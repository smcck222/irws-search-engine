FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals downturn to Pounds
5.16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCELY competitive pricing and the weakness of the US dollar was
responsible for Yorkshire Chemicals reporting a 3 per cent fall in interim
pre-tax profits.
In the six months to June 30 the dyes and specialist materials group saw
pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 5.33m to Pounds 5.16m on increased sales of
Pounds 48.4m (Pounds 44.8m).
Mr Phillip Lowe, chairman, said: 'As worldwide economic conditions
deteriorated we had to cut prices which affected profitability.'
The weakness of the US dollar in the period also affected profits because
the bulk of output is manufactured in the UK and sold in dollars.
The two divisions worst hit by the recession were Yorkshire Colours, which
reported a fall in operating profits from Pounds 4.09m to Pounds 3.57m, and
Yorkshire Americas, which saw profits fall from Pounds 488,000 to Pounds
345,000. Yorkshire Speciality Products and Yorkshire Australia both achieved
advances.
Capital investment in plant and buildings totalled Pounds 5.1m against
Pounds 2.6m previously. The interest charge rose to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds
490,000) as gearing increased from 13.9 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
The interim dividend has been increased to 2.5p (2.375p). Earnings were up
at 9.41p (9.35p).
The shares fell 28p to close at 290p.

FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cupid's cash call flops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 80 per cent of the shares in Cupid's 1-for-2 rights issue were
left at the altar for the sub-underwriters to pick up.
The USM-quoted bridal wear company, which includes the Pronuptia retail
business, announced yesterday that 18.1 per cent of the 82p-a-share issue
had been taken up.
Mr Mike Murray, chief executive, said the result was disappointing, but it
came against the background of a falling market between the June launch and
the closing date.
Cupid's share price closed down 2p at 79p yesterday. On the day the Pounds
2.68m issue was announced it shed 5p to finish at 90p.
Mr Murray said the money was raised to finance retrospectively last winter's
purchase of the Youngs formal wear business from the receiver. That had
pushed up borrowings to Pounds 4.2m - gearing of 93 per cent.
The issue proceeds would wipe out debt during the current favourable period
for cash. Gearing would rise to about 24 per cent by the seasonal low in
December. That would leave the group scope to expand its nursery accessories
business into the 'hardware' side of cots and prams.
The issue was underwritten by BZW and sub-underwriters included Clerical
Medical &amp; General and South Yorkshire Pension Fund.
Last year Cupid made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 982,000 on turnover of
Pounds 14.7m.

FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 18% growth for Admiral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMIRAL, a Camberley-based computing services company, made sound progress
in the first half of 1992 despite tough trading conditions.
Pre-tax profits were 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.96m while turnover
advanced 17 per cent to Pounds 13.66m.
Earnings per share rose to 11.6p (10.3p) and the interim dividend has been
set at 1.7p, a 13 per cent advance on last year's 1.5p.
The results included a contribution from Computer Business Consultants,
which Admiral acquired recently, but Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, said the
results represented essentially organic growth.
He said that Admiral had continued to prosper while many other computing
services companies were showing reduced revenues and profits because of
strong project and business management.
The company specialises in the defence, government and financial services
sectors but its commercial and industrial divisions were developing well, Mr
Brendish said.

FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon acts to restore credibility -
Shareholders approve planned disposal aimed at reducing debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER NEARLY six months of turmoil Harland Simon, the control systems
company, yesterday appeared to have won a breathing space in which to try
and restore its credibility with shareholders and customers.
The company, which has seen its market value collapse following unexpected
losses and a qualified set of accounts, gained approval from shareholders to
sell Vickereys, its specialist blade and equipment maker, for Pounds 8.1m to
Thermo Fibertek of the US.
The sale, which still requires Office of Fair Trading approval, is the first
of several planned disposals. It will reduce Harland's net borrowings of
about Pounds 12.3m and restore shareholders' funds which, following losses
and provisions last year, fell from a restated Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 8.1m.
The disposal, and the re-appointment of directors and auditors, were passed
at Harland's annual and extraordinary meetings yesterday. Unusually, the
meetings were closed to the press - a decision described by one of the
company's advisers as 'rather silly'.
According to institutional shareholders present, the meetings were free from
acrimony. The only questions asked concerned the large number of Harland
board directors, and why Mr George Neophitou, newly-appointed finance
director, owned no shares in the company. However, shareholders remain
extremely concerned despite a series of briefings by the company over the
past few weeks.
'No-one is going to risk knocking the company at this stage. But if it
doesn't do what we expect it to in the next few months, we are in trouble,'
one major shareholder said.
High on the list of priorities are further management changes. Mr Roy
Ashman, former chairman and the driving force behind the company, was
replaced in February by Mr David Mahony, a former chairman and an industrial
adviser to Hambro's, the company's financial adviser.
But Harland's attempts to recruit new non-executive directors, and a new
executive chairman, have so far been frustrated by controversy over its
relationship with Perfect Information Ltd (PIL), a loss-making information
service.
One possible candidate is understood to have become hesitant following
adverse comment about PIL, and the failure of Harland's auditors to confirm
the ownership of a stake in the company held through a Liechtenstein trust.
The auditors, Price Waterhouse, therefore qualified Harland's accounts
because they could not conclude whether PIL was an associate.
Harland has now bought the outstanding stake, taking its holding to 63 per
cent. Mr Ashman has retained 27 per cent and is refusing to sell.
Institutional shareholders say a bigger worry is that PIL remains
loss-making and finding a buyer will be difficult. One analyst estimated
closing down PIL, the other possible option, could lead to further
write-downs and restructuring costs of more than Pounds 3m.
Harland said yesterday that negotiations had advanced for the sale of
Contraves, the electronic control company bought last year. An overseas
buyer had begun due diligence on the acquisition, the company said.
Harland's shares remained unchanged at 17p, giving a market capitalisation
of just under Pounds 3m. Before a profits warning in February, the first
indication that the company had problems, the shares touched 653p, giving a
market value of Pounds 115m.
Mr Mahony repeated an earlier warning that the company may not return to
profit this year. But Harland again insisted that its underlying business
had not been affected by the collapse in its share price and shareholder
criticism.
One institutional shareholder warned that speculation about the effects of
Harland's troubles on its business could be self-fulfilling if customers
started delaying major orders.
Harland rarely comments on orders before they are won. So far this year the
only significant contract announced was a medium-sized order from Royal Mail
Parcel Force.

FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Norton seeks share relisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTON Group, the engineering concern that includes the famous motorcycle
marque, is meeting its bank plus brokers and institutions today to discuss
the rescheduling of debt and relisting of shares.
The shares were suspended in March last year at 18p after a delay in
publishing results and the launching of a Department of Trade and Industry
investigation.
Mr Norman Wilson, one of the directors appointed since the suspension, said
annual trading losses in Norton Motors, which makes rotary engines and
motorcycles, had been reduced from about Pounds 2m to Pounds 47,000. Pro-Fit
Piping Components, a US subsidiary, had made a trading profit.
The relisting was linked with efforts to reschedule the group's borrowings,
which amounted to some Pounds 6m. Midland Bank is the main lender.
Norton's troubles came to a head with a poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights
issue to fund the purchase of FUS Beteiligungs und Verwaltungs, a German
fasteners maker. This proved controversial because the vendor was a Channel
Islands trust company set up to benefit the children of the then chairman,
Mr James Tildesley. He resigned in April last year.
Mr Wilson said FUS - 'an albatross around Norton's neck' - had been sold for
a nominal amount to get rid of the accompanying liabilities.
The DTI said yesterday that its investigation was well advanced.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Surely that is enough calls for decisive action to boost the UK housing
market. A whopping cut in UK interest rates or massive government spending
apart - two options which are clearly not on the agenda for the foreseeable
future - it is hard to see what can be done at a stroke to underpin house
prices and restore buyer confidence. Tired sounding, if headline-catching,
schemes from the Great and the Good not only look narrowly self-serving. As
yesterday's further round of jitters in the building materials sector
illustrates, the rhetoric which accompanies them merely spreads further
despondency.

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Kalon/Manders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The issues in a bid are seldom black and white, not even when the offer is
from a white paint manufacturer in Yorkshire (emblem: white rose) for an
English black country rival making ink. Yesterday's undeniably impressive 55
per cent advance in interim profits from Kalon does little harm to its cause
 -but there seems no escaping the conclusion that come the weekend or sooner
the aggressor will have to sweeten its currently all-paper terms.
Kalon's management ability and recent share price and earnings records all
look superior to those of Manders. But there is a legitimate question mark
over how long Kalon will be able to sustain its juicy paint margins. The
widening which took place in the first six months of this year is largely
attributed to higher volumes in the own-label market and economies of scale.
But, with the likes of B &amp; Q and Texas engaged in a fierce price war, how
long will it be before they expect their suppliers to suffer more of the
pain? Kalon badly needs to swallow its prey to keep its profits momentum
going, which is why Manders shareholders should hold out for a more
attractive deal. In these markets, though, a token cash element might not be
enough.

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 109 per cent rise in National Westminster's first-half profits from last
year's particularly depressed interim result is as much as the market could
have expected. Bad debt provisions have fallen sharply in both the US and
Australia. Costs are under control. Commission income is up, although not
against last year's second half. Net interest income has registered only a
modest fall, thanks partly to the bank's involvement in fixed rate lending.
Although UK bad debt provisions have fallen only slightly since the second
half of last year, a high charge was always likely, given National
Westminster's high share of small business lending.
None of this means a strong recovery is secure. Operating income is likely
to rise only modestly in spite of an increasing contribution from life
insurance. Nor can one expect anything other than a modest fall in UK bad
debts. It is thus hard to see why the shares have any special attraction.
NatWest has outperformed Barclays by nearly 40 per cent since the start of
the year. But since the latter has fallen harder it may now have further to
recover. On the other hand NatWest cannot boast the same defensive qualities
as Lloyds.

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: TI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10 per cent fall in TI's shares in response to yesterday's interim
figures poses the question of whether it can reap the full benefit of Dowty
without economic recovery. Some downward revision of Dowty's unaudited
full-year figures was expected. It was clearly in the interests of the
defending management to book profits as early as possible. Equally it is now
in the interests of TI to leave room for earnings growth. The slightly
disturbing factor is that it is not itself expecting such a recovery.
TI forecasts that the second-half contribution from Dowty will be no higher
than the Pounds 13m turned in in the same period last year. The market had
assumed the positive earnings trend reported by Dowty would be maintained
under new ownership. Perhaps it was being naive, but the episode underlines
how difficult it can be to value hostile bids in an uncertain trading
environment.
TI itself is open to criticism for not revealing the full details of its
post-acquisition valuation of Dowty this time around, although it promises a
thorough clean-out in the autumn. However, the market cannot have it both
ways; two years ago TI was vilified for taking a second chunk of goodwill
write-offs against Bundy, having hurried through the initial provisions.
Against this background, the performance of the shares yesterday looks like
a more basic rethink of TI's ability to ride out the recession. Excluding
Dowty, the interim figures were at the lower end of expectations. On a
prospective multiple of roughly 15 times, which the market generally
accepted, the shares stood until yesterday at an expensive 11 per cent
premium to the engineering sector and a 42 per cent premium to aerospace.

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: A Royal misfortune
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to resist a gasp of apprehension at the sheer size of the
Pounds 418m claim against Royal Bank of Scotland from the liquidators of
Wallace Smith Trust. The sum is not only broadly equivalent to a whole
year's profit before provisions. It also amounts to a quarter of the bank's
shareholders' funds.
Uncertainty about the suit will dog the bank for a long time. One can only
guess at the outcome, but the chances are that Royal will not in the end
have to write off the full amount. A further consolation is that the bank is
well endowed with tier 1 capital under Bank for International Settlements
rules. Its BIS ratio at the end of the last business year was nearly 7 per
cent and it is currently adding new tier 1 capital through its Dollars 200m
issue of non-cumulative preference shares in the US.
A more serious worry in the short run is the warning in the US issue
documentation that provisions will exceed last year's Pounds 351m, a figure
which was already 80 per cent up on the previous year. It looks as though
the bank has been less than usually canny in its forays into English
lending. Its admission is especially disconcerting after its encouraging
noises at the interim stage. That alone would be enough to justify a large
part of yesterday's 12 per cent fall in the shares.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Complaints about BR rise to record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS ABOUT British Rail reached record levels in the year to March,
the rail passengers' statutory watchdog reported yesterday.
But the Central Transport Consultative Committee blamed the government more
than BR, saying it had failed to allocate enough resources to the railways.
Major-General Lennox Napier, the committee's chairman, said: 'I give British
Rail credit for doing its best with outdated equipment and rolling stock
and, in my view, inadequate levels of long-term investment.'
The committee's report acknowledged that big increases in funding had been
authorised by the government , but had left BR Pounds 3.1bn short of the
Pounds 7.4bn it needed over the next three years.
Badly needed projects such as rolling stock replacement for Network
SouthEast commuter services and the upgrading of the west coast main line
had therefore been put on indefinite hold.
The committee said other ways of financing investment had to be explored,
such as leasing deals and allowing BR to tap the international money
markets.
Complaints rose from 8,053 to 8,371 in 1991-92, an increase of 3.9 per cent.
This was more than twice the number in 1985-86 and over four times that in
1980-81.
Top five categories of complaint were punctuality, suitability of services
to passenger requirements, the amount of information at stations, fares, and
refunds and claims.
Maj-Gen Napier said he gave two cheers for the Passenger's Charter but it
should have set tougher targets and allowed more scope for compensation
claims.
He said he was not against privatisation but there was a risk that the
government could use it as an excuse to cut investment.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Cure for a malaise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From K D REED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, None of Barry Riley's listed drugs (The Long View, August 1) has
produced a cure for the current national malaise of Meddlomania. This
wasting disease is easily diagnosed from cries in the media of 'Do
something, no matter what' at times of economic stress emitted by opposition
and panicking politicians and failing businessmen.
The old fashioned remedy of hard work and cold showers is seldom tried for
long enough, but when used with conviction it can produce strengthening of
the system and an improvement in efficiency that provides the necessary
competitiveness. Unfortunately, fashionable Freudian tendencies always to
blame a third party have caused this simple remedy to be omitted from later
editions of the British Economicapae.

<TEXT>
Sir, Having spent more than 11 years at MBB making satellites, among others
Intelsat VI, I feel your article 'Europe's satellite makers are knocked out
of orbit' (July 31) leaves a great deal to be desired. MBB has made the
solar panels for almost all of the Intelsat satellites made by Hughes &amp;
Ford. British Aerospace has also been a very large contributor, because the
UK was number two financial contributor to Intelsat, after the US.
The simple truth is that the satellite market is reaching saturation and the
US, funded by the American debt, has built a gigantic satellite capability
which is desperately seeking new markets. I suggest that the US
manufacturers will be steeped in red in the not too distant future.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Major energy users say that they are paying too much for their
electricity and this means that they cannot compete with their rivals in the
EC ('Large users step up demand for lower electricity prices', July 29).
These industrialists do not say that before electricity privatisation in
1990 their electricity was subsidised by the state, and that they enjoyed
further subsidies until March 1991. Neither do they admit that what industry
calls 'high prices' are only a fraction of what domestic consumers pay.
One solution is that they should make their own electricity. Many of our
members would be pleased to build them energy-efficient power stations. They
could then be quite certain that they were paying the right price for their
power.
They might prefer an electricity subsidy, but wouldn't it be much better if
the new EC president could persuade our competitors to get rid of theirs?

Stock markets have no sense of romance. Word late on Monday that Swiss
chocolate king Rudolph Sprungli had remarried at 72 sent shares of the
family-controlled firm, Lindt &amp; Sprungli, plunging yesterday.
Sprungli had not been above panicking himself when various accusations had
surfaced about the business ambitions of his bride-to-be 44-year-old
Alexandra Gantenbein, who belongs to an obscure American religious sect
called 'I am'. The marriage was off, Sprungli called in accountants KPMG
Fides to conduct an investigation, the marriage was back on, and the couple
were secretly wed last Friday.
Sadly, the market remains unconvinced that all is now sweetness and light.
By the end of yesterday, the bearer shares of Lindt &amp; Sprungli stood at SwFr
11,000 on the Zurich exchange, down 9.1 per cent on Monday's close, and at
their low for the year.

Among the many suggestions for the future use of London's redundant County
Hall, its advantages as a police dog training centre have not received much
attention.
However, Observer can disclose that many of London's 389 police dogs have
honed their skills sniffing the secrets of the old GLC power house.
The London Residuary Body - charged with selling the site - says that there
have been police dog classes in former GLC buildings for a long time.
However, since County Hall is now the only empty GLC building, it follows
that most police dog classes are held there.
Interesting to see whether the London School of Economics will permit the
classes to continue if it buys County Hall. No doubt it could charge extra
if it provided the dogs with a few stroppy students to practice on.

The arrival of Robin Woodhead as the new boss of commodity futures market
London FOX removes one possible contender for the really big exchange

Jenkins retires.
Liffe had hoped to name its candidate by now - but apparently the favourite,
who comes from outside the derivatives industry, has suddenly become
indispensable to his present employer.
At least this shows that Liffe is definitely seeking fresh blood, rather
than settling for an insider - of whom there are two reasonably competent
candidates. Another name mentioned - regulator Phillip Thorpe, who has been
the caretaker at FOX - seems never to have been seriously in the running.
It sounds as if Liffe has gone back to the drawing board, and Jenkins, who
has promised he will continue until the right person is found, is in there
for a while yet.

persuade people of the dangers of the HIV virus and Aids and the virtues of
using condoms is one of the key factors behind the doubling of condom sales
since 1987, according to research carried out by Mintel International.
This year some 155m condoms, with a retail value of Pounds 43m, are likely
to be sold in the UK, with the market set to grow substantially in the next
few years.
Mintel suggests that the 'embarrassment factor' is also fast disappearing;
evidence is that mail order sales have declined from 3 to 2 per cent of
total sales.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In all the comings and goings at NatWest it is easy to forget that dear old
Tom Frost, who was replaced as NatWest's chief executive by young Derek
Wanless only four months ago, still works there.
While all the Blue Arrow prosecutions have been halted, Frost, who has never
been charged with any offence, is still centrally involved in the DTI's
ongoing investigation into the affairs of the National Westminster Bank.
Both Frost and NatWest vehemently deny any suggestion of a cover-up, but
Frost still decided to withdraw to the sidelines as a deputy chairman to
give himself time to present his case.
Since he is only a year away from retirement, the outcome has no bearing on
his future career. But his decision to relinquish the reins will look more
like noble self-sacrifice if his bank is exonerated.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: Clearing out the bankers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What a shambles. The revolving door at the top of NatWest continues to spin
faster than most in London's accident-prone securities industry. Yesterday,
Sir Geoffrey Littler and John Drury, who little more than a year ago were
appointed chairman and chief executive of NatWest Investment Bank, the
parent of County NatWest, headed for the exit.
Their departure may have been inevitable following the reorganisation
earlier this year which saw first Derek Wanless, and then Martin Owen,
clearing bankers through and through, put in charge of a new corporate
octopus called NatWest Markets. Even so it means that this side of the
business must have had half a dozen chiefs in as many years.
Whereas there were supposed to be three senior managing directors under
NatWest Markets new chief executive Martin Owen, Drury's departure means
that there is now only one, Roger Byatt, another career clearing banker. The
lower orders seem equally confused. Presumably, the gaps will soon be
plugged but given the recent record it would be surprising if it did not
result in a fresh twirl of the door from the executive dining rooms.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Foreign Affairs: How to contain conflict - Peacekeeping is
much more than a matter of manning a line between two opposing armies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week I tried to suggest ways of preventing conflicts of the Croat and
Bosnian type elsewhere in Europe, especially by giving early attention to
the problems of national minorities. The premise was that conflict
prevention failed in those two countries. It has also failed in
Nagorno-Karabakh, appears to be failing in Moldova, and will almost
inevitably fail in other places soon.
This week I shall concentrate on ways of containing and ending conflicts. At
a conference last week on 'conflict in the states of central Europe and the
former USSR', sponsored by the Austrian government and the International
Peace Academy, an Austrian diplomat helped me by dividing the necessary
measures into four time - scales:
immediate humanitarian ones to help the victims;
short-term ones to contain the conflict and bring about an effective
ceasefire;
medium-term ones to consolidate the ceasefire, creating the minimum of
confidence and communication needed for a political settlement; and
long-term 'peace-building'.
Even in the first stage, military forces may be involved, whether to secure
'safe zones' or havens for refugees, or to protect airports and convoys so
that supplies can reach civilians. But the crucial need, illustrated by the
confusion which prevailed in Turkey and Iran in the early stages of last
year's Kurdish crisis, is for one international agency to be given the
leading role, with responsibility for co-ordinating everyone else's
contributions; and for that agency to work openly rather than secretively,
so that everyone else knows what is happening. In Yugoslavia this role is
being played, effectively, by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
As far as possible local resources should be used. Recently, public works
ministers from all the ex-Yugoslav republics attended a meeting in Vienna,
and said they had human resources at their disposal but not financial ones.
They claimed that, given even one per cent of the cost of the UN protection
force (Unprofor), they could set up more effective aid programmes of their
own.
The caveat here, of course, is that local humanitarian organisations,
however sincere, are seldom completely separate from the parties to a
conflict and often closely identified with them. International monitoring is
needed to ensure supplies are fairly distributed and not manipulated for
political ends.
That can best be done by a UN liaison office on the spot, something even
more necessary for the second task, of containing hostilities and working
for their suspension. This task has to be carried on simultaneously with the
first, even though it may take longer to have any tangible effect.
The biggest difficulty, amply illustrated in Yugoslavia, is that one may
have to 'take sides' by identifying the party most responsible for
prolonging the fighting or violating ceasefires, and to bring pressure on it
to stop; whereas peacekeepers on the spot - engaged in fact-finding
missions, negotiating ceasefire terms, or monitoring compliance - can only
operate effectively if accepted by all sides as impartial. There needs to be
a clear distinction between peacekeepers and those involved in any kind of
punitive action, even if at the top level both should be co-ordinated by
some kind of 'conflict management unit'.
One aspect of conflict management often neglected is information and public
opinion, both in the conflict zone itself and in third countries trying to
help resolve it.
Fear and hatred between communities are constantly nourished by one-sided
atrocity stories; often totally contradictory statements of fact are
published and believed on opposite sides. Sometimes the media of third
countries in turn fall victim to such one-sided accounts. The Austrian and
German media have portrayed the Yugoslav conflict in much starker black and
white than those of most other countries. Without resorting to control of
the media, governments and international organisations seeking to contain
the conflict should make efforts to publicise a balanced account of the
facts.
Accurate and credible information is also central to the next task, that of
peacekeeping proper, which comes after a ceasefire is in force. The essence
of peacekeeping is confidence building: to enable each side to desist from
hostilities without fearing that it will thereby expose itself to hostile
action by the other. The more confidence peacekeeping forces can create, the
more durable the ceasefire is likely to be.
But in an increasing number of cases - Yugoslavia is certainly one - this is
not simply a matter of manning a line between two opposing armies.
Unprofor's mandate in Croatia requires it to ensure that the 'protected
areas' are demilitarised, 'through the withdrawal or disbandment of all
armed forces in them', to 'monitor the functioning of the local police there
to help ensure non-discrimination and the protection of human rights', and
to 'facilitate the return, in conditions of safety and security, of civilian
displaced persons to their homes'.
This means that successful peacekeeping has to include tight control of all
weapons coming into the area, and of existing arms depots within it (likely
to be an acute concern for peacekeepers operating in ex-Soviet territory);
disbandment of irregular forces, or at least their incorporation into
recognised armies with a clear chain of command; and collection or
decommissioning of unauthorised weapons, especially those of a
'destabilising' nature, such as hand-held surface-to-air missiles.
Peacekeeping forces will often have to exercise police powers, to search for
weapons, arrest malefactors, and prevent the intimidation of civilians.
All this requires significant resources - and they have to be available at
short notice. In the Yugoslav case the UN Security Council was lamentably
slow in making up its mind to put in a peacekeeping force, and when it did
so it authorised a force so small that it could only have carried out its
mandate on 'best case' assumptions. Needless to say these were not
fulfilled, and the secretary-general was soon back asking for more.
But peacekeeping will not in the long run be considered successful if the
peacekeepers become a permanent feature of the landscape, which cannot be
removed for fear of precipitating a resumption of the conflict - as has
happened in Cyprus and south Lebanon. So it has to be accompanied by
peacemaking and 'peace-building', defined respectively by the UN
secretary-general as 'action to bring hostile parties to agreement' and
'action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and
solidify peace'.
These long-term efforts take us back into the realm of conflict prevention,
since their object is to prevent backsliding into violence once it has
stopped. But they have to confront the additional thorny question of how far
peace requires the reversal of changes (especially population movements)
brought about by violence, and how far, on the contrary, it requires their
acceptance.
In principle, everyone supports the former proposition: it is unthinkable to
'reward the aggressor'. In practice, as Greek Cypriots and Palestinians have
both been obliged to recognise, negotiated settlements generally involve the
weaker party accepting a fait accompli, in part if not in whole.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Morgan (Letters, July 31) unintentionally nails the dilemma for
investors who wish to act responsibly.
Clearly, a unitary board is essential for corporate efficiency, and thereby
shareholder value.
But if investors have no say at all in the running of a company, their only
option on detecting problems is to sell out. Instead of nipping them early,
mistakes grow long hair until chronic decline sets in, or a crisis means
expensive action by lawyers and accountants - paid for by shareholders, of
course. Investors are capable of exercising vigilance - especially when
their own money is at stake. But it is no use if, as often at company annual
meetings, boards can simply ignore their views ad lib.
There were sceptics on Maxwell and Polly Peck, but what teeth did they have
to stop the rot before it was too late?

FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: The struggle to alleviate plight of the Somalis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Baroness CHALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sadly there is very little with which I could disagree in Julian
Ozanne's description ('Desperate famine stalks the forgotten Somalis', July
28) of the desperate and harrowing conditions in Somalia.
Numerous similar reports can leave us in no doubt that a human tragedy is
unfolding on a scale never before seen in that country.
I must make it clear, however, that Britain has not forgotten Somalia. The
government is deeply concerned about what is happening there. For months, we
have been in the forefront of efforts to alleviate the suffering. None of
this has received very much attention in the media.
We have been among the first to respond to needs as new possibilities for
delivery have opened up. In January, I announced a gift of 14,000 tonnes of
food aid via the Red Cross; in May, we provided a further 5,000 tonnes of
food through the UN World Food Programme; earlier this month, I allocated
Pounds 2.5m to the Red Cross for its country-wide relief activities.
We have given all possible support to British aid agencies which continue
their heroic work inside Somalia, in spite of the enormous difficulties and
danger. In June, I responded immediately to the UN's appeal on behalf of
refugees, predominantly Somalis, in Kenya, with a grant of Pounds 1m. We
gave a further Pounds 50,000 for the Somali boat refugees arriving in the
Yemen within days of their plight becoming known.
Since the present crisis began in early 1991, we have provided almost Pounds
15m for Somalis in need. I expect to provide more in the months ahead. Our
record is a far cry from the near-indifference of which you accuse the west
in your leading article, 'Time to interfere' (July 29).
The tragedy we are witnessing in Somalia is highly complex and there are no
easy solutions. Until peace and stability return, helping the hungry and
dying will be enormously difficult.
Somalia remains for us an acute priority in a highly troubled region, the
Horn of Africa, which continues to absorb the lion's share of the
humanitarian aid resources available to us; some Pounds 155m since the
present crisis began in late 1990.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Moral philosophy that should not be forgotten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AUBREY JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are quite right to remind us that Adam Smith was a moral
philosopher as well as an economist ('Ethics and worse', July 31). Indeed,
his economics was secondary to his moral philosophy.
This is clearly seen in this quotation from the Wealth of Nations: 'Every
man, so long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly
free to pursue his own interest in his own way' (italics mine).
Similarly the expression 'laissez-faire', as used by the French physiocrats,
was subordinate to the idea of a divine plan which could be discovered by
human reason; 'laissez-faire' meant that, when this moral order had been
found, no hindrance should be placed in its way.
What seems to have happened is that, in the long transition from medieval
Christendom to modern secularism, the origins of many of the ideas that
marked that transition have become forgotten.
Dixons, in donating to the London Business School a chair in business
ethics, deserve our thanks for reminding us whence we have come.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Letter: Attitude to Cadbury clarified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E M SANDLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Cadbury proposals prove unpalatable' (August 3) contains a
reference to the Institutional Shareholders' Committee's position which
might give a misleading impression of the warmth with which the ISC welcomes
the draft Cadbury report.
At its June 17 meeting the ISC council agreed that a press release showing
the ISC's general support for the work of the Cadbury Committee should be
issued. However, it is important to understand that the ISC is an umbrella
body whose members are the associations representing the different groupings
of UK institutional investors - the insurance companies, the pension funds,
the unit trusts, the investment trusts and the asset management arms of the
merchant banks. Each ISC member felt this important subject deserved
detailed debate within its own membership, and separate responses have been
prepared and delivered to the Cadbury Committee.
In the circumstances the ISC's press release could not have been couched in
other than general terms. Its apparent failure in the eyes of your
commentator to provide a 'ringing endorsement' should not be taken to
indicate that the ISC is less than warm in its support.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Peace-making at the UN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING has gone badly wrong at the United Nations. Just when it ought to
be more capable of concerted action to make and keep the peace than ever
before, the organisation presents a sorry spectacle: wracked by petty
squabbling, starved of funds, and confused about priorities.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, accuses western members of
the security council of hypocrisy, parsimony and worse; western governments
respond with leaks aimed at undermining him. The row could seriously
debilitate the body that was supposed to have found new vigour and unity
after the Cold War.
Mr Boutros Ghali's frustration - however undiplomatically expressed - is
understandable. He is being criticised by Security Council members for
poorly handling a predicament that is not his creation but theirs. It is,
after all, largely at the behest of western governments that the UN is being
asked to confront an expanding range of tasks; the same western governments
are simultaneously refusing to give the organisation the requisite resources
or political backing. Instead of trying to shoot the messenger, they should
remind themselves of the solemn commitments they made only six months ago at
UN headquarters.
At the suggestion of Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, 15 world leaders
gathered for the first Security Council summit. They renewed their pledge to
respect and implement the principles of the UN Charter. And they asked Mr
Boutros Ghali to report on how the organisation's role in preventing and
ending conflicts could be enhanced.
The result, produced in June, was 'an agenda for peace' - an ambitious
document calling for an intensification of preventive diplomacy; the
deployment of peace-keeping forces to pre-empt potential inter- or
intra-state conflicts; the use of so-called 'peace-enforcement units' when
conflicts occur; and the creation of a rapid reaction force of troops from
member states on which the secretary-general could call at short notice.
Cease operations
The world's latest convulsions have underlined the need for ambition on this
scale. But the UN is sorely over-stretched already, with member states owing
it Dollars 1.75bn in overdue contributions for peace-keeping and other
activities; it says it will have to cease operations at the end of the year
if it does not receive a speedy injection of cash. The lion's share of the
arrears is the responsibility of one country: the US.
In a sense, the current conflict is a natural outgrowth of this mismatch
between ambitions and means. But it also exposes the contradictions between
the grandiose rhetoric of the UN Charter and the inevitable national
instincts of its signatories. The secretary-general is trying to turn the UN
into a real force for peace-keeping and peace-making with a coherent,
internationalist agenda; as Mr Boutros Ghali sees it, the leading paymasters
are continuing to pursue their own interests and leaving the UN to sweep up
the mess.
Humanitarian tragedy
The flashpoint has been the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. When the
European Community negotiated what it thought was a ceasefire and then asked
the UN to monitor its implementation, Mr Boutros Ghali's patience broke.
Regional organisations, he expostulated, should be at the service of the UN,
not the other way round. And in any case, why was the world worrying so much
about Yugoslavia while ignoring the arguably much worse humanitarian tragedy
in Somalia?
In principle, Mr Boutros Ghali is right to press this point. The UN will be
irrevocably damaged if it comes to be seen as preoccupied only with the
concerns of the rich countries.
At the same time, the secretary-general would stand a better chance of
success in his campaign if he adopted a subtler approach. The UN is seldom
short of rhetoric and not often over-blessed with forceful diplomatic skills
based upon a realistic assessment of what is possible. In the longer term,
changes in the composition of the Security Council might make the task of
balancing disparate demands on the UN easier. But no secretary-general will
escape the need for a close and effective working relationship with the UN's
paymasters.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Leading Article: A surfeit of quick fixes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE British economy in an increasingly desperate state, the government
finds itself besieged by interest groups with handy nostrums to help promote
economic recovery. Foremost among the would-be helpers are the banks and
building societies, which want to see tax reliefs to alleviate the problems
of homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their houses. The
temptation to deploy taxpayers' money in this particular direction should
nonetheless be firmly resisted. There are better ways of dealing with
problem at hand.
At first sight the case advanced by the banks and building societies is not
wholly implausible. Consumer confidence has proved more fragile than
expected since the election, which in part reflects the continuing decline
in house prices and the low volume of housing transactions. There has been a
powerful negative wealth effect since the market peaked in 1988; and the
resulting dampener on market expectations has been reinforced by the
phenomenon of negative equity, whereby homeowners cannot sell their houses
without having to make a repayment to the building societies. The natural
way out of this debt trap is to spend less and save more. Yet the last thing
the economy needs, now that the household savings ratio is a nearly three
times its level when the economy was overheating, is an outbreak of
Victorian values.
Lower rates
The obvious response to the debt overhang in housing is a sharp reduction in
short-term interest rates. Yet the government's monetary policy is in the
hands of the Germans, who can safely be relied on to deliver too little, too
late, to satisfy Britain's domestic requirements. In the meantime membership
of the exchange rate mechanism has contributed to a continuing decline in
the inflation rate. But this merely makes the problem worse, because with
nominal interest rates stable and inflation going down, real rates of
interest are rising. Over the past two years the real rate on mortgage debt,
after allowing for movements in house prices, has been running at a punitive
15-20 per cent.
So far, the government's response to this situation has been to hold the
line, hoping that eventually something will turn up to spur economic growth.
An event which might change everything is a 'no' vote in September's French
referendum on Maastricht. That would be a potentially lethal blow to
monetary union (among other things); and should the government feel by then
that the pursuit of disinflationary gains is outweighed by other factors, it
might conceivably be ready to contemplate a different approach.
Housing subsidies
Should the French decline to use the referendum to pass a vote of no
confidence in Mr Mitterrand, new housing subsidies might appear more
tempting to hard-pressed ministers searching desperately for 'green shoots'.
Yet it is hard to see that tax subsidies for loss-making homeowners would do
the trick. For a start, tax relief for losses on the sale of the home would
not become available in time to help repay the building society in full.
Assuming that some further nostrum could be cooked up to bridge this
financing gap, there is a risk that the resulting wave of sales might
actually cause house prices to fall further - scarcely the way to mitigate
the pain in the period before German interest rates finally come down.
The only plausible case for expensive subsidies to loss-making homeowners
would arise if the banking system were on the brink of a financial crisis.
Yet the banks and building societies are not, as yet, seriously threatened,
largely because so much of the losses in housing have been borne by the
insurance sector. If the government is to increase its already huge
subsidies to housing, it would do better to acknowledge that the economy is
suffering from an excessive level of homeownership and accelerate the
revival of the private rented sector. It should eliminate the tax
discrimination against private landlords, for example by exempting them from
capital gains tax, while directing more money towards badly needed social
housing. Creating yet more subsidies for homeowners is an idea whose time
should not be allowed to come.

<TEXT>
In re a company No. 0013734 of 1991
(FT, June 3)
THE REINSURED was in liquidation, having been ordered to be wound up by the
Supreme Court of Bermuda, which also approved the manner whereby the
valuation of the insurance claims against it had been carried out. The
claims had not been settled but were calculated following an actuarial
valuation of the underlying contingent claims against the reinsured.
In the present proceedings, the reinsured claimed Dollars 122,244 against
the reinsurer company which argued that no liability to pay had arisen and
that the petition against it should be struck out because the debt on which
it was based was disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds.
Were it a simple matter of construction and the only issue was whether
settled (albeit not actually paid) claims fell within the terms of the
reinsurance contracts, the present court would have refused to strike out
the petition. However, in granting the petition, Mr Roger Kaye QC (sitting
as a deputy judge of the division) stated that it was not the only issue in
the case.
There were other factors which might have a bearing on the construction of
the reinsurance contracts. Those factors raised serious and complex issues
which were not appropriate to resolve on an interlocutory motion or on the
hearing of a winding-up petition.
The Mercers Co v New Hampshire Insurance Co
(FT, June 4)
MERCERS CLAIMED against New Hampshire for monies allegedly due under an
advance payment bond of Pounds 4.5m to Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd in respect of a
building contract. Rush &amp; Tompkins had commenced the works although Mercers
had given possession of the site four weeks late. Thereafter Rush and
Tompkins had gone into receivership and the contract automatically
terminated.
At first instance, Mr Justice Phillips held that New Hampshire was under no
liability under the bond; dismissed Mercers' claim; and ordered repayment of
New Hampshire's interim payment of Pounds 1m. Mercers contended that the
bond was simply a promise to pay a specific sum on a contingency which had
happened and that the document could not be construed as a performance
guarantee.
Accepting that argument, the Court of Appeal stated that the plain purpose
of the document was to ensure that if Rush &amp; Tompkins did not earn the
amount of the advance payment, both Rush &amp; Tompkins and New Hampshire should
be jointly and severally liable to Mercers for the balance. Moreover,
postponement of the date on which possession of the site had been given by
Mercers did not affect New Hampshire's liability.
Regina v Kansal
(FT, June 5)
THE COURT of Appeal, in dismissing Mr Kansal's appeal against convictions
under the Theft Act 1968 and the Insolvency Act 1986, stated that privilege
from self-incrimination was abrogated in bankruptcy proceedings by Rule
6.175 of the Insolvency Rules. That rule provided that '(1) The bankrupt
shall . . . answer all such questions as the court may put . . . (5) The
written record may in any proceedings (whether under the Act or otherwise)
be used as evidence against the bankrupt . . .'.
Mr Kansal made a statement under the Insolvency Rules which was ruled
admissible in his Crown court trial on the theft charges. Under the Theft
Act, section 31, a person was not excused on the ground of
self-incrimination from answering questions in proceedings for the recovery
of property but that no statement made was then admissible evidence against
him. Section 433 of the Insolvency Act, on the other hand, made evidence
given under the Insolvency Rules admissible in any proceedings.
The appeal court accepted the contention of the Crown that section 433 was
concerned with admissibility of a special class of document derived from an
insolvency in 'any proceedings' - whether or not under the Insolvency or the
Theft acts. Its terms were clear, unambiguous and unequivocal, and were not
subject to any exceptions, so that section 31 of the Theft Act was not
capable of protecting the defendant in such a case.
TOSG Trust Fund Ltd v Girozentrale und Bank der Oesterreichischen Sparkassen
Aktiengesellschaft and others
(FT, June 10)
THE PLAINTIFF sought a declaration that it was not liable to repay to the
defendant banks a bonded sum which had been applied by TOSG in accordance
with its powers.
TOSG was a company set up by the Tour Operators Study Group (an association
of UK travel and tour operators), the primary purpose of which was to
administer bonding arrangements made for the protection of customers in the
event of failure. A bond for Pounds 63.2m had been issued by the banks in
favour of TOSG, the subject matter of which was the potential failure of ILG
Travel Ltd, a TOSG member.
The bonded sum, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated, was not a fund in which the
banks had reserved any proprietary right or which was impressed with any
trust. On the facts before the court, TOSG was in a position to show that,
subject to a small margin, the sum it spent on intra vires functions would
fully absorb the sum paid by the banks together with accrued interest.
Although TOSG had also spent money ultra vires there was no automatic
liability accrued to make an equivalent payment to the banks. That argument
would depend on an earmarked fund which was not applicable in the present
case.
Barclays Bank plc v O'Brien
(FT, June 11)
THE ISSUE in the instant case had arisen when a married woman pledged the
matrimonial home as a second charge to the bank for her husband's debts,
after having failed to take independent advice and not having the
transaction fully explained to her.
Allowing an appeal against an order that the bank could enforce the mortgage
document, the Court of Appeal stated that in certain cases, equity would
hold the security given by the surety to be unenforceable by the creditor
if: (1) the relationship between the debtor and the surety and the
consequent likelihood of influence and reliance was known to the creditor;
(2) the surety's consent to the transaction was procured by undue influence
or material misrepresentation on the debtor's part, and the surety lacked
adequate understanding of the nature and effect of the transaction; or (3)
the creditor failed to take reasonable steps to try and ensure that the
surety entered into the transaction with adequate understanding of its
nature and effect and that the surety's consent was true and informed. In
particular, equity was still concerned to protect the position of married
women and to treat them differently from other third parties who provided
security for the debts of others.
MS Fashions Ltd and others v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA
(FT, June 12)
SINCE 1980 the two companies had been customers of BCCI and had borrowing
and overdraft facilities. Each company had given a debenture to BCCI, and
cross-guaranteed the other's debt. In addition, security for the companies'
debts was given by S and his brother by a charge of property, so that the
effect was to render each of the four parties as included within the
relationship of 'the principal debtor' so that all were jointly liable.
On its winding-up BCCI claimed a comprehensive demand of Pounds 600,000
against each of the potential debtors for the total indebtedness owed by the
two companies. There was no defence available save under rule 4.90 of the
Insolvency Rules 1986 which provided that where, before a company went into
liquidation, there had been mutual debts between it and a creditor claiming
to prove in the liquidation, 'the sums due from one party shall be set off
against the sums due from the other'. S had some Pounds 300,000 on deposit
with BCCI.
The Court of Appeal stated that rule 4.90 could not properly operate unless
it operated in reduction of the debt owing to BCCI at date of liquidation.
All that was left for BCCI, therefore, whether against the principal debtors
or the sureties, was the balance of the original debt, viz. a sum of Pounds
300,000.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Fuel cells' chance to take
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle by the London Regeneration Consortium to gain planning permission
for its redevelopment project at London's King's Cross could hold an
unexpected silver lining for the environment. The long delay means
alternative energy technologies will be available for incorporation when the
project gets under way.
LRC is looking at fuel cell technology to provide at least some of its
projected power needs of about 80MW. Fuel cells would be suited to running
its articulated bus network, and possibly even provide some of the
buildings' electricity, said Hugh Delap, LRC infrastructure manager. 'It can
be cheaper, more efficient and its pollution levels are a fraction of that
arising from current means of producing electricity.'
Fuel cells produce electricity from the electrochemical reaction produced
when hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. Oxygen comes from the air
and hydrogen from such fuels as natural gas, methanol and coal gas.
New research shows fuel cells can be used in about 90 per cent of cases
where conventional energy sources are employed, according to consultants
Arthur D Little. Their use would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 60
per cent, and noxious emissions by between 50 and 90 per cent.
The environmental benefits of the alternative energy source are therefore
many, say proponents. Emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides cause acid
rain; those of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide cause pollution and related
health problems; carbon dioxide emissions contribute to global warming. All
would be reduced significantly.
The efficient nature of fuel cells would also mean lower demand for
non-renewable fuels like coal and oil, with the additional environmental
benefit of reduced risk of oil spills. In the longer term, hydrogen for use
in fuel cells could itself be derived from renewable energy sources, like
landfill gases.
Finally, fuel cells can be sited within cities and near load centres,
reducing the need for electricity transmission and distribution equipment,
which are criticised for health concerns related to electromagnetic
radiation and for marring the countryside.
The big drawback with fuel cells - as with many other alternative sources of
energy - is the high start-up costs. Generation currently costs about
Dollars 2,500 (Pounds 1,300) per kilowatt for a 200kW plant, making it too
expensive for most applications. The largest plant currently operating is
11MW, supplying electricity for up to 5,000 homes in Tokyo. But production
levels would have to approach 200-300MW a year - when the cost would fall to
about Dollars 1,500/kW - before they are economically viable, says Arthur D
Little.
The World Fuel Cell Council, which is busily promoting the technology, is
therefore campaigning for government subsidies such as tax credits to help
kick-start the technology. Japan, which imports almost all of its energy
resources, has taken the lead with a national goal to install 2,250MW by
2000 and 8,300MW by 2010.
In Britain, the Department of Trade and Industry has set up a programme
aimed at accelerating the development of fuel cell systems for early
applications in the UK. California, meanwhile, has introduced a requirement
that 2 per cent of each motor manufacturer's sales should be zero emission
vehicles by 1998, rising to 10 per cent by 2003.
Several companies in the US are developing fuel cell powered vehicles, with
Ballard Power Systems, for example, due to demonstrate its hydrogen-operated
bus later this year.

After little more than a year as boss of Parcelforce, 56-year-old Peter
Howarth (left) has been brought back in to the mainstream business of the
Post Office and been put in charge of the Royal Mail, which earns the bulk
of the PO's profits.
The return of Howarth, who joined the PO in 1953 and had been Royal Mail's
assistant managing director, is the most important of a series of top
management changes following 49-year-old Bill Cockburn's appointment as the
PO's next chief executive. It is also a further sign that the sale of the
loss-making Parcelforce parcels business is imminent.
John Roberts (right), Cockburn's rival for the chief executive's job,
remains managing director of Post Office Counters whose turnover is around a
quarter of the size of the Royal Mail.
However, Roberts, 48, is to take on wider responsibilities at group level.
He will assist Cockburn on the planned sale of Parcelforce and will help
formulate the PO's response to the government's recently-announced review of
the future of the PO. He will also take over the group responsibilities of
Ken Young, the PO deputy chairman, when he retires at the end of this year.
Richard Dykes, a 47-year-old ex-civil servant who joined the PO in 1986 and
is currently director of operations of Post Office Counters, becomes acting
deputy managing director of that company. He will be responsible for its
day-to-day management and will report to Roberts on major issues.
Meanwhile, 43-year-old Malcolm Kitchener, Parcelforce's financial director,
seems to have made the right move when he quit Fisons and joined the public
sector 18 months ago. He becomes Parcelforce's acting managing director.
However, unlike his predecessor he has not been given a seat on the PO
board.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Management: Enterprise brews in Cambodia - Victor Mallet
looks at an unusual rehabilitation project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors could be forgiven for shuddering at the mere thought of
embarking on an industrial venture in Cambodia, where the infrastructure is
in a shambles after two decades of war, skilled workers are dead or exiled
and Khmer Rouge guerrillas refuse to lay down their arms in accordance with
a UN peace plan.
Indeed, most of the businessmen thronging the hotels of the capital Phnom
Penh are traders, property speculators, bankers or UN contractors. But John
Harper, an energetic 50-year-old Australian entrepreneur, is about to start
making Cambodian beer.
The triumphs and travails of Harper and his Australian and Malaysian
partners in their 18-month-old project to rehabilitate the brewery in the
port of Sihanoukville (previously Kompong Som) demonstrate some of the risks
 -and potentially high rewards - of investing in a chronically unstable
developing country.
As a partner in Pacific Malting of Ballarat in Australia, who had spent 10
years working in Asia, Harper knew that Indochina was an important growth
area for the beer industry. He first heard of the Sihanoukville brewery on a
visit to Laos in late-1990 and assumed there would a chance to sell malt
when it re-started production.
Accompanied by officials of the ministry of industry and a military escort
on the dangerous 250km road from Phnom Penh, he went to see the idle and
neglected brewery and ended up taking it over himself.
The brewing and soft drinks complex overlooking the sea was built by a
French contractor in the late 1960s for the then Cambodian government, but a
few years after production began, the war in Cambodia overtook the town and
forced the French expatriate staff to leave. Angkor and Bayon, the regular
and premium brands named after the renowned Khmer temples in northern
Cambodia, were not to appear on the shelves again until this year.
During their reign of terror in the 1970s, the extreme-left Khmer Rouge
guerrillas emptied Cambodia's cities in pursuit of an agrarian revolution.
Local employees from the brewery were scattered and killed, and no more beer
was made. 'We found it 20 years later,' says Harper. 'It's like you've
bought a brand new Jaguar, driven it for 18 months and parked it in the
garage for 20 years. It's okay, but it's not a new model. The tyres are flat
and rats have got into the wiring. We knew we had taken on a formidable
task.'
He and his Australian partner, Stanley Ng, registered Cambrew Pte in
Singapore for the Dollars 5m (Pounds 2.6m) rehabilitation project, and later
sold a majority stake in the venture to a group of Malaysian investors.
'The most formidable problem was that there was not one drawing, not one
manual, not one piece of paper to identify the equipment,' says Harper.
Baffled by the unfamiliar French layout, Harper and his colleagues were
reduced to pouring red dye into the drains to see where it emerged.
The mystery of the missing documents was later solved by the few surviving
employees: China was the principal supporter of the Khmer Rouge, and the
guerrillas had turned to the Chinese brewers, Tsing Tao, in a vain attempt
to reopen the plant. According to the Cambodian workers, the Tsing Tao
experts took photographs and shipped all the manuals to China.
Harper became a detective. By noting the names on the various pieces of
equipment in the brewery, he discovered that Nordon was the main contractor
and travelled to Nancy in France, where he was rewarded with a pile of plans
and drawings. The laborious task of stripping down or replacing everything
from boilers to refrigeration units could begin.
'Given the choice I'd rather build a new plant,' sighs Vijayan Kuttan,
Cambrew's Malaysian production director in Sihanoukville. 'From a
manufacturing point of view it was a nightmare.'
Boilers had to be cut open and rebuilt, gaskets replaced, pressure lines
tested and a shell-hole in the soft drinks unit cemented over. 'Mechanically
it looked alright from the outside, but when you've got a plant that has sat
still for a very long time, it's got more damage than if it had been run.'
Cambodia's desperate economic straits made matters worse. 'Messages
initially had to be sent by taxi,' says Kuttan, who now has a satellite
telephone installed on the balcony of the brewery's administration block.
Even today, Sihanoukville produces no electricity in the daytime because of
a shortage of fuel, and soldiers wave down cars and trucks on the road to
Phnom Penh with their guns to beg for cigarettes or money. The UN operation
which has so far failed to eradicate such problems has also lured many
skilled Cambodians away from the domestic economy, and Harper says he lost
six of his 16 marketing staff to the UN.
In such circumstances it was inevitable that the brewery would have to
become a self-sufficient complex, generating its own electricity and
purifying its own water for a planned initial capacity of 250,000
hectolitres of beer a year. Harper has even taken over a Phnom Penh glass
plant - built by the Chinese in 1966 - and brought in Chinese partners to
produce the bottles, although the first batch will be imported when beer
production begins in the next few weeks.
Before the repairs to the plant could begin, Harper spent four months in
negotiations with the Cambodian government and it was not until April last
year that the two sides drank Russian champagne to celebrate a deal. Cambrew
was awarded a 20-year lease at what Harper calls 'a very acceptable rental'
and was granted tax and customs privileges for the project.
Australia's active role in the Cambodian peace talks which led to the
comprehensive settlement agreed in Paris last year was a helpful influence,
Harper says. He also says he applied two rules to the Cambrew operation: no
corruption - even if it means paying Dollars 50,000 for a satellite
telephone instead of a Dollars 3,000 bribe for a regular international phone
line - and no private security forces carrying weapons.
Cambrew appears to have few worries about the market for its beer. Apart
from strong demand from Cambodians themselves, Harper estimates that each of
the 20,000 UN soldiers and officials in Cambodia is consuming between a case
and a case and a half of beer each week. At present all beers and soft
drinks in Cambodia are imported in cans - mostly from Singapore - and
Cambrew is in the gratifying position of being wooed by various foreign
companies which are anxious to have their beers made in Sihanoukville under
licence. The Cambrew plant will also be bottling soft drinks for Pepsi-Cola
International.
Harper is understandably coy about how long it will take Cambrew to recoup
the cost of its investment, but it is unlikely to be more than a few years.
Critics can already be heard complaining that foreign investors like Cambrew
are making a financial killing out of Cambodia, but the risks remain
immense.
For a start, there is no guarantee that the authorities will be willing or
able to implement their promise to impose higher customs duties on imported
beer. At the moment there is supposed to be a levy of a mere Dollars 2.80 on
each case of 24 cans, but a cash bribe is said to be sufficient to ensure
inaccurate counting of the cases.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas are still roaming the countryside and refusing to
co-operate with the peace plan, and the Vietnamese-installed government with
which Cambrew struck its agreement is now regarded as only one of the four
Cambodian factions and has no legal authority to govern on its own.
Harper is quick to point out that Cambrew will be directly employing 1,000
Cambodians, that it will save the country millions of dollars in foreign
exchange each year and that reneging on the prestige brewery deal would
'destroy direct foreign investment' in Cambodia.
'We were dedicated to make it work in an environment which was very, very
tenuous. It wasn't easy when everyone was telling us we were crazy,' he
says. 'We will - unless something dramatically goes wrong - make a very
gracious return out of our commitment. But so it should be.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Mods versus Skinheads - Peter Berlin
watches a consummate team sport in a rough part of town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MODS took on the Skinheads the other night in Barcelona. It was quite a
rumble.
This wasn't some polite Olympic contest in one of the air-conditioned,
hill-top sports palaces built for the Games. This was a street affair fought
in a sweaty old gym near one of the rougher parts of town.
The US men's volleyball team, winners of gold at the last two Olympics, took
on the younger, bigger Italians, who are the reigning world champions.
The Italians had already won their qualifying group and the US was sure of
second place, so this was a battle for pride and a psychological edge should
the two meet again in the gold medal game. The battle lasted three hours.
First came finger-pointing and stares. Then the hitting started: violent and
unrelenting. Volleyball may not be a contact sport, but it is not short of
aggression.
In a game where the two teams are separated by a net, looks, including
stares, are important.
The US team, half of whom give as their home towns beaches in southern
California, shaved their heads last week to express solidarity with their
bald team-mate, Bob Samuelson, following a yellow-card dispute which cost
them an earlier match.
It was a brave thing to do, especially as Samuelson, who has no facial hair
and therefore no experience of razors, did most of the shaving. Even with
five days' growth (Samuelson excepted) the team look highly menacing - and
thoroughly stupid.
The Italians, all star players with the big professional clubs in the
Italian league, also pay close attention to their hair: short but not staid
with a little something to hold it in place even when they are diving around
the floor and leaping in the air and sweating like flying pigs.
Their oldest player, Andrea 'Lucky' Lucchetta, 29, sports a particularly
impressive topiary which builds to a delicate coxcomb along his parting.
The basic strategy of volleyball is simple. If your opponents manage to get
the ball past the blockers at the net, you have three touches to create a
killing attack of your own. The first will usually be a defensive scoop or
'dig' which guides the ball to the team's setter.
He pushes the ball up in the air, usually to a pre-arranged spot, where one
of the big men should be flying in to windmill it down on the other side.
The best attackers have such powerful vertical jumps that they seem to hang
in the air, assessing the defence, before battering the ball.
Most teams have two or three reliable hit men. The Italians can put six men
on court at once who can deliver the knock-out blow. On some plays five men
can be flying towards the net at once as part of a choreographed attack.
This is the Raging Bull school of volleyball.
The joy of volleyball is that it is not a contact sport, said Sylvie Bigras,
the assistant Canadian chef de mission at the Olympics and a former junior
international, as she watched her countrymen pounded into the plastic
matting by the big-hitting Italians 15-11 8-15 15-12 15-7.
It is also 'the consummate team sport. A player can't control the ball as it
rebounds off his body, and run with it.'
Against the US, Italy came out punching, Andrea Zorzi, 2 metres tall and
designer-stubbled, circling far off the court to get the best angle of
attack for his roundhouse rights. The Italians' other 2-metre man, Andrea
Gardini, smashed imperious attacks from centre of the court.
'They're a very physical team. Big strong, good jumpers, hittting the snot
out of the ball,' said Bob Ctvrtlik, one of four US team members who play in
the Italian league. 'Everything is a power game.'
By the start of the second set, the Americans were punchy. But in
volleyball, where the six men on court must defend as one, move as one and
think as one, sudden shifts of mood are common.
'Momentum is everything in volleyball - more than any other sport,' said
Ctvrtlik. 'It comes in waves.'
Simply by hanging on, the US broke what Italian coach Jose Velasco called
'the rhythm of our concentration'. Somehow the tide had turned. The US
fought back to win 9-15 16-14 15-11 15-11 on their sixth match point.
'We rely on defence and slowing the ball rather than stuffing it,' said
Ctvrtlik. 'The Italians are not used to having the ball come back. The US
tactic is to wear them down.'
Velasco agreed: 'If an opposing defence plays well, we lose our rhythm of
concentration. For Italy to win, we had to defend and block as well as
attack.'
In the quarter-finals today the US play the Unified Team, about whom they
are superstitious and suspicious. Italy play the Netherlands.
Each teams will keep a wary eye on the other's progress.

GOVERNMENT plans for privatising British Rail were 'extremely ill thought
out' and risked destroying the rail system, Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat
Treasury spokesman, said yesterday.
Mr Beith was unveiling a Liberal Democrat policy paper on competition in the
utilities sector.
The document, to be debated at the party's annual conference next month,
covers policies for the energy, transport, communications and water
industries.
Mr Beith said common thread of the document was that competition rather than
ownership was the main utilities-related issue. 'Privatisation has not by
itself solved all the problems of the utilities or created a competitive
environment,' he said.
The party's proposals include:
Restructuring the electricity generating companies into smaller units.
Divesting British Gas of its pipelines and providing equal access to the
network for all operators.
Opening up the coal industry to new entrants.
Separating British Telecommunication's trunk and international business from
its regional and local networks.
Extending the competitive tendering of bus services.
Creating a rail holding company to franchise services and stations.
Where a monopoly existed, it should be broken up or regulated 'very
strictly' in the consumer's interest, Mr Beith said.

MANY small companies in rural mid-Wales are finding trading conditions 'very

Presenting the board's annual report, he said: 'We are receiving more
requests for refinancing packages. Inward investment is difficult to attract
and those considering a move to mid-Wales are taking much longer to reach a
decision.'
The development board, which was set up 15 years ago, said recently it had
branched away from its original strategy of encouraging manufacturing
industry in the area.
Mr Davies said: 'We previously concentrated on building advance factories
for potential incomers but we are increasingly turning towards the
allocation of finance out of our Pounds 27.8m annual budget towards
development money for existing companies.
'We are also placing more emphasis on building factories to demand rather
than putting up sheds speculatively and then looking for a tenant.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / November start for GM plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS is to start production in November at its Pounds 190m engine
plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.
The top-of-the-range V6 engines to be produced at the plant will be used in
GM's European Opel/Vauxhall executive cars and will also be supplied to Saab
Automobile, the Swedish carmaker in which GM holds a 50 per cent stake and
management control.
GM said yesterday that the new 2.5 litre V6 engine would be fitted first in
a luxury version of its Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra large family car to be
launched early next year.
The investment at Ellesmere Port, which will be GM's sole European source
for the V6 engines, marks a watershed for the US group's operations in the
UK. It reverses its earlier significant retrenchment from manufacturing in
Britain, where it made big losses for nearly 20 years until the late 1980s.
GM has achieved record profits in the UK in recent years, and the engine
plant is expected to lead to the establishment of other component operations
at the Cheshire site.
Work on the plant started last year. The facility will have a workforce of
about 300 initially. This is expected to rise to about 450 at full
production.
GM has a considerable trade deficit in the UK, but the engine plant is
expected to cut it by about Pounds 100m a year with most production being
exported to GM assembly plants in continental Europe.
The plant will have an initial output of 85,000 engines a year on
three-shift, 24-hours-a-day working. This capacity is expected to rise
substantially as demand grows.
The plant will include extensive machining operations for blocks, cylinder
heads, crankshafts, camshafts and con-rods, and will also produce more than
140,000 additional cylinder heads to be supplied to other GM European engine
plants.
The 170-brake-horsepower V6 engine is expected to be used in the next
generation of GM's Vauxhall Carlton/Opel Omega executive car to be launched
in 1994, and a version will be used by Saab when it unveils a replacement
for its Saab 900 range late next year.
GM claims that it has achieved a lighter, more compact V6 than many of its
rivals with a narrow angle V6 configuration.
The US carmaker, which holds second place in the German and UK new car
markets, is in urgent need of the new top-of-the-line V6 engine range in
order to counter the success of Volkswagen's rival VR6 engine, which was
launched last year in its Passat large family car.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Companies House status under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES HOUSE, the government's corporate information agency, has come
under attack for its monopoly position.
Mr Michael Whitwell, chief executive of Jordans, the corporate information
and services group, has written to Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs
minister, to highlight areas he believes need scrutiny.
His letter follows an announcement last month by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, that Companies House would be subject to a review of
its operation, role and 'how its work can best be carried out in the
future'. It is expected to start in the autumn. It will consider a range of
options on the agency's future, including full or partial privatisation and
contracting out some activities.
Mr Whitwell's concerns echo those of other private-sector suppliers of
corporate information, who are worried that Companies House has benefited
from its position as the legal depository of information on all of Britain's
1m limited liability companies.
One of the published operating principles of Companies House is that it
'will not abuse its monopoly position as the central source of company
information'. But some bulk users of the information it provides say prices
have risen sharply since it became one of the first executive agencies under
the government's Next Steps initiative in October 1988. Accounts for the
year to March 31 show a surplus of Pounds 1.57m and a turnover of Pounds
32.4m, up from Pounds 20.6m in the previous year. A further Pounds 17m in
income last year was paid directly to the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Heseltine left open the possibility of privatising Companies House,
saying at the time of the announcement: 'The government's job is to govern,
not to administer.'

Duncan to his friends - lives a wealthy though private lifestyle with an
address in Chelsea, west London, and a property at Lyford Key, a well-known
tycoon's playground near Nassau in the Bahamas.
Mr Smith, 58, born in Edmonton, Canada, is described as a friendly family
man, and his business acquaintances say he has firm political views.
He is well known among the Bruges Group of anti-European federalists who
number Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, among their supporters.
Lord Harris of High Cross, a former chairman of the Bruges Group, said
yesterday that Mr Smith was in no sense high-living.
'He struck me as an extremely gentle, extremely decent and straightforward
man,' he said.
He added: 'He was extremely interested in the whole idea of the market
economy. He has taken an alert and scholarly interest in economic argument.
He is a student of these things in a quiet way.'
Mr Smith is known to have paid the rent on the Bruges Group's one-room
office in Jermyn Street, central London, for nearly two years, and to have
made the same level of contribution to its bigger rent bill after the group
moved to Whitehall.
According to an individual familiar with the Bruges Group Mr Smith
contributed 'a small percentage' of the ongoing cost of the group's
campaigning without taking a public role in its affairs. Like other
contributors, he took no part in the group's internal decision-making
process.
Outside politics, however, Mr Smith was recognised as a dealer in trade
finance. During the 1960s he was a broker with Nesbitt Thompson, a Canadian
broking firm.
He is known to have approached at least one large conglomerate seeking to
handle its treasury funds.
A banker who knew him said: 'He said he was dealing in fixed-interest
securities to get a return above the rate that could be achieved by putting
the funds into bills.
'I think the process was called riding the square and involved interpreting
the interest curve.'
During the late 1970s Mr Smith worked in east Africa, handling Canadian
export finance in countries such as Kenya and Uganda.
His bank maintained a balance of between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m which
enabled it to carry out sophisticated trades in swaps and deals in various
commercial paper such as certificates of deposit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFFING AT hospital accident and emergency departments in England is often
overstretched, with some being manned by inexperienced doctors during busy
night periods, the National Audit Office said yesterday.
It said medical staffing levels often fell 'well short' of recommended
levels.
In a separate report on Scotland the audit office said that consultants for
accident and emergency departments were 'often overstretched'.
Last year the audit office examined the organisation of departments at six
hospitals: Leicester Royal Infirmary; University College Hospital, London;
Taunton and Somerset Hospital; St James's University Hospital, Leeds; Leeds
General Infirmary; and Worcester Royal Infirmary.
The report says that at night - in all cases but Leicester Royal Infirmary,
which employed the highest number of registrars and senior registrars -
inexperienced senior house officers who needed advice had to call in a
consultant from home or seek advice by telephone.
The audit office concludes that while all the departments were well run on a
day-to-day basis, 'our examination pointed to opportunities for more
positive management' including stronger accident and emergency department
representation in hospital management.
In the Scottish report the audit office calls for a review by the Scottish
Office and health boards of the kind of service which should be developed
over the next decade.
It looked at six accident and emergency departments at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary; Monklands General Hospital, Strathclyde; St John's Hospital,
Howden; Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; West Highland Hospital, Oban; and Belford
Hospital, Fort William.
It found that the limited number of experienced staff at Fort William and at
Oban meant 'supervision of house officers was often nominal'.

THE NUMBER of receivership and administration appointments in July fell,
compared with the same month last year, for the sixth successive month,
according to figures released by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm,
yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
The statistics, based on an analysis of notices in the official London and
Edinburgh Gazettes, show appointments at 474, compared with 549 in July last
year. That is the highest number of appointments since March, and brings the
total this year to 3,192, compared with 3,464 in the first seven months of
last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said he did not share the pessimism of some other commentators about the
continued extent of the recession. The reducing level of appointments might
reflect the high level of support being given by banks to struggling
businesses.

THE Charities Act will come into force in five stages, starting next month
and probably concluding next autumn, Lord Ferrers, a Home Office minister,
announced yesterday.
The act is designed to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commissioners to
investigate and remedy abuse and introduce effective controls over
fund-raising.
The act gives commissioners greater powers to inquire into charities, to
deal with abuse and mismanagement and to protect charity property, including
the power to appoint a receiver and manager for a charity. There will be a
new regime for accounting by charities, and the home secretary will have
power to prescribe the form and content of a charity's statements of
account. It will be an offence to be persistently in default of the
requirements to submit annual reports and accounts to the commissioners.
People convicted of offences involving dishonesty or deception and
undischarged bankrupts will be disqualified from acting as trustees.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Car parks urged to boost security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOME OFFICE minister yesterday called on operators of car parks to improve
security for motorists.
'Car thieves can have rich pickings in poorly managed car parks,' Mr Michael
Jack, Home Office minister, said at the launch of a report into crime at car
parks. The study covered 52 car parks in the London area and was carried out
as part of Car Crime Prevention Year by the Home Office police research
group.
Mr Jack said one in five stolen cars was taken from a car park. 'This is not
acceptable. Car-park users have the right to expect a minimum level of
security for the fees they pay.'
The study found that unstaffed 'pay and display' car parks and long-stay
commuter car parks had the highest crime rates.
Those with low crime levels were characterised by a 'customer service'
attitude on the part of management, and a greater willingness to accept
liability for theft and damage.
The Automobile Association and Consumers Association both called for
car-park users to have some legal redress against operators if their
vehicles were broken into, and suggested that car parking be covered by the
Fair Trading Act. Provision of car parking is not classified as a service
and so is outside the act.
The AA said: 'Other consumer products worth far less than the cost of a
day's parking are subject to all-embracing consumer protection legislation.'
The main car-park operators will be invited to discuss the problem with Mr
Jack. More than eight in 10 petrol stations last year suffered crimes
including armed robbery, attacks on staff, burglary, fraud, theft and
vandalism, according to a survey of petrol retailers published yesterday.

FT  05 AUG 92 / House-building starts fall 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDERS started work on 8 per cent fewer homes in the three months after
the general election than in the preceding three months, according to
figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment.
These showed that after allowing for seasonal adjustments builders started
work on 38,900 homes in Britain in April, May and June. This compared with
42,200 in the first three months of this year and 39,200 in the
corresponding months last year.
The quarterly figures are the lowest since the final three months of 1990.
Housing starts have flagged in recent weeks as builders have realised that
the market remains deeply depressed in spite of the removal of political
uncertainty following the outcome of the election.
According to the department private housing starts made by builders were 6
per cent lower than in the previous three months and 7.5 per cent lower than
in April, May and June last year.
The only bright spot in an otherwise gloomy outlook for housebuilders is a
sharp rise in work provided by housing associations. The government wants
housing associations to take over the local authorities' role as the main
providers of social housing for rent for needy and disadvantaged people.
Housing associations started work on 7,600 homes in the three months to the
end of April. This was 55 per cent more than in the same period last year.
Local authorities started work on 500,000 homes compared with 1m in April,
May and June last year.
Housing associations have seen grants rise sharply since their role was
enhanced by the 1988 Housing Act. They are also expected to finance an
increasing proportion of building and refurbishment by raising funds from
private investors.
The number of homes built by housing associations is expected to rise from
27,000 to more than 40,000 in the 12 months to March 31 1993, at an
estimated cost of Pounds 8bn. Of this, Pounds 1.5bn is expected to come from
private investors.

FT  05 AUG 92 / GA launches cover for property values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYERS OF new homes will be able to insure themselves against plummeting
property prices under a scheme launched this week.
The scheme, provided by General Accident Property Services, which operates a
chain of 400 estate agents and is part of the General Accident insurance
group, will be provided initially in the Thames Valley area, west of London,
and will spread nationally during the next two months.
It comes as the government is under pressure to stimulate the depressed
housing market. The Thames Valley has seen some of the biggest reductions in
house prices, which in south-east England have fallen on average by a
quarter since 1988-89.
GA is offering to cover owners forced to sell their home within three years
of a purchase against losses of up to 10 per cent of the original price - up
to a ceiling of Pounds 15,000.
Mr David Wright, national operations manager of the property services
division, said the scheme would be sold through housebuilders, which would
be able to offer the loss-of-value insurance as a sales incentive. It is not
planned to offer the scheme generally to the public.
The cost to builders would be a flat fee of less than Pounds 300 a house
which would cover purchasers for three years. Letters detailing the offer
have been sent this week to companies in the Thames Valley region, including
most of the national housebuilders.
Mr Wright said the insurance policies would be written by a Lloyd's
insurance syndicate rather than by GA. 'The aim is not to generate insurance
business but to try to stimulate the housing market out of the worst slump
for more than half a century,' he said.
GA already offers mortgage protection insurance against redundancy.
It said that to qualify for the new scheme purchasers must be forced to sell
their home by the loss of a job or a forced job move, a divorce or
separation, or by the withdrawal of equity by a joint mortgagee.
'Unemployment and the fear of homes losing their value are the two biggest
concerns holding back the housing market,' Mr Wright said.
Abbey National, the country's second largest mortgage lender, this week
urged the government to provide a once-only tax credit of up to Pounds
10,000 to people making a loss on selling their property.

FT  05 AUG 92 / White House vetoes plan for rationing health care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration has vetoed this week a plan by the state of Oregon
to expand access to health care by rationing the provision of services,
highlighting the legal and political obstacles facing US social reformers.
The decision also casts doubt on the administration's commitment to social
experimentation by individual states. The White House has frequently argued
that states should serve as 'laboratories', pioneering policies that might
become adopted nationally.
Dr Louis Sullivan, federal health secretary, rejected Oregon's plan on the
grounds that it might have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, which President George Bush had strongly backed.
Supporters of the plan, however, vigorously rejected the federal criticism.
Senator Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, said the state had been 'stabbed
in the back.' State Governor Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, said nothing in
the plan was intended to discriminate against the disabled.
Like other US states, Oregon is struggling to cope with the rising costs of
its Medicaid programme of health services for the poor. Under existing
rules, certain categories of the poor - for example, women with children -
are granted unlimited access to services, while others, such as poor single
adults, qualify for nothing.
This form of rationing has existed for decades in the US.
The Oregon plan has provoked intense controversy because it proposes a
different form of rationing. In essence, it says that the services received
by all poor people must be rationed so that, with a limited budget,
everybody shall be guaranteed access to a basic level of care.
The plan divides all health services into a total of 709 condition/treatment
pairs. The ranking is determined partly by medical effectiveness (treatments
that rarely work are at the bottom of the list) and partly according to
value judgments expressed by Oregonians in surveys. The legislature was
presented with the list last year and with a series of costings prepared by
an independent actuary.
It then faced a simple task: to find how far a limited budget would stretch.
The cut-off point was treatment pair 587 - nothing ranked lower was to be
made available. Rejected treatments range from the trivial - such as viral
sore throats - to serious conditions such as Aids and some cancers, where
prospects of survival are rated as very low. Hospice and comfort care for
the dying, however, is provided.
Dr Sullivan said the priorities in the list appeared to reflect a 'bias
against persons with disabilities', and that many treatments which would
help the disabled had received a low ranking. He urged Oregon to correct
these biases, then resubmit its plans.
The ranking of treatments proposed by Oregon may be questionable, but its
determination to improve access to care, and to set priorities for
treatment, contrast favourably with a refusal elsewhere to accept that
choices have to be made. Most health care systems ration care, but do so
behind closed doors. Oregon has been penalised for open acknowledgement of
its priorities.

TURKEY is to revive plans for a high-speed rail link between Istanbul and
Ankara, inviting tenders for a project started in 1979 but shelved for lack
of finance.
The scheme, estimated to cost TL30,000bn (Pounds 2.2bn), is for a
twin-track, 430km rail link. It will include a tube tunnel crossing the
Bosporus (which divides European and Asian Turkey and is 600 metres at its
narrowest point). The project will cut travel time from eight hours to just
over two. Bids for design and construction must be in by September 15.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's premier, first mentioned the rail scheme
during French President Francois Mitterrand's visit earlier this year. He
urged foreign companies to join Turkish groups in rebuilding the Silk Route
to Central Asia. Mr Bruno Durieux, France's junior trade minister, expressed
interest in the rail and tunnel project when visiting Turkey two weeks ago.
Interest from the UK is expected from Costains and Trafalgar House.

TURKEY is near to winning Libyan agreement to settle a Dollars 600m (Pounds
314m) debt owed to Turkish contractors, if details of a protocol involving a
debt-for-oil swap can be finalised, John Murray Brown reports from Istanbul.
Officials from the Turkish Eximbank and Libya's Umma Bank last week
initialled terms to provide payment to Turkish contractors for the first
time since September 1990. Mr Ozer Olcmen, head of the Union of Turkish
Contractors in Libya, said Tupras, the Turkish oil company, has still to fix
a price for the Libyan crude, proceeds of which would be lodged in an
account in the Eximbank to repay Turkish contractors. He expected final
agreement in the next 10 days.
Turkish contractors have done more than Dollars 10bn-worth of deals since
the early 1980s, building infrastructure for the Libyan oil industry. At one
time, over 200 Turkish companies were engaged in this market. Today, 38
Turkish groups are owed Dollars 282m by Libya, according to Turkish figures.
The balance is owed by local Libyan authorities.
Mr Olcmen traces the problem to Turkey having made its lira convertible in
1990. To comply with terms of an IMF pact, Ankara had to close the account
held by the Turkish bank through which Libyan payments were made.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Take 'em out to the ball game: Patrick Harverson reports on
Baltimore's baseball strike for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY cities across the US, Baltimore is impatiently waiting for the
nationwide recovery to breathe new life into a local economy still hung over
from the recession of 1990-1991.
Yet unlike any other city in the US, Baltimore is looking to an unusual
source to help it out of the economic doldrums - a baseball stadium.
Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the new home for the Baltimore Orioles, was
completed earlier this year at a cost of Dollars 105m (Pounds 55m), and city
planners hope the stadium will serve as an economic catalyst for the entire
downtown area. It is already proving a magnet for local developers. Some
hope it will become the focal point of a billion-dollar urban redevelopment
programme.
When Oriole Park was opened in April, Maryland governor Mr William Schaefer
announced that construction of the stadium had fuelled the local economy
with Dollars 140m in gross sales and Dollars 48m in direct payroll. He also
forecast, quoting from a study by state economists, that the net impact of
the baseball season would inject another Dollars 274m in sales and income
and Dollars 14m in taxes into the economy.
Today, those projections are beginning to look on the low side. Before the
season started, it was hoped that attendance at Oriole Park this year would
be 20 per cent higher than at the old Memorial stadium.
People, however, have flocked to the new ballpark in huge numbers.
Attendance is averaging near capacity at 43,000 a game, compared with the
28,000 the old stadium drew last year. Total attendance for the season is
expected to top 3.5m, not 2.5m as first forecast.
It has helped that the team has been successful. Last season the Orioles
finished near the basement of the baseball leagues. So far this year, it has
the second-best record in its division and is attracting fans from Baltimore
and nearby Washington DC.
The stadium itself is also popular. Two golden rules of sports stadium
development were broken with Oriole Park. First, it is a baseball-only
stadium, and not the usual multi-use monstrosity built to host a range of
sports and entertainment to maximise revenues.
In sticking to baseball, the architects designed an intimate, old-fashioned
ballpark with traditional features such as red brick arch facades and a
sunken, asymmetrical field. One critic hailed the result an 'anthem to the
national pastime', and Oriole Park has quickly become a tourist attraction
in its own right.
The second gamble was to locate the stadium within minutes of the city's
downtown area. Since the 1960s most sports stadiums built in the US have
been put in the suburbs or on vacant space outside metropolitan areas, where
construction is cheaper, access easier, and disruption to local
neighbourhoods avoided.
Baltimore, however, has put the stadium virtually in the heart of the city,
on the site of the old railway yards just a few blocks west of the inner
harbour area. The idea was to make Oriole Park part of the downtown
'experience'. Since its re-development in the early 1980s, the harbour has
become the heart of Baltimore. Shops, restaurants, hotels, a conference
centre and tourist attractions draw millions of Baltimore natives and
visitors to the harbour area every year.
At the start of the season, city managers hoped that when people came to see
the Orioles, many would stay downtown to enjoy the harbour's shops and
restaurants.
Those hopes are being realised. On game days crowds in the area are larger
than normal. A study is about to be launched that is expected to show a
significant boost to retail and restaurant sales since the stadium opened.
Several projects for the area immediately surrounding the stadium are
already in the pipeline, including a Dollars 600m life sciences trade and
medical conference centre, a Dollars 130m expansion of the current
convention centre and a Dollars 500m extension to the nearby University of
Maryland. If Oriole Park had not been built on its present site, it is
unlikely these projects would have been slated for the central city area.
For all its successes, Oriole Park cannot bring Baltimore out of recession
on its own. Future prosperity lies in the hands of the two main employment
providers, white-collar services businesses and the construction industry,
both of which remain depressed and dependent on the national economy for
growth.
Redeveloping the downtown area and building a baseball stadium has also not
addressed the problems of crime and poverty that plague Baltimore, as they
do other US cities. While parts of downtown are popular during the day and
night, Baltimore's politicians have been accused of neglecting important
social problems in favour of sprucing up a small section of the city.
The city's managers argue that a thriving downtown area benefits everyone in
the region by attracting new businesses, and with them new jobs, to
Baltimore.

<TEXT>
ANSALDO, the Italian state-owned engineering company, and the transport
systems division of Germany's Siemens group have fleshed out further details
of their preliminary agreement, signed in March 1991, to co-operate in
railway equipment.
The two companies have agreed to work together on developing a cooling
system for railway locomotives, based on technologies derived from both
sides.
The new system will eliminate the use of freon gases, while maintaining the
full operating capabilities of methods using CFC chemicals.
Ansaldo and Siemens have also decided to extend their collaboration into
areas such as high-speed trains, urban mass transit systems for the US
market and automated signalling equipment.
Precise areas of co-operation will be defined shortly, according to Ansaldo,
which is part of the Iri state holding company's Finmeccanica group.
The two companies hope that combining their resources will put them ahead of
the competition in developing a new generation of high-speed trains to
replace Germany's ICE or Italy's ETR 500.
The first fruits of the collaboration may be seen in Ansaldo's E402
locomotive, 70 of which have recently been ordered by the Ferrovie dello
Stato (FS), the Italian state railway.
The FS is thought to require about 200 units, meaning that future models may
incorporate cooling technology based on the Siemens-Ansaldo deal.
Earlier this year, Siemens passed an important first hurdle in its attempts
to break into the Italian market by being officially recognised as a
potential supplier to the FS.
Meanwhile, an Ansaldo official said the collaboration with Siemens meant its
cooling technology would also be used in future German locomotives.

deal

CHINA is putting pressure on the Israeli government not to go ahead with a
proposal to sell 40 Kfir fighter aircraft to Taiwan, a deal which could be
worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 210m) to Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), the
country's main arms-maker.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has become involved in intense
discussion within the government over the issue. It pitches Israel's
newly-forged diplomatic relations with Beijing against an important contract
for the biggest state-owned company, which is struggling to restore profit
margins after lapsing into losses in the late 1980s.
IAI has refused to comment on the deal, but is known to have been in
discussion with Taiwan about the Kfir sale for some time. Although a
relatively old aircraft, IAI has the advanced avionic and weapons technology
to make an up-to-date version of the Kfir, originally a copy of the French
Mirage.
China only opened diplomatic relations with Israel earlier this year.
Israeli officials are concerned that going ahead with the Kfir deal could
jeopardise lucrative trade prospects in China which it began to nurture
before official ties were completed.
The agreements establishing diplomatic links included Israel's signature on
a document which in effect acknowledged that Taiwan was a province of China,
not an independent state.
But supporters of the Kfir sale argue that other countries have sold weapons
to Taiwan without damaging their trade with China. The final decision will
rest with Mr Rabin.

FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Malaysia makes Pacific waves - Calls for
east Asia trade pact are worrying some
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS RAFIDAH Aziz, Malaysia's minister of trade and industry, does not mince
her words. On a recent visit to Tokyo she described Japan as acting like 'a
bashful bride'. On a subsequent visit to Canberra, she asked the Australians
to decide whether they were part of Asia. In between Mrs Rafidah launched a
thinly veiled attack on the US, warning it about interfering in Asia's
affairs.
The subject under discussion has been the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC),
an idea inspired by Malaysia to combat what it sees as a growing tendency
among the industrialised countries to divide the world into regional trade
blocs. Malaysia wants the fast growing economies of east Asia, including
Japan, to join together to form common positions on questions of trade.
Now it seems to be making a determined effort - through Mrs Rafidah and Mr
Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian foreign minister - to bring the EAEC to
reality. So far the Japanese remain bashful about the EAEC, the Australians
are still undecided, while the US makes no secret of its continued hostility
to the idea.
An EAEC was first suggested by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, more than a year ago. Malaysia's fellow members in the Association
of South East Asian Nations - Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines and Brunei - have not been greatly enthusiastic about the idea.
In the first instance it appears the other Asean members were not consulted.
There has also been the fear that a new trade grouping, including the
powerful north-east Asian economies, would be looked on with great anxiety,
especially in North America where it would be likely to increase already
strong protectionist sentiment.
Mrs Rafidah insists that the EAEC would not become another trade bloc. She
says the idea of the EAEC came into being because of frustrations about the
lack of headway being made in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks.
'Because we do not see free trade coming, we would like to talk about
getting freer trade in this part of the world,' says Mrs Rafidah. 'It is
important for east Asian economies, which account for 20 per cent of total
world trade, to meet at private sector, official and ministerial levels to
discuss how they can enhance trade and investment.'
The US has clearly stated its opposition to any move towards an EAEC. In the
words of Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, an EAEC would 'draw a
line down the Pacific' with the US on one side and Japan and the other Asian
economies on the other. Though Malaysia has watered down its original
proposal - describing the EAEC as a caucus rather than its original group
title and stressing its proposed mainly consultative role - it seems the US
will not be satisfied until the idea is dropped entirely.
'Washington clearly sees the EAEC as the camel's nose under the tent,' said
one US source.
Instead, the US is stressing the importance of Apec - the Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum. On a recent visit to Kuala Lumpur, Mr Paul
Wolfowitz, the US under-secretary of defence, said the US could not afford
to drop its commitment to east Asia.
'In 1991, our two-way trade across the Pacific exceeded Dollars 310bn -
nearly one third larger than our trade with Europe. The US exports more to
Malaysia than to the countries of the former Soviet Union; more to Indonesia
than to eastern Europe and more to Singapore than to Spain or Italy.'
Japan has been non-committal so far about an EAEC. On one hand Japan is
deeply involved in the region's economies, with an estimated Dollars 33bn
invested in the Asean countries - nearly a third of its total overseas
invest ments.
But Japan remains sensitive not only to US trading pressures but also to
fears expressed in some south-east Asian countries about growing Japanese
economic dominance - which inevitably conjure up wartime memories of Japan's
'Greater Co-Prosperity Sphere' in Asia. For these reasons Tokyo would be
unlikely to want to take a lead role in an organisation such as EAEC.
Malaysian officials privately argue that an EAEC would in fact contain
Japanese power in the region. Within an EAEC forum Japan could be pressured
and steered in the right direction.
Malaysia risks embarrassment by continuing to press the EAEC idea so
strongly to an apparently unappreciative outside audience. But as the
fastest growing economy in the Asian region over the last four years it
clearly feels its onward success is threatened.
The fear for countries such as Malaysia, said one government minister, is
that the world trading environment is disintegrating into regional blocs
'with each appearing like a beautiful castle from inside but in effect a
fortress to those outside'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil, battling to stay in power amid a
worsening corruption scandal, has been dealt a heavy blow by the resignation
of one of his most senior ministers.
Mr Jose Goldemberg, education minister, is the first cabinet member to quit
since the political crisis erupted in May with a series of corruption
allegations against the president. The minister resigned on Monday night,
provoking much speculation that other ministers might follow suit.
Citing 'political and personal reasons' for quitting, Mr Goldemberg accused
the government of greater concern for its own survival than for the
Brazilian people, and of lack of commitment to education.
Mr Goldemberg, 63, was the only remaining civilian member of the original
Collor cabinet of three years ago.
Yesterday, Mr Jorge Bornhausen, minister in the president's office, sought
to dismiss fears that other ministers would follow Mr Goldemberg.
Mr Collor has also managed to hold on to his economic team by agreeing to
maintain his austerity policy. The team had threatened to resign if the
economic adjustment programme were compromised by Treasury disbursements.
Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister, said he had agreed merely to
re-allocate some government resources to social programmes, such as housing.

cover
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY's leading industry and trade associations yesterday appealed for
federal guarantees to cover barter trade deals with Russia and eastern
Europe.
'We are looking for new ways of doing business with the east in the '90s,'
said Mr Gerhard Reckel of the BGA foreign traders' association. The classic
trading formula - goods for money - would no longer be effective in the
foreseeable future.
Barter would become increasingly important, but there was no federal
mechanism comparable with the Hermes export credit insurance agency to
protect German companies.
The appeal for new support from the BGA along with the Federation of German
Industry (BDI) and the national trade and industry chamber (DIHT) will be
discussed with the finance and economics ministries next week.
According to the BGA, trade with Russia and former Soviet Republics fell a
further 25 per cent to 30 per cent in the first five months of this year.
Almost all business now being transacted was between German companies and
their subsidiaries in the east.
In 1991, German exports to the former Soviet Union fell 35 per cent to
DM18.2bn (Pounds 6.2bn) and imports dropped 20 per cent to DM14.6bn.
The associations claimed that barter guarantees had advantages in that banks
would not need to be involved, and that eastern trading partners were less
likely to renege on agreements than with credit deals.
Defending their claim for state aid, they pointed out that Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, economics minister, who has promised to develop but has yet to
unveil a new eastern trading strategy, admitted that his plans would 'cost
money'.
'One thing is clear. Without subsidies there will be no trade at all with
the east in the next few years,' Mr Reckel said.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Mandela to lead march on citadel of white authority: The ANC
week of protest is about to enter a potentially dangerous phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S week of protest enters its critical and most dangerous phase
today when Nelson Mandela leads a march on Union Buildings, the citadel of
white authority in the heart of Pretoria.
For the next three days, the focus shifts from the shop floors, target of
the 48-hour general strike which ended yesterday. Although factories will
still be the targets of sit-ins, much of the action moves to the streets of
towns and cities across the country, where the risk of confrontation with
the security forces is higher.
The ANC and its allies - the Communist Party and the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - expect a huge turnout for today's march
through Pretoria's city centre to the steps of Union Buildings, the seat of
government.
An equally enthusiastic response is predicted in Cape Town, where motorists
were yesterday warned to steer clear of today's march from the black
township of Langa into the city centre.
If the massive stayaway that marked the strike can be followed up with a
massive turn-out for these and other rallies, demonstrations and sit-ins
that get under way today, Mr Mandela and his allies will have mounted the
most formidable organised protest against white rule that the country has
seen.
The days ahead, however, could also reveal the limitations of the ANC
campaign, intended to force President F W de Klerk to accept a rapid
transition to majority rule.
'The percentage of people who stayed at home does not tell us if they
support the ANC alliance's cause,' comments Professor Tom Lodge of
Johannesburg's Witswatersrand University and an authority on black politics,
'or if they would vote ANC in an election.'
A strong response to the campaign would help provide the answer, as well as
rebut allegations that the huge stay-away was due in great measure to
intimidation - the explanation offered by government, the Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
'Keeping people away from work by threats, or by paralysing the transport
system, is easier than forcing them to attend rallies or take part in
sit-ins,' said a sceptical businessman yesterday.
But a weak or modest turnout is susceptible to another explanation: the high
price of protest.
Although many workers reached agreements with employers to work extra
shifts, or take the two days as holiday, thus not losing income, most
participants will have had their pay packets docked.
What is more, their jobs will be at risk, either because employers may take
a tough line, or because the strike could have proved the last straw for
businesses battling to keep afloat in a recession now in its third year.
These problems do not dampen the enthusiasm of Mr Jay Naidoo, the Cosatu
general secretary. Jubilant over the outcome of the first day of the
campaign, he vowed to 'continue the rolling mass action until the
(alliance's)  .. demands are met'.
The next few days will indicate whether the energy for what would be a
protracted effort is there.
Organisers of South Africa's week of protest announced plans to occupy city
centres and business districts today as millions of workers continued to
stay at home on the second and last day of the country's general strike.
There was no sign of a fall-off in support for the 48-hour strike which
ended last night, though employers' organisations contested ANC claims that
4m workers had stayed away. They estimated 2m had responded to the strike
call.
United Nations observers continued to monitor areas of tension, in
particular an ANC march on Bisho, the capital of the Ciskei homeland.
The South African news agency reported that heavily armed Ciskei security
forces were guarding routes into the capital.
The situation last night was said to be extremely tense.
In Natal, gunmen opened fire on a car carrying a senior ANC official in the
region, Mr Harry Gwala. Mr Gwala survived the attack uninjured. Some of the
worst violence of the past 24 hours took place in Johannesburg's Alexandra
township where five people were killed by unknown attackers early yesterday.

<TEXT>
THE YAKUZA, Japan's gangsters, are adjusting to life under a new law curbing
their activities, by setting up superficially legitimate front operations,
and are continuing to expand in membership and influence, the national
police force said yesterday.
The police annual report on crime in Japan last year, chronicling
well-publicised cases of stock-cornering in the Tokyo equity market -
uncovered as share values slid during the year - warned that the existence
of the gangs 'is becoming a big threat to the healthy economic system of the
country'.
It said that known gang membership had increased 3.1 per cent since the
start of last year to stand at 91,000 by March, when a law prohibiting
'unjust acts' by yakuza came into force.
Nearly four in ten of these members were loyal to Yamaguchigumi, the largest
grouping, which increased its dominance over smaller rivals.
The police report is in part ammunition for the force in justifying budget
proposals for the coming year to a government which is having its tax
receipts squeezed by the current economic slowdown. None the less, it helps
illuminate the margins of Japan's low-crime society.
Although 17.4 per cent of those convicted last year were in financial
difficulties, this figure showed no increase as a result of the slowing down
of the economy - the proportion was 18.7 per cent a year before and 22.4 per
cent a decade earlier.
The yakuza has held back from overt clashes with rival gangs, instead
setting up companies based at their headquarters - an entity called 'Y Co
Ltd' in the case of Yamaguchigumi - as well as establishing right-wing
political front organisations and engaging in charitable works to 'improve
their image'.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG forcibly repatriated 60 Vietnamese boat people yesterday,
including 16 members of Vietnam's Nung ethnic minority, amid concerns that
some returnees may face persecution.
Asia Watch, a New York-based human rights group, said the Nung people, who
fought on the side of the French colonialists and later the US forces during
Vietnam's civil war, could be at risk if they returned to Vietnam.
The minority fled the country after being persecuted for their past
associations. Asia Watch said they could face imprisonment, police abuse and
forced labour if they had to return.
The Hong Kong government yesterday said Asia Watch had submitted a list of
133 members of the Nung minority. But Mr Brian Bresnihan, the colony's
refugee co-ordinator, said that 24 on the list had returned to Vietnam
voluntarily last year. There was no evidence that they had been subject to
persecution at the hand of the authorities, he said.
So far 295 people have been returned to Vietnam against their will and
20,317 have returned voluntarily.
Hong Kong is currently housing 52,151 boat people in detention camps. Of
these, 24,319 are awaiting repatriation, the status of 24,646 has yet to be
determined, and 3,186 have been classified as legitimate refugees.
In May, the Hong Kong authorities reached an agreement with Hanoi to
repatriate those who are not classed as refugees. So far this year, 6,472
have returned - of which 134 were compulsory repatriations - compared with
7,753 for the whole of 1991. Repatriation does seem to have stemmed the flow
of boat people into Hong Kong. This year only nine have arrived in the
colony, compared with 20,207 in 1991.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL production in India declined sharply during the first year of the
country's new economic reforms. The index fell from 7.8 per cent in
1990-1991 to -0.1 per cent in 1991-1992, according to a confidential
Ministry of Industry report.
The report shows that manufacturing contracted 1.7 per cent, with the
sharpest fall in the capital goods sector - a decline of 12.8 per cent over
last year - while consumer durables posted a fall of 12.5 per cent.
After a decade of high industrial growth, the recession is being attributed
to the macro-stabilisation programme stipulated by the IMF in July last
year, which forced India to cut back sharply on capital expenditure. This as
exacerbated by a credit squeeze and a high rate of inflation (currently 13
per cent) which reduced demand for industrial products.
Exports have been adversely affected by global recession and the
disintegration of the Soviet Union, with which India had a rupee trade
agreement.
Estimates show that industrial growth in the first two months (April and
May) of the current financial year remained sluggish at 0.6 per cent. A
growth rate of 5.9 per cent was recorded in the corresponding period of last
year.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE consumer confidence has been undermined by concerns about the
slowing economy and, in particular, a fall in new jobs, the Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) said yesterday.
The agency's consumer confidence index in the April-to-June quarter was down
0.4 to 42.3. That movement reinforced the recent judgment of the Bank of
Japan and the Ministry of Finance that consumers are unlikely to lead an
economic recovery in coming months.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said a sharp fall in new job offers
in recent months had increased pessimism. However, he said fears of a bad
debt crisis facing Japanese financial institutions were unfounded. Financial
institutions had co-operated in the past to overcome difficulties and 'such
co-operation will continue', he declared, adding that reserves would cushion
institutions against the increase in non-performing loans.
The EPA also released a separate survey suggesting that manufacturing
companies would continue to reduce capital spending by an average 2.8 per
cent over the second half of this year, compared to the first half.
The agency said the largest falls would be in precision machinery, down 14.8
per cent, electrical machinery, down 28.5 per cent, and non-ferrous metals,
down 37 per cent.
However, capital spending by non-manufacturing companies was expected to
rise by 6.5 per cent, with wholesalers, retailers and restaurants
forecasting a 28 per cent increase.
About 36 per cent of companies said the economy would continue to slow
during the second half, while only 3 per cent thought it would recover, the
EPA found.
The agency said 46 per cent of companies reported that the economic
conditions had deteriorated during the first half, while 1 per cent said
there was an improvement.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arkady Volsky, the powerful head of the Russian Union of Industrialists
and Entrepreneurs, said yesterday that reform in Russia was 'on the edge of
collapse', and called for immediate policy changes.
His call was backed by leaders of the Civic Union, the political bloc which
Mr Volsky helped form. They said that if the government did not adopt an
alternative reform programme to be presented in mid-September, President
Boris Yeltsin should ask for its resignation.
Mr Joseph Diskin, a member of the Civic Union's consultative council and the
author of the alternative programme, said there were no longer any 'good
options' left for the economy, and only the enforcement of order could
prevent catastrophe. Income tax should rise, fuel prices should be fixed,
and the government must ensure that the increasingly separatist regions of
Russia pay federal taxes - by force if necessary.
Mr Volsky is widely viewed as a prime minister-in-waiting, or at least as a
figure who can dictate policies to the government. His new, and more extreme
than before, attack on the government comes at a time when it has
substantially relaxed its grip over credits to enterprises. It is also
signalling that it may not be able to meet the targets of 9 per cent
inflation and a budget deficit at 5 per cent of GNP by the end of the year,
which it agreed with the International Monetary Fund in order to receive a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 523m) advance this month.
International experts in Moscow see these targets as unattainable.
At the same time, a struggle has broken out between the government and Mr
Victor Gerashchenko, acting chairman of the Central Bank, over Mr
Gerashchenko's intention to provide Rbs1,000bn in credits to enterprises to
help them pay off Rbs3,000bn of debts which they have contracted over the
past few months.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said yesterday he believed the
bank would soon cancel the order it sent out to commercial banks authorising
the provision of credit. He was immediately contradicted by Mr Gerashchenko,
who said in an interview with Izvestia that he had no such intention -
though he might 'take the government's views into account'.

MOURNERS at the funeral of the two children killed by snipers while being
evacuated by bus from Sarajevo fled in terror after two mortar bombs
exploded within 100 metres of the graves in what appeared to be a deliberate
attack, Reuter and our foreign staff report.
The grandmother of one of the children was wounded. Sarajevo's central Lion
Cemetery, where the burial took place, has been in the middle of heavy
fighting, but the proximity of the hits seemed to indicate the shelling was
intentional.
'My daughter is dead, and now they've injured my mother,' said Mrs Svetlana
Glavas, mother of one of the children, after her mother Ruza was wounded in
the arm by debris.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, accused Moslems of 'staging'
a mortar attack on the funeral of the two children, who were killed during
the evacuation of an orphanage at the weekend.
Elsewhere in the capital, shelling was reported in the Old Town and suburbs
in the west of the city.
Water supplies broke down again because of the fighting. Heavy artillery
could also be heard in the north-west of the city, where Bosnian territorial
forces are trying to break the grip of besieging Serbs. Four people were
killed and 20 wounded, the city's radio reported yesterday.
Meanwhile 30 young orphans, pictured left, reached Germany yesterday, after
an an Aeroflot AN-26 aircraft brought them to a Russian army air strip about
90km south-west of Berlin.
Two of the children were ill with dehydration and exhaustion and were taken
to hospital in Zerbst. The rest were taken to orphanages.

STATE-OWNED electricity companies in France and Italy have decided to
compromise over the terms of a contract with a small Alpine producer rather
than confront the European Commission on the sensitive issue of mono-poly
rights in the electricity sector.
The Commission announced yesterday that it had dropped the threat of further
action against Electricite de France and Enel of Italy after they amended
the anti-competitive contract.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, welcomed the compromise
as 'a step towards the opening up of national energy markets', but EdF said
it was a specific case with few broad implications.
EdF is in the forefront of resistance to Commission plans to break open EC
energy markets, a top priority for Britain during its presidency of the
Community.
Societe Hydroelectrique de Grangevieille (SHG) - an independent French
electricity producer near the Italian border - complained to Brussels in
April last year that EdF was abusing its monopoly rights.
Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday described the original contract with SHG as a
'no-win situation' for the independent French producer. EdF was entitled to
buy all SHG's output at comparatively low French prices, and sell it on to
Enel. But SHG is cut off from the French market by a large mountain range
and is only able to supply electricity to Italy, where prices are much
higher.
The Commission argued that EdF's monopoly rights to buy French electricity
production did not apply in this case. The French group has now agreed that
SHG's electricity should be priced on the same basis as electricity which is
generated by independent Italian producers.

FT  05 AUG 92 / EC to cost Sweden SKr3.4bn a year

MEMBERSHIP of the European Community will cost Sweden only SKr3.4bn (Pounds
330m) net a year, according to a Commission report issued yesterday.
Sweden's contribution would amount to 3.2 per cent of the EC's annual
spending.
Although Sweden will have to pay an estimated SKr10.8bn a year into the EC
budget, it can expect to receive SKr7.4bn in return in financial support,
particularly for its vulnerable agricultural industry. Between SKr4.4bn and
SKr5.2bn will be earmarked for supporting cereals, milk and dairy products,
lamb and mutton.
The report makes it clear that Swedish accession to the EC 'would represent
an important challenge for agriculture, resulting in lower prices, reduced
support level and increased competition'.
It noted, however, that Swedish cereals surpluses, which have been
eliminated under the reforms, could reappear as Sweden adopted EC farm
programmes.
The report also calculated that Sweden would benefit from an annual SKr1.5bn
in regional aid.
It suggests that the abolition of the state monopoly on the production of
spirits, the marketing and importing of all types of alcohol and export of
all spirits and strong beers would also be necessary as a condition of EC
membership. In the Commission's view, Sweden's state alcohol monopoly is the
'most worrying' because it conflicts with EC competition laws.

FT  05 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Company news undermines equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOMY reports from the corporate news front undermined the UK stock market
again yesterday, reversing an early gain and leaving share prices to react
sharply when Wall Street made a dull start to the new trading session. Pleas
from Britain's boardrooms for government action to stimulate the domestic
economy did little to help sentiment, and hopes for base rate cuts dimmed as
sterling failed to hold Monday's improvement.
Equities opened firmly on the back of stable performances in the New York
and Tokyo stock markets. But investment interest was lacking and it was
again left to the stock index futures to provide the lead for share prices.
An early rise of 14.6 on the FT-SE Index was soon challenged by a cautious
response, in the banking sector, to the disclosure by Royal Bank of Scotland
that it faces a substantial law suit, as well as provisions against property
losses. The market also responded coolly to the interim report from National
Westminster Bank, while the industrial share sectors featured a fall in TI
Group, also on half-time trading figures.
The stock market drifted back towards overnight levels but saw little
selling pressure. It was a fall of 15 Dow points in early trading on Wall
Street that took the heart out of London. UK share prices sagged in late
trading and the final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,407.5, the net fall
of 12.7 bringing the 2,400 mark into jeopardy yet again.
An increase in the day's Seaq volume total to 466.8m shares appeared to
reflect little more than the focus on trading news from a handful of leading
blue chip companies. Monday's Seaq total of 329.6m shares was worth a mere
Pounds 704.1m in retail business, an exceptionally low figure even by recent
standards and certainly well under levels regarded as profitable for the
securities industry.
National Westminster Bank and the Woolwich Equitable Building Society
followed Abbey National, Britain's second largest mortgage lender, in
calling for official moves to stimulate the UK housing market, which is seen
as the key to any recovery in consumer confidence. Such pleas have found a
ready reception at City brokerage houses; Mr Robin Aspinall of Panmure
Gordon commented that interest rates are 'so obviously' the appropriate
instrument to tackle the debt problem overhanging the UK economy.
The building and construction sectors, long identified as the chief
casualties of the implications of high domestic interest rates, came in for
renewed pressure yesterday. Even the international stocks, which have
benefited from their perceived status as 'safe havens' from the storm,
drifted as buyers showed no inclination to support current price levels.
Traders are waiting nervously for tomorrow's decision on the quarterly
dividend by the board of British Petroleum.
Among the few firm exceptions was the publishing sector, where the presence
of a few buyers proved enough to inspire substantial recoveries in the
leading names, which have suffered severely over the past three months.

FT  05 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTSIE futures surrendered Monday's gains in a volatile session as the
recent gloom in the markets caused by economic worries returned, writes Joel
Kibazo.
A firm opening at 2,455, after the previous day's strong close, appeared to
indicate another good session. However, within half-an-hour a retreat set in
and was indicative of the volatility and decline that was to come.
Having dipped to 2,445, September was then squeezed forward, reaching 2,458
by 10am. The renewed strength proved short-lived, however, as uncertainty
and worries about the economic outlook gained the upper hand, sending not
only the contract into retreat but also pulling the underlying cash market
down. A decline in gilts also affected sentiment.
Several attempts at a rally were noted in the September future, but the
contract eventually ended at 2,418, down 28 from its previous close and
around 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover came to 7,834 lots.
Traded options remained dull, with a majority of the day's total volume of
20,495 contracts seen in the index options. The FT-SE 100 option had 9,052
lots transacted.

FT  05 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bank hit by profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROFITS warning from Royal Bank of Scotland prompted the shares to fall
steeply on exceptionally heavy turnover. The slide was given further impetus
by the announcement of a law suit against the bank and savage profits
forecast cuts from many banking analysts. The shares ended 21 down at 153p
after 19m traded.
Observers had expected Royal Bank's provision for bad debts to be below last
year's Pounds 351m and were shocked by the announcement that it would be
worse. As a result, forecasts for the year ending in September were scaled
right back, with Smith New Court, believed to be the most bearish, coming
down to Pounds 57m from Pounds 107m. Smith has been negative on the stock
since last November, and in spite of yesterday's sharp slide, refused to
consider the shares worth buying.
The law suit involves a Pounds 418m claim by Wallace Smith Trust, a small
London bank whose chairman was arrested for alleged fraud. Wallace Smith
went into liquidation last year and alleges that cash was transferred by
Royal Bank without authority to a related company's account. National
Westminster, which is being sued for Pounds 71m, lost 4 to 320p.
Builders weak
Building issues suffered as a combination of government statistics, industry
reaction and brokers' gloomy reports dragged the market down. Early trading
was dominated by a mostly sceptical response to the Abbey National housing
market rescue plan, which was viewed as a desperate attempt to alleviate a
dire situation.
The arrival of official figures showing housing starts for the three months
to the end of June down 8 per cent from the previous quarter, added to the
negative feeling. As if this were not enough, BZW and County NatWest weighed
in with further summaries of the gloomy outlook.
In a predictably weak building materials sector, Blue Circle dropped 10 to
181p, Marley 7 to 78p, RMC 11 to 479p and Redland 14 to 445p. Among
contractors, Amec fell 7 to 85p, John Mowlem 6 to 75p, Persimmon 6 to 184p
and George Wimpey 5 to 100p. Spring Ram was undone by an agency cross,
thought to be by Albert E. Sharpe, of 2.9m at 105p, which is where the
shares finished with a day's fall of 10. Turnover was a hefty 8.9m.
BP dividend fears
Concern about the forthcoming second quarter results from British Petroleum,
and specifically a fear that the oil group may cut the dividend, continued
to overhang the shares, which slipped a further 1 1/2 to 211p. Turnover was
heavy at 8.6m. Strauss Turnbull's Mr John Toalster, the long-standing
superbear of BP shares, said there was a two-way pull between gloomy UK
pundits and more optimistic analysts in the US.
He added: 'The US now holds about 16.2 per cent of BP compared with 7.1 per
cent last year, and US forecasts for the extent of a dividend cut range from
zero to 25 per cent. In the UK, the estimates are of a 40 to 50 per cent
cut.' Mr Toalster forecasts a halving of the second quarter dividend to
around 2.1p and a subsequent slide in the share price to between 160p and
180p.
TI upset
The spate of negative corporate news continues to undermine equities and,
yesterday, engineering company TI Group fell sharply after analysts decided
that the effect of the recession on year-end profits was likely to be
greater than originally anticipated.
The shares at first registered only a modest decline to 312p after the
company revealed a 7 per cent setback in interim profits to Pounds 50.2m,
slightly below market expectations. The slide started after the analysts
meeting, when most concluded that full-year forecasts were too high because
of the continuing recession in the UK, and many quickly moved to downgrade
predictions for the current and following year.
Sentiment was further weakened by worries about the trading prospects of
Dowty, the aerospace company acquired by TI nearly two months ago. There was
talk in the market that the rationalisation costs for the Dowty acquisition
were likely to reach Pounds 70m. By the close, TI had tumbled 31 to 283p as
turnover reached 4.2m.
An announcement by Reckitt &amp; Colman that it would take an exceptional charge
of Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m) in its 1992 first-half results due to its
withdrawal from the US spice market was behind a fall of 10 to 580p in the
shares. However, an analyst argued that, because Reckitt concentrates on
cash flow rather than the balance sheet, the sentiment was misplaced.
Water shares extended their impressive recovery from last week's losses,
although one broker warned that it might be short-lived. North West rose 7
to 421p, Southern 8 to 392p and Yorkshire 9 to 443p. Ms Rachel Lucas at
County NatWest warned that the sector was starting to look expensive against
other utilities, in particular the regional electricity companies (Recs) and
that some switching could soon occur. A positive analysis on the Recs from
Smith New Court forecast continued strong earnings. Among others, Smith
likes Norweb, ahead 5 at 331p, and Southern, 6 stronger at 293p.
Hints from Yorkshire Chemicals that some of its markets were under pressure
sent the shares down 28 to 290p.
Publishers Pearson and Reed International stood out against a weak market as
the shares recovered from underperformance in the past quarter. Pearson
gained 10 to 337p and Reed was up 9 at 499p.
Bowater also recovered from recent underperformance and closed 12 up at
738p. Carlton Communications dipped 4 to 560p, held back by an agency cross
of 1.4m shares at 555p. WH Smith rose 8 to 396p as Kleinwort Benson moved
from a hold to a buy stance.
Press reports on the dire state of the London hotel market sent Forte down 8
to 149p, and also dragged Ladbroke back 7 to 170p.
Continued worries about the future of The European Fighter project (EFA)
unsettled British Aerospace, the UK's lead contractor on the project. The
shares lost 7 to 211p.
A firm motor components sector helped Lucas Industries put on 5 to 110p.
Broker Henderson Crosthwaite yesterday issued a note putting the company's
break-up value at 235p a share. Firm motors also helped Laird Group, up 7 at
270p.

FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Spanish building stocks feel the pinch
 -Government efforts to rein in spending are bad news for the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Between 1987 and 1990, shares in Spain's big construction companies were
probably the best measure of the country's unprecedented economic boom. They
are now a chillingly accurate barometer of the economy's rapid decline.
Since the beginning of the year, shares in most of Spain's 'Big Seven'
quoted constructors - Dragados, FCC, Cubiertas, Huarte, Ocisa, Agroman and
Lain - have fallen more than 50 per cent as it becomes clear that annual
Spanish growth rates of 5 per cent or more are a thing of the past. Gross
domestic product will, if the government is lucky, grow at 2 per cent this
year and 1.5 per cent in 1993.
In a relatively poor country such as Spain, any increase in economic
activity includes, almost by definition, the building of a road, a factory
or an office block. For the most part, the state has been the biggest
builder during the past six years, and it has also ensured that Spanish
contractors have the lion's share of the work. As the government puts the
brakes on new public projects, the danger of depending on the same
institution for both business and protection has become manifest.
In an effort to control public spending, the government has been forced to
announce tax increases and budget cuts for this year to save about Dollars
3.2bn. Interest rates have been raised and next year's budget, due to be
presented in the autumn, will allow spending growth of around 8 per cent,
the lowest in nearly 10 years. Most of that growth will probably be
concentrated on social services, not infrastructure.
Spanish equity analysts desperately hope that a 'yes' vote in the French
referendum on Maastricht will restore some confidence in their market. But
the current Spanish malaise may be beyond the power of French voters to
influence. In spite of determined declarations by the government to rein in
public spending in order to converge the Spanish economy with the rest of
the European Community, it has also been determined in the past but has
failed to do so.
Spending by regional governments and town halls, not affected by last
month's fiscal package, is hard to control. The government has admitted that
their spending was Dollars 3bn higher than thought in 1991 and has adjusted
its calculation of the overall government deficit for last year from 4.4 per
cent of GDP to 4.95 per cent.
Elections due to be held next year may mean that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
prime minister, will have to form a coalition with the Catalan nationalist
government and this would make it even more difficult to control regional
spending.
This is bad news for the construction sector. The government is already
delaying payments for completed work, and by the end of June it owed
constructors about Dollars 8bn. Dozens of sub-contractors have been put out
of business and share prices in cement companies have fallen sharply.
Fortunately for the construction companies, 1991 was a fat year as the
country rushed to complete building for the Seville Expo and the Barcelona
Olympics.
Investment in public works, however, is down almost 50 per cent so far this
year and the private housing market has come to a virtual standstill. 1992
started out appearing to be a temporary setback for construction companies
but it now looks like the beginning of a long haul.
Mr Paul Farrow, an analyst at brokers FG in Madrid, says: 'The economy could
go through two to three years of low growth, and for the constructors, size
will be a determining factor. The big ones are better placed to ride out the
problems.'
Although FG is forecasting no change in dividend policy from the big quoted
Spanish constructors - except, perhaps, at Agroman, which has borrowed
heavily - it is predicting a decline of around 9 per cent in net profits and
a 10 per cent fall in cash flow, for the sector this year.
It is hard not to sympathise with Spanish brokers, who have been declaring
through much of this year that the end of the market's slide has arrived. In
May, with the Madrid general index at around 270, a bottoming out was
confidently announced. By this week, though, the index was nodding along at
216 with still no end to its fall in sight.
Foreigners have deserted Spanish equities in droves, and attractive
valuations are not enough to lure them back. While the government struggles
to get its spending under control what matters most is whether investors
believe it can be done.

FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities retreat on
sporadic profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets snapped a five-day winning streak yesterday as prices
tended to ease amid occasional profit-taking, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.08 down at 3,384.32. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 lost only 0.73 at 424.36, while the Nasdaq composite shed 1.04
to 581.32. Turnover on the New York SE was again light, at 167m shares.
After five days in which the Dow had added more than 110 points, yesterday's
mild correction was not unexpected. In the absence of important economic
news (the day's only data, a 0.2 per cent decline in July leading economic
indicators, was in line with expectations), and with no lead from the bond
market, share prices turned softer on a lack of buying and sporadic
profit-taking.
Trading was also subdued by a reluctance among investors to take large
positions ahead of Friday's employment report for July, which should give
the latest reading on the conditions in the job market and which might, if
sufficiently weak, produce another easing of monetary policy by the Federal
Reserve. Analysts are expecting the job figures to show a 110,000 rise in
non-farm payrolls and a slight decline in national unemployment to 7.7 per
cent.
Monsanto jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 in turnover of 1.5m shares
after announcing the sale of its Fisher Control International unit to
electronic products group Emerson Electric in a deal valued at Dollars
1.275bn. After the announcement, broking house Kidder Peabody upgraded its
rating on Monsanto from 'hold' to 'buy'. The news of the deal left Emerson
Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 50.
Harris Corp rose Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 on fiscal fourth-quarter
net income from continuing operations of 87 cents a share, up from the 69
cents earned at the same stage a year ago. Thiokol was also boosted by
higher quarterly earnings, putting on Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 .
Going the other way on quarterly figures was Houston Industries, down
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 46 1/8 on news of the 60 cents a share earned during
the April-June period, down slightly from a year earlier.
Bethlehem Steel was one of the most active stocks, dipping Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 13 3/8 in turnover of 1.9m shares after the steel group's 12m-share
stock offering began trading yesterday.
On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4
after posting a second quarter loss of 34 cents a share, against a 6 cents a
share shortfall a year ago. Scios lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 after
analysts warned that drug group Pfizer may not pursue its collaboration with
Scios on a diabetes drug after the end of the year.
Canada
TORONTO share prices spent a quiet session in negative territory. The TSE
300 index retreated 17.4 to 3,426.0 and losing issues led gains by 292 to
211 after volume of 18.5m shares. The market was closed on Monday for a
holiday.
The gold shares group posted the day's largest fall, losing 2.36 per cent.
The New York gold price, although slightly higher yesterday, fell nearly
USDollars 5 an ounce on Monday.
Canadian Pacific reported lower second quarter earnings, and a six-month
loss compared to year-earlier net income, but gained CDollars  1/4 to
CDollars 17 1/2 .
Canfor, up CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 28, announced a significant reduction
in its second quarter and six-month losses.
Mitel shot to the top of the actives list, with the shares climbing to a
52-week high of CDollars 2.72 before ending 9 cents up at CDollars 2.56 on
volume of 856,000 shares. The company released its earnings for the first
quarter shortly after the close.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling dips on new rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING lost ground against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday
as dealers grew more nervous that the Bundesbank will raise rates at its
council meeting tomorrow, writes James Blitz.
There are plenty of reasons to believe that the Bundesbank will not raise
the Lombard rate tomorrow. Germany's central bank needs more time to gauge
the effects of the recent discount rate rise on money supply before making a
decision to tighten further. Moreover, the Bundesbank would probably want to
wait until France votes in its referendum on the Maastricht treaty on
September 20, for fear of exacerbating the 'No' vote there.
However, one London dealer said the market engaged in short-covering of
D-Mark positions yesterday 'just in case'. Another factor unnerving the
markets is today's Paris Match poll on how the French will vote in their
referendum. One London trader talked of fears that the poll, due out at 1400
GMT today, will be close, or even show the 'No' voters in the lead.
The pound may also have been weakened by increasing calls from British
political and business figures for emergency action to stimulate the housing
market. The growing argument for a temporary cut in VAT to try and boost the
economy has unnerved some traders, who fear this will lead to a worsening
trade balance. They believe that consumers will purchase more goods from
abroad at reduced VAT rates rather than British ones.
Sterling, therefore, declined to DM2.8350 from a previous close of DM2.8400.
In late New York trading it was down further to DM2.8325.
The Italian lira came under renewed pressure from fears over European union.
Compounding this was the Bank of Italy's decision to cut  1/2 percentage
point off its discount rate on Monday night, bringing the cost of one-month
lira cash down by 1 3/8 percentage points to 13 1/2 per cent.
However, the Italian central bank doubtless calculated that the market feels
well disposed towards Mr Giuliano's Amato's government after the
ratification of his plans to reduce the budget deficit. The lira closed
against the D-Mark at L755.9, after a previous L755.5.
The dollar was sidelined in Europe yesterday, trading within a tight range
between DM1.4730 and DM1.4789. The currency drifted lower after the US index
of leading indicators, the government's chief economic forecasting gauge,
weakened in June for the first time in six months. It fell 0.2 per cent, in
line with economists' forecasts.
The US currency finished against the D-Mark in London at DM1.4750, down
slightly from a previous close of DM1.4760. In New York the dollar showed
some improvement to finish at DM1.4772.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures drop further
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures again performed bearishly as the pound showed renewed
weakness against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
After opening at 89.69, the September short sterling contract dipped 6 basis
points in the morning, shadowing the pound's drop to a low of DM2.8350 in
European trading. In the late afternoon, the contract declined even further,
to close at 89.61, as sterling weakened to DM2.8325 in New York.
The December short sterling contract, after opening at 89.81,slipped a net
six basis points to a low of 89.74 in the morning. By the close, it had
rallied slightly to 89.75.
Dealers again had mixed views about the extent of the bearishness. One
clearing bank dealer said the fall in the September contract was
insignificant, considering the low volume of trading.
A commercial bank dealer, however, said the bearish mood had been underlined
by uncertainty over sterling's position in the European exchange rate
mechanism and a call by the chairman of Abbey National, the British mortgage
lender and retail banking group, for the government to give tax relief to
people who sell houses at a loss.
Rates in the sterling cash market were slightly softer after the Bank of
England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 300m. The fall in short-dated
money fed through to the longer dates.
For most of the day, one-month money was offered at 10 1/8 per cent, after a
previous close of 10 3/16 per cent, and three-month money was down to 10 3/8
per cent from 10 7/16 per cent. But the three-month offered rate tightened
to 10 5/16 per cent in the late evening as sterling fell in New York.
In its discount market operation, the Bank of England dealt in only Band 2
bank bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. In the morning it
purchased Pounds 10m and in the afternoon Pounds 11m. There was late
assistance of Pounds 220m.
Eurolira futures rallied significantly yesterday after the Bank of Italy cut
its official discount rate by  1/2 percentage point to 13.25 per cent on
Monday night. The September Eurolira contract opened at 85.66, up 19 basis
points from its previous close, and then climbed to finish at 85.93 for a
day's rise of 46 basis points.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK aluminium can recycling rate
increases to 16 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM CAN recycling rates in the UK increased sharply in the first
quarter of this year, from 11 per cent to about 16 per cent, according to
the Aluminium Can Recycling Association.
The industry expects the pace of improvement to continue because the last of
seven regional centres planned for the UK, where scrap merchants and other
collectors are able to exchange cans for cash, opened for business this
week.
The new infrastructure was needed to feed a Pounds 28m dedicated aluminium
can recycling facility at Warrington, in the north of England, established
last year by Alcan of Canada - the first of its kind in Europe.
In the whole of last year Warrington processed 2,180 tonnes of used cans
among other aluminium scrap collected by Alcan.
The dedicated, which started up in October and ultimately will be able to
process 50,000 tonnes of used cans, already has handled 2,259 tonnes of
recycled cans from the UK in the first half of this year. The rest of its
feedstock is imported, mainly from the US.
The UK's seven new regional 'aggregation centres' enable merchants to take
250 kg loads of used cans to collection points close by instead of having to
deliver to Warrington or to the Swansea collection centre operated by the
Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa). Merchants get the same 'factory gate'
price as paid at the Warrington facility and receive their cash seven to 10
days after delivery.
Acra suggests this should enable more of the UK's used aluminium cans to be
drawn into a 'closed loop' system where the special alloy used for
can-making is used over and over again for cans instead of being downgraded
and used in other products.
The European aluminium industry has set itself a target of recycling 50 per
cent of all aluminium cans by the mid-1990s. Acra says that in those areas
of the UK where extra promotional effort has been made - such as Warrington
and Swansea - recycling rates have been above 40 per cent.
Last year about 21 per cent of all aluminium cans consumed in Europe were
recycled, twice the percentage in 1987. Sweden, which has a mandatory
deposit scheme on cans, had the highest recycling rate, 85 per cent,
followed by Iceland, 75 per cent, and Switzerland, 50 per cent.
Remelt plants for used aluminium cans are operated by Granges in Sweden
(15,000 tonnes a year); VAW in Germany (20,000 tonnes); Elval in Greece; and
Alcan in Italy. Reynolds is bringing a 60,000 tonne-a-year unit into
production at Venafro, Italy, where one of the lines will process cans.
Pechiney is investing in two units, at Neuf-Brisach and at Nogueres with an
annual capacity of 15,000 tonnes each.
About 32,350 tonnes of aluminium cans were recycled in Europe last year (up
from 25,000 tonnes in 1990) and so the industry is putting plenty of
capacity in place for the expected recycling growth.
Efforts to promote that growth and to provide the necessary infrastructure
are being co-ordinated by Acre (Aluminium Can Recycling Europe) formed in
1984 by Alcan, Pechiney of France and VAW of Germany. Alcoa and Reynolds of
the US, joined in 1988, as Alusuisse-Lonza, Hydro Aluminium and Elval agreed
to provide support in their domestic markets.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amoco signs Romanian oil and
gas exploration deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AMOCO OF the US has signed a 25-year oil and gas exploration and
production-sharing agreement with Rompetrol, Romania's state oil company, as
part of the country's first post-communist exploration deal, the companies
announced in Bucharest yesterday.
The agreement gives Amoco Romania Petroleum, a subsidiary of Amoco
Production Company, rights to a 750 sq km (290 sq miles) area in the
Carpathian Mountains about 60 km (37 miles) north-east of Bucharest, which
Amoco won after an international tender in September 1990.
A Canadian Occidental/Enterprise Oil combine, which won two offshore sites
in the Black Sea and, Shell, which successfully bid for an area in
Transylvania, are due to sign similar contracts within the next 10 days. The
western companies are expected to invest about Dollars 90m in the next three
years as part of an initial five-year exploration period.
However, Rompetrol said developing the sites in the event of commercial
finds could could cost more than Dollars 2.4bn.
Rompetrol retains the right to acquire up to 20 per cent in any development,
with the western companies, which have received substantial tax concessions
from the Romanian government, free to export their share of production.
Mr David Work, vice-president of Amoco Production, said the agreement was
consistent with the company's strategy of investing in areas with known
hydrocarbon potential.
The deal, which was held up for several months until the Romanian parliament
passed enabling legislation, is Amoco's first exploration agreement in
central Europe.
Existing wells in Romania, historically one of central Europe's major
oil-producing areas, were heavily exploited under the Ceausescu regime.
However, the dictator's obsession with paying off the national debt kept the
Romanian oil industry short of funds for further exploration, contributing
to a drop in domestic crude oil production from more than 12m tonnes in 1979
to 6.8m tonnes last year.
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil producer, said yesterday
its Snorre oil and gas field had come on stream six weeks earlier than
planned and NKr1.5bn (Pounds 135m) below budget at a cost of NKr16.6bn,
writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Recoverable oil reserves are put at 770m
barrels. Production will be gradually built up beyond 100,000 barrels a day
by the end of the year, by which time production from a seabed installation
will have come on stream, allowing production capacity of 190,000 b/d to be
reached early next year.
Snorre is providing Saga's first production from a field that it operates.
It has been developed with the Norwegian North Sea's first tension leg
platform, the biggest of its kind in the world. Oil and gas is processed at
the nearby Statfjord field, with oil tanker loaded and gas exported further
via the Statpipe line to the European continent.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Italian bonds rally strongly after rate
cut
</HEADLINE>

ITALIAN government bonds rallied strongly in the wake of the Bank of Italy's
discount rate cut, continuing Monday's rise in the market.
The announcement on Monday evening of a half point cut in the official
discount rate - from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent - took the financial
markets by surprise, and when the Italian government bond market opened
yesterday, bond prices surged half a point.
The Italian bond futures contract, which closed at 93.59 on Monday, reached
a high of 94.85 yesterday before profit-taking wiped out some of the gains.
By late afternoon the futures contract traded at 94.18.
Mr Franco Reviglio, the Italian budget minister, told Italian radio that
further interest rate cuts would be possible in the next few weeks if Italy
manages to restore its credibility in international eyes.
The Bank of Italy cut its official discount rate to 13.25 per cent following
the agreement at the weekend to abolish inflation-linked wage indexation.
Elsewhere in Europe, many of the bond markets are waiting for today's
opinion poll in France on the Maastricht Treaty. The most recent poll showed
57 per cent of French voters backing the ratification of the treaty, a
result which boosted French government bond prices by up to half a point on
Monday. Yesterday, French bonds ended the day slightly lower or little
changed, with the Matif futures contract slipping from 105.46 to 105.38 by
late afternoon.
UK government bonds fell on the combination of new supply in the sterling
bond market, speculation that a big US investor was selling gilts and
sterling weakness.
Volume in the Liffe futures contract was relatively high at 34,000
contracts. The contract fell from 97.11 to 96.29 while in the cash market
the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 dropped from 103 5/32 to 102 27/32 to yield
9.30 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds ended little changed in dull trading, with many
investors waiting on the sidelines for Thursday's Bundesbank Council
meeting.
The Liffe bund futures contract moved in a range of 86.78 to 87.06 and by
late afternoon it was trading at 86.96, slightly higher than Monday's close
of 86.93.
Dealers reported only faint interest in the German Bundespost 10-year bond
issue yesterday, when DM3bn of the 8 1/4 per cent bonds were priced at
100.30 to yield 8.2 per cent.
The federal bond consortium met yesterday to negotiate the terms, and
dealers expect a further DM2bn to be auctioned today. However, traders noted
only weak demand from domestic investors for 10-year issues.
US Treasury prices firmed yesterday as investors traded cautiously before
today's announcement of the government's quarterly refunding programme and
Friday's key jobs data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 106
25/32 , yielding 7.422 per cent. The two-year note was up  3/16 at 99 29/32
, to carry a yield of 4.283 per cent.
The market expects the Treasury to unveil a Dollars 36bn refunding package
today, probably consisting of Dollars 15bn of three-year notes, Dollars 11bn
of 10-year notes and Dollars 10bn of 30-year bonds. With the wait for
refunding details and the eager anticipation of Friday's employment report
for July, many investors initially held their fire yesterday, although by
mid-afternoon activity, which had been limited mostly to technical
manoeuvring by professional traders and some sporadic speculative buying
early on, included active buying by retail interests.
The day's only economic data, the 0.2 per cent decline in the index of
economic indicators for June, was in line with expectations and had no
impact on a subdued market.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher on the day, buoyed by firm domestic
demand.
The September futures contract moved in a relatively wide range - from
104.59 to 105.05 - and closed at 105.02 in Tokyo, against its opening level
of 104.64. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at
4.98 per cent and moved to 4.92 per cent in London trading.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu to end chip production
at US plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese computermaker, is to end production immediately at its
semiconductor plant in San Diego as part of a reorganisation of the
company's chip production.
The decision, which could stir criticism in the US, reflects the financial
pressure on electronics companies, particularly those determined to stay in
the semiconductor race.
It is also a sign of a general restructuring now taking place within the
Japanese electronics industry.
About 260 workers are employed at the California plant, which assembled
1-megabit dynamic random access memory (D-ram) chips, and is one of two
Fujitsu semiconductor plants in North America. The chips, produced for sale
on the open market, are used in computers and telecommunications equipment.
The memory chip market has suffered over-production, leading to large price
falls. The 1-megabit D-ram market is particularly oversupplied and
increasingly dominated by South Korean suppliers.
The trend among Japanese semiconductor suppliers has been to enter markets
for the most advanced products at an early stage when margins are higher.
Fujitsu has not been successful in the memory chip market generally, where
it has failed to be an innovator.
The group has invested heavily in a recently-opened UK plant making
4-megabit D-rams.
However this has been incurring losses because demand has fallen short of
expected levels. Fujitsu's difficulties in the semiconductor market led it
recently to dismiss the heads of its European and North American
semiconductor operations.
Referring to the latest US move, Fujitsu said last night: 'We have to close
the plant because of profitability and competitiveness problems. We all know
that the profitability of the semiconductor industry is not so good. The
weak Japanese economy is a reason, but that is not the only reason for the
closure.'
Fujitsu reported a 68 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to
March, while other Japanese chipmakers announced profit falls of 40 per cent
and more, due to the weak memory markets.
These companies are reviewing their chip production and their role in the
crowded consumer electronics markets. They have sought to reduce development
costs through partnerships with US and European makers.
It is likely some of the San Diego operations will be transferred to a
Fujitsu facility in Malaysia, where production costs are lower.
The US facility, opened in 1980, assembled about 800,000 memory chips out of
a total of 5m produced monthly by Fujitsu.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Medal-winning run for Wall
Street - Patrick Harverson assesses the performance of US securities houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE US securities business was an Olympic sport, Wall Street's
performance in the second quarter would warrant a silver-medal.
A good showing, but not quite up to the sparkling gold-medal display of the
first quarter, when almost every major securities house reported record
profits in the wake of booming stock prices and huge demand from
corporations for securities underwriting services.
Not that anyone is complaining. At most firms, profits, revenues and
return-on-equity ratios were higher than in the second quarter of 1991,
while cost-containment measures introduced at the start of the decade
continued to pay off.
Total expenses, however, actually rose during the three months because of
higher performance-related compensation, itself evidence of buoyant market
conditions.
The favourable interest rate environment continued to be the key factor in
Wall Street's success. The record first quarter drew its strength from the
big cut in interest rates at the end of December.
After rates came down, investors flooded out of low-yielding, short-term
financial assets, such as bank certificates of deposit and money market
funds, and into stocks and bonds as investors went in search of higher
yields.
Although the Federal Reserve did not engineer a major cut in interest rates
during the second quarter of this year, there was sufficient follow-through
from the December policy ease to ensure that large amounts of money
continued to flow into equities between April and June.
The latest figures for net inflows to stock funds (which does not account
for direct investing in the market) show that more than Dollars 19bn was
invested in funds in the second quarter, down slightly from first-quarter
levels.
Those securities firms with a strong presence in the retail stockbroking
market - notably Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman Brothers and PaineWebber -
benefited most from continued high levels of individual investor interest in
the stock markets in the form of strong broking commissions.
At the same time, low interest rates have spurred Corporate America, eager
to take advantage of cheap credit, into a flurry of debt and equity issues.
This sent revenues at securities houses with big underwriting books through
the roof. In the second quarter, companies raised a record Dollars 116bn
through stock and bond sales, although there was a modest decline in the
most profitable line of business - initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock
 -which hit firms, such as Alex Brown, which rely more on IPO revenues.
Low interest rates also benefited Wall Street firms in other ways. With a
low cost of borrowing, firms have put their cheap capital to effective use
in the markets, especially in exploiting arbitrage opportunities.
Low rates have also helped keep stock markets relatively buoyant despite a
hostile economic and political environment, thus maintaining the value of
firms' securities holdings.
Also, the big gap between low short-term rates and high long-term rates
enabled firms to borrow short, lend or buy long and enjoy the wide profit
margin in between.
The undoubted star of the second quarter was Salomon in the clearest sign
yet that the giant securities house has recovered from the debilitating
effects of last year's scandal involving its illegal activities in the
Treasury markets.
Salomon posted a Dollars 647m pre-tax operating profit, the largest
three-monthly profit ever recorded by a publicly-traded securities firm.
As always, the bulk of Salomon's earnings came from proprietary trading
activities, and the firm was reportedly helped by a big derivatives-related
windfall at its foreign operations during the quarter.
The one area that is still feeling the impact of the scandal, however, is
investment banking, where revenues fell 16 per cent during the quarter
despite strong demand on Wall Street for bond underwriting, a Salomon
speciality.
There was no holding back investment banking revenues at Merrill Lynch, the
league leader in securities underwriting.
Merrill's investment banking division earned a record Dollars 399m from
selling stock and bonds and from an increase in mergers and acquisitions
activity (M&amp;A). The rebound in M&amp;A at Merrill, and at other firms, suggests
this long-dormant part of Wall Street's repertoire is finally coming back to
life.
Shearson Lehman, the second-largest US broking firm, also had a solid
quarter, with profits rising 37 per cent to Dollars 163m. The earnings
picture at Shearson was similar to other firms - strong proprietary trading
and investment banking revenues offsetting flat or lower stockbroking
commissions and slower IPO business.
Despite the good times, Wall Street has been cautious about boosting its
payrolls. Management is sticking with the more cost-conscious approach
adopted soon after firms realised that over-spending had eaten dramatically
into dwindling profits during the late 1980s.
Those that did take on more staff were mostly retail houses looking to boost
their broking muscle. PaineWebber was one of the biggest hirers. By the end
of the quarter the firm had 350 more brokers than a year earlier, taking the
total to 4,900.
While no one is expecting Wall Street to repeat its stunning first-quarter
performance during the second half of the year, the July reduction in
interest rates, plus recent gains in equity prices, suggest that the third
quarter should see healthy earnings at most firms.
The only real cloud on the horizon is the IPO market, which for the past few
months has been showing signs of distress.
Investors have become more choosy, and market conditions less favourable
(too many IPOs are trading below their issue price to make potential
investors comfortable). A host of planned flotations has been cancelled or
abandoned in recent months, including, last week, a Dollars 380m offer by
cosmetics giant Revlon.

takeover

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of the Maxwell Communication
Corporation (MCC) that discovered a majority of its shares were pledged
improperly last year to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
said last night it was talks with bidders interested in a possible takeover.
The Princeton-based Berlitz also unveiled its second-quarter net profit of
Dollars 2.9m, down from Dollars 5.9m in the same period of last year.
Revenues in the quarter were Dollars 72.6m, up from Dollars 66m a year ago.
For the first six months of 1992, Berlitz made Dollars 7.3m net income, down
from Dollars 11.8m in the first half of 1991. Revenues for the first half of
1992 were 7.8 per cent improved at Dollars 140.9m.
MCC is currently operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law in a
complex trans-Atlantic arrangement that requires co-ordination between New
York and UK court-appointed adminis-trators.
At present, most of the 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake that was nominally owned
by Macmillan - the US publisher that was itself owned by MCC - is actually
in the hands of five banks and companies that received the stock as
collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Berlitz, however, said it no longer
considered itself to be part of MCC.
Berlitz said it had retained Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to advise it on a
possible merger, but the company stressed no agreement had yet been reached.
The news nonetheless cheered Wall Street, which marked the Berlitz share
price up by Dollars 1 1/2 , to Dollars 21, a 52-week high.

CIBA-GEIGY, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, has bought
Rhone-Poulenc of France's high-performance polymers operations, writes Paul
Abrahams in London. No financial details were given.
The sale is the latest of a series of disposals by the French company, which
is aiming to refocus its business, reducing its debt to equity ratio from
0.8 in 1991 to 0.5 next year. In June, Rhone-Poulenc sold its 50-50
polychloroprene rubber joint-venture with British Petroleum to Enichem of
Italy for an estimated FFr450m (Dollars 88.23m).
The high-performance polymers operations are expected to generate sales of
about FFr80m this year. The technology is used to make printed circuit
boards for the electronics industry and structural parts resistant to high
temperature in jet engines.
Ciba-Geigy will market the products worldwide, and will use the French
company's production facilities until its own have been completed. A number
of specialists will transfer to the Swiss group.

Yves Saint Laurent, one of the leading French fashion houses, countered
lacklustre sales in the US and Europe with a strong performance in the
Middle East and Latin America to increase turnover by 7 per cent to
FFr1.39bn in the first half of this year, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
YSL has been clouded by controversy because of the internal rows over the
decision of Mr Pierre Berge, chairman, to launch the first ready-to-wear
fashion collection, of Mr Robert Merloz, his young friend. It was affected
last year by the impact of the Gulf war on sales in the important duty free
sector.
Duty free sales have recovered this year and the company benefitted from the
contribution of its first skincare range, which made sales of FFr87m in its
first three months on the market compared to a first year target of FFr140m.
The group saw its turnover from fashion, which includes the YSL haute
couture collection as well as the ready-to-wear ranges, rise by nearly 1 per
cent to FFr258.3m in the six months to June 30.
Sales of perfumes rose faster, by 8.2 per cent, thanks to the recovery in
the duty free market, to FFr1.13bn.

Mayne Nickless, the Australian-based international transport group, is
expanding further into Europe with the purchase of Centropa, a distribution
company with operations in the Netherlands and Belgium, writes Bruce Jacques
in Sydney.
Mr Bill Blytheway, Mayne Nickless managing director, said the acquisition,
combined with the group's existing Heijden Transport business in the
Netherlands, would make it a leading food distributor in the Benelux region.
Centropa group had revenues of more than ADollars 43m last year.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Employers offered training cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUILDING industry trade association seeking to avert skills shortages is
offering employers subsidies of more than Pounds 1,000 for each trainee they
recruit.
The Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association, which organises
training in its industry, is offering employers who are not members of its
association a one-off grant of Pounds 300 and payment of two years' training
fees, at Pounds 375 a year, in return for taking on a trainee funded by the
Youth Training scheme.
The HVCA is offering the same incentives for its 1,200 member companies,
with the one-off grant increased to Pounds 400.
It said it had more than adequate funds for the scheme - the more employers
who wanted to take up the offer, the better for the industry.
The incentive is one of the most radical by an employers' organisation at a
time when employers generally have cut the number of training places for
young people. That has put a strain on the YT scheme, under which companies
take on young trainees.
One of the main reasons that Training and Enterprise Councils - which
administer the YT scheme in England and Wales - have found it difficult to
uphold the government's guarantee of a training place for all young people
who want one has been a shortage of places with employers.
There has been a sharp reduction in training places in the heating and
ventilation industry - in the 12 months to July there were about 3,000 craft
and technician trainees; This September the new intake is projected to be
about 1,200.
Mr John Clarke of the association said: 'If we do not continue to train now,
there will be a very severe skills shortage when the recession ends.
Companies will then have to pay over the odds for staff and that will be
reflected in contract prices.'
He said most employers in the industry employed about 10 people and
companies were finding it difficult to keep on adult staff, with little left
over to recruit apprentices.
Mr Clarke said at least two colleges in London had stopped offering courses
for the industry and he feared more might close. Cuts in training by
employers were said yesterday to be one of the reasons for a fall in the
number of young people leaving YT with qualifications.
Youthaid, a charity concerned with young people in the labour market, said a
survey showed that the proportion of young people leaving YT with
qualifications fell from 38 per cent in the 12 months to March 1991 to 35
per cent in the 12 months to July 1991.
The survey also showed the unemployment rate for young people leaving YT
rising from 20 per cent in the 12 months to March 1991 to 23 per cent in the
same period to July 1991.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Gas-fired stations win approval
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday gave planning consent for two
gas-fired power stations - at Shoreham, West Sussex, and Stallingborough,
Humberside.
These are the first consents for large power stations to be granted since
February, when Thames Power, the independent electricity generator, won
consent for a 1,000MW station on the Thames at Barking.
The DTI dismissed speculation that there had been any deliberate policy of
holding back consents because of fears that many of the new gas-fired
stations will be redundant.
Hydro-Electric, the integrated electricity company, has started burning
cheap North Sea gas at its Peterhead power station in Aberdeenshire.
The gas, from BP's Miller field, will replace oil and should add Pounds 6m
to the company's bottom line.
The backbone of an important new natural gas transmission system in the
North Sea was completed yesterday.
The 255-mile Central Area Transmission System pipeline will carry up to
1.4bn cubic feet of gas a day from the central North Sea to north-east
England.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Satellite project by ITV seen as 'spoiler'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS have been cast on how serious the ITV companies are about launching a
satellite television service, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Memos of a meeting attended by the main potential backers of the venture
said it 'could not in any circumstances become a money spinner'.
The project appears designed more as a spoiler of UK Gold, the Thames-BBC
venture which plans to launch in the autumn based on the broadcasters'
programme archives.
At the end of last month senior ITV executives said there was serious
interest in at least one channel using ITV library programmes.
The ITV 2 venture, it was estimated, would cost between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 30m and would be broadcast on the Astra satellite system.
The ITV competition committee decided: 'The main point (of ITV2) would be
the possible impact on Thames/BBC plans and the siphoning of advertising
revenue from other satellite channels.'

FT  04 AUG 92 / Ageing process may benefit less well-off: Norma Cohen
reports on the implications of the proposed equalisation of the retirement
age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's pensions advisers have made it an offer that politically it
will be hard pressed to refuse.
In short, benefits improvements for the most vulnerable elderly people -
most of whom are women - can be paid for by requiring the most well-off
women to work five years longer before they are entitled to any benefits at
all.
Indeed, the Department of Social Security is likely to be secretly gloating
over the advice yesterday from its own Social Security Advisory Committee
that the state pension ages be equalised at 65 - an option that will save it
about Pounds 3bn a year.
The catch is that DSS advisers do not want the saved revenues to be returned
to the Treasury. Instead, they should be devoted to a cause long recognised
as deserving of additional funds. 'Our recommendation for an equal pension
age of 65 is part of an indivisible whole on the basis that the cost savings
will be recycled,' said Sir Peter Barclay, committee chairman.
The move appears to offer the government a politically palatable method of
raising women's retirement ages to 65 - something it has hinted it wanted to
do all along.
'It is clear that if you are going to reduce social security entitlements,
you have to say the savings will be used to help the poor,' said Mr Andrew
Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a social policy think
tank.
Mr Dilnot said that in spite of the government's disavowal of means testing
for benefits, it had already begun to move down the road to diverting social
security benefits to those who need them most.
Meanwhile, the committee acknowledged that if the government follows the
advice to raise women's retirement age, there is no guarantee that a future
government would choose to spend the cost savings on enhancing benefits for
the poorest elderly. But Sir Peter said that pressure to do anything other
than that would be so great that a government would have little choice.
Among the ways the committee has proposed spending the saved revenues are:
Enhancements to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme to assist the
low-paid and those with broken employment records, who are primarily women.
A new premium with income support for those unemployed for more than two
years and aged 55 or over and those 55 and over who are long-term sick or
disabled.
Enhanced 'home responsibility protection' and an extension of the invalid
care allowance to those aged 65.
The committee has also urged that the government extend the date at which
equalisation would be phased in to a 15-year period rather than the 10 years
suggested in the DSS's initial discussion document. That means that no one
currently 52 or over would be affected by the proposals and no one 42 or
over would feel the effects of the full five-year rise in women's pension
ages.
While the recommendations contain a certain logic, it must be remembered
that the move to equalise state pension ages had nothing to do with
improving benefits. In Britain, women are eligible to receive full basic
state pension at age 60 while men must wait until 65. But a recent European
Court ruling on occupational pensions determined that men and women must not
receive disparate pension benefits and the European Community is drafting a
directive for member states requiring equalisation all around.
Last December the DSS released a discussion document on proposals to remove
sex-related differences in state retirement benefit. The options were
lowering men's retirement ages to 60 - at an estimated cost to the Treasury
of Pounds 3.5bn a year - raising women's ages to 65 or equalising at the
actuarily neutral age of 63 in a move with no cost implications. It also
included the option most favoured by the pensions industry and providers of
occupational pensions: the introduction of a so-called flexible decade of
retirement between 60 and 70 that would give lower benefits to those who
retired before 65 and higher benefits to those who retired later.
In explaining why the other options were ruled out, Sir Peter made clear
that the committee's main goal was finding ways to use equalisation to
channel scarce benefits to groups that need them most and to ensure that the
best-off receive no additional benefits.
Already, some 75 per cent of male retirees will be eligible for some form of
occupational pension and are therefore better off in old age than women.
Because many women have interrupted or part-time service that is ineligible
for the receipt of pension, they are the most needy group of elderly.
In explaining why retirement at the neutral age of 63 was rejected, Sir
Peter said the option did not produce any cost savings that could be used to
help the worst off.
The pensions industry is sure to be disappointed by the committee's
rejection of flexibility in retirement ages. This is increasingly a feature
of occupational schemes - the basis of the best retirement packages
available in Britain.
Sir Peter said that not only would flexibility not save money, but it would
penalise those who genuinely needed most to retire at 60 for reasons of ill
health.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Canals keep the recession at bay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH WATERWAYS, which runs the country's canal system, has increased
revenues and maintained capital spending in spite of the recession and a
third year of drought.
Mr David Ingman, the chairman, says in the report and accounts for 1991-92,
published yesterday, that earned revenue had increased by 6.6 per cent to
Pounds 29m in the face of difficult economic circumstances, compared with an
increase of only 3 per cent in central government grant.
The public-sector organisation is on target to become more self-financing
but it is unlikely to become a target for privatisation as it will never
make a profit.
Its board, substantially restructured in the past few years with the
introduction of senior private-sector personnel, aims to improve waterway
facilities by raising finance from various sources, increasing fishing and
boating use of the waterways, and preserving the heritage and environment of
the system.
Spending on priority repairs remained at a high level last year and
increased to Pounds 14.4m from Pounds 13.6m in 1990-91. The corporate plan
envisages expenditure of Pounds 68m over the next four years to eliminate a
backlog of high-priority engineering works.
Recreation, leisure and tourism income rose by 12 per cent, and even in a
period of recession there was an increase of more than 4 per cent to 26,000
in the number of pleasure boat licences issued. More than 100,000 angling
licences are also issued annually.
Sales of water for industrial and other purposes are running at Pounds 2.7m
a year, and the imbalance of water reserves across the UK, with a surfeit in
Scotland, Wales and northern England and a shortfall in East Anglia and
parts of the south-east, has highlighted the possible use of canals to
transfer water in bulk. A six-month feasibility study will be launched
shortly.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The quest to avoid political Tweedledeedom: Ivo Dawnay on
the tough and uncertain road ahead for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Mr John Smith retreated to southern France for a well-earned break last
Friday, he could be forgiven for switching his attention to his beloved
airport thrillers and forgetting all about politics.
But the three weeks of rest and relaxation for the opposition leader may be
disturbed by one nagging thought: what exactly is it that Labour now plans
to oppose?
The irony is that - leaving aside temporarily the grander question of
'Whither Labour?' - the most immediate policy questions that confront Mr
Smith are almost exactly the same as those facing the prime minister. What
is more, his gut responses are close, if not identical, to those of Mr
Major.
On both Europe and the UK's gloomy economic outlook - the two issues set to
dominate the autumn session of parliament - Labour can and does point to
some differences with the government. But if the detail is perused
carefully, many of those differences are more of tone and presentation than
of policy. When it comes to general strategy, Mr Smith and Mr Major are, in
many respects, of one mind.
On Maastricht, for example, the dust kicked up by the Danish referendum's
'no' vote is insufficient to camouflage the similarity of position between
the Labour and Conservative parties' ruling establishments.
Certainly Labour will make the most of its insistence on British adherence
to a common environment policy. Its backing for the social chapter of common
workplace rights - vigorously opposed by the Tories - is and will remain the
chief virility symbol of its more-communautaire-than-thou European Community
policy. There will also be much talk of Labour's demands for greater
democratic accountability of EC institutions.
But when it comes down to whether to ratify the treaty - leaving the Danish
problem until later - Mr Smith will, like Mr Major, fight to the death for
ratification.
In the short term, Labour will take up the tactical option of opposing a
guillotine motion that curtails debate on ratification. Thereafter, Mr Smith
is determined that Labour must remain firmly behind its pre-election
position and either openly support endorsement of the treaty or abstain from
obstruction.
Then there is the economy. The so-called summer onslaught, launched by the
shadow cabinet last week, was full of sound and fury about the need for
measures, a more active government approach and such like.
More closely questioned, Mr Gordon Brown, the new shadow chancellor, will
talk of limited fiscal measures - investment incentives, for example, or the
'phased release' of some local authorities' capital receipts from housing
sales for new building projects. Behind the bluster and righteous
indignation, Labour is far from advocating a spending free-for-all.
Does the party argue for a policy of full-blown Keynesian reflation,
unilateral interest rate cuts or abandonment of sterling's DM2.95 central
parity rate in the exchange rate mechanism? It most certainly does not.
On the day the new shadow cabinet met for the first time, the most
vigorously argued case for more government spending was coming not from the
official opposition but from the Confederation of British Industry.
Labour officials were briefing that there were 'no easy answers' on the
economy.
During the leadership election campaign Mr Smith was goaded by his rival, Mr
Bryan Gould, into making a few gestures towards the idea of a UK initiative.
For a short while he argued that the British presidency of the European
Community should use its clout to mobilise its EC partners into a pressure
group on Germany to revalue and for 'co-ordinated steps' to cut intererst
rates.
Yesterday Mr Robin Cook, the trade and industry spokesman, was trotting out
those ideas once again.
Yet it seems clear that Mr Smith, whose European contacts are well nurtured,
has all but abandoned such gestures. He and his aides are more than aware
that no just pressure can be brought to bear without the support of France
and, socialist or not, President Francois Mitterrand has made clear he is
not playing that game.
The new Labour leader has long argued that there should be no rush into a
policy review. The lessons of this year's election defeat were that the
review, launched in 1987, left the party with polices that were drawn up in
a boom and had to be sold in a recession.
Labour must fill the void somehow. It will do so with a new document on its
aims and values, intended to broaden out the until now half-hearted
post-mortem on the April defeat into a general debate about the goals for a
left-of-centre party as the millennium nears.
But we already know that there will be only partial reform of Labour's union
links, that the party leader is sceptical about any formal accommodation
with the Liberal Democrats and equally in two minds about proportional
representation.
Perhaps, like Mr Micawber or, dare one suggest, Mr Major, Mr Smith believes
something will turn up. But at the moment he appears ready to play Prime
Minister Tweedledum's more socially conscious twin brother.
For the meantime, the government's real opposition will remain on its own
back benches.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Blackpool to lose InterCity link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail confirmed yesterday that Blackpool would lose its InterCity
links from Monday September 28 - the day the annual Labour party conference
is due to open there.
The line to the resort will in effect become a branch line, with passengers
leaving InterCity trains at Preston and changing to local services.
BR said it was no longer commercially viable to run InterCity services to
Blackpool because there were not enough passengers using the 17 1/2 -mile
stretch beyond Preston. The service was costly to run because diesel
locomotives had to be kept on hand to haul the trains on the short
non-electrified section between Preston and Blackpool.
The cutting of the Blackpool service is the latest in a series in the
InterCity network. Services to Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ceased in May, and
services to south Humberside are to end in September.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said more cuts were possible.
He accused the government of cancelling peak services to clear a way for
private-sector trains run by companies such as Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Group.
InterCity is also cutting two trains each way on weekdays from London to
Birmingham.
Mr John Hall, Blackpool's deputy director of tourism and attractions, said
the news had been 'greeted with very considerable dismay' in the resort.
'Our particular concern is over conference business,' he said. 'There is a
much higher percentage of delegates travelling by rail.' His department's
own survey had shown that, overall, only about 10 per cent of holidaymakers
arrived at the resort by train.

FT  04 AUG 92 / BR widens telecom link: Eurotunnel lease agreement bolsters
international plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL has advanced its plan to supply UK and international
telecommunications services. It will lease from Eurotunnel the rights to use
the Channel tunnel for a communications system, initially for its private
use.
British Rail Telecommunications (BRT), BR's telecommunications subsidiary,
will use Eurotunnel's transmission system for its international
telecommunications service, which it plans to start at the end of next year.
BRT, which operates the largest UK private telecommunications network,
linking it with its trains and stations, applied to the Department of Trade
and Industry in March for a Public Telecommunications Operator's licence for
both UK and international telecommunications traffic. It plans to invest
Pounds 500m over the decade and hopes to capture about 7 per cent of the UK
market by the year 2000.
Such a service would be based on its existing network, and it is exploring
the use of a system of fixed aerials to extend its network's link.
BRT is also examining the possibility of linking its telecommunications
network with that of SNCF, the French national railway concern. It has
ordered a powerful international gateway trunk exchange from GPT
Communication Systems, to link its exchange network to SNCF in Paris.
Mr Peter Borer, BRT managing director, said the development 'paves the way
for more international traffic in the event that we are awarded an
international PTO licence'.
The company has reserved further capacity to cope with expansion, although
if that were to include a public service it would require a separate
agreement with Eurotunnel, as the lease agreed provides only for a
telecommunications service for BR.
The deal with SNCF similarly relates only to BR's private telecommunications
needs. But the talks could form the basis for wider discussions between the
French group and BRT, which is talking to potential partners about a joint

FT  04 AUG 92 / Home market scheme faces cost queries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people would like to see a revival in the housing market but few agree
on how to achieve it.
Abbey National said the tax credit scheme it proposed yesterday was only an
outline. It seems clear that it would need significant changes before it
could be implemented.
The scheme's rationale is that the housing market is in a vicious circle.
House prices cannot rise because there are no transactions. Yet with prices
depressed, many people cannot afford to sell their homes, because they would
lose money.
By allowing the seller to offset the loss against income tax, Abbey National
hopes to turn the vicious circle into a virtuous one. The tax benefit would
enable people to sell their houses, restoring activity to the market and
allowing prices to rise. Once prices started to rise, the need for the
scheme would disappear.
For example, if a purchaser bought a house for Pounds 60,000 and sold it for
Pounds 50,000, the scheme would allow the Pounds 10,000 loss to be offset
against income tax. Either the seller would not pay tax on salary until the
credit was worked off, or the Inland Revenue would send a refund in the form
of a cheque.
There would be restrictions. The benefit would be available only once and
the proceeds would have to be reinvested in another property. There would
have to be a limit on the amount of the credit - Abbey National suggests
Pounds 10,000 a homeowner - and independent valuation of the sale price, to
prevent someone making a bogus sale at a bargain price to claim the credit.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said:
'Abbey National should be given praise for thinking of something new and for
trying to revive the housing market. 'But the scheme has a fatal flaw -
cost.'
The exact cost is impossible to quantify.
Another important factor is how the homeowner's 'loss' would be worked out.
Abbey National quotes the Council of Mortgage Lenders as saying that 375,000
homeowners have 'negative equity' - their houses are worth less than their
mortgages. With the average negative equity estimated at Pounds 2,662, Abbey
National says the cost to the Treasury would be Pounds 250m.
In the text of its proposal, Abbey National consistently refers to the
homeowner's 'loss' as the difference between the purchase and an independent
current valuation of the sale price. Except in cases of 100 per cent
mortgages, that loss will be much larger than the 'negative equity' element.
For a homeowner who put down Pounds 10,000 and borrowed Pounds 50,000 to buy
a Pounds 60,000 house, which is now worth Pounds 48,000, the negative equity
is Pounds 2,000, but the total loss is Pounds 12,000.
The cost of compensating owners for their full loss would be much larger.
Simply compensating owners for the 'negative equity' element would
discriminate against those who had prudently saved to put down a deposit on
their home.
Even if the scheme was restricted to the 'negative equity' element, Mr
Wriglesworth estimates that the cost would be much larger than Abbey
National's Pounds 250m. He believes that there are 1.5m homeowners with
negative equity, and that therefore the cost to the Treasury would be
between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn.
Mr Wriglesworth suggests a potential cap on the tax credit of Pounds 2,500,
but it would still not be enough to help those worst affected by the housing
slide. An owner who could sell his house for Pounds 5,000 less than the
original loan would receive a cheque for Pounds 2,500 from the Inland
Revenue, but this would still leave him owing the building society Pounds
2,500. He would also face estate agents' and solicitors' fees if he moved.
In its present form, therefore, the scheme might not achieve its purpose,
especially as it would not help first-time buyers.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Way is cleared for fly-in estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNING permission for the country's first fly-in community has been
granted by Wrekin District Council in Shropshire.
The plan for the old Bratton airfield, north-west of Telford, was drawn up
by directors of two private Midlands companies - LBE Group, a contract
tooling and engineering business, and London &amp; Midland Developments, a
property company. Under the scheme, 65 upmarket homes will be built on plots
of up to 1.5 acres. Each will have its own hangar and be connected by
taxiway to an airstrip more than 1,000 yards long.
There are about 500 such estates in the US, but in Europe the practice of
flying for pleasure or to work is not common.
The council's decision was made amid local concern about noise and safety
and was taken on party political lines, with Labour in favour and the
Conservatives against. Shropshire County Council had recommended rejection
on the grounds that the development was against the county structure plan.
Mr Jack Turner, a Wrekin Labour councillor and chairman of the Telford
Development Authority, described fears about noise and safety as
'exaggerated'.
The council has promised that noise levels would be closely controlled. No
more than 25,000 landings and take-offs would be allowed a year, which means
that roughly half of the residents could use their aircraft every day.
The Telford Development Authority, whose task is to attract inward
investment, welcomed the plan as giving the area an extra edge in the
competition for new investment. The airstrip will be available for use by
local business as well as residents.
The developers, who call their plan Telford Skypark, expect to start
construction this year and to finish within three years. The completed value
is estimated to be about Pounds 20m.
The costs of constructing the airstrip, flight-control tower and the
infrastructure of the estate are about Pounds 3.5m. LBE and London &amp; Midland
expect to create an early cashflow through contracts with building companies
wanting to build homes on the site.
The district council's planning permission is subject to formal approval by
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary. The airfield also needs a
licence from the Civil Aviation Authority before it can begin operations.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Limited liability for one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES can now be created with a single shareholder, under legislation
published yesterday in response to the European Community twelfth company
law directive.
The Companies (Single Member Private Limited Companies) Regulation amends
the 1985 Companies Act, which previously required at least two people to
create a company with limited liability.
It also protects existing companies that become single-member companies,
after events such as the transfer of shares, from insolvency or the loss of
limited-liability privilege.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the legislation
represented a simplification of red tape in company formation, in accordance
with the EC directive introduced in 1989.
The DTI denied that the move was likely to lead to the creation of more
fraudulent companies. It said that was no more likely than under existing
legislation with just two shareholders, one of whom could be a nominee and
therefore offer little more protection.
The regulation for single-member companies provides safeguards by requiring
that contracts, corporate decisions and other information are put in writing
and specifies criminal penalties for any breaches.
The Inland Revenue has tightened regulations over profit-related pay schemes
that it will accept for registration.
A new statement of practice says any schemes that give a formula for the
distribution of profits without specifying the figures used will no longer
be accepted.
PROPOSED Treasury guidelines on money laundering are burdensome and omit
certain important groups, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
The institute emphasises that secondary legislation on laundering should be
extended to the unregulated financial sector, to include businesses such as
Bureaux de Change.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Blue Arrow judge urges computer support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGES should make greater use of computer technology to help to keep
complex fraud trials manageable, Mr Justice Brooke, the second Blue Arrow
trial judge, said yesterday.
Mr Justice Brooke - who replaced Mr Justice McKinnon after the first Blue
Arrow trial - was speaking after formally acquitting the remaining four
defendants charged with fraud over the affair.
Not-guilty verdicts were returned against Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim
Brown, both former equities directors with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew; Mr Charles
Villiers, the former chairman of County NatWest; and Ms Elizabeth Brimelow,
County's former compliance director. Their costs, thought to approach Pounds
1m, were awarded from public funds.
Contributing to the debate on reforming the handling of large fraud trials,
Mr Justice Brooke said the public and business community were 'justifiably
looking with impatience' to the courts to find ways to manage such trials.
Judges in such cases faced an enormous intellectual and physical burden, he
said. Computer support was crucial.
Experience in the US had shown that the use of laptop computers by judges
could save much time and cost. Edited evidence could be recorded on computer
within 20 seconds of its being given. With the judge freed from making
handwritten notes, up to 10 per cent more evidence could be heard in a day.
'It is, I believe, incumbent on English judges to be willing to learn new
techniques if they may make such a substantial difference to the length of a
trial or the overall cost of proceedings,' said Mr Justice Brooke.
To reduce court time further, he called for firmer timetabling of legal
arguments heard when juries are out.
The Law Society the solicitors' governing body, is to re-examine US-style
'no win, no pay' contingency fee arrangements as an alternative to legal
aid, Robert Rice writes. The move is part of an overall review of methods of
funding court cases.
Solicitors are concerned that restrictions on legal aid have put the cost of
going to court beyond the reach of people on average incomes. The review
will examine whether contingency fee arrangements, where lawyers are paid
only if they win the case, could cut the cost of legal aid, which is
expected to exceed Pounds 1bn in 1992-93.
Government attempts to control the rising cost of legal aid by imposing
standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts have been
opposed by solicitors, who have threatened to withdraw from legal-aid work.
The society believes that a more radical solution to the drawbacks of the
legal aid system must be considered. The review will examine whether
contingency fees would increase access to justice or simply encourage
hopeless litigation. It will also ask whether legal aid should continue to
be available in cases that could be funded on contingency fees and whether
insurance could be devised against the risk of paying the other side's
costs.

FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Japanese claim US bill on mini-van tariffs
is unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL approved by the US House of Representatives which raises the tariff
on imported mini-vans discriminates against Japan by excluding European
vehicles, a Japanese trade ministry official said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Tokyo and Detroit.
'It is regrettable the US House passed the bill which is apparently in
violation of Gatt,' Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the international
trade and industry ministry (Miti) stated. The bill, passed on Friday, would
reclassify some mini-vans and sports utility vehicles as trucks, making them
subject to a tenfold increase in import duties. It now goes to the Senate.
The bill, backed by the US car industry and unions, would transfer passenger
vans, multi-purpose vans, four-door sports utility vehicles and other
jeep-type vehicles to a category carrying 25 per cent duty. It makes two
exemptions. Critics say these were designed to exclude European mini-vans
such as Volkswagen, imported since 1963, and vehicles with sales in the US
of less than 10,000 a year, such as Britain's Range Rover.
The Bush administration opposes the mini-van reclassification on the grounds
it would increase consumer costs, could be seen as a violation of Gatt, and
could result in retaliation against US exports. Mr Bush is expected to veto
the bill.
Tokyo will seek to present its case to Gatt if the bill becomes law,
Japanese newspapers reported. It 'is clearly in violation of Gatt,' the
Asahi Shimbun quoted Miti as saying. The vote was protectionism in its most
blatant form,' Toyota Motor said. 'The bill ought to be named the Big Three
windfall profits Act of 1992. The real losers from this kind of
protectionism will be once again the American consumer.'
But General Motors said the reclassification was justified. 'When a vehicle
is designed as a truck, built like a truck, performs like a truck, it ought
to be called a truck for tariff purposes.' Chrysler, controlling over half
the mini-van market, said the House action showed 'determination to come to
grips with our trade problems'. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association,
a US industry group supporting Detroit's vehicle-makers, said the bill would
close a loophole giving unfair advantage to importers.

THE US Commerce Department yesterday ruled out limiting gear imports on
grounds they threaten national security, Nancy Dunne reports from
Washington.
An investigation concluded the Pentagon was expecting 'substantial
decreases' in defence gear requirements. Inter-agency experts said the US
industry was technologically competitive with foreign suppliers.
Total gear imports to the US last year totalled Dollars 2bn-worth. Japan
took 27 per cent of the market, Canada 23, France 19, Germany 10, and the UK
3 per cent. If the Department had found imports threatened national
security, President Bush would have had 90 days to decide a course of
action.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Collor tries to hold power by spending
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S economic realities were thrown to the wind yesterday as beleaguered
President Fernando Collor held a crisis meeting of his economics team to
draw up an 'anti-impeachment plan'. His aim is to cling to power at all
costs.
The Sao Paulo stock market closed 7.3 per cent down on the day yesterday,
after the Brazilian press had reported that senior economy ministry
officials, including Mr Francisco Gros, central bank governor, were
threatening to resign over Mr Collor's decision to relax economic austerity
and redraw the government budget to devote resources to projects such as
road-building.
He would thus seek crucial support in Congress for the president needs the
votes of 168 Congress members to survive the impeachment initiative,
expected to begin next week, over his ties to Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a
businessman under investigation for alleged running of a
multi-million-dollar bribery scheme.
The members of the economic team are eager to resist compromising the
economic stabilisation programme, as this could jeopardise the country's
accord with the International Monetary Fund and agreement in principle with
creditor banks abroad on the restructuring of Dollars 42bn in commercial
debt.
The political crisis could hardly have come at a worse time in terms of the
economy. Inflation remains near 22 per cent a month, domestic debt is
soaring - up 157 per cent so far this year in real terms  - tax revenues are
10.4 per cent down and unemployment in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial
heartland, is at record levels.
With urgently-needed fiscal reform delayed by the political crisis, Brazil
is continuing to miss the targets of its IMF accord, agreed in January, and
it is becoming increasingly difficult for Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing
director, to keep the agreement in place. Officials of the Brazilian economy
ministry admit that no one wants to head a mission to Washington to explain.
Mr Collor is in a very sensitive position. On the one hand, he needs to open
Treasury coffers to buy political support; on the other, he cannot risk
resignations from his cabinet. If one minister goes, others may well follow.
The continued presence in the cabinet of Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the
well-respected economy minister, is seen as more important to the country's
stability than the survival of Mr Collor.
Yesterday, the minister denied that key members of the economic team had
threatened to resign over Mr Collor's efforts to redraft the budget.
The government hopes Congressional enthusiasm for impeachment will be
dampened by threats from Mr Farias to expose over 100 federal and state
legislators he claims to have helped financially in their election
campaigns. Congress has not yet considered any impeachment requests against
Mr Collor; a Congressional committee investigating the corruption charges is
still a week away from announcing its findings. Mr Jorge Bornhausen,
minister in the president's office, said at the weekend a request for
impeachment was inevitable, but 'the impeachment will not pass.'

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK seeks to defuse row over border controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is examining how further to lighten the
burden on European Community citizens posed by British immigration and
passport controls, in an attempt to defuse the dispute over Britain's
intention to retain border checks beyond the end of this year.
But the European Commission is maintaining that all border controls must be
lifted from January 1, 1993.
According to the Home Office, Mr Clarke has given an undertaking to Mr
Martin Bangemann, European internal market commissioner, that he will
'reflect on what more could be done to lighten the touch on EC nationals'.
Mr Bangemann yesterday denied reports that the Commission had already agreed
to allow the UK to keep border controls on people. He said Brussels stuck to
its interpretation of the Single European Act, which aims to establish a
barrier-free internal market.
He and Mr Clarke will meet again on September 1 to discuss the issue.
In theory the Commission could take any member state which retains border
controls to the European Court of Justice. It is more likely that the
January 1 deadline will be postponed, as other EC members are worried that
external borders will not be strong enough to allow all controls to be
lifted.
The Home Office said that Britain's determination to retain immigration
controls on third-country nationals travelling from EC countries would
require a 'light' passport check on EC nationals 'simply to establish their
nationality'.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Isolated Macedonia holds on to stability and a name: Kerin
Hope finds the independent but unrecognised ex-Yugoslav republic enjoying
rare political and economic order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT but unrecognised, the beleaguered ex-Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia is still managing to hold on to political and economic stability.
Mr Petar Gosev, the prime minister designate, is expected to announce a new
government this week. It will be a delicately balanced coalition between his
ex-communist Social Democrat party and the ethnic Albanian party for
Democratic Prosperity.
Its survival will depend on whether the European Community decision in June
that Macedonia should not be recognised under its present name can be
reversed. Greece, its southern neighbour, insists on a change of name on the
grounds that an independent Macedonia could one day make a territorial claim
on the adjoining Greek province of the same name.
But Mr Kiro Gligorov, Macedonian president, and Mr Gosev say they have
little room for manoeuvre. Mr Gligorov says: 'Without the name, we have no
identity. It distinguishes us from other Slavs. The Greeks say, denounce the
name and then we will talk. But who can do that?'
If the new government compromises on the issue of the name, it risks
provoking an outburst of nationalism that could be exploited by the main
opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO).
Tension is already apparent between extremist nationalists in VMRO and the
ethnic Albanian minority, which makes up more than a quarter of the
country's 2.2m population.
Macedonia has joined the UN embargo against Serbia, its main trading
partner. According to Mr Ivanco Stefanov, foreign undersecretary, the cost
of applying sanctions will amount to Dollars 1.3bn, equivalent to
Macedonia's total annual export earnings before the collapse of the Yugoslav
federation.
Efforts are under way to ensure that technical assistance from the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development can continue. But Macedonia will not
be eligible for EC financial aid or for loans from international
institutions.
Greece has been enforcing unofficial sanctions in recent months. About
two-thirds of Macedonian imports used to come by road from the northern
Greek port of Salonica, but delays and obstruction on the part of Greek
officials have forced Macedonian companies to find an alternative route
through Bulgaria.
Shops in Skopje, now mostly under private ownership, are well stocked as the
government rarely attempts to collect customs duties on consumer goods
shipped through Bulgaria, according to local businessmen. Food prices have
come down, thanks to a good harvest and lack of opportunity to export.
Still, Macedonia's economic policymakers have a difficult course to steer.
'We must be pragmatic about coping with our predicament but we can't abandon
plans for restructuring to develop a full market economy,' says a government
adviser.
One pressing problem is to find backing for a new currency, the denar, due
to be launched by the end of 1992. Yugoslav dinars were withdrawn from
circulation as part of an anti-inflation package launched in April. They
were replaced with a transitional currency, the Macedonian coupon, on a
one-for-one basis.
A public-sector wage freeze was imposed at the same time, together with
price controls on a basic shopping basket, including bread, sugar and
cooking oil. The result has been the monthly inflation rate has fallen from
80 per cent in April to 17 per cent in June.
But Macedonia's foreign exchange reserves total less than Dollars 40m,
including Dollars 5m in gold. 'We need a substantial loan if we are to make
the denar convertible, but international recognition is necessary first to
establish our creditworthiness,' says Mr Borko Stanoevski, central bank
governor.
The transitional currency is unofficially propped up by a steady inflow of
D-Marks, estimated at more than Dollars 750m last year, brought home in cash
by migrant workers in Switzerland and Germany. Coupons are used for public
sector wages and payments, while the D-Mark serves as a parallel,
convertible currency for the private sector.
Meanwhile, the government is pressing on with legislation to attract foreign
investors and broaden the privatisation programme to include more than 1,400
industrial and service sector companies. One encouraging sign is a project
by Daewoo, the South Korean electronics giant, to start producing
telecommunications equipment later this year at a state-owned plant on Lake
Ochrid, close to the Greek border.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Outrage over Serb 'death camps': President Tudjman
re-elected in Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL outrage is growing over allegations of Serb-run death camps in
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The French government demanded yesterday that humanitarian organisations be
allowed immediate access to camps in northern Bosnia to investigate
allegations of atrocities, following claims at the weekend that thousands of
civilians have been slaughtered, starved or imprisoned.
The US yesterday confirmed such reports when a government spokesman said:
'We know from our own reports that Serbian forces are maintaining what they
call detention centres for Croatians and Moslems. There have been abuses,
torturing and killings taking place in those centres.'
International human rights agencies have feared a systematic slaughter of
Moslems and Croats but no international agency has gained access to the two
camps.
The disclosures came as President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia won 55 per cent
of the votes in the country's first presidential election since gaining
independence from Yugoslavia.
In the parliamentary poll on Sunday, his ruling Croatian Democratic Union
party (HDZ) looked set to gain a majority in the 124-seat parliament, after
winning 41 per cent of the votes.
The public confidence in Mr Tudjman stems from his success at realising the
widespread ambition for gaining international recognition for an independent
Croatian state.
Moreover, after a year of bloodshed and destruction, Croats voted for a
former communist army general who says he won the war and promises to lead
Croatia to prosperity.
Mr Tudjman's critics said the result cast a shadow over the development of
democracy in Croatia. Mr Zarko Puhovski, a professor of political philosophy
at Zagreb University, said he was concerned the vote would be seen as a
mandate for Mr Tudjman and HDZ to rule single-handedly.
'If they have been elected in both presidential and parliamentary elections,
then they will understand the results as the legitimisation of their
authoritarian rule,' said Mr Puhovski. 'This is the worst possible outcome
in terms of democracy. Tudjman has ruled from some kind of court for years.'
The vote for Mr Tudjman and the HDZ also appears unlikely to bring Croatia
closer to a resolution of the Serbian question. Ethnic Serbs, who make up 12
per cent of the 4.5m population, generally abstained from voting - with the
exception of urban Serbs. The 200,000 Serbs living in the UN-patrolled zones
and 200,000 Serbs who fled the war to Serbia did not vote.
They will now remain outside the political process and parliament. In
addition, Mr Tudjman's victory is likely to radicalise further Croatia's
rural Serbs, who waged a nationalist war against Croatian independence after
the HDZ came to power in 1990.
The weak opposition in Croatia has accused Mr Tudjman for losing control of
about one-third of its territory to the Serb militia, or to the UN.
But unlike his political challengers, Mr Tudjman has backed the UN peace
plan. His support means the UN peacekeepers will be allowed to continue
their attempts to demilitarise Serb militia, try to establish local polices
forces which represent the pre-war national make-up, and eventually restore
Croatian control over its borders.
In London, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, ruled out any immediate
prospect of a militarily-imposed solution in the former Yugoslavia, saying
the international community could not be united behind such a policy.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Belgian budget comes under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian government yesterday unveiled a surprisingly soft budget for
1993, which was sharply criticised by economists and market analysts, Andrew
Hill writes.
The measures should reduce the budget deficit from an estimated 5.7 per cent
of GNP in 1992 to 5.2 per cent next year. The target is to reduce the
deficit to 3 per cent of GNP by 1996, one of the criteria for European
economic and monetary union (Emu).
Analysts were unhappy that Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister,
had not persuaded cabinet colleagues to push for a more drastic reduction in
the deficit to 4.9 per cent of GNP in 1993.

Germany yesterday became the first European country to start destroying its
cold war arsenal when officials lit a cutting torch to destroy a Soviet-made
armoured car and a cannon, Reuter reports from Rochensussra.
Defence Minister Volker Ruhe (centre) and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
(right) had to jump back from a massive BTR-40 P2 armoured personnel carrier
(APC) as sparks showered over them.
'There is no place any more in a Europe of democratic states and pluralistic
societies for over-armament and the bulging arsenals of the cold war,' Mr
Ruhe said at the ceremony in the village near Erfurt in Thuringen state.
Mr Kinkel said: 'This day is a symbol for the victory of reason and morality
over confrontation and the arms race.'
The APC and the 125mm Howitzer cut apart in Rochensussra, once behind the
Iron Curtain, were the first of about 40,000 tanks, artillery and
helicopters that European states will destroy by late 1995.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Germany's industrial output in the second quarter of this year was
2.2 per cent lower than in the first three months, the Economics Ministry
reported yesterday.
The ministry, which also revised May production figures from a provisional
increase of 0.7 per cent to a fall of 0.1 per cent, and unveiled a 2.1 per
cent month-on-month drop for June, partly blamed the early start to the
holiday season.
However, the figures revealed the underlying economic slowdown, masked
earlier in the year by the beneficial effects of unusually mild winter
weather on sectors such as construction.
The seasonally-adjusted index of industrial production, which had been
falling gently earlier in the year, fell 2.5 points to 118.7 in June and
stood 5.6 points below the level of June 1991.
A two-month comparison of output in May and June with the same period in
1991 showed a 2.1 per cent drop. Only raw materials and construction showed
any improvement. Output of capital goods fell 3.3 per cent. Consumer
durables were down 3.5 per cent and food and drink output fell 4.5 per cent.
In a similar comparison with March and April of this year industrial
production fell 1.5 per cent.

FT  04 AUG 92 / President of Hesse central bank dies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karl Thomas, one of the most experienced and influential members of the
Bundesbank's policy-making council, died suddenly at the weekend.
Mr Thomas, 63, was also president of the regional central bank of Hesse, the
German state which includes the banking centre of Frankfurt.
He had been head of the regional central bank for only 2 1/2 years of his
eight-year term but was an energetic supporter of efforts to promote
Frankfurt as the site of the European central bank and to develop its
strength as a financial centre.
He supported reforms, such as a new supervisory body for the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, aimed at improving the city's financial status in competition with
other European centres and preventing trading scandals like those which
surfaced last year.
Mr Thomas, born in Chemnitz in Saxony in east Germany, also argued strongly
in Bonn for reforms to the Bundesbank's structure which are now being
implemented and which will make the council less unwieldy.
Unlike some of the other regional central bank heads who have a political
background, Mr Thomas came from the ranks of the Bundesbank, where he had
spent about 40 years after studying economics in Berlin. He became head of
the credit department, an important part of the central bank's operations.
He had backed the Bundesbank's efforts to damp down inflation and curb money
supply growth, including the latest interest rate rises.
Mr Thomas's successor as president of the central bank of Hesse, and thus as
a member of the Bundesbank council, will be chosen by the state government
in Wiesbaden in conjunction with the upper house of the Bonn parliament.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Retirement age of 65 proposed for men and women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE state retirement age for women should be raised to 65 to equal that of
men and the cost savings should be used to help the poorest pensioners, the
government's own advisers urged yesterday.
The recommendation from the Social Security Advisory Committee, which
advises the government on pensions policy, increases the likelihood that
women will have to work another five years before becoming eligible for
state pensions.
Last December, the Department of Social Security published a discussion
document outlining plans for equalising pension ages, allowing men to retire
earlier at age 60 or men and women to retire at age 63. The report said that
retiring at 60 was estimated to cost roughly Pounds 3.5bn per year in
additional expenditure, while a common retirement age of 63 would have no
revenue effect.
The SSAC suggested that the political unpopularity of its recommendation be
mitigated by a promise to use the estimated Pounds 3bn in annual cost
savings to help the (mostly women) pensioners penalised by low pay and
interrupted service in their working lives. They also suggested that the
government begin phasing in the equalisation policy 15 years from now,
rather than 10 years as suggested in the DSS report.
This would mean that no one currently older than 52 would be affected by the
changes and that no one over 42 would feel the full effect of equalisation.
Since 1940, women in Britain have been allowed to retire on full state
pension at age 60, while men have had to wait until 65.
In rejecting the proposal to lower men's retirement age to 60, Sir Peter
Barclay, chairman of the SSAC, said: 'It gives a huge gift to men regardless
of their need.' Nearly three-quarters of British men are eligible for
occupational pensions already so that their need for state benefit is less
than that of women.
The committee rejected the option of age 63 because it would cut women's
benefits while providing no additional funds to help those who need aid
most.
The SSAC also rejected pensions industry suggestions that the government
adopt a so-called flexible decade of retirement between the ages of 60 and
70.

FT  04 AUG 92 / House sales boost urged as prices fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT came under mounting pressure last night to revive the deeply
depressed UK housing market as prices showed a further fall.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was 'considering carefully' proposals by
Abbey National aimed at stimulating house sales while senior Conservative
backbenchers stepped up their calls for action.
Abbey National, the bank which is Britain's second largest mortgage lender,
urged the government to offer a once-only tax credit of up to Pounds 10,000
to people selling their homes to cover any loss of value. The proposals were
contained in a letter to Mr Lamont from Sir Christopher Tugendhat, the
bank's chairman.
Unveiling the group's half-yearly results, which showed a 12 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 270m, Sir Christopher said a way was needed to
enable existing owner-occupiers to sell their houses and move up in the
market without being deterred by the prospect of making a loss.
The restoration of a healthy housing market was required to lead the way for
a general recovery in the UK economy by boosting consumer confidence and
expenditure, he said.
Abbey National said its proposed credit would be made on condition that the
cash was reinvested in another property.
News of the initiative coincided with the publication of Nationwide Building
Society's monthly house price index which showed that house prices fell on
average by a further 0.6 per cent during July. The average UK house price is
now Pounds 55,414, a 6 per cent drop from Pounds 58,928 a year ago.
The government continued to insist that no contingency measures to bolster
the troubled market were under preparation but some of its senior
backbenchers argued that urgent action was required. Mr John Townend,
chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, said the
government had 'got to now look at' alternative measures to revive the
housing market.
'If the housing market went down by another 10 per cent, that could push us
into a severe recession,' he said.
He said the Abbey National proposals were 'a non-starter', adding that
viable measures could include a government-backed mortgage guarantee scheme
and a limited-period increase in tax allowances. He advocated paying for
this through a 'semi-freeze' on public-sector pay increases and by cutting
Britain's overseas aid budget by some 25 per cent.
Sir George Gardiner, Conservative MP for Reigate and leader of the
Thatcherite 92 group of MPs, said he would consider favourably any proposals
to revive the housing market that was financed by cutting other government
programmes.
It was of paramount importance, however, that no fresh measures that would
cost additional public money should be introduced, he said.
For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said the
best measure the Treasury could take was 'to let councils build some
houses'.
In the City, there was scepticism about the viability of the Abbey National
proposals. Mr John Wriglesworth, a leading housing finance specialist, said
the cost would be much larger than the Pounds 250m forecast by the bank. He
said the cost to the Treasury would probably be nearer Pounds 1.5bn to
Pounds 2bn.

FT  04 AUG 92 / ANC declares strike a success

LEADERS of South Africa's general strike claimed a 'resounding success' as
millions of workers stayed at home on the first day of a week of protest
called to force President FW de Klerk to agree to majority rule.
Much of the country's business and industry was brought to a halt, or forced
to reduce output, with an estimated 90 per cent of the workforce staying
away in the Johannesburg region, falling to about 50 per cent in Durban,
Natal, where Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party (IFP)
opposes the strike.
The country's mining sector, however, was less affected, with Anglo American
Corporation reporting that its gold and coal mines were 'operating normally,
with high attendance', ranging from a full turnout in the West Rand and Vaal
Reefs regions, to 40 per cent at Freegold and about 75 per cent in its coal
mines.
The Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry said members reported a
turnout of less than 50 per cent.
At least 34 people were reported killed in the past two days, though it was
unclear how many of the deaths were directly linked to the strike.
Cape Town townships were effectively no-go areas as barricades, some in
flames, blocked streets.
A 10-member team of United Nations observers is monitoring the violence,
with the assistance of local organisations, in the first exercise of its
kind in South Africa.
At a news conference last night Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the
African National Congress, said: 'South Africa has been plunged into a
national crisis as a direct result of the government's intransigence in
negotiations and its lack of political will to end the violence.'
The real test of the ANC's campaign is yet to come. Past strike calls by the
ANC and its allies, the Communist party and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (Cosatu), have had comparable success.
This time the alliance is committed to a week of protest, with rallies,
demonstrations and sit-ins due to continue after the strike ends tonight.
If today's level of support, or near it, can be sustained, pressure on Mr de
Klerk may start to tell.
Mr Jay Naidoo, the Cosatu general secretary, said at the same news
conference that the protest would continue until Mr de Klerk gave way. If
there was no positive response to the alliance's call for an early interim
government, elections for a constituent assembly and an end to political
violence, it would 'continue its campaign of rolling mass action until the .
. . demands are met'.
Mr Naidoo said that 4m workers had responded to the strike call. 'Millions
have voted with their feet today.'
The campaign organisers also claimed that school boycotts, opposed by many
parents, ranged from 75 per cent in the western Cape to a total boycott in
the Johannesburg region. The city itself was quiet yesterday.
Parties opposed to the strike, including Inkatha and the Pan Africanist
Congress, as well as employers, claimed that there had been intimidation, a
charge denied by the ANC.
However, with few taxis or buses operating in many parts of the country, it
was impossible for many people to travel to their jobs even if they wanted
to work.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Delta calls for block on BA's Dollars 750m share deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA AIR LINES, the third largest US carrier, yesterday called for British
Airways' proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 390m) equity investment in USAir, the
sixth largest US carrier, to be blocked.
The request to the US Transport Department coincides with mounting pressure
by the three largest US airlines - Delta, American Airlines and United
Airlines - to be given greater access into the UK and other European markets
through a revision of the existing aviation agreement between the UK and the
US.
American Airlines, the biggest US carrier, said yesterday that the US
government should not approve the investment deal unless the US secured
'equal opportunities for US carriers'.
However, the strongest attack came from Delta which called on the US
Transport Department to take action to stop the deal 'as a matter of law'.
Mr Ronald Allen, Delta's chairman, claimed the BA-USAir deal involved 'a
foreign carrier cloaked in the protection of one of the most restrictive and
anti-competitive international aviation regimes in the world seeking control
over a US carrier in violation of our government's current law and policy'.
Mr Allen also claimed BA would exercise control 'over virtually every
significant business activity of USAir'. Even if BA control of USAir was
eliminated, Delta argued, the US government was obligated to protect US
interests by requiring as a precondition to any deal a revised US-UK
agreement giving US carriers free and open access to and from British
cities.
BA yesterday said its agreement with USAir complied with US regulations and
had no implications for the aviation regime between the two countries.
Under the deal negotiated at the end of last month, BA is proposing to
acquire a 44 per cent equity stake in USAir which would give it 21 per cent
of the voting rights in the airline.
US regulations restrict foreign ownership in US airlines to 25 per cent of
voting rights and 49 per cent of equity. BA also said the US Transport
Department had promised a rapid review of its proposed deal with USAir.
With its demand that the US authorities block the deal, Delta is adopting a
far more aggressive and extreme position than the two other big US carriers.
It claimed that if the deal was approved, the US industry's competitive edge
in the world market would be 'sacrificed'. Mr Allen warned that 'the jobs of
an entire US industry are at stake'.
In contrast, both American Airlines and United Airlines have indicated there
could be opportunities for the US airline industry if the proposed
transaction led to more open skies between the US and the UK.

FT  04 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: US soars in the summertime heat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the height of summer, the Olympic Games are in full swing and most
investors' thoughts have wandered to the annual holiday. Yet as Wall Street
heads for record levels it is apparent that there are still some investors
who are delaying their leave. Last week the FT-Actuaries World index put on
2 per cent, its first appreciable gain for nearly a month.
The rally in the US started on Tuesday, when sentiment was boosted by a fall
in long-term bond yields, and also better than expected second quarter
results from Chrysler that lifted car manufacturers in general.
Japan also contributed to the stronger World index. After a disappointing
start to the week when the Nikkei average sank to a new six-year low,
narrowly avoiding a fall below 15,000 on Wednesday, sentiment took a turn
for the better as the government announced that it was bringing forward by a
month its plans to stimulate the economy. By the weekend the index had more
than recouped its losses.
The situation in continental Europe was not so encouraging. Comments by Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, effectively dashing any hopes
for lower German interest rates this year, held back share prices. The
downgrading of Allianz following its first-ever underwriting losses, and
fears that Deutsche Bank's first-half earnings, due to be published
tomorrow, will fail to meet forecasts also hurt the German market.
However, both Sweden and Switzerland ignored Mr Schlesinger's pessimistic
analysis and showed firm gains on encouraging domestic news.
Astra enjoyed foreign buying on reports of strong US sales, while Skandia
moved ahead as it appeared that a solution was in prospect to Uni
Storebrand's attempt to take control of the Swedish insurer. Switzerland
took comfort from satisfactory results from Union Bank and a strong chemical
sector.

FT  04 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as daily
volume declines to 10-year low

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices lost ground in subdued trading as volume fell to 121m shares,
the lowest since August 1982, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei average ended 200.83 down at 15,709.45 after a day's
high of 15,954.44 and low of 15,665.40. The index rose at mid-morning on
light index-linked buying, but later drifted lower on small-lot speculative
selling.
Volume dropped from Friday's 200m as investors remained inactive. Falls led
advances by 621 to 289, with 156 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks slipped 11.81 to 1,207.44, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 1.65 to 955.92.
Stock prices moved in tandem with the futures market, with little demand
from investors. Traders expressed worries about the meagre turnover and were
pessimistic about the effects of lower interest rates. An analyst at Daiwa
Securities commented: 'Rates on bank deposits are being lowered next week,
but the market lacks incentives to attract investors.'
According to Daiwa, the daily average trading value on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell from June's Y219.2bn to Y189.2bn in July, moving below Y200bn
for the first time since August 1984.
Foreign investors, who had been steady buyers of Japanese stocks, have also
turned negative on the Tokyo market. The Finance Ministry said foreigners
sold a net Dollars 1.96bn worth of Japanese stocks in June, turning net
sellers for the first time since November 1990.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the domestic telecom company, receded Y6,000
to Y582,000 and KDD, the international telecom group, lost Y140 to Y8,200.
The lifting of the foreign ownership ban on the two stocks at the start of
this month has failed to attract buyers.
High-technology issues retreated on profit-taking. Toshiba, the most active
issue of the day, dipped Y4 to Y610 and Hitachi Y3 to Y720.
Speculative theme stocks weakened as dealers and individuals liquidated
short-term holdings. Meiji Milk Products fell Y40 to Y835. However, some
suppliers of satellite television parts rose on hopes that the Olympic Games
would boost demand for satellite television sets. Ikegami Tsushinki advanced
Y38 to Y775 and Denki Kogyo Y30 to Y630.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 123.89 to 17,626.86 in turnover of 6.4m
shares, down from Friday's 12.9m. Trading volume on the OSE in July fell 2.7
per cent from June to 328.3m shares, the lowest monthly figure since May
1958.
Volume of the Nikkei 225 stock index futures fell 5.4 per cent from the
previous month to 1.2m contracts, with average daily turnover dropping 9.5
per cent to 51,808 contracts. Futures options traded during July totalled
974,737 lots, up 22.9 per cent from June.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday.
HONG KONG moved ahead on selective buying of blue chips amid expectations of
positive corporate results. The Hang Seng index put on 29.60 to 5,910.73 as
turnover dipped to HKDollars 1.76bn from HKDollars 2.15bn.
Hang Seng Bank, with interim results due next week, added HKDollars 1 at
HKDollars 54.5, while Cheung Kong, which reports half-time figures on
Thursday, climbed 30 cents to HKDollars 24.80.
BANGKOK rose across the board in active trading as investors were cheered by
the government's decision to replace top military officers held responsible
for the May shooting of pro-democracy campaigners. The SET index gained
12.80, or 1.7 per cent, to 757.22 in turnover of Bt9.4bn.
MANILA declined as profit-takers moved in following the composite index's
failure on Friday to break through 1,500. The index relinquished 19.68 to
1,479.82 in turnover of 96.9m pesos. Mining shares led the market lower, the
sector's sub-index shedding 90.56 to 2,892.70.
TAIWAN finished lower in thin trading as major players and institutions took
profits after recent gains. The weighted index lost 29.76 to 4,072.08 in
turnover of TDollars 18bn, against Saturday's half-day TDollars 22.68bn.
AUSTRALIA ended a shade off after hardly moving all day, due to a bank
holiday in New South Wales. The All Ordinaries index eased 0.5 to 1,617.3 in
light turnover of ADollars 149.8m.
Challenge sank 8 cents to ADollars 2.12 after the bank said it would have a
one-for-four rights issue and forecast a ADollars 43.5m loss for the year to
September.
SINGAPORE edged lower at the close in thin trading. The Straits Times
Industrial index shed 6.86 to 1,444.98 in volume of 23.2m shares, down from
Friday's 36.2m.
KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed to easier as bargain hunting alternated with bouts
of profit-taking. The composite index was off 0.14 at 601.39 in volume of
69.1m shares, against 72.3m on Friday.
KARACHI suffered its worst daily fall in six months as the textile sector
reported a sharp contraction in cotton yarn sales. The 100-share index lost
39.15 to 1,247.12.
BOMBAY came off the day's lows, aided by late institutional support. The BSE
index ended 4.41 down at 2,722.65, after touching 2,697.04.

FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: Canada keeps close eye on
troubled carriers' talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL government is distancing itself from any quick solution to the
troubles of Air Canada and Canadian International Airlines, despite market
rumours that a merger proposal could come later this week.
While officials of Canada's two major airlines continued talks in Calgary,
Transport Minister Jean Corbeil said the government will not provide any
direct financial backing for a merger, beyond completing acquisition of
three Airbus 310s for the defence department from Canadian for about
CDollars 150m (USDollars 127.1m).
The Mulroney government, facing the countdown on its constitutional talks,
is watching the airlines' negotiations closely.
It must assure a future for Canadian's principal assets in western Canada,
including a large maintenance base, and also the position of Air Canada in
the east, including headquarters and a larger maintenance base in Montreal.
In the past two weeks Air Canada has been frozen out of negotiations with
USAir after British Airways bought part of the US carrier.
Then Canadian's parent, PWA, broke off talks with American Airlines because
Ottawa disagreed with the terms.
Immediately, Air Canada resumed merger talks with PWA, with the two airlines
picking up where they left off earlier this year.
Despite its heavy losses, Air Canada remains the stronger of the two
airlines financially, but it badly needs Canadian's Far East routes.
The two airlines have about 25 per cent over-capacity. Putting them together
would create an airline with 200 aircraft, 34,000 employees, two maintenance
bases, CDollars 4.5bn of debt, equity of CDollars 1bn and continuing heavy
operating losses because of the poor domestic market.
It would, however, still need greater access to US routes.
Analysts estimate between 5,000 and 10,000 employees would have to be axed
to bring costs in line with US carriers and severance and other factors
could run to CDollars 100m.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: David James adds Lep to list of rescues -
Even after its refinancing debt of almost Pounds 330m will remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Mr David James, Lep Group represents the fifth company rescue that he
has been involved in over the past eight years and it entails the biggest
bank debt.
Even after the refinancing, the freight forwarding and security group will
have bank borrowings of nearly Pounds 330m. This is about 4 1/2 times the
resuscitated figure for shareholders' funds of Pounds 71.2m - an improvement
from the December deficit of Pounds 108.8m.
Mr James said the banks had taken a huge hit in swapping Pounds 180m of debt
for equity. 'They also have to take a chance on the interest (on Pounds
145.7m) being rolled up for three years and carry the consequences of
providing working capital.'
Part of the agreement involves the banks releasing Pounds 20m of asset-sale
proceeds as well as providing a new Pounds 12m working capital facility.
Some compensation will come from their share of the Pounds 10.3m allowed for
fees and expenses.
Mr James's refrain, which will be familiar to shareholders in Davies &amp;
Newman, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is that there is no alternative short
of receivership.
'Nearly 12,000 people would lose their jobs, the pension fund would have
remained severely deprived, about Pounds 40m of trade creditors would have
lost everything, the shareholders would have lost whatever recovery value
there now is.'
What remains is a company with between Pounds 1.3bn and Pounds 1.4bn of
turnover, the bulk of it in freight forwarding. Last year's operating profit
came to Pounds 26.5m (Pounds 55.6m), most of it contributed by National
Guardian Corporation, the US security arm.
With this year's trading no better than last, the amount of debt to be
serviced has been reduced to Pounds 182m. The restructuring, negotiated with
about 25 banks, covers the rest of the Pounds 507.8m net debt. Altogether,
Mr James said, Lep had '42 separate relationships with 34 banks'.
As for the future, the alternatives are that the group slims down to the
freight forwarding and NGC subsidiaries, or that these two parts are spun
off as independent entities. Sorting out the twin core businesses incurred
nearly Pounds 29m of exceptional costs.
The price of withdrawing from non-core businesses was reflected in Pounds
172.1m of extraordinary charges. Apart from Pounds 103.3m of property
write-downs, the interests to be ditched include bearings distribution and a
Tanzanian gold mining project.
In spite of the scale of Lep's debts, Mr James said that the salvage
operations had been more difficult at both Eagle Trust, a mini-conglomerate
where the repercussions have included criminal proceedings, and at Central &amp;
Sheerwood, another industrial holding company.
The recent weakness of Davies &amp; Newman's share price - it closed at 16p last
night compared with the deeply discounted rescue rights price of 50p - shows
how the initial refinancing cannot solve all the problems. Mr James is still
involved with D&amp;N, which has had to warn that this year's pre-tax profits
will not come near the Pounds 20m forecast at the time of the rescue.
Lep will hold an extraordinary general meeting to discuss its restructuring
plan in London on August 24.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Mercury challenges BT's claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Communications yesterday challenged claims made by British
Telecommunications that it was winning back substantial numbers of business
customers from its main competitor.
Mr Peter Howell-Davies, deputy chief executive of Mercury, said that BT had
won back only about Pounds 6m of business from Mercury, compared with an
increase in Mercury's order book of Pounds 300m in the past financial year.
A comparison of the figures indicated that 'BT's impact has been
negligible,' he said.
Mercury was responding to a claim made by BT at its annual general meeting
on July 30 that it was succeeding in winning back business customers from
Mercury and fending off competition from cable TV companies.
Mercury said it had arrived at the figure of Pounds 6m from its own market
sources. The figure did not mean that BT has won back a number of business
customers altogether but represented just 45 customers at an average of
Pounds 133,000 per customer, Mercury said.
As business customers tended to use BT for local calls and Mercury for
long-distance and international calls, the business that has been won back
by BT could represent a slight shift in balance between the use of the
respective services.
Mercury added that it was continuing to increase its customer base at a rate
of about 19,000 a month. Of these some 12,000 were for its own residential
services and about 7,000 were for services provided in partnership with
cable TV operators.
Mercury provides services in partnership with cable operators in areas
including Birmingham, Portsmouth, Bristol and London. These services provide
users with competitive rates for long-distance, international and local
calls.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Abbey National falls 12% to Pounds 270m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the mortgage lender and retail banking group, yesterday
reported a 12 per cent fall in its pre-tax profits during the first half of
the year as a result of the deep recession in the housing market.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 slipped to Pounds 270m, in line
with the lower end of market expectations, from Pounds 308m a year ago.
The dividend was increased by a larger-than-expected 9 per cent to 3.8p from
3.5p in spite of a fall in earnings per share to 13.2p from 15.7p. a year
ago.
The higher dividend failed to cheer the stock market, however, and Abbey
National shares fell 3.5p during the day to close at 255p.
Provisions against problem loans were Pounds 138m, up from Pounds 58m a year
ago and Pounds 97m in the second half of 1991. The figure included a general
provision of Pounds 30m, up from Pounds 3m a year ago, for UK residential
mortgages, and a further Pounds 30m in provisions against losses in France
and Spain and unsecured lending in the UK.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, said: 'With the continuing depressed
state of the housing market so apparent, no one should be surprised that the
charge for provisions has increased and caused a fall in our pre-tax
profits.'
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, hinted that borrowers who took out high
loan-to-value mortgages might have to pay higher rates to reflect risk more
accurately and offset the reduced protection available from mortgage
indemnity insurers.
The bank's treasury operations contributed Pounds 38m to pre-tax profits, up
from Pounds 20m a year ago.
Total operating income rose 12 per cent to Pounds 744m, from Pounds 663m a
year ago.
Costs rose 134 per cent to Pounds 336m, taking the cost:income ratio to 45.2
per cent, slightly up on 44.8 per cent a year ago but still well below the
big four clearing banks.
During the first half of the year, Abbey National's net mortgage advances
were Pounds 1.2bn, down from Pounds 1.7bn a year ago.
As a result, Abbey National's share of new UK mortgage advances has shrunk
to 10.9 per cent from 15.5 per cent at the beginning of the year. The bank's
share of the liquid savings market also fell from 7.9 per cent to 5.6 per
cent over the same period.
There was a net inflow of only Pounds 700m in retail savings during the
half-year, compared with Pounds 2.2bn a year ago.

FT  04 AUG 92 / BBA half-year results boosted by cost cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COST-CUTTING exercise in all divisions at BBA, the component maker for the
automotive, aviation and industrial markets, helped it report a 26 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the half year.
For the six months to June 30, BBA's pre-tax profits increased from Pounds
26.1m to Pounds 33m, on sales of Pounds 649.1m, up from Pounds 620.2m a year
earlier.
Mr John White, managing director, said: 'By reading the recession early we
were able to tackle costs against the background of difficult economic
conditions.'
He warned that there was 'no firm evidence of any generalised recovery' and
called on the government to cut interest rates at the 'earliest
opportunity'.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 4.8m relates to redundancy costs covering
the loss of 600 jobs and the closure of loss-making plants.
Mr White said the company would concentrate its resources on its core
businesses which had rare technology and a high proportion of the market,
such as its friction materials operations.
He said there would be no 'firesale' of non-core businesses. 'If there are
constraints from resources we will address them as and when they arise.'
However, Mr White did not rule out disposals of some of the portfolio
businesses if the price was right.
The automotive division, which saw the most significant reductions in its
cost base, made the strongest recovery, reporting increased pre-tax profits
of Pounds 17.4m against Pounds 12.8m a year ago.
Pre-tax profits from aviation edged up to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.5m). BBA
said its airline clients had reported 'diabolical market conditions' which
would lead them to extend the life of their fleets of aircraft.
Industrial activities, particularly in the US, went late into recession.
This helped explain the fall in the division's pre-tax profits from Pounds
20m to Pounds 18m. After a sharp fall in the second half of 1991, profits
have recovered to the level achieved in the first half of last year.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 4.4m relates to the settlement of a claim
over the value of the net assets of a disposal.
Gearing increased from around 40 per cent to about 50 per cent of
shareholders' funds. The interest charge, however, fell by Pounds 4.2m to
Pounds 8m because of money received from last year's Pounds 79m rights issue
and lower US interest rates.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.25p. Earnings per share increased to
5p (4.4p).

FT  04 AUG 92 / TWA creditors and unions discuss deal on ownership

<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD Airlines, the debt-laden US carrier operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, yesterday confirmed it was discussing a plan with its
creditors and unions which centres on TWA's owner, Mr Carl Icahn, ceding
control to employees and creditors.
Creditors are expected to forgive about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) of TWA's
roughly Dollars 1.6bn of debt in exchange for a 55 per cent stake in the
airline. They would also receive debt securities and preferred stock. The
remaining 45 per cent of the equity would be held by employees.
Although some labour groups, including the International Association of
Machinists which represents 15,000 TWA employees, are believed to have
agreed to the plan in principle, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, which
insures TWA's pension fund, has not yet agreed to the plan and several
unions are still negotiating.
The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents about 2,800 TWA pilots,
said it was participating in negotiations, 'but it's not a done deal yet'.
The pilots want assurances that they are participating in a viable airline.
'We don't want the airline to be sold out from under us if we reach an
agreement,' said Mr Marc Spiegel, ALPA communications chairman.
Another source of concern is TWA's pension plan, which is believed to be
underfunded by about Dollars 1bn. PBGC would oppose any proposal 'that would
break up the controlled group unless it provides adequate protection for the
pension plans', it said.
'We want to make sure that the current controlled group, including Carl
Icahn's controlled entities, stay liable for the Dollars 1bn under-funding
in TWA's pension plans. We will take what action we must to protect the
pension plans including termination, if necessary, as a last resort.'
When TWA announced its 'pre-planned' Chapter 11 filing in February, it said
Mr Icahn would give up his majority equity stake. The latest plan calls for
Mr Icahn to inject about Dollars 150m into the airline to keep it aloft
until it receives bankruptcy court approval. Mr Icahn would then become an
ordinary bond holder in the company.
TWA, the seventh-largest US carrier, has been almost crippled by debt
acquired in 1988, when Mr Icahn borrowed heavily to take the business
private.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Bond markets await debut of Treuhand: David Waller and Sara
Webb on the German agency's plans to raise DM10bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The after-shocks of German unification will reverberate around the European
bond markets once again this autumn. The Treuhandanstalt, the German
government agency charged with the privatising the east's old state-owned
enterprises, is due to make its debut in the bond market to raise up to
DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn).
The inevitable result of this and other cash-raising by the German
government or its agencies is continuing upward pressure on long-term
interest rates across Europe.
The DM10bn will not, in itself, test the patience of investors. Most bond
issues by the federal government are around the same size. However, it will
be an additional burden to what was already due to be a hefty borrowing
programme.
The Unity Fund, set up to support the new federal states in the east, has
already raised most of the DM25bn it plans to borrow this year. But almost
all of the federal government's fiscal deficit of some DM40bn has yet to be
financed. This demand for cash will make it harder - and thus more expensive
 -for other European governments to raise money.
When the Treuhand was set up in February 1990 by the East German government,
it had about 8,000 companies to sell, restructure or simply close. Following
reorganisation, this number increased to about 12,000. Of these, just over
7,600 have already been sold, raising DM29.3bn.
However, this is not enough to make the Treuhand self-financing. Analysts
estimate that the combined costs of restructuring companies, paying social
compensation and environmental costs, as well as rolling over old debt from
the state companies to the Treuhand far exceed revenue from the sale of
assets.
'Privatisation and restructuring of the former East German state-owned
properties will necessitate considerable borrowing by the Treuhand over the
next few years, both to fund continuing large cash deficits and to refinance
the former state-owned companies' existing debt,' according to Standard &amp;
Poor's, the international credit rating agency.
The Treuhand plans to tap the international capital markets towards the end
of September or early October, depending on market conditions. It wants to
borrow between DM8bn-DM10bn.
The bonds will be part of the Treuhand's own financing programme and will be
separate from other government-backed issues. These include bonds issued by
the Unity Fund, for which the outstanding volume at the end of May was
DM41.2bn.
Although, in theory, German government bunds and bonds issued by agencies
such as the German state railways or post office should be equally
attractive, investors prefer to hold ordinary government bonds as these are
much more heavily traded, and hence more liquid. As a result, government
agency bonds tend to trade at a slightly higher yield than the plain
government issues.
Steps have already been taken to prepare the way for the Treuhand issue. On
June 26, the government passed a law which permits the agency to use the
international capital markets. The government has set a borrowing ceiling of
DM30bn for 1992 for the Treuhand.
At the same time, the two leading credit rating agencies - Standard &amp; Poor's
and Moody's - announced they would assign their top ratings for debt issued
by the agency. The Treuhand already has a DM10bn German commercial paper
programme, of which about DM7bn has been issued. This existing short-term
debt has been assigned a top rating, and both agencies have said that bond
issues by the Treuhand would be rated Triple-A.
Because of the government guarantee, any creditor would have a direct claim
against the Federal Republic of Germany. As the Treuhand is due to be wound
down by the end of 1994, any outstanding obligations will be taken over by
the government.
At least one other important question remains. Treuhand bonds would be of
much greater interest to investors if they were 'deliverable' into the
German government bond futures contract traded on the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) - in other words, if they
could be used to settle bund futures contracts when they expire. The
Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options exchange, has already
taken this step.
Bond dealers hope that Liffe will amend its specifications to include
Treuhand bonds - which would almost certainly smooth the launch of the
Treuhand issue.
However, this autumn will be a testing time for the bond markets. The
Bundesbank's July 16 decision to raise the discount rate to 8.75 per cent,
coupled with doubts over the future of European economic and monetary union,
has shrouded the European bond markets in uncertainty.
'At the moment the whole of the market interest rate structure is in
disarray, so the Treuhand may be forced to wait for stability to return to
the markets first,' says Mr Michael Buneman, assistant vice-president at
Moody's German office.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRUCIAL talks on the future of the troubled European Fighter Aircraft take
place in Madrid today amid growing signs that both Spain and Italy are
losing faith in the Pounds 20bn four-nation project.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will fly to Madrid in the hope of
persuading Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, not to 'shut the
door' on joining the aircraft's production phase. Germany made clear in May
that it would not take part in the production of the aircraft, due to begin
next summer.
However, Mr Rifkind appears to face an uphill battle in his efforts to save
the project. UK industry officials believe the gloomy economic outlook is
now undermining the commitment of Madrid and Rome to Europe's largest
defence collaboration project.
Italy's new defence minister, Mr Salvo Ando, indicated yesterday that his
country was having second thoughts about the project, at least in its
present form. Speaking in Brindisi, he said the EFA 'needs the German
contribution (to the project)'.
Alluding to the Italian government's financial difficulties, Mr Ando said:
'If Germany has problems with costs, imagine the position of nations which
aren't adrift in gold, like Italy and Spain.'
Since Germany's announcement, the UK has fought to persuade Spain and Italy
to proceed with the aircraft as a three-nation consortium. Last month, Mr
John Major, the prime minister, wrote to Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish
prime minister, asking him to 'confirm publicly' his faith in the project
and a readiness to study the feasibility of production on a three-nation
basis.
However, Mr Gonzalez has so far failed to do so. Instead, the Spanish
government has appeared to offer tacit support to the German proposal that
the project, still in its development stage, either be adapted to build a
more modest aircraft or should be replaced altogether.
Under agreements reached last month, a team of civil servants representing
the four countries is looking at cutting costs. It is due to report in
October.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Italian rate cut as lira strengthens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy announced last night that it was cutting interest rates as
pressure on the lira eased in response to abolition of the scala mobile wage
indexation system.
The central bank said from today it was reducing the official discount rate
by half a percentage point to 13.25 per cent and the rate for fixed-term
advances to commercial banks by the same amount to 14.75 per cent.
The lira recovered strongly yesterday, breaking through the psychologically
important barrier of L755 to the D-Mark, to be fixed at L754.95, its best
level for weeks.
Shares on the Milan stock exchange also rebounded, jumping 3.7 per cent. The
Comit index closed at 416.64, up almost 15 points from Friday's close.
The improved tone in the markets follows Friday's agreement between
ministers, business leaders and trade unions to scrap the scala mobile,
which gave workers inflation-linked wage rises. The deal has reinforced the
view that the recently formed government of prime minister Giuliano Amato is
coming to grips with Italy's economic ills.
The Bank of Italy said the government's deficit trimming measures and the
scala mobile accord had given it room for interest rate cuts.
The lira has been under pressure during the past two months as speculation
mounted that it might have to be devalued against the D-Mark. The Bank of
Italy twice raised interest rates to support the currency.
Equity dealers described the agreement to end the scala mobile as historic,
even if many details of future wage bargaining arrangements have still to be
fleshed out. The deal is seen as an important step in reducing inflation,
improving productivity and boosting international confidence in the Italian
economy.
However, some brokers warned that yesterday's surge in share prices came in
a thin market, which was also affected by a breakdown of the screen-based
dealing system and signs of selling by some foreign investors.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Disarray deepens in Bush camp: President forced to disown
senior aide's savage attack on Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISARRAY in President George Bush's re-election campaign deepened
yesterday as he was forced to disown a senior aide's savage, personal attack
on Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.
A White House spokeswoman, travelling with the president in Georgia, said Mr
Bush was 'very upset' that Ms Mary Matalin, his political director, had
released a venomously worded document on Sunday which virtually accused Mr
Clinton of marital infidelity, among other sins. Ms Matalin had apologised
to Mr Bush for having overstepped the mark, the spokeswoman said.
Ms Matalin herself issued a statement that was barely an apology at all. She
merely regretted possibly leaving the impression that she had violated Mr
Bush's proscription on personal attacks, but added that she stood by her
criticism of Mr Clinton for 'unprecedented hypocrisy' and for disparaging
'in the most egregious and personal terms the president of the United
States'.
Until yesterday, it had appeared that Mr Bush's previously confused campaign
was finally beginning to take shape, with the president adopting a
relatively high road, attacking Mr Clinton only on policy issues, while his
surrogates went for the personal jugular.
Ms Matalin had been joined in this task by Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White
House press secretary. However, Mr Bush's disavowal of their unrestrained
approach may be no more than a temporary tactical retreat. It is still
expected that the presidential campaign will get dirty again in the three
months to go before election day.
The particular bone of contention was a 'news release' issued by Ms Matalin
in the form of a series of questions for Mr Clinton.
The last question read: 'Which campaign had to spend thousands of taxpayer
dollars on private investigators to fend off bimbo eruptions?' This was a
reference to a newspaper report that Mr Clinton had brought back a former
assistant to check the stream of allegations purportedly being peddled to
the tabloid press from women claiming to have had affairs with him.
Another passage ran: 'We respectfully request you and your fellow Democrat
snivelling hypocrites read our lips; shut up and sit down so we can get back
to more highlights of the Clinton record.' Mr Fitzwater's principal target
has been Senator Al Gore, Mr Clinton's running-mate, describing him as 'Mr
Sell-out America' for having criticised the president's performance at the
Rio environmental summit.
Then, last week, another spokesman commented on the fact that Mr Gore and
his family had taken counselling after their son was nearly killed in a car
accident, by saying: 'Real men don't get on the couch.'
How the low road plays with the electorate is anyone's guess. It is possible
that Americans are now more concerned with improving their own lives than
with revelations about another 'smoking bimbo', but if Mr Bush continues to
trail badly in the polls, it is hard to believe his campaign will not
resuscitate the 'character' issue.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The community revisited: Hazel Duffy examines shifting
strategies in urban regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mrs Gwendolyn Mayfield took over as principal of Fowler Elementary
school eight years ago, few parents ever came into the school. In this poor
part of Atlanta, schools are regarded as institutions and therefore not to
be trusted. Gradually she coaxed some of them to cross the threshold, even
to attend classes to learn the skills of being a parent.
Mrs Mayfield's efforts are part of an approach being used increasingly in
urban regeneration in the US and in Europe. Emphasis is being placed firmly
on recreating a sense of community in inner-city areas, rather than just
pumping in extra resources.
Community empowerment - or community development as the specialists prefer
to call it - is thought by many to be the strongest weapon in the efforts of
public and private sector groups to combat poverty and crime.
There is nothing new about the idea of community. John Gardner, a pioneer of
the community-building movement in the US, traces the strong sense of shared
values which existed in the past to the ties that people had to each other
in their villages back in Europe.
In the poorest areas, however, that sense of community has gone. 'They are
torn by everything from momentary political battles to deep and complex
ethnic rifts. Separate worlds live side by side but fail to communicate or
understand one another,' says Gardner.
The Los Angeles riots demonstrated the dangers arising from such bleak,
separate worlds. Other American and, increasingly, European cities know that
it could be their turn next. The familiar litany of American inner-city
problems - one-parent families, high unemployment, poor housing - is
repeated in many European cities. The educational and social problems
stemming from the growth in racial minorities in many cities accentuate the
difficulties.
Indebted, and therefore constrained in effecting change in their own right,
American city governments are turning increasingly to the big corporations,
voluntary groups, parents and schools to help build some sense of community
which has been lost in the violence and fear of ghettos.
A report to be published shortly by the Washington-based German Marshall
Fund identifies the twin themes of community and schools as potentially the
most powerful action points in the inner cities struggle. The report takes
six cities, three in Europe - Glasgow, Rotterdam, Frankfurt - and three in
North America  - Toronto, Chicago and Atlanta.
The cities reflect different cultures, levels of prosperity, racial mix, and
degrees of governmental and business support in dealing with their problems.
But each city has ideas of relevance to others.
The principals of two elementary schools - one in Rotterdam, the other in
Atlanta - demonstrate, for instance, how much greater is the task of
teaching children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Rene Vissesser, head of De Vlam School, has 175 pupils spanning 15
nationalities. Some of his teachers have to cope with half a dozen different
languages and customs although the government wants all subjects to be
taught in Dutch.
Mr Vissesser wants to get parents more involved in the school and to make it
a place where they can talk about the problems of adapting to Dutch society.
His first venture will be to open a restaurant as a non-profit-making
subsidiary to encourage parents to come into school after hours.
Gwendolyn Mayfield in Atlanta has used similar tactics. Spaghetti suppers,
talent contests and parents' days which offer trinkets as an incentive to
attend, are all part of the inducements.
Nearly all of her pupils are black. They live in the surrounding public
housing projects. In acknowledgement of the uphill task, she gets extra
staff and equipment, access to special teaching programmes for her staff and
volunteers who work as mentors with many of her pupils.
The help comes from government, Atlanta-based corporations such as
Coca-Cola, Bell South and IBM, and the prestigious Georgia Institute of
Technology across the street.
The plight of Atlanta's poor has been taken up in the past few months by
former president Jimmy Carter under the banner of the Atlanta Project. The
project unit plans to co-ordinate the provision of social services with the
diverse voluntary and business resources in the city, targeting
neighbourhoods in need. The plan again focuses on schools as the focal point
of organisation in each neighbourhood - elementary and middle schools form a
cluster with the high school at the centre.
Beyond the education system, the Dutch approach to building community is a
mix of carrot and stick. The 17 per cent unemployment rate in Rotterdam has
prompted the city to experiment with schemes to get even the most unlikely
job prospects back into work, as assistant caretakers, additional street
cleaners, and so on. Without work, it is hard to foster a sense of being
useful to the community.
Young unemployed people on training courses are closely tracked to make sure
that they attend and follow through with job interviews. If they refuse
three job offers, their social security is at risk.
Weaning people off welfare to make them more responsible for the way they
live, and to impart a greater sense of community into the areas where they
live, is encapsulated in the Social Innovation programme piloted by
Rotterdam city council and now taken up in other Dutch cities.
'Where governments have failed, there is much merit in giving the reins back
to people,' says Gerard Klein, director of the Rotterdam Social Innovation
unit. Giving schools over to parents and the streets to their residents
makes them more responsible. He thinks that there has been too much talk in
the past about peoples' rights, and not enough about their duties.
This may sound like the radical right. But Rotterdam's city government is
Social Democrat, and it deliberately invited leading members from the
opposition to take part in its social planning exercise in order to get
broad backing.
Community development is a long haul and the ground is infertile. To sustain
community, leadership has to be identified. Community workers - voluntary
and professional - must be trained to run the organisations. Leaders of
urban schemes say this is where business can help.
They also emphasise that commitment must come from companies, schools and
higher academic institutions to nurture the grassroots initiatives coming
out of communities. Such initiatives might then turn out to be a rare bright
spot in the cities of the 1990s.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Heat is turned up on debate over pay freeze: The British
government is facing pressure to limit public sector salary increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government appears increasingly like an embattled firefighter as it
fends off critics of its economic policy.
For much of last week it was pouring cold water on advice for it either to
devalue sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism or quit the system
altogether. Now it is having to turn its hoses on suggestions that it freeze
public sector pay or at least peg it to inflation.
Such ideas - which could affect up to 5.1m employees of central government,
local authorities and nationalised industry - have suddenly gained a
powerful head of steam.
Last week, Mr Howard Davies, the newly appointed director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, set the ball rolling by proposing that
public sector pay should bear the brunt of the government's efforts to hold
its 1993-94 public expenditure planning total at the Pounds 244.5bn level
agreed last November. Pleading for the government to channel resources into
investment and infrastructure he said: 'The government pay bill should not
increase at all in cash terms. Any increases in rates of pay should be
financed through improvements in efficiency or reductions in government
activity.'
At the weekend, another recent appointee, Mr John Townend, chairman of the
Conservative finance committee, suggested a public sector pay freeze and
cutting Pounds 500m from overseas aid to activate the housing market and
bring on economic recovery.
By yesterday, the bandwagon was running sufficiently strongly for Downing
Street to have to deny reports that Mr John Major was planning to veto
public sector pay increases higher than the rate of inflation.
At first glance, the idea of limiting public sector pay has certain
attractions. The government's finances are under serious pressure with the
public sector borrowing requirement expected to exceed its Pounds 28bn
target for this financial year. Such a move might also mollify Britain's
increasingly worried business community by showing that the government is
prepared to add teeth to its counter-inflation policy and shoulder some of
the burden of maintaining sterling's ERM parity of DM2.95.
But pay determination in the public sector is no easy matter. Different
categories of workers have differently structured arrangements and
bargaining procedures. Also, the Treasury, which negotiates with public
sector unions, is guided primarily by a need to recruit, retain and motivate
suitable staff. Heavy-handed intervention in public sector pay would
jeopardise its efforts to put greater emphasis on performance pay and
greater flexibility within centrally agreed pay settlements.
Any attempt to keep pay rises to below inflation would probably mean clashes
between the government on the one hand, and the public sector trade unions
representing more than 3m public sector workers and the review bodies that
recommend pay levels for a further 1.5m on the other. Pay freezes would make
conflict inevitable, with a possibility of industrial action.
However, any confrontation would be unlikely before next year. The public
sector pay round for 1992-93 is virtually complete. The first test of any
new government resolve would be in January next year when ministers decide
on the recommendations of the review bodies covering the armed forces,
teachers, senior civil servants, nurses and doctors and dentists, all of
which are due for implementation in April.
At present, expectations of public sector pay increases in 1993-94 are
running well ahead of the 3 per cent inflation rate that the government is
now thought to expect during that financial year. The Public Finance
Foundation, a research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance &amp;
Accountancy, expects a review body recommendation of 5.25 per cent for
teachers in 1993-94 and 5 per cent for armed forces personnel against a
likely out-turn of 4.75 per cent for all public sector workers.
In recent years, workers covered by the review bodies have fared
considerably better than the majority of civil servants and local government
workers, whose pay is determined by collective bargaining. There is,
however, nothing to stop the government ignoring the recommendations of the
review bodies, as it demonstrated last month when it cut pay rises of up to
24 per cent suggested by the Review Body on Top Salaries to 4 per cent.
But that decision was highly unusual and thought to have infuriated the
review body panel which made the recommendations. In the event, panel
members did not make their displeasure public; nor did any resign from the
panel. However, if the government were repeatedly to ignore the
recommendations of review bodies, panels would increasingly question their
role. Resignations and open criticism would doubtless ensue, bringing the
review body system into disrepute.
Confrontation with the broad mass of the government's employees would be
messier still. A pay freeze for the police, firefighters and the majority of
civil servants would involve the government in breaking long-standing
agreements with these groups of workers.
Police pay increases have been linked to the rise in average earnings in the
economy for nearly 15 years. The government has already placed this system
under review, causing rumblings of discontent among the police.
Union leaders representing firefighters have frequently threatened
industrial action in defence of their pay formula which links fire pay rises
with the highest quarter of manual male earnings in the economy.
On the other hand, the continuing recession is sapping the militancy of the
public service trades unions. This summer, leaders of the National Union of
Civil and Public Servants were rebuffed by their 114,000 members when they
urged them to strike over a 4.5 per cent pay offer.
It is clear, however, that public sector pay has become a major
preoccupation of ministers as they struggle to find ways of keeping their
spending within the targets set for the coming financial year. The sheer
size of the overall paybill, which in 1990-91, the most recent year for
which figures are available, amounted to Pounds 33.7bn for central
government and Pounds 32bn for local government, is a reason enough for a
cash-strapped government to put pay under special scrutiny.
Despite the known Byzantine tendencies of Whitehall and Westminister, there
is no reason to doubt that Downing Street's denials of a prime ministerial
veto over pay are genuine. But the government will be determined to keep the
future increases in public sector pay bills as low as possible - and the
mere floating of the pay freeze idea has served notice on Treasury, review
bodies and unions to prepare for an extra-tough pay round between now and
next spring.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Letter: Earth Summit sceptics miss the point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC ORTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The prevailing dismissals of the Earth Summit, reconfirmed by David
Lascelles ('Hot air in Rio sows green seed', Business and the Environment,
July 29) disserve the business readership.
The summit's most lasting achievements are not the biodiversity and global
climate treaties, but agreements on foundational principles to guide future
international environmental initiatives.
Sceptics ignore two documents establishing these principles: the Rio
declaration and Agenda 21.
Notably, Agenda 21, a consensus statement of more than 500 pages, emphasises
the 'crucial' role business must play in attaining 'sustainable
development'. (The suggestion that sustainable development is 'a flawed
concept, if not an actual contradiction in terms' itself assumes a
contradiction: the long-term viability of non-sustainable development.)
Environmental concerns are no passing fancy (witness Senator Al Gore's
selection as US vice-presidential nominee).
Instead of simply listening complacently to reports of weak treaties, while
remaining deaf to an increasing volume of evidence which indicates a global
consensus on the urgency of environmental issues, prudent businesses should
instead adopt appropriate, well-considered, proactive environmental
policies, in advance of fast-changing national and international regulatory
regimes.
Those businesses that do not adapt are likely to find themselves quickly
disadvantaged in competition with other companies ahead of the game (for
example members of the Business Council for Sustainable Development).
The inevitability of growing environmental controls, coupled with increasing
consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and production,
renders exclusive focus on short-term financial costs of new environmental
regulation anachronistic.
Agenda 21 directs business to join affirmatively with government, academia
and international organisations to provide flexible, workable solutions to
environmental issues that do not, in the end, only affect someone else, but
instead affect us all. Business should heed the call.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The delicate art of persuasion: Italy's government has yet
to convince investors of its commitment to budgetary reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS

<TEXT>
Summer heat and tourists are usually enough to persuade the citizens of Rome
to head out of town. But Italy's current economic crisis means there are no
holidays for government ministers and Treasury civil servants this year.
Mr Giuliano Amato, prime minister for a month, has acted fast since he came
to office. Last Wednesday, he hustled through parliament, using a vote of
no-confidence, an emergency budget package which includes L30,000bn of tax
increases and spending cuts.
Yesterday's half-point cut in the discount rate (the rate at which Italy's
central bank lends to commercial banks) to 13.25 per cent is a reward for
such swift action. But the financial markets remain unconvinced that Mr
Amato has either the courage or the political clout finally to bring the
budget deficit under control without resorting to inflation and devaluation.
Investors are still commanding higher short-term interest rates than at any
time since 1986, despite the easing of rates over the past week. This rise
in rates has happened at precisely the time when a new government appears
determined to cut the bloated public sector and when parliament may be too
weak to oppose such reform.
'We are paying the price in high interest rates for past inaction at the
very moment when we have a government prepared to do something,' argues Dr
Fabrizio Sacconmanni, head of the Bank of Italy's foreign department.
In addition to its emergency package, the government has started to tackle
the public sector. Privatisation remains a long-term goal, but transforming
the four large nationalised concerns to joint stock companies under Treasury
control is a necessary first step. The abolition of the system of indexing
wages to the inflation rate, the scala mobile, confirms that both employers
and trade unions recognise the need for change.
But for all its tough talk, the Amato government has yet to prove decisively
that it has broken with Italy's dismal tradition of overborrowing.
Successive governments, unable to cut spending or raise taxes, have closed
the budget through borrowing and inflation. Repeated attempts to cut the
budget deficit have been sabotaged in parliament. This year's package has
avoided that fate, but is too small to stabilise Italy's rapidly expanding
government debt, let alone set it on a downward path.
The package contains largely temporary measures while leaving important
areas such as Italy's generous pension system virtually untouched. Despite
its L30,000bn of cuts, it will leave the deficit some L30,000bn higher than
was originally envisaged for 1992.
So Italy's public debt will remain high. At a little over 100 per cent of
gross domestic product it places a heavy burden on the budget and causes
severe problems. The larger the debt, the greater the interest payments. The
Italian Treasury expects the primary budget deficit, which excludes interest
payments, to show a small surplus of L8,000bn this year. But interest
payment on past debt will amount to L171,000bn, converting this small
surplus into a budget deficit of 10.8 per cent of GDP.
Therefore, the government's fiscal strategy is still vulnerable to the mood
of the market. The recent rise in short-term interest rates is having a
devastating effect on the budget deficit: 28 per cent of the government's
debt is financed by three-month Treasury bills. The Treasury forecasts
assume average short-term rates of 13.5 per cent this year. Every percentage
point on short-term rates increases debt interest by a further L15,000bn.
Short-term rates eased slightly to close yesterday at 15.7 per cent.
The financial markets had been losing patience with successive governments
before Mr Amato took office. They have been stepping up demands for higher
interest rates as the price of investing in Italian government debt and
because they feared a government might devalue the lira and pursue an
inflationary economic course.
Until the Danish referendum rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union, with its austere limits on budget deficits, Italy's politicians
appeared to have an incentive to control public spending. Since the
ratification of Maastricht now appears in doubt, the markets suspect that
Italy's politicians may not be willing to undertake the tough measures
needed, under the convergence criteria of the treaty, to bring the economy
into line with the rest of the EC.
The rise in interest rates since the Danes voted no is more than offsetting
the impact of the government's emergency package. Perversely, the higher the
Bank of Italy pushes up interest rates to persuade investors that the
government will use spending cuts rather than inflation and devaluation to
fund the deficit, the larger the fiscal adjustment needed to stabilise the
debt, and the more nervous the markets become.
For interest rates to fall decisively, the markets must believe that the
government is getting the budget under control. 'There is a risk that the
package will not be seen as a strong signal,' says Dr Stefano Micossi,
research director at Confindustria, the employers' association. Mr Stefano
Patriaca, economics director at CGIL, the largest trade union, agrees. 'You
cannot simply touch things up. You have to go to the heart of the problem
and close the deficit.'
Treasury officials reject the criticism that they are going too slowly. The
government promises its public sector reforms will be placed before
parliament in early September. 'We have spent the last 10 years worrying
about the next six months,' argues Mr Franceso Giavazzi, its chief
economist. 'In the past, we have introduced temporary measures which never
deal with the source of the problem.'
In an effort to prevent parliament thwarting its structural reforms, the
government intends to bring in next year's budget without the customary
detailed discussions. It will ask parliament only to agree the budget's
broad principles, leaving it to work out the details. The aim is to reduce
the budget deficit from 10.8 per cent of GDP this year to 10.2 per cent next
year, and 8.3 per cent in 1994.
The government needs to persuade parliament to accept next year's budget
plans in early September, to convince investors that it is serious about
tackling the budget deficit and thus to encourage them to accept lower
interest rates. For now the government has little option but to bear the
pain of high rates.
A devaluation now, before the 1993 budget package has parliamentary
approval, would spell disaster. A weaker government would be sorely tempted
to turn to direct monetary creation by selling debt to the central bank.
This would lead to a loss of confidence, devaluation and possible
hyperinflation soon afterwards. Both the government and the Bank of Italy
say they are committed to maintaining the lira within its current ERM bands.
'The immediate impact of devaluation would be a loss of credibility,' says
Mr Sacconmanni. The Treasury agrees. 'Now it would be the worst possible
thing that could happen to the budget.'
Yet were the Amato government to be defeated in parliament through a vote of
no-confidence, and to step down, a devaluation would probably be inevitable.
'We are close to the end of the line,' says Mr Giavazzi of the Treasury. 'If
things do not go through parliament then the next thing that happens is a
really big financial crisis.'

FT  04 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Balkan refugees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations conference last week on how to deal with the problem of
Yugoslav refugees did not come up with any ready-made solutions. But it has,
at least focused governments' attention on an increasingly critical
situation, demanding urgent action.
It is all the more unfortunate that the donor countries have been unable to
reach a genuine consensus. Those such as Germany, Austria and Hungary, which
have offered asylum to hundreds of thousands of former Yugoslav refugees,
understandably feel that the burden should be more equitably shared between
countries.
Others, such as Britain and France, which have already absorbed a large
numbers of immigrants from their former colonies, do not want to open their
doors to a new flood of refugees, particularly during a recession.
Critics of Germany's proposal that refugee quotas should be fixed for each
host country argue that transporting hundreds of thousands of refugees
abroad merely plays into the hands of the Serbs, whose policy of expelling
Croats and Moslems is designed to create ethnically pure regions. But the
alternative favoured by most nations, the creation of
internationally-protected 'safe zones' in the former Yugoslav region, also
has some serious drawbacks.
The danger is that the Serb policy of 'ethnic cleansing' has already gone so
far that it will become impossible for most Moslem refugees ever to return
to their homes. There is also a risk that the protected zones may become
semi-permanent fixtures, like the Palestinian camps in Lebanon, at a huge
cost to an already overburdened UN.
Given the urgency of the situation - shelter will have to be provided for
some 500,000 Bosnian refugees next winter - all countries should be prepared
to make an additional effort to take in refugees pending a move on the safe
zones.
Washington's decision to offer Bosnian refugees 'temporary protected
status', is a formula which even Britain and France should find it possible
to accept.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Personal View: A high-price market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the evidence that prices of many products are higher in the UK than
in the US and other European countries has recently been discussed in the
Financial Times.
The OECD's purchasing-power parity exchange rates confirm that only some
goods - notably cars and electrical equipment  - are relatively expensive in
the UK. This raises the suspicion that special rather than general features
of the British market may explain the high prices. One of these factors
might be agreements among suppliers to restrict competition. But, as was
shown by a recent investigation by the British Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
into the price of compact discs, the OFT lacks the legal powers to find out
whether such agreements exist.
Legislation to give the OFT such powers was proposed in a white paper in
1989, but the Conservative government has not considered this reform
important enough to be included in its legislative programme - even though
it was promised in its election manifesto. The weaknesses of UK competition
policy extend beyond the powers of the OFT. The Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC), the main investigatory body under the existing law, has
proved to be ineffective when faced with well-defended monopolies.
The most necessary reform is to give the OFT power to investigate whether
restrictive practices exist - for example, by raiding the offices of
companies to remove files which might contain incriminating evidence. The
OFT presently has to rely on information that is publicly available or is
volunteered by companies it investigates. Not surprisingly, these sources do
not reveal whether companies operate a cartel or just price leadership.
The second reform needed, but one not proposed in the white paper or the
election manifesto, would be to create a more effective body than the MMC.
The MMC can at best be described as unprofessional and at worst incompetent.
It suffers from the fundamental defect that decisions are made by part-time
commissioners, while its research is done by the full-time staff. This
separation between investigators and decision-takers reduces the
effectiveness of the investigations. The MMC findings also suffer from the
rigid legalistic approach with which they are conducted, and by their
division between studies by the staff and hearings conducted by the
commissioners. The commissioners may be more influenced by what they hear
from the witnesses representing the companies being investigated, than by
the evidence collected by their staff. The subjects of the investigation are
often surprised by the ease with which the MMC accepts their arguments.
A depressing aura of mediocrity hangs over the MMC and its staff. Neither
businessmen nor civil servants regard it as a desirable posting, so the
quality of both commissioners and staff suffers.
The first weakness would be rectified by the the proposals in the white
paper which would bring the treatment of restrictive practices within the UK
into line with that in the European Community. But the changes should be
supplemented by the creation of an agency to take over the work of the MMC.
The reform might be best achieved by enlarging the OFT to form a UK
equivalent of the German Cartel Office. Like the Cartel Office, the UK
counterpart should be staffed by lawyers, economists and others with
experience of industry who can devote all their time to their job, and who
are therefore better placed to take informed judgments than the part-time
members of the MMC.
As in Germany, there should be the right of appeal from this new body to the
courts; but unlike Germany there should be no provision for ministers to
override its decisions. Competition policy should be based on economic
principles and decisions taken by a quasi-judicial process. Political
intervention will reduce confidence in the impartiality and consistency of
the decisions.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK minister responsible for competition policy,
appears not to rank an effective competition highly among his priorities.
But he may change his mind when he learns more about British industry.
Excessive competition has not been cited an an explanation of poor
performance in British industry. Indeed the improvement in British
performance in the 1980s seems closely related to the more intense
competition of those Thatcher years.
Comparison with far eastern countries such as Japan and Hong Kong show that
domestic competition is much more intense than in the UK, and is one of the
more plausible explanations for these countries' rapid growth. Many
manufactured consumer goods are cheaper in the Far East, and the US, than
they are in the UK. Mr Heseltine should consider whether he is happy that
the UK should be a high-price economy, or whether he would prefer to attack
this culture by launching a more effective competition policy.

Town Hall (BBC 2, 9.45) is finally picking up the following, and the rave
reviews, it deserves. The attraction of this fly- on-the-wall documentary
about Lewisham Council is that it switches between the arid, devious,
bureaucratic, political meetings of councillors and staff to the realities
of their decisions. This week the subject is the budget for educating
children with special needs, which is badly over-spent. Why it matters comes
to life when you see Christopher, who bites other children and who will cost
Lewisham Pounds 100,000 in care over five years.
There is another gripping documentary on ITV at 9.00. First Tuesday follows
the story of two Siamese twins from Ireland. Their parents have to decide
whether the little girls should be separated. Most surviving Siamese twins
are happy to stay joined, but these two have distinct internal organs and
might survive the operation.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Arts: Face facts, new visions of the visage - Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARINA VAIZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO EYES, a nose and a mouth, five dashes placed in a circle: a face is what
most of us first see - and first try to depict. We gaze into the faces of
others, look at our own in the mirror, cover ours with all kinds of things,
from make-up to sunglasses to beards, depending on sex and culture. And we
assume that we know each other's attitudes and feelings by interpreting the
almost infinite range of expressions which the face, with its elaborate
muscular structure, is capable.
The face, stripped bare - the skull  - is the ultimate momenti mori. So it
is inevitable that the face should be currently undergoing, on the outskirts
of Paris, deconstruction and reconstruction in an enthralling anthology, A
Visage de Couvert (The Naked Face) at the Cartier Foundation at
Jouy-en-Josas until October 4.
Here, among other things, are tattooed Maori faces, the life mask of William
Blake as the subject of painting by Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol's smiling
Jackie in diptych and organic masks all put together beyond any framework of
historic, chronological, geographic or cultural categories. The collection
is billed simply as '200 masterpieces from every civilisation' and described
as 'witnesses to the philosophical and aesthetic interrogation that man has
always had with his own image'. The French are hardly given to
understatement.
There is a fascinating paradox at the core of the exhibition. The faces are
not presented as portraits and the subjects are rarely named. If identified,
most mean little: for example, Robert Mapplethorpe's powerful photograph of
a black face with its eyes closed - a living mask - is named as Ken Moody.
And yet from the extraordinary Sang mask from the Gabon to 19th century
bronze caricatures by Franz Xaver Messercshmidt to Picasso's cubist head of
a man, the parade faces, however stylised, satired and stereotyped, is a
procession of remarkable individuality.
Even the Malevich suprematist face - two squares, a rectangle and a curve in
black (the ultimate smile) floating in a white rectangular space - seems
cheeky and smart and proves that revolutionaries can relax.
The exhibition is dramatically shown in three separate sections apportioned
among three free-standing galleries in the spacious gardens of the Cartier
Foundation, opened by the company in 1984 to show thematic art exhibitions
to the public. Occasionally the sense of chic occasion has overwhelmed the
art: last summer's meditation on Vitesse (Speed) was long on presentation
and short on substance. Not so with The Face: divided into sections called
The Grammar of the Face, Uproar, and Silence, there is plenty of room for
the spectator to respond to a rich display in various media, including
holograms and video.
The heads are almost exclusively frontal views. Appearances range from the
startling smears of paint used like muddy cream by Frank Auerbach for his
obscure emotionally telling portraits of his friends to the colourful and
sinister watercolour heads by Francesco Clemente; a gouache and glued paper
portrait by Paul Klee vividly evokes a face with orange blobs for eyes and
nostrils set in to a grey oval, a contrast to the radiant liveliness and
immediacy of the second century Egyptian Fayum portraits of a young man
which have adorned his coffin.
This is a primitive and sophisticated mix, and what becomes clearest of all
is the surprising perversity of modern times. There are surprisingly few
female faces on view.
Many of the modern and contemporary artists as seen here defy history by
cultivating the childish, affecting a knowing, sly innocence. They focus on
anxiety and alienation, their images are fragmented and broken down,
distorted and deliberately obscure.
The stark simplicity, coupled very often with elaborate decoration, of the
masks and faces of North American Indians, African tribes and the classic
perfection of antiquity, still have a persuasive power. After this
extraordinary immersion into faces across human history, destroyed and
reassembled, our own will never look quite the same again.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: EC law extends UK Social Security
obligations - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TWO recent judgments, the European Court of Justice has clarified the
application of community and UK social security rules in the contexts of
family credit and income support.
In the first case, the ECJ ruled that family credit was a social security
benefit which could be claimed by a worker from the national authority of
the member country in which he worked even when resident in another EC
state.
The court said that this also meant that the spouse of the worker who had
never been resident or employed in the country in which the worker was
employed could claim the worker's rights to family benefits for the members
of his family to which he would otherwise be entitled.
The case concerned a civil servant who worked in Northern Ireland but lived
with his wife and family in the Republic of Ireland. The wife claimed family
credit to bring the family's income up to the minimum level of entitlement
because her husband's earnings were at the time in question below the
relevant threshold.
As a result of the court's ruling she should be paid family credit by the UK
authorities rather than be left to claim any benefits available in the
Republic of Ireland.
This decision may be short- lived. A recent EC regulation will require
benefits in these circumstances to be paid by the authorities of the country
of residence. However, the situation could remain uncertain until any
challenge to the validity of the new regulation has been made through the
national courts.
Case C-78/91, Hughes v Chief Adjudication Officer, Belfast, ECJ FC, July 16
1992.
IN THE second case, the ECJ held that EC rules on equal treatment of men and
women in matters of social security and regarding access to employment and
vocational training did not apply to UK supplementary allowance or income
support. Income support was previously known as supplementary allowance.
The court said, first, these benefits were not directly and effectively
linked to protection against the social security risks covered by the equal
treatment rules.
Second, the fact that entitlement to income support may depend on conditions
which may affect access to part-time employment or vocational training by
single parents was insufficient to bring the benefits within the scope of
the EC rules.
The subject matter of the UK benefit scheme is the provision of income
support for persons of insufficient means to meet their needs, not access to
employment etc.
Joined Cases C-63/91 and C-64/91, Jackson and Cresswell v Chief Adjudication
Officer, ECJ FC, July 16 1992.
French overseas departments import charges unlawful
THE ECJ has condemned the charges imposed on imports into the French
overseas department ('DOM'), Reunion, which were not imposed on domestic
Reunion products.
The question of interpretation of EC law on the free movement of goods arose
in refund proceedings before the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal (Reunion)
brought by importers of cars from Germany and Sweden.
The court held the charges infringed the Rome Treaty rules which prohibit
charges equivalent to customs duties and a similar rule in the EC Trade
Co-operation Agreement with Sweden.
However, it limited the retrospective effect of its ruling to prevent
financial difficulties for the Reunion co-operatives which had previously
benefitted from the revenue. No refunds need be made by the Reunion
authorities to parties who have not already filed their claims.
Case C-163/90, Administration des douanes et droits indirect v Legros and
others, ECJ FC, July 16 1992.
Conditions for late collection of import levies
THE COURT interpreted various EC rules applicable to the collection of
unpaid import levies on agricultural products in circumstances where the
national authority responsible had made an error regarding the import
certificate.
The Belgian authorities claimed unpaid import levies on eggs which the
importer had declared at a lower amount in accordance with pre-fixed
certificates which turned out to be issued unlawfully.
While pointing out to the Belgian Court of Neufchateau that the regulation
whose interpretation it had sought was irrelevant, the court said the
regulation did not prevent later claims by the importer for repayment of
sums wrongly paid to the authority.
However, under the applicable EC rules, it was for the national court to
assess whether the tests for preventing national authorities from claiming
extra payments, resulting from their own error, were satisfied.
In the absence of fraud or a mistake by the importer, factors such as the
obviousness of the error and the importer's size and experience had to be
examined by the national court before deciding that it was reasonable for a
national authority to claim payment.
Case C-187/91, Belgium v Societe Co-operative Belovo, ECJ 6CH, July 16 1992.
National cheese additives rules upheld
THE ECJ dismissed cases brought by the European Commission against rules
banning imports of cheese with nitrate additives in Greece, Italy and Spain.
The court ruled that the commission had ignored the tests of legality for
national food additive laws established in previous cases.
According to relevant EC rules, the member states' obligations were merely
to establish an authorisation procedure for food additives and ensure there
was a right of appeal in the event of refusal.
The commission had not suggested there was any infringement of these rules.
As a result, the court was not in a position to rule whether national rules
on additives infringed Rome Treaty rules on free movement of goods.
Cases C-95/89, C-293/89, C-344/90, Commission v Italy, Greece and Spain, ECJ
FC, July 16 1992.
THIS report completes the coverage of the vacation judgments given by the
European Court on July 16 1992, after the formal end of its summer sittings.
The next report will cover the first week of the new sittings starting on
September 14 1992.

An entry into the antiques trade is easy. Making it pay - especially during
a recession - is more difficult. The basic requirements are hard work,
experience, knowledge, flair, and considerable capital.
There are three paths for those who want to become an antiques dealer but
are lacking experience: a course at a college or university; a practical,
hands-on apprenticeship working as an assistant to a dealer; or a job as a
saleroom porter. There are many courses for students who want to pursue a
career in antiques. The British Antique Dealers' Association (Bada) can
supply details.
Finding a job in an antiques shop can be difficult because most dealers rely
on the grapevine to obtain new staff.
For this reason, many antiques experts started as porters in the big auction
houses where they were able to handle valuable antiques and gain experience
at the same time.
Others decide to go it alone, buying antiques on their own account and
opening a shop or even a stall. Some dealers have become successful without
formal qualifications, but many fail.
To avoid being duped into buying fakes and forgeries from the unscrupulous,
the safest way is to buy from one of the 400 British antiques dealers who
are members of Bada. These dealers provide an after-sales service and seek
to build long-term relationships with clients. They also offer advice on the
restoration of antiques.
For all dealers, financial backing is paramount. Many ventures have failed
because would-be dealers underestimated the capital needed to cover start-up
costs. To stock a basic market stall can cost up to Pounds 10,000. The best
place to set up a stall is at one of the large antiques markets or one-day
antiques fairs that are advertised in the local press.
Salesmanship is vital in the trade. Having an esoteric knowledge of netsuke
and English silverware is all very well, but you also need to be able to
translate that knowledge into a tempting sales pitch.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Not all brute force and ignorance -
Weightlifting is full of surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the men in leotards stepped up to the platform the other evening,
dusted their hands with talc and tightened the belts around their waists, I
expected a show worthy of a circus.
Weightlifters, after all, are the strongest men in the world, the kind of
physical oddities commonly found in the company of bearded ladies and
two-headed calves. I anticipated bulging muscles, heaving shoulders and
quivering biceps - a show of brute strength. A show is what I got, but not
the one I expected. Weightlifting is full of surprises.
My first surprise was that muscles, shoulders and biceps were not what I
ended up goggling at. It was faces. The event was the final for lifters
weighing up to 100kgs - some of the heavy boys of the sport  - and so a lot
of muscle was on display. But the struggle recorded in the lifters' faces
was compelling. Their features form a record of intense struggle,
determination and anguish.
Every weightlifter has a different set of facial contortions, vocal
expressions and body mannerisms registering the tremendous depth of power
being summoned.
Denis Garon of Canada, for example, contemplates his weights with pursed
lips and a long look of intense concentration before a lift. When the moment
of effort comes, the tendons in his neck stand out like tent ridge-poles,
his forehead takes on the appearance of a corrugated iron roof, his mouth
opens wide and a tiny, strangled 'Ah]' escapes.
Japan's Yoshimitsu Nishimoto, on the other hand, remains serene and
Buddha-like throughout his performance. He gazes at the audience
impassively, throws an inscrutable glance at his weights, and then without a
flicker of emotion goes to work, raising 165kgs of steel over his brush-cut
head.
For sheer spectacle I liked Waldemar Malak best of all. A crop-skulled
22-year-old Pole with a raw, farm boy's face, he treats the barbells like a
personal enemy.
He comes on to the platform forcing short, sharp breaths of air through
clenched teeth. He growls at the audience, growls at his weights, mutters
Polish imprecations, and then with a tremendous 'Yaaaaagh]' drives the
barbells into the air, turning the colour of a good Polish beet in the
process.
Such aggressiveness pays off: Malak won a bronze medal, lifting a combined
total in the snatch and clean-and-jerk events of 400kgs. Two Unified Team
lifters, Russian Victor Tragoubov and Ukrainian Timour Taimozov, took gold
and silver respectively with combined lifts of 410kgs and 402.5kgs.
My second surprise was that weightlifters do not look the way I thought they
would. Bulging, rippling muscles - like walnuts stuffed into a condom, as
Clive James once remarked - are not in great evidence in weightlifters. They
are the trade-mark, rather, of the cosmetic body-builder.
Weightlifters do have tremendous muscle power, but not where you might
think. It is not the arms, shoulders or torso that do most of the
weightlifter's work - their main task is holding the barbell in place once
it has been raised.
By far the greatest part of the power that drives a 200kg barbell from the
ground into the air over a weightlifter's head comes from the quadriceps in
his thighs. Iraq's Nazar Kadir has quadriceps so big they bulged a good inch
or two out over his elastic knee supports. Frenchman Francis Tournefier
looked as if he has had metal bars surgically inserted under the skin of his
thighs.
Another surprise was that weightlifting is not a matter of brute strength
alone, nor even a question of technique added to strength. A good part of
the weightlifter's skill is cerebral. Not all weightlifters read Proust, but
behind the contorted faces and tremendous physical effort lies great mental
discipline.
My final, and perhaps biggest, surprise came after the event was over. At a
press conference I asked gold medal winner Tragoubov what his feelings were
about Andrew Saxton, the British weightlifter who would have been competing
against him that evening had he not been withdrawn for the use of
performance-enhancing clenbuterol.
To the champion it was all news; until that moment he had not heard of two
British weightlifting drug disqualifications in Barcelona. None the less, he
rallied to Saxton's defence. It was distressing to hear such news, he said,
but perhaps there had been some mistake.
What has provoked scandal, shame and endless moral navel-gazing in Britain
has caused little disturbance elsewhere. In most foreign newspapers, the
withdrawal of Saxton and Davies has earned a line or two at the bottom of
the inside sports page. In weightlifters' locker rooms at Barcelona, it
seems, it has not even caused a ripple.
The truth is that in the weightlifting world drug abuse is commonplace, as
the 1988 Seoul Olympics showed. The Soviet Union's Aleksandr Kurlovich not
only won a gold medal in the super-heavyweight class, but set an Olympic
record. He had previously been arrested in Canada for importing steroids,
banned, then reinstated.
His two main competitors at Seoul, another Soviet and a Bulgarian, withdrew
from the competition, presumably because of last-minute fears of improved
drug-testing techniques. When two Bulgarians were subsequently discovered to
have used steroid-masking diuretic drugs, the Bulgarians withdrew their
entire weightlifting team from the Seoul Olympics.
Seen from outside the UK, the British weightlifters' withdrawal is,
unfortunately, a comparatively minor affair. Nor are the days of drug abuse
in the sport over. Not long before the Barcelona Olympics began, Wally
Holland, president of the European Weightlifting Federation, expressed his
concern over the use of a new generation of performance-enhancing drugs.
This is a sport full of surprises. The most disturbing is that such
temptations continue to make strong men weak.

British Prime Minister John Major will attend the Barcelona Olympics on
Friday and Saturday, partly to push Manchester's bid to stage the Games in
the year 2000, British officials said.
Major, a keen sports fan, will also assess the kind of services a city must
provide when playing host to the Olympics. Major will meet Juan Samaranch,
President of the International Olympic Committee, as well as the Barcelona
organisers and members of the British team.
The officials conceded that last week's withdrawal of three British Olympic
team members because they had failed drug tests might affect Britain's
chances of staging the Olympics.
Beijing, Berlin, Braslia, Sydney, Milan, Istanbul and Tashkent are also
bidding to host the 2000 Games.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: New kings of middle distance - Even
Qatar is making strides as a running power and could emulate Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER Javier Sotomayor, the high jump world record holder, became the first
Cuban man in 16 years to win an athletics gold medal at the Olympics, he
walked out of the arena in tears. At the entrance to the tunnel he was
embraced by a Cuban official.
The ubiquitous television camera was on hand to catch the touching scene.
Suddenly, the face of the older Cuban appeared 30ft high on the huge screen
at the Montjuic stadium. One after another, journalists in the press stand
stopped tapping furiously at their computers and gazed up for a moment. A
murmur went along the press bench: 'Alberto Juantorena.'
In Montreal in 1976, Alberto Juantorena became the first man since Paul
Pilgrim in 1906 to win both the 400 metres and 800m at the Olympics. (Ann
Packer of Britain, another 400m specialist, had won silver in the 400m and
gold in the 800m in Tokyo in 1964).
Juantorena was also the first 800m champion from outside the US, Britain or
Australasia. He had hardly run the 800m before the Games and when he broke
the world record in the final it seemed the 800m would be transformed
forever.
The 800m had been dominated by middle-distance runners with a kick. They
would spend 600m jostling for position and then sprint off the final bend.
Juantorena started his sprint on the first bend.
But the future belonged to the man who came fourth, Britain's Steve Ovett,
and his ilk: runners who could stay with a fast pace and still accelerate at
the end. Ovett won Olympic medals in the 800m and the 1,500m in Moscow in
1980, as did his compatriot, Sebastian Coe. Said Aouita of Morocco won the
5,000m in 1984 and came third in the 800m in Seoul. The middle-distance
runners had reclaimed their race.
Even in Seoul, when Paul Ereng of Kenya, another former 400m runner, won the
800m, he ran a tactical race. His better-known team-mate Nelson Kiprotich
sacrificed himself by setting a sharp early pace for Ereng. On Sunday, Ereng
trailed in last in his heat. A former champion struggling to recapture his
greatness is a sorry sight. When that champion is burnt out at 25 it makes a
particularly pathetic spectacle.
But even while Ovett, Coe and Peter Elliott were regularly appearing in two
middle-distance finals, things were changing. In Los Angeles and Seoul,
Joaquim Cruz of Brazil won medals in the 800m and then failed to appear for
his 1,500m races. In Los Angeles, Ovett regretted not following this
example. The 1,500m final was his seventh race in nine days. He was carried
from the track on a stretcher.
As recently as last year, at the world athletics championships in Tokyo, the
800m was squeezed in early in the Games schedule and then, following a brief
respite, the 1,500m starts.
When the Barcelona timetable did away with that separation, and increased
the gaps between rounds, nobody complained. None of the eight men who
advanced from the 800m semi-finals on Sunday night were even entered in the
1,500m heats yesterday morning. Tony Ward of the British athletics team said
that Peter Elliott might have considered the 800m-1,500m double if he had
been in top form. But Elliott is absent, injured, and so, yesterday morning,
was the great Aouita.
Aouita's injury and Ereng's elimination mean none of the Seoul medallists in
either race will reach a Barcelona final. The 800m final tomorrow will be a
contest between the old and the young.
There are three veterans of the 1988 final who are unlikely to have another
chance. Johnny Gray of the US, the perennial front-runner always passed in
the final dash for medals, is 32. Kiprotich and Jose Luis Barbosa of Brazil
are both 31. Their chief rival on past form is William Tanui, 28, another
Kenyan. But the fastest qualifier was Curtis Robb, 19, the rapidly-improving
Briton.
The 1,500m heats are a poor indicator of form. It is possible to finish
seventh, as Edgar Martins de Oliveira of Brazil did yesterday, and still
advance. The key is to set a fast pace from the start, squeezing the
no-hopers out of the pack like peas from a pod.
Pop] There goes a Laotian. Pop] There goes a Rwandan. And - in yesterday's
first heat - Pop] There goes Briton Steve Crabb, suddenly 20m adrift and
battling Kim Bong-Yoo of Korea for eighth.
Qatar's Sulaiman Mohamed ran a perfect race in the final heat, pulling the
train along for nearly four laps while one runner after another tumbled out
of the guard's van. He was caught on the line by David Kibet of Kenya but
the heat was the fastest.
Qatar has never had an Olympic athletics finalist, though they have Lee
Evans, the Mexico 400m champion, in Barcelona as a coach. Al-Raheem Talal
Mansoor missed a place in the 100m final by 0.01 seconds. Muftah Ibrahim
Ismail qualified for tomorrow's 400m final by coming third last night in his
semi-final heat and now Sulaiman gives them a third chance to break their
duck.
You read it here first: in athletics, Qatar is about to become the Cuba of
the Gulf.
One of the legacies of Coe and Ovett is the large and noisy contingent of
British athletics fans in the Montjuic stadium every day, cheering their
heroes. Yesterday they were in place promptly at 10am, drenched by a storm,
ready for the start of the 200m heats.
As Linford Christie, Britain's 100m champion, won his heat on cruise
control, he was greeted by a roar. But the fans saved their biggest and
warmest reception for Kris Akabussi as he made his ungainly but effective
way over the obstacles in the 400m hurdles.
Afterwards, the fans joined the gaggle of Britons haggling for tickets in
the Olympic souk that has developed outside the main complex.
There is plenty of Olympic action to come.

FT  04 AUG 92 / 'Sick building' ills defy diagnosis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTENSIVE research has found no identifiable cause or cure for 'sick
building syndrome', according to a report by the Health and Safety
Executive, Catherine Milton writes.
An HSE review published yesterday says the cause of the syndrome - in which
office workers blame buildings in which they work for symptoms such as
headaches, dry throats, mental fatigue and dizziness - remains a mystery,
and the syndrome is unlikely to go away in the short term.
The Institution of Environmental Health Officers said last year that local
authorities had received a total of 500 sick-building complaints. The HSE
said the issue was hard to quantify because some workers might not blame
their offices for the symptoms.
Dr Pam Buley, a senior health policy official at the HSE, said the situation
was 'as confused as ever', in spite of extensive research.
She said: 'Sick building syndrome is often associated with air-conditioned
buildings and seems to affect women more than men, especially workers who
are in a building for a long time.'
She said the complexity of the issue meant that a quick answer was unlikely.
The report says the syndrome occurs in even the best-designed buildings.
Poor air quality and inadequate ventilation, high temperatures and bad
lighting have been identified as risk factors.
The HSE is funding research at London University, which is comparing the
sickness and absence data of more than 10,000 office-based civil servants
with measurements of environmental factors and building maintenance records.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Will privatisation deliver the goods?: Andrew Bolger on the
parcels industry upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parcels industry faces upheaval with British Rail's parcels division and
Parcelforce, the Post Office's delivery service, due to be privatised.
The move is not entirely unexpected, but the timing of both announcements -
just before parliament rose for the summer  - still came as a surprise and
has sent managers, employees and prospective buyers into a huddle trying to
assess the implications.
All agree that crucial decisions remain to be made about how those parcels
operations can be separated from their parent organisations.
Parcelforce delivers 750,000 parcels daily, giving it a leading 34 per cent
share of the market for ordinary parcels delivered later than next day - but
it has only 2 per cent of the premium 'next day' market, which is most
attractive to the private sector.
The Post Office is split into Parcelforce, which employs 12,500 people; the
Post Office Counters division; and the Royal Mail, which handles letters.
Parcelforce lost Pounds 24m on turnover of Pounds 508m in the year to April,
but that compared favourably with the previous year's loss of Pounds 131m,
and the operation was profitable in the second half.
The greatest buyers' interest will focus on Red Star, BR's express parcels
service. Although BR's parcels division lost Pounds 34.7m last year, Red
Star is one of the leading carriers of express parcels.
TNT, the international transport group, said it was interested in the BR and
Parcelforce businesses, but awaits further details.
Securicor Omega Express said it was interested in operations that offered
business-to-business services, such as Red Star. It was less attracted by
delivering to domestic addresses, which had lower price margins and the
difficulty of catching people at home. Parcelforce delivers to almost all
the UK's 24m homes.
Many observers believe Parcelforce is likely to become the subject of an
employee/management buy-out, as the National Freight Corporation was in
1982. Announcing the Parcelforce decision, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, said financial support would be available so that
management and employees could bid - although rival bids would be
considered.
Mr Heseltine also insisted that there would continue to be a universal
parcel service at a uniform and affordable tariff. 'That is not negotiable,'
he told MPs. Under questioning, he suggested that some of the responsibility
could be shared with Royal Mail, which already delivers for Parcelforce in
remote areas.
DHL International, the air express company, said privatisation would produce
a fairer, more competitive environment by preventing the Post Office from
cross-subsidising its parcels service with profits made by Royal Mail.
Private companies say that Parcelforce will have a big advantage if it
retains access to its 18,500 existing 'retail outlets' - post offices all
over the country.
Prospective buyers might also face heavy investment demands. In April,
Parcelforce announced a five-year plan to invest Pounds 250m in new
vehicles, depots and information technology. Mr Heseltine has said such
investment would be a decision for new owners.
These opportunities for purchase and investment in the UK parcels business
do not come at a good time for the international operators in the sector,
which have seen profits cut by recession. Earlier this year US parcels
carrier Federal Express pulled out of all European domestic and regional
activities, including the UK domestic express market.
Last autumn DHL disposed of its UK overnight delivery company Elan through a
management buy-out. DHL said it was keeping an open mind about the latest
sell-offs, but wanted more detailed government proposals. Having focused on
the international market, it is likely only to be interested in
business-to-business services for those clients who want deliveries in the
UK.
Other potential bidders might include United Parcels Service, the US company
that in June bought Carryfast, the UK's largest privately owned express
delivery company. UPS seems likely to concentrate on bedding in its
acquisition before taking on any more business in the UK.
The unanswered questions are best illustrated by Rail Express Systems, the
other part of BR's parcels division, which mainly carries letters for Royal
Mail. As a loss-maker, how would it fare if split from the more attractive
Red Star? What deal would a prospective buyer strike over trains and track
fees with BR, which itself faces privatisation? Only when the full
privatisation packages have been unwrapped will the serious bidding begin.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Agency has surplus of Pounds 1.56m: Companies House freezes
fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES HOUSE, the government's company information agency which is
subject to a review that may lead to privatisation, reported a surplus of
Pounds 1.56m in the year to March 31, compared with a deficit of Pounds
6.59m in the previous 12 months.
The annual report and accounts, which have been prepared along the lines of
a private company for the first time, left the agency with a retained
surplus of Pounds 421,000 after paying a dividend of Pounds 800,000 to the
Treasury to reflect past investment.
Fees and charges rose from Pounds 20.17m to Pounds 32.35m last year, while
expenditure rose from Pounds 26.63m to Pounds 30.95m. The agency says there
will be no increase in fees during the current year, and that it will be
launching two new computerised services: a register of corporate mortgages
and one of directors and secretaries.
It has cancelled its ambitious image-based search system, on which it has
spent more than a Pounds 1m. This would have allowed documents to be stored
and read electronically, but it says the system is not financially viable in
the current economic climate. Against the four performance objectives
announced by the minister of corporate affairs in May 1991, it reports that:
80.5 per cent of British companies' accounts and annual returns were filed
on time by mid June, compared with a target of 85 per cent.
93 per cent of documents were made available to the public within the
planned five days after their receipt from companies. The average document
processing time is 5.8 working days.
Unit costs were reduced by 2 per cent, compared with a target of 1 per cent.
99.8 per cent of company searches for customers were achieved within the
planned two hours. The hope is to reduce the time to one hour by April 1994.
Companies House, which is an executive agency under the government's Next
Steps initiative, was granted trading agency status last October, giving it
considerably greater flexibility and responsibility than other parts of the
Civil Service.
The accounts show assets of Pounds 24.06m, including Pounds 2.68m in
intangible assets which reflects capitalised development expenditure.
The contribution paid to the Department of Trade and Industry for company
regulation and the development of company law fell to Pounds 17m from Pounds
18.7m the year before.
The salary of the chief executive for the last six months of the year is
Pounds 26,000, including pension contributions.

FT  04 AUG 92 / London health authority urges hospital closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROGRAMME of hospital closures is proposed in a report from North West
Thames Regional Health Authority to the government inquiry into future
healthcare in London.
'Looking forward to 1996, it is clear that the present pattern of hospital
services in west-central and north-west London is unsustainable,' the
authority says in evidence to the inquiry.
It proposes the withdrawal of accident and emergency services from Charing
Cross Hospital, in Hammersmith, by 1994. There should be only two accident
and emergency departments in west-central London - at St Mary's Hospital,
Paddington, and the new Westminster and Chelsea Hospital - and many other
services could be accommodated at those hospitals.
Surplus sites would include Westminster Hospital; Westminster Children's;
the West London; the Western Ophthalmic; the Samaritan; and part of St
Charles Hospital.
Charing Cross is, the report says, threatened by the government's internal
market in healthcare although it might prove 'more stable than many other
London teaching hospitals'. An appraisal exercise being undertaken by the
authority will develop firmer proposals on the allocation of services to St
Mary's and Westminster and Chelsea, and 'consider the future of Charing
Cross in more detail'.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is awaiting a report on London's
health provision from Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern
Regional Health Authority, in the autumn. It is likely to recommend hospital
closures with resources diverted to family doctor and community services.
The North West Thames report is the latest indication that health
authorities are planning on the assumption that the Tomlinson inquiry will
lead to a big cut in hospital beds. A report from South East Thames Regional
Health Authority last week raised the possibility of the closure of either
St Thomas' or Guy's - two of the capital's most famous teaching hospitals.
London has more hospital beds than the national average but family doctor
and community services are relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
inner-city areas. The need for rationalisation has become urgent because of
last year's health reforms. New funding arrangements are leading to health
authorities in outer areas sending fewer patients to the central London
teaching hospitals.

FT  04 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt drops on fears of
Lombard rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate fears weighed on Frankfurt yesterday, but Paris and Milan
jumped on domestic developments, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT weakened on fears that the Bundesbank may be forced to lift the
Lombard rate at Thursday's council meeting. While most analysts think this
is unlikely, the market has become so nervous that the slightest rumour is
enough to drive prices down. Renewed pressure on Allianz and Deutsche Bank
led the FAZ index down 5.06 to 631.84 at midsession, while the DAX index
ended down 20.71 at 1,594.71, its lowest close for seven months. Turnover
was a low DM3.8bn after DM4.6bn on Friday.
Allianz remained vulnerable, reaching an intraday low of DM1,722 before
recovering slightly to close down DM60 or 3.3 per cent at DM1,777. Deutsche
Bank worsened, losing DM12 to DM637 ahead of tomorrow's half-year results
which are expected to be disappointing. Dresdner Bank, which reports today,
was down DM2 at DM325.
Among car makers, BMW continued to outperform, up DM3.80 at DM556.80. James
Capel in London issued a sell note on the stock yesterday, following a visit
to the company on Friday. The broker forecast that BMW's earnings growth in
1992 and 1993 will be stunted by weakness in the dollar against the D-Mark,
a less favourable model and engine mix, falling Japanese sales and a higher
tax charge.
Lufthansa was again weak after last week's announcement that it was to shed
some non-profitable US routes. Its shares fell DM9.50 or 8.7 per cent to
DM100.
PARIS jumped on news that an opinion poll showed 57 per cent in favour of
the Maastricht treaty. But analysts warned that the market was being driven
by sentiment rather than fundamentals and that a rally could be short-lived.
The CAC-40 index finished 29.77 or 1.7 per cent higher at 1,784.44 in
moderate turnover of FFr1.5bn.
Financials were lifted by a strong bond market as Societe Generale rose
FFr26.60 or 5.9 per cent to FFr475.60 and UAP recovered from a low of
FFr275.50 to close FFr3.40 down at FFr393.10.
LVMH was another winner, rising FFr156 to FFr3,736 but Euro Disney failed to
join in the rally, losing another FFr1.20 to FFr83.80.
MILAN jumped 3.7 per cent following the well-publicised agreement between
the government, trade unions and employers to scrap wage indexation. There
were hopes that the accord would allow the Bank of Italy to cut interest
rates. The Comit index rose 14.92 to 416.64 in turnover estimated at around
L100bn after Friday's L87.4bn.
Traders attributed most of the rise to professional short-covering, and to a
slight improvement in attitude from domestic investment funds. But there was
virtually no foreign interest, apart from some residual selling. Fiat rose
L244 to L4,624, Montedison rose L70 to L1,190 and Generali rose L175 to
L27,520.
Due to a breakdown in the computer trading system, closing prices of the 35
shares listed on the system had to be fixed by traditional open outcry at
the end of the session.
The Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino, created by a merger between
the two regional banks, made its debut on the main market yesterday. It
closed L120 higher at L13,670.
ZURICH's SMI index lost 3.2 to 1,794.9 in quiet trading. Nestle bearers fell
SFr130 to SFr9,240 and its registered shares lost SFr70 to SFr9,250.
BRUSSELS was weaker, and trading in Clabecq was temporarily suspended after
the steel maker predicted heavy 1991-92 losses. Clabecq closed BFr250 or
19.2 per cent lower at BFr1,050. The Bel-20 Index lost 7.48 to 1,137.78.
Electrabel bucked the trend, gaining BFr40 to BFr4,550 in spite of the
government announcing in its budget package yesterday that it plans to levy
a new fixed tax on electricity producers.
AMSTERDAM enjoyed a stronger day, the CBS Tendency index rising 0.4 to
116.6.
Akzo gained Fl 2.70 to Fl 146.50 ahead of today's half-year results which
are expected to be positive. Philips, which reports on Thursday, improved 50
cents to Fl 24.50.
STOCKHOLM slipped in featureless trading. The Affarsvarlden General Index
eased 2.3 to 859.4 in thin turnover of SKr182m. Astra continued to dominate
trading, as the A share slipped SKr1 to SKr558.
The dollar-sensitive forest sector fell 1.4 per cent while the wholesale and
retail sector posted the session's best result, up 1.6 per cent as Hennes &amp;
Maurtiz rose SKr4 to SKr139.
OSLO's all-share index fell 2.15 to 381.01 in turnover of NKr52.92m, the
lowest since September 1988. Uni Storebrand free A shares fell NKr3 to NKr25
on news of its planned share issue.
VIENNA's ATX index slumped 15.71 or 2 per cent to 766.91 on news of further
developments in the finance ministry inquiry into possible insider trading
in OMV shares in late June and early July.
ISTANBUL eased ahead of today's publication of July inflation figures. The
75-share index closed 7.95 lower at 4,256.18.

TIN prices slumped in kerb trading on the LME, with a sharp fall in the
final minutes leaving the market testing key support, dealers said.
Three-month metal moved below Dollars 6,800 a tonne and then tumbled to
Dollars 6,750, the day's low and a Dollars 75 loss from Friday. Traders will
be looking to see if key support at Dollars 6,750 holds, but the market's
technical picture has recently turned bearish. Apart from the late sell-off,
tin was featureless throughout the session -- as were many other metals,
with physicals quiet at this time of the year, dealers said. COPPER prices
declined - news that Polish copper workers were willing to suspend their
stoppage undermined the market, which is increasingly factoring in a
settlement soon. London COCOA prices edged ahead, but with no fundamental
support. 'The market is currently in a conflict between buyers and sellers.
On one side we've got the fact the Ivorians were back in the market last
week, while on the other, there are uncertainties such as the dry weather in
west Africa,' said one dealer. Estimates of how much cocoa has been sold
from the Ivory Coast in the past week range between 10,000 and 35,000
tonnes.

<TEXT>
A REGULATION forcing brokers to complete settlement four business days after
trading could lead to some securities houses being suspended, brokers in
Jakarta have warned.
The regulation, which came into force yesterday, was drafted by Bursa Efek
Jakarta (BEJ), the private managers of the Jakarta stock exchange. Under it,
securities houses failing to settle or report to BEJ within the four-day
period face suspension while settlement remains outstanding.
'The aim is to nip in the bud incipient skulduggery. It doesn't, however,
take into account how long settlement can take,' explained one foreign
broker. Most brokers accept some delays in payment or receiving share
certificates as inevitable.
The Jakarta stock exchange is not computerised and clearing relies upon
Jakarta's banks.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the Australian investment
company which owns Bell Resources, faces repayments of ADollars 19.2m plus
interest to European retail investors, following a decision in the British
Court of Appeal last week.
The court found that the issuer's option to call a Dollars 200m convertible
Eurobond issued by Bell Resources Financial Services did not override the
investors' put option, set at a higher price.
'We believe the decision removes a degree of uncertainty from the market
(for investors holding bonds with put options),' said Mr David Newport, an
executive in the distressed debt division of Bankers Trust, which acted in
conjunction with the Law Debenture Trust Corporation on behalf of
bondholders.
Burton, the UK retailer, has already amended the documentation of a similar
deal, to clarify bondholders' rights to exercise the put option, he added.
Directors of ACIL may seek leave to appeal against the decision in the House
of Lords, following last week's overturning in the Court or Appeal of an
earlier decision in the High Court in 1991.
ACIL directors said yesterday that, acting on legal advice, they had not
provided for the Dollars A19.2m in the company's latest accounts. 'The
company is obtaining legal advice as to its legal position, including the
prospects of appeal to the House of Lords,' they said.
The dispute arose when bondholders last year tried to exercise the put
option providing for early repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par
value on November 13, 1991. Instead, bonds were redeemed at 103 per cent of
their par value, when the company exercised its call option.

FT  04 AUG 92 / International Bonds: IADB set to launch Dollars 500m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) plans to launch a Dollars 500m
offering of long-dated bonds later this month. The agency, which has not yet
decided whether to tap the US Yankee or the Eurobond market, will take bids
this week from seven firms under the new syndicate structure set up in May.
The IADB has so far raised Dollars 2.6bn of its Dollars 5.5bn borrowing
programme this financial year, which runs to the end of the calendar year.
Of the agency's remaining Dollars 2.9bn funding requirement, the IADB needs
about Dollars 800m in dollars, Dollars 1.2bn in yen and Dollars 900m in
D-Marks or Swiss francs, according to Mr Carlos Santistevan, treasurer.
However, the agency may borrow in other markets and swap the proceeds into
the required currencies.
Elsewhere, the Eurobond market started August, traditionally its quietest
month, in a subdued manner. Abbey National took advantage of stronger demand
for floating-rate paper to launch a Dollars 100m structured FRN, arranged by
Merrill Lynch, with a minimum coupon of 5 per cent, and a step-up maximum
coupon.
Mitsubishi Bank raised Dollars 520m of lower tier 2 capital through two
offerings of fixed-rate subordinated bonds via a financial subsidiary.
British Gas announced plans to set up an Ecu1.5bn Euro-medium term note
programme, to be signed in early autumn.
The company's first MTN programme, arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation,
represents 'an extension of the facilities available for funding,' said Mr
Arthur Burgess, group treasurer of British Gas. The company will channel
some of the funding it has previously carried out in the Eurobond market
through the programme.

FT  04 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Syndicated loans sector
tapped by EC for Ecu499m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community is tapping the international syndicated loans market
for the first time in a decade - and at the most tightly priced terms in
recent loans history.
The Ecu499m, three-year loan, which is being arranged by Credit Lyonnais,
carries a margin of 3.125 basis points - or   1/32 of a percentage point
over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). In addition, the
participating banks will receive fees of 10 basis points.
As recently as last week, bankers forecast that the EC would probably have
to pay a margin of between 10 and 20 basis points over Libor. Pricing in
terms of margins and fees has climbed steadily over the last two to three
years, reflecting bankers' concern over the cost of capital. However, as one
German banker pointed out, the EC is a triple A rated borrower which is zero
risk weighted for capital adequacy purposes.
The EC traditionally prefers to borrow in the international bond markets
where it can raise funds at sub-Libor rates. In this case it has had no
choice but to tap the syndicated loans sector and risk paying a higher
interest rate. That is because the proceeds of the loan will be used to
finance imports of agricultural and medical products by the former Soviet
republics.' It was necessary to have the flexibility to accommodate the way
the funds are going to be used,' said Mr Antoine Albert Bloch, the EC head
of borrowing, yesterday.
In contrast to a bond where all the proceeds are paid at once, with a loan
the borrower can draw the proceeds as and when they are required.
Bankers yesterday described the loans pricing as 'tight'.
The facility is due to be signed on August 14 and may be drawn with effect
from August 20.
The EC last tapped the international syndicated loans market in 1983 with a
Dollars 1.24bn term loan.

welcomes CFTC decision
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGED futures funds industry has welcomed last week's decision by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to ease regulations on
sophisticated investors who participate in commodity pools and funds.
Known as rule 4.7, the measure exempts highly-accredited investors, or what
the CFTC calls 'qualified eligible participants,' from the normal rigorous
and time-consuming disclosure, reporting and record-keeping requirements
that would apply for such investments.
The industry had long pressed for the rule change, which is comparable to
the Securities and Exchange Commission's 'accredited investor' rule,
applicable for securities investments exclusively regulated by the SEC.
Commodities pools and funds are jointly regulated because, while they
contain futures, they are securities vehicles.
The CFTC's original proposal for rule 4.7 included a stricter definition of
qualified eligible participants. Individual investors had to have at least
Dollars 5m in assets, and at least Dollars 1m in initial margin monies on
deposit with futures brokers. These amounts have now been reduced to Dollars
2m in assets and Dollars 200,000 in margins.
For institutional investors, the original proposal required Dollars 10m in
assets. This has been reduced to Dollars 5m. In addition, foreign investors
can now be defined as qualified eligible participants even without passing
the asset tests.

<TEXT>
ASTRA International, Indonesia's second largest company, has announced that
Mr William Soeryadjaya, its chairman and main shareholder, is stepping down.
The move follows speculation that the Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per
cent of Astra, is preparing to sell up to half its stake.
Astra, which has a market capitalisation of Rp2,882bn (Dollars 1.4bn),
accounts for almost half of Indonesia's vehicle sales and, brokers say, is
among the country's best-run companies. There has been concern, however,
that Astra could be affected by losses suffered by Bank Summa, part of the
Summa Group privately-owned by the Soeryadjaya family.
Brokers say the Soeryadjaya family has recently injected more than Rp550bn
of capital into Bank Summa to compensate for a fall in value of property
investments. At a press conference last week, Mr Soeryadjaya said he wished
to concentrate fully on the Summa Group and to underline that no linkages
existed between the two businesses.
The new chairman of Astra is to be Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, a former
Indonesian economy minister and close associate of President Suharto. Mr
Djojohadikusumo said he had consulted President Suharto and government
ministers before accepting the post.
Brokers recently downgraded 1992 net profit forecasts for Astra from Rp150bn
to about Rp120bn, as against Rp210bn last year. Sales in the first quarter
of this year were down 35 per cent on the same period of 1991.
Mr Djojohadikusumo's priority is likely to be the search for new investors.
Toyota vehicles make up about half of Astra's sales but Toyota has denied an
interest in buying a stake.
Astra is to hold an extraordinary meeting on September 18 to authorise
changes on its board.

The offer, equivalent to Kwong's closing share price on Friday, triggered

93 cents, respectively.
Kwong Sang Hong, which has consolidated net tangible assets of HKDollars

FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: Seoul clears the lines for
mobile phone explosion - John Burton looks at the consortia vying to
challenge a state-owned monopoly and the potential market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of three South Korean consortia, each supported by foreign partners,
will be selected this month to compete against Korea Mobile
Telecommunications Corporation (KMTC), one of the country's most profitable
companies, in the country's lucrative mobile telephone market.
Competition between state-owned KMTC and a private operator is expected to
lead to explosive growth of South Korean mobile telephone services. Turnover
is expected to reach USDollars 3bn by 2000, up from Dollars 300m this year,
as the number of subscribers climbs to 4m from 200,000 now.
The earnings performance of KMTC indicates the potential rewards the Korean
cellular phone market could offer. Established in 1984 as a state monopoly,
KMTC ranked seventh in terms of profits among listed Korean companies last
year, with earnings of Won42.7bn (Dollars 54.2m), and sixth in terms of
sales growth, with turnover increasing by 105 per cent to Won147.3bn.
KMTC's high profit margins reflect its ability to share administrative costs
with state-run Korean Telecom, which holds 65 per cent in KMTC. But its
profit-to-sales ratio of nearly 30 per cent will shrink as it increases
research and development and capital investments, and it cuts charges
because of increased competition.
The predicted increase in mobile telephone use is like-ly to benefit foreign
telecommunications equipment suppliers because South Korea lacks the
necessary technology. AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US now provide the switching
equipment. Motorola is a leading supplier of handsets, while its Korean
rivals, Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Electronic Industries, assemble
cellular phones from imported components.
The ability to transfer foreign technology will be an important factor in
determining which consortium will be chosen by the Ministry of
Communications (MoC) to operate the country's second mobile telephone
network. The winning consortium will also be expected to help fund the MoC's
Won72.2bn research on mobile telecommunications.
More advanced digital mobile telephone technology is needed to replace the
current analog system. This will improve the performance of the mobile
telephone network and relieve a threatened shortage of circuits in Seoul by
1994, when the second network starts operating. Cellular telephone
connections are difficult in mountainous South Korea, with only one out of
every three attempted calls being completed.
The participation of foreign companies, which can have a maximum
shareholding of 33 per cent in a consortium, will bolster the financial
ability of their Korean partners to build the second cellular network, which
will cost at least Dollars 1.3bn. There are seven foreign telecommunications
operators taking part in the bidding, including British Telecom and
Vodafone.
Banks, usually barred from taking direct shareholdings in Korean companies,
are being allowed to participate in the consortia to increase their
financial strength.
The MoC banned Korean telecommunications equipment manufacturers from
heading any consortium on anti-trust grounds, although they may have minor
shareholdings. The domestic companies leading each of the consortia are
limited to 30 per cent stakes.
However, it may not be technological and financial factors alone which
determine which consortium will win the contract. The political opposition
contends that President Roh Tae Woo's outgoing administration is using the
mobile telephone contract to reward companies supporting his party in this
election year.
Most observers were not surprised when Sunkyong, the country's
seventh-largest business group, and Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company (Posco), the
leading national steelmaker, were recently selected as finalists for the
franchise out of six contenders. Both have close ties with the government.
One of the sons of Mr Chey Jong-hyon, Sunkyong chairman, is married to the
daughter of President Roh. Mr Park Tae-joon, Posco chairman, is one of the
three co-chairman of the governing Democratic Liberal Party.
'It would be embarrassing if either of them won because it would appear to
confirm charges by our opponents that political favouritism is involved. But
the truth is that they are also probably the best qualified companies in the
competition,' said a government official.
A preliminary evaluation of the competing consortia announced last week
found Sunkyong to be most qualified in financial and technical terms,
followed by a group led by the Kolon business group and Posco.
A second evaluation this month will examine the construction and
installation proposals of the three groups before a final decision.
Sunkyong's Greater Korean Telecom consortium is led by Yokung, its oil
refining subsidiary, supported by state-run Korea Electric Power and Korea
Long-Term Credit Bank. Lucky-Goldstar, which manufactures telecommunications
equipment, is also affiliated with this consortium.
Its foreign partners include mobile telephone operator Vodafone of the UK,
GTE of the US and Hutchinson Telecom of Hong Kong. Sunkyong has also been
gaining experience in managing cellular telephone systems by participating
in a joint venture with US Cellular in the US.
Posco, in which the government holds 35 per cent, views cellular
communications as part of a diversification strategy, which includes
expanding into the semiconductor and specialty chemicals sectors. It is
seeking the contract through its Posdata subsidiary, established in 1989 to
develop communications technology and computer software.
Posco is supported by several of Korea's biggest conglomerates, including
Samsung, Daewoo, and Hyundai. Its foreign partners in the New Century
consortium are Pacific Telesis, a US Baby Bell, and Mannesmann, a German
private mobile telephone network operator.
The Kolon consortium is being supported by British Telecom and Nynex,
another Baby Bell operating in New York.
The selection of Kolon as a finalist was surprising, because Toray, the
Japanese textile group, is the largest shareholder in Kolon Industrial, the
textile subsidiary heading the bid, with a 17 per cent stake.
The South Korean government is sensitive about Japanese ownership of
strategic businesses due to its colonial history.
The three consortia recently eliminated from the mobile telephone
competition included: Dongbu, linked with Bell Atlantic; Tongyang with US
West; and Ssangyong, Korea's fifth-largest business group, supported by
Swedish Telecom and Southwestern Bell of the US.

<TEXT>
COLES Myer and Woolworths, Australia's two largest retailers, have announced
improved sales for the latest financial year, against the trend of a
depressed retail sector.
The larger Coles Myer unveiled a modest 1.6 per cent rise in sales to
ADollars 15.18bn (USDollars 11.32bn) for the year to July 26, from ADollars
14.94bn a year earlier. This performance was easily surpassed by Woolworths,
part of the Adelaide Steamship group, with an 11 per cent advance in sales
to ADollars 9.18bn for the year to June 23, from a lower base of ADollars
8.27bn.
Woolworths, due to be floated by Adsteam later this year, also announced a
13.1 per cent rise in earnings before interest in tax to ADollars 247.0m
from ADollars 218.4m. Coles Myer's earnings will be announced on September
10.
Mr Paul Simons, Woolworths chairman, said all divisions had improved market
share with sales growth ahead of inflation. He said the supermarket
division, the company's core business, had raised its national market share
to 30.22 per cent from 28.66 per cent.
Mr Peter Bartels, Coles Myer chief executive, said the company's sales
increase would have been 3.9 per cent excluding New Zealand businesses -
mainly Progressive Enterprises - which were sold during the year. But he
warned that profit margins were still under considerable pressure from
widespread discounting. A performance breakdown showed that the fourth
quarter was by far the strongest, with Australian sales increasing 6.5 per
cent to ADollars 3.64m from ADollars 3.42m.
Bridge Oil, an Australian oil and gas producer, yesterday reported that
production fell 2.7 per cent to 5.08m barrels of oil equivalent in the first
half to June 30, from 5.22m barrels a year earlier, AP-DJ reports. Revenue
from petroleum sales fell 6.5 per cent to ADollars 84.5m in the six months,
from ADollars 90.4m in the year-earlier period.

SKIS Rossignol, the French company which is the world's largest ski
equipment manufacturer, continued its recovery with a 27 per cent increase
in turnover to FFr319.6m (Dollars 63.92m) in the first quarter of this
financial year.
The increase in sales for the three months to June 30 was fuelled by the
group's success in the Winter Olympics, where 18 medal winners used its
skis. Skis also benefited from the cold weather in Europe's skiing resorts,
which produced a marked improvement in demand for ski equipment after
several successive seasons of warm winters and snow shortages.
The spate of warm winters, combined with the effects of the economic
recession, has pushed Skis Rossignol, which also makes tennis and golf
equipment, into the red. The group recently announced an unexpectedly high
loss of FFr53.9m for the year to March 31, against a higher loss of
FFr140.8m the previous year.
Mr Laurent Boix-Vives, chairman, has forecast a return to profitability this
year, helped by cost-cutting and productivity improvements.

against Arthur Andersen

<TEXT>
The Resolution Trust Corporation, the government agency handling the
clean-up of the US savings and loan (S&amp;L) industry, has filed a Dollars 400m
lawsuit against Arthur Andersen.
It is alleging that negligent audit work by the big accountancy firm
contributed to the collapse of Benjamin Franklin Savings Association, a
large Houston-based savings and loan.
Andersen said that it would fight the case vigorously, and denied that it
was negligent during its auditing of Benjamin Franklin between 1984 and
1988.
The firm said the S&amp;L's failure, which cost US taxpayers almost Dollars 1bn,
was related to the collapse in oil prices in 1986 and other economic forces
which were affecting the Texas region at the time.
The RTC, however, alleges that Andersen agreed to the use of accounting
devices by Benjamin Franklin's management that kept the company's
deteriorating financial condition from regulators.
While the case is pending, the RTC is reconsidering its relationship with
Andersen. The accountancy firm is one of the biggest contractors for the
agency.
The RTC has instructed its regional offices not to award new work to the
firm until the Benjamin Franklin case is resolved.
And Arthur Andersen has been asked to discuss its existing contractual
relationships (which are worth about Dollars 38m if completed) with the
government agency.
This is not the first time that Andersen has run into problems over its work
in the S&amp;L industry during the 1980s.
In March, the firm agreed to pay a total of Dollars 30m to settle investor
claims from the collapse of the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
Other big accountancy firms and a number of legal firms have also faced
lawsuits over their role in the collapse of the savings and loan industry.

CONSOLIDATED pre-tax profit of Baer Holding, the Zurich banking group, fell
13 per cent to SFr59m (Dollars 430m) in the first half of the current year,
mainly because of a sharp drop in income from securities trading.
Baer said income from securities trading tumbled by 36.9 per cent to SFr44m,
mainly because high interest rates discouraged investors from the equity
market.
Net commission income increased by 11.7 per cent to SFr91.4m, reflecting
good progress in portfolio management and investment fund business while net
interest income was flat at SFr53.4m.
The result, after other income of SFr16.5m, was a 3.3 per cent decline in
total income to SFr205.3m.
Consolidated total assets stood at SFr6bn at June 30, up 6 per cent from the
end of last year.
The value of clients' assets entrusted to the Julius Baer group rose 5 per
cent to SFr31.3bn, and the total assets of Baer Group investment funds
climbed 25 per cent to SFr2.5bn.

move by Pirelli

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOSTILITIES between Continental and Pirelli, two big European tyre
companies, flared up again yesterday as Pirelli launched legal action
designed to nullify the outcome of the Continental's annual meeting in
Hanover last month.
At this meeting, Pirelli was outmanoeuvred for the second year in a row in
its attempt to overturn voting restrictions at the German company. Mr Ulrich
Weiss, chairman of Continental's supervisory board and a director of
Deutsche Bank, then simply declared that Pirelli was not entitled to vote
its full holding.
Pirelli, which owns 5 per cent of Continental directly and has options over
a further 34 per cent, is maintaining it should have been able to vote the
entire stake. Had this been the case, it argued yesterday, voting
restrictions would have been overturned and the meeting would not have
granted approval to Continental's management, as is required under German
corporate law.
The legal challenge was not unexpected. At the meeting last month, Mr Gert
Silber-Bonz, chairman of Pirelli's German operations, delivered a furious
denunciation of Mr Weiss's tactics and said Pirelli would challenge the
outcome of the meeting in the courts.
Pirelli said yesterday that Continental had been wrong to say that the
shares held under option by Pirelli and Mediobanca, its banking associate,
should be aggregated with Pirelli's direct share stake for the purposes of
voting right restrictions. 'The call options were normal call options,' the
Italian company said yesterday. 'It has never been maintained by any
authority on German law that call options are a basis for aggregation.
Therefore all votes at the general meeting should have been counted.'

toymaker

<TEXT>
PLAYMATES, the Hong Kong manufacturer of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles toys,
will pay HKDollars 235m (USDollars 30m) for a 35.31 per cent stake in Ideal
Loisirs, the leading French toymaker which owns licensing rights to Babar
the Elephant.
The deal marks a big push by Playmates, which makes most of its products in
China, into the European market. Last year, Europe accounted for 12 per cent
of its HKDollars 3bn sales, compared with 84 per cent in the US.
Playmates saw sales fall last year and earnings tumbled from HKDollars
1.22bn in 1990 to HKDollars 882m in 1991. However, thanks to the Turtles, it
still had a war chest of HKDollars 1.5bn to invest in new, more lucrative
concepts.
Mr Thomas Chan, managing director, said the investment in Ideal Loisirs was
part of the group's expansion plans. The deal is expected to be signed in
November.
'Working with Ideal Loisirs will increase our involvement and insight
through to the retail level of the European toy market,' he said.
The acquisition allows Playmates to recoup some of the 25 per cent of the
profits which accrue to French vendors of its Ninja Turtles toys, but it is
also seen as a defensive move.
Playmates is highly dependent on the US market. It is therefore vulnerable
to US policy towards China - in particular the withdrawal of Beijing's 'most
favoured nation' status - as it manufactures most of its products in China.
Ninja Turtles have been one of the world's most successful toy ranges since
the late 1980s. Their success turned Playmates into the world's most
profitable toy group. But the Turtles have fallen victim to the fickle
buying habits of their young consumers. Sales are now falling, and Playmates
has been searching for new toy concepts to replace them.
Babar the Elephant, invented in 1937 by cartoonist Mr Jean de Brunhoff, has
been discreetly updated for the 1990s by his son, Laurent. The Babar revival
has helped Ideal to become France's biggest toy company with profits of
FFr38m (Dollars 7.5m) on sales of FFr850m last year. But Ideal's finances
have come under strain because of its expansion. The group has for some
months been searching for new capital.

FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: Marzotto begins to flex its
muscles at Boss - Haig Simonian on the Italian men's clothing group's
prospects after its German deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX months after taking control of Hugo Boss, Germany's best-known mens'
clothing group, Marzotto, the big Italian textiles and clothing concern, is
starting to flex its muscles.
Italian representatives have joined Boss's supervisory board and Mr Peter
Littmann has been hired as chief executive, replacing from next March the
brothers Uwe and Jochen Holy who brought the company - founded by their
grandfather - from obscurity to international fame.
After spending Dollars 165m last December on a 63.7 per cent stake in Boss
and an option to buy 13.8 per cent more, Marzotto, chaired by Mr Pietro
Marzotto, had been waiting patiently to reinforce its position.
However, Mr Marzotto asserts there is no question of Boss losing its
identity or merging with his company, which had sales of L1,280bn (Dollars
1.12bn) last year. 'At least not for the time being,' he says. 'These first
six months have been spent seeing how to use the existing synergies. Talk of
merger is premature.'
Boss, which made net profits of DM35.4m (Dollars 23.2m) on sales of DM997m
in 1991, will only be consolidated from this year. But the companies have
been examining how to co-operate to improve efficiency and save money, short
of amalgamating.
Savings have already been identified by collaborating in 'outsourcing' -
subcontracting work to low-cost countries - acquiring accessories like
linings and buttons and data processing, Mr Marzotto explains. Working
groups of managers from both sides are being formed, and detailed proposals
should be ready by year-end. 'There is already a marked exchange of
management and ideas,' he states.
Part of the improvement will come through resolving difficulties at Joseph &amp;
Feiss, the US men's clothing group Boss purchased in 1989. Hailed as a
breakthrough into the lucrative US market, the concept turned sour as a
result of collapsing US demand and the need for expensive modernisation at
the company's Cleveland plant.
The problems with Joseph &amp; Feiss 'were a bit of everything', Marzotto
managers explain. Losses arose owing to problems in retailing and
distribution, while earnings were depressed by the recession.
Boss had already begun modernising Joseph &amp; Feiss, where over half the
output is up to its standards, says Mr Marzotto. That should rise to 100 per
cent by next March, when all the production lines will have been brought up
to date. He remains as convinced as the Holy brothers of the validity of the
acquisition. Under their strategy, Joseph &amp; Feiss would continue making its
well-established brands to traditional US tastes, while introducing softer,
more European-styled Boss apparel. Around 80 per cent of the Hugo Boss
formal wear, like suits, sold in the US is already produced in Cleveland.
The priority is to relaunch Joseph &amp; Feiss's own brands, says Mr Marzotto.
The new equipment should raise quality while cutting overheads. Although a
loss is still forecast this year, the company should break even in 1993.
Reviving a troubled apparel operation is familiar ground for Marzotto. Like
many Italian manufacturers, it has been caught in the vice of producing the
bulk of its output in a high-cost country with relatively high inflation,
heavy social security costs and a fairly strong currency.
'The situation in Italy today penalises all manufacturers requiring
substantial amounts of labour,' he notes.
Marzotto's profits have fallen for three years running. Group net earnings
last year were just L39.8bn, 12.3 per cent down on 1990 and two-thirds of
their 1988 peak, triggering a 20 per cent dividend cut.
Mr Marzotto grows testy when probed about current financial performance.
Enquiries about prospects for the dividend are dismissed as 'arrogant',
while predictions on net earnings, especially at group level, are based on
factors 'which are not interesting for readers', he replies.
In spite of falling demand in most big markets and increasing competition,
parent company operating profits, adjusted for acquisitions, should rise
this year, he says. The increase will come through higher productivity and
lower costs, while a better product mix, weighted more towards higher value
items, should also contribute.
Taking free cash-flow as his measure, Mr Marzotto says this year's figures
will 'certainly be better' than in 1991. Earnings at group level are tougher
to predict, as much hangs on how Marzotto treats the difference between the
acquisition and book price for Boss. And Boss's final-quarter sales,
traditionally very important, will also play a part.
Raising earnings will partly depend on pushing through the strategy of
internationalisation which dictated the Boss acquisition. Prior to the
purchase, 70 per cent of Marzotto's sales came from Italy, where over 90 per
cent of its goods were produced. This year's consolidated figures, which
will see turnover rising to around L2,100bn, will show domestic sales
falling to around 55 per cent of the total, while the domestic share of
production will have fallen to around 60 per cent, forecasts Mr Marzotto.
Longer term, his aim is to reduce the Italian share of apparel production
down to 'a very significant minority'. For textiles, manufacturing at home
'will always be preponderant', he says.
Bringing that about will entail some further adjustments to the group, which
has tripled sales in the past six years, largely through takeovers.
Acquisition-led growth is set to continue, probably in eastern Europe at the
outset. And there will be disposals of non-core businesses.
The recent sale of its work clothes subsidiary and its 50 per cent stake in
another small offshoot have brought the group's target closer. The disposals
should also generate 'a certain capital gain' for the first-half results.
However, there is still a little more to do, says Mr Marzotto.
International demand and the Italian economy permitting, the group should
remain on course with its financial strategy of maintaining its ability to
generate cash, without turning to shareholders for funds, and keeping up the
dividend.
For Mr Marzotto, this year's dividend cut was an isolated event triggered by
the Boss acquisition. But with the market still difficult and Italian
manufacturers increasingly penalised by domestic economic conditions,
investors will have to wait until early next year to see whether he is
proved right.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of foreign bank creditors to Efim, the Italian state holding
company put into voluntary liquidation last month, will make four demands at
a meeting with the Treasury and the company's administrator due in Rome
tomorrow.
The delegation, which is likely to include executives from London-based
banks, will press Treasury officials to clarify a number of points which
remain obscure after last month's government decree liquidating the company.
Foremost will be to glean whether the government's plan to issue up to
L4,000bn (Dollars 3.48bn) in new securities from next January to cover the
company's debts will be adequate. No details have been released as to how
the L4,000bn figure has been calculated, and foreign bankers will want
reassurance that the figure is enough and, if necessary, can be increased.
Foreign banks are believed to have lent around L3,500bn to the Efim group,
which has indebtedness of around L8,500bn.
Bankers will also be pressing for details on the nature of the new bonds to
be issued next year. So far, the Treasury has given no indication of the
maturity of the new instruments, nor of the interest rate they will carry.
Bankers will also want to discover whether the Treasury plans to issue any
of the new bonds in currencies other than the lira. The Efim group, which
borrowed heavily in the international markets, had exposures in a variety of
currencies, and bank creditors are keen that the new bonds should as far as
possible reflect its borrowing profile.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Trencherwood swaps debt for equity as
losses mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRENCHERWOOD, the USM-quoted housebuilder, has reached agreement in
principle for its bankers to take a 'substantial' stake in the company, in
return for conversion of debt and unsecured liabilities.
Details of the debt for equity swap are likely to be finalised in the next
few weeks and are subject to legal and other conditions, the company said.
The conversion will secure borrowing facilities until the end of 1997.
Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Schroders are Trencherwood's main
bankers.
'We're very pleased, especially when many other property companies have
fallen by the wayside,' said Mr Richard Brooke, finance director.
Trencherwood yesterday reported mounting pre-tax losses of Pounds 37.7m in
the year to October 31, from Pounds 29.3m in the previous period. Mr John
Norgate, chairman, said conditions had deteriorated during the year and he
expected a further decline in volumes this time.
Operating losses were contained to Pounds 863,000 (Pounds 2.92m) thanks to
cost cutting. But exceptional items increased to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds
23.3m). These included about Pounds 15m of provisions against land holdings
and work in progress, restructuring costs of about Pounds 2.5m and Pounds
12m of provisions against losses in the company's property joint ventures.
Turnover fell to Pounds 28.8m (Pounds 38.3m). A total of 306 units (328)
were sold during the year at an average price of Pounds 78,000. Prices were
not comparable with the last year because the types of unit sold differed.
Pressure on margins led to a Pounds 3.6m loss before exceptionals in the
residential division.
The company continued to reduce its exposure to off-balance sheet associated
companies. Off-balance sheet borrowings fell to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 26.9m).
But increased borrowings for land purchases lifted total bank borrowings to
Pounds 45m (Pounds 40.5m). The loss for the year of Pounds 34.3m resulted in
negative net assets of Pounds 12.5m (net assets Pounds 21.8m).
No dividend is recommended. Losses per share increased to 137.01p (102.39p).

greater access to the European ballscrew market ahead of the European Single
Market reforms.
Ballscrews are an essential component of machine tools and other industrial
machinery, converting rotary motion into linear motion and vice-versa.
PGM is the second largest UK ballscrew manufacturer with annual sales of
Pounds 3.5m and 104 employees.
The deal is one of few struck recently by Japanese companies in the European
machinery sector. They either prefer greenfield expansion or are deterred by
current market conditions. It is also one of few moves by machine tool part
manufacturers to emulate Japanese machine tool builders by manufacturing in
Europe.
Founded in 1971 by the Teramachi family, THK is the Japanese market leader
in linear motion systems with a 75 per cent market share. Still family
controlled, it is quoted over-the-counter in Japan and had sales last year
of Y78bn (Pounds 339m) and 2,536 employees.
THK said it intended to maintain the existing PGM management and employee
structure but may strengthen both with support from Japan. The deal includes
PGM's 96.8 per cent subsidiary PGM Ballscrews Ireland.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: London Pacific boosts Govett profits to
Dollars 29.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVETT, the financial services group, recorded a 14 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits to Dollars 29.7m (Pounds 15.5m) for the six months
to June 30.
More than half the group's operating profits came from London Pacific, a US
insurance company which sells annuities through the intermediary market.
London Pacific's first half profits were 37.6 per cent higher at Dollars
14.5m.
In the UK, the group is best known for its investment management activities,
particularly its John Govett subsidiary.
Group funds under management increased from Dollars 5.2bn to Dollars 5.8bn,
with the bulk of the increase coming from client inflows, in particular US
mutual funds and specialised futures funds in the UK.
Investment management fees rose nearly 30 per cent to Dollars 18.1m, helped
by the acquisition of US fund manager ACI, now renamed Govett Institutional
Investment.
However, the acquisition and the growth of the mutual funds business led to
a 45 per cent increase in operating expenses to Dollars 15.9m. Investment
income fell to Dollars 4.8m (Dollars 5.23m) in the wake of lower US interest
rates.
Operating profits were Dollars 27.6m (Dollars 23.4m) and after net profits
on investments of Dollars 2.07m (Dollars 2.53m), pre-tax profits were
Dollars 29.7m (Dollars 26m). After tax of Dollars 7.06m (Dollars 5.35m),
fully diluted earnings per share were 28.5 cents (25.5 cents).
The company is paying a gross dividend of 9.5 cents (8.5 cents).
The shares rose 4p to 107p on the news yesterday, having touched a peak of
333p before the crash of 1987. Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer,
said the group hoped to widen its shareholder base by an American Depositary
Receipt scheme in the US.
Mr Arthur Trueger, the executive chairman, said 'the outlook for the balance
of the year is encouraging. While always vulnerable to unexpected
developments, our business is very diversified and growing in all areas.'

<TEXT>
PRODUCTION problems held back Clarke Foods, Britain's second biggest
ice-cream manufacturer and owner of Lyons Maid, which yesterday reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 168,000 for the six months to May 2.
Mr Henry Clarke, chairman, said equipment problems meant the company did not
have enough product available at the beginning of the summer.
'That delay was a very bad thing,' he said, '. . . but it is behind us now.'
The half year results compared with profits last time of Pounds 364,000.
However, 1991 profits were boosted by Pounds 305,000 in interest income
compared with charges this time of Pounds 108,000.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.75p from earnings of 0.05p
(1.65p). Sales surged from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 10.4m, due to a full
contribution from Hillsdown and two months from Lyons Maid.

Novalal, the USM-quoted plant propagation and biotechnology company,
incurred a loss of Pounds 3.49m for the seventeen months ended December 31
and had its accounts qualified. The company's year-end has been changed. For
the eight months to July 31 1990 the loss was Pounds 1.35m.
The auditors, Ernst and Young, said the accounts for the 17 months had been
prepared on a going concern basis which depended on the successful outcome
of actions being taken to secure the viability of the group.
These included continuing cost reduction, successful completion of trial
projects, establishing a business in Greece and raising mortgage finance.
The loss for the 17 months was struck after taking account of exceptional
provisons of Pounds 1.1m (0.2m). Losses per share emerged at 14.8p (6.8p).

years.
The company, which has recently undergone a restructuring and has changed
its year end, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 27,000 for the seven

The result was struck on turnover of Pounds 2m and represents a marked

After a tax charge of Pounds 61,000 (nil) and extraordinary costs of Pounds

1.41m). Losses per share were 0.04p (3.58p).

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bankers grant new standstill agreement to
Control Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL SECURITIES, the property, hotels, brewing and pubs group which is in
refinancing talks with its bankers, has come to a new standstill agreement
with them.
It also warned that its accounts would show substantial provisions against
assets and that results for the year to end March 1992 would be
'significantly worse' than for 1990-91. The new standstill agreement will
run until September 30. The original standstill was signed at the end of
June and was due to run out on July 24. It was then extended until the end
of July.
The aim of the standstill is to give the company time to put a business
strategy into place and to stabilise its financial position. Meanwhile, the
banks are providing facilities to allow the group to continue trading.
Control Securities was built up by Mr Nazmu Virani, who is facing charges of
fraud relating to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Mr Virani stood down as chairman and chief executive after he was freed on
bail in April.
The group has delayed payment of interest on one of its two Swiss franc
bonds and is calling a meeting of bondholders of both its issues, totalling
SFr 200m (Pounds 78.8m), on August 17. Resolutions will be put to
bondholders to defer interest payments until October 12. Another meeting
will be held on or before that date.
The company said yesterday that results for the year to end March had not
been finalised but would be 'significantly worse than those for the previous
year'. Those showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.3m, after a Pounds 3.8m
provision covering the company's exposure to BCCI. Also the accounts will
show 'substantial provisions against the values of the group's assets'.
Control's shares have been suspended since October at 16 1/2 p when the
Serious Fraud Office raided its offices in connection with BCCI
investigations.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 52m loss on US sale for Reckitt &amp;
Colman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECKITT &amp; Colman, the household products, toiletries and food group, is
taking a Pounds 52m extraordinary loss on the sale of its US spices and
seasonings business.
The sale price is Dollars 75.1m (Pounds 39.1m), but there will be an
extraordinary loss of Dollars 100m in the current year's accounts. The buyer
is Burns Philp Food, a subsidiary of Burns Philp, an Australian food and
hardware company.
The extraordinary item comprises the loss on disposal of assets, valued at
Dollars 99.5m, goodwill written off, Dollars 50m of closure and redundancy
costs while Dollars 18m represents a trading loss made since the sale
decision was made in January.
However, the sale will add Dollars 40m to Reckitt's cash flow in the current
year. The proceeds will go to reducing borrowings, which were Pounds 338.3m
at the end of 1991.
In January Reckitt said the business, part of the Durkee-French subsidiary,
was being sold for Dollars 80m, but since then trading conditions have
worsened and the price reduced.
Reckitt bought Durkee Famous Foods from Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, in 1986 for Dollars 140m. The spice and seasoning part of
Durkee has found the market increasingly competitive. In 1991 the business
being sold made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 2.2m.
Reckitt said the sale was part of its strategy of disposing of non-core
assets where a price could be obtained that would not dilute earnings.
The group is also negotiating the sale of its Canadian spice and seasoning
business to Burns Philp, although that deal has not yet been completed. The
price stated in January was Dollars 8m.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Automotive side behind 36% rise at BBA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its automotive business helped BBA achieve its
first increase in pre-tax profits and earnings per share for two years.
On a significantly reduced cost base the automotive division reported a 36
per cent increase in trading profits, from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 17.4m on
sales of Pounds 319m, up from Pounds 302.3m. Group trading profit increased
from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 39.7m.
Mr John White, managing director, said new orders won by the friction
materials operation in Germany more than compensated for market fragility.
Car sales in Germany have fallen for two consecutive months and are expected
to continue to decline.
The division's margins improved from 5.2 per cent to 6.4 per cent.
A geographical breakdown of trading profits showed that the only fall was
experienced by North America, down from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 14.5m. The
industrial division was most affected by the US recession with margins
falling from 9.1 per cent to 8.2 per cent.
COMMENT
Against a background of falling car sales across Europe a 5 per cent
increase in automotive sales is impressive. The cost cutting exercise has
ensured an immediate payback in profits. A report last year by UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew showed that a 10 per cent cut in labour costs of the big automotive
components group would result in a 40 per cent to 50 per cent increase in
profits. That is a message BBA took to heart earlier than its rivals. Yet
with the fall in German car sales set to continue well into the next six
months, can BBA go on producing profit increases? The answer is probably
yes. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 65m, giving earnings per share
of 9.3p, the shares - up 8p to 133p - are on a prospective multiple of 14.3.
That does not look too demanding given the company's ability to produce
increased profits in a recession.

FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: TDG static at Pounds 16.8m but shares rise
12p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest charges fuelled a marginal increase in interim profits at
Transport Development Group, Britain's second largest haulier, from Pounds
16.5m to Pounds 16.8m.
The pre-tax result was struck on turnover 9 per cent down to Pounds 267.2m
for the six months to June 30. Operating profits were flat at Pounds 18.9m.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 3p, while earnings per share
rose from 7.46p to 7.51p.
Sir James Duncan, who retires as chairman at the end of this month, said the
results were 'alright', neither sparkling nor disastrous. 'The balance sheet
is very strong and that is the way we would want it.'
A strict control of cash had helped the company cut net debt from Pounds
63.7m to Pounds 40.4m. As a result, interest charges fell by Pounds 300,000
to Pounds 2.1m.
Sir James said recession continued to affect the group as severely as ever.
'We keep looking for the sunrise but it is not happening yet,' he said.
France, in particular, had suffered from economic downturn.
The French business incurred a loss of Pounds 537,000 in the first half,
compared with a profit of Pounds 1.9m. Management had been changed and steps
to reduce losses, such as depot closures, were being taken.
Holland marginally increased profits from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.5m,
despite intense competition.
In the UK, overall trading profits were 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 14.2m
with solid increases recorded by hire, storage and transport. Redundancy
costs depressed profits of the UK distribution business from Pounds 4.8m to
Pounds 4.3m. Redundancy costs for the group overall came to Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 800,000).
Willig Freight Lines, the US business earmarked for disposal, incurred
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.1m in the first half. These were set off against
the Pounds 15m extraordinary provision made at the end of last year. Sir
James said the company was in negotiations over a sale with two potential
purchasers.
COMMENT
Sir James's modest success was applauded by the market last night with the
shares rising from 216p to 228p. The restructuring begun by the company
before the recession appears to be feeding through. However, there's more
work to do, with the biggest question mark hanging over Willig Freight.
France, too, will take time to sort out. Yet the main problem for TDG
remains the global economy and there is not a lot that Sir James can do
there. Forecasts are for Pounds 40m pre-tax this year. Although the multiple
of 12.7 times may look undemanding, the shares are not likely to take off
until some sign of recovery becomes apparent. Better to hold and wait for
the upturn.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Lep and banks agree debt swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security concern brought to the brink
of bankruptcy by borrowings of more than Pounds 500m, has reached agreement
with about 25 banks to swap Pounds 180m of debt into equity.
The rescue is likely to leave the banks, led by National Westminster, with
85 per cent of the company, which before yesterday's announcement had a
market value of less than Pounds 8m. Lep's share price had fallen from 199p
in June 1990 to less than 5p earlier this summer.
About 784m new shares will be issued, nearly six times the current number.
As the price is 21p each, compared with yesterday's opening of 5.5p,
existing shareholders - of which the largest is the security group ADT, with
27 per cent - are unlikely to take up the 17-for-3 open offer.
The directors, now headed by company doctor Mr David James, yesterday warned
shareholders that Lep would not be able to continue trading unless they
approved the rescue proposals. Mr James replaced Mr John Read, the former
chairman and chief executive, who is suing for Pounds 1.7m compensation. Lep
has issued a counter - claim.
Apart from the debt-equity swap, which will reduce net borrowings from
Pounds 507.8m to less than Pounds 330m, Lep will also be allowed to roll up
interest payments on Pounds 145.7m of its remaining debt for three years.
This leaves Pounds 182m of borrowings outside the restructuring, which will
have to be serviced.
The group also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 59.1m in 1991 after Pounds
47.3m of exceptional costs and net interest payments of Pounds 38.3m.
Extraordinary costs amounted to Pounds 172.1m, of which the largest item was
the write-off of Lep's entire Pounds 92.4m investment in US property. The
losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 235.1m and there is no
dividend payment.
The accounts have been qualified by Touche Ross, the auditors, who point out
that the company may be unable to continue trading if shareholders reject
the restructuring, or if banks outside the agreement refuse to finance
ongoing debts.
The rescue will enable a Pounds 900,000 deficit on the pension fund - caused
by a fall in value of a property purchased from a group subsidiary - to be
repaid over the next two or three years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to interpret yesterday's 5 per cent jump in Italian stock
prices as a sign the country's economic problems are on the mend after the
provisional agreement to abolish the scala mobile system of wage indexation.
But as so often the case in Italy, the story is more complicated than it
seems. The Amato government still has to win parliamentary approval for its
budget cuts. Even the wage indexation agreement will not be finalised until
the autumn.
To be sure, the agreement is a further indication of the government's
determination to stick to a tough line on the economy. It allowed the Bank
of Italy last night to reverse a half point of its recent 1.75 point rise in
interest rates. The bank must be satisfied that the deal will help shore up
the lira at least for the time being.
That will come as a relief to other European governments, which have been
worried that a weak lira could destabilise the entire ERM. But pressure
could resurface in September as the French referendum on Maastricht looms.
As for equities, yesterday's gain looks doubly suspicious since it occurred
on very low turnover. Italian shares still offer an earnings yield of little
more than 8 per cent, not much more than half the return on medium term
government bonds.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lep Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In April last year, the then chairman and chief executive of Lep expressed
cautious optimism. So even though they must have known that something was
amiss, investors are entitled to some surprise at the way Pounds 200m in
shareholders' funds have since been transformed into a Pounds 100m deficit.
Even with a skilful company doctor at the helm, the terms of yesterday's
restructuring agreement suggest a long struggle to secure the group's
future.
At least Lep has no truculent Swiss bondholders to grapple with. But,
unusually, it requires the support of overseas banks not covered by the
agreement. The auditor's report recognises as much, pointing out that Lep's
future as a going concern depends on the willingness of overseas lenders to
back freight forwarding subsidiaries with overdrafts, letters of credit and
the like. The qualification may explain the performance of Lep shares
yesterday: almost doubling to 10p when the proposals were released but
falling to 6 3/4 p by the close.
The banks have shown how serious the situation is by converting debt into
equity at a 300 per cent premium to the market value. That could also imply
an expectation that the restructuring proposals will succeed. Otherwise they
might have gone for seniority by converting into preferred stock. But what
value seniority when the company shows post-restructuring borrowing of
Pounds 330m and tangible assets of Pounds 250m?

FT  04 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be few less loved shares in the market at present than those of
Trafalgar House. Yesterday's statement from the company inspired a mild
bounce to 59p - against a price of more than 90p just three weeks ago - but
it is hard to see investors getting carried away merely on the back of the
board's soothing reassurance.
Part of the problem lies in Trafalgar's dismal relations with the City: a
record of misplaced optimism and doubtful accounting policies is no
foundation on which to rally friends in difficult times. The main cause of
concern is the pace and extent of the cash outflow - on the company's own
admission likely to be at least Pounds 320m for the year to September -
though even if the fears have been exaggerated there seems little compelling
reason to buy the company's shares on cyclical grounds. If anything, its
dominant construction and engineering businesses are only now entering the
toughest part of the UK downturn, with wafer thin margins and keen
competition. The Pounds 3.5bn order book alluded to yesterday is of little
avail if it fails to make a profit. Commercial property - and to a lesser
extent housebuilding - will be in the doldrums for some time.
To be fair, Trafalgar looks to be comfortably within its banking covenants,
would yield more than the market average solely on the basis of a final
dividend equivalent to a quarter of last year's final payout, and on a
forced break-up appears to have ample asset backing. For a market with
diminishing faith in fundamentals, this may be scarcely relevant.

FT  04 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Homework at the Abbey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Tugendhat's rescue plan for the housing market looks more
like a grand gesture from the politician he once was than an expert
pronouncement from the mortgage lender he has now become. The plan is right
to home in on the lack of liquidity in the housing market as harmful to
consumer confidence. But it is otherwise so flawed that one wonders why
Abbey National chose to launch it with such fanfare. It certainly did not
need the distraction from a respectable set of interim results.
Suppose the government were persuaded to use income tax credits to
compensate people for selling their houses at a loss. That would relieve
homeowners caught in the negative equity trap, but it would cost a great
deal more than the Pounds 250m which Sir Christopher suggests. While market
turnover would almost certainly increase, net new demand would probably be
marginal and confined to bargain hunting by first time buyers.
A more obvious advantage would accrue to lenders. With their loans
effectively underwritten by the government, the quality of their assets
would improve. Presumably the Abbey itself could unwind some of its first
half Pounds 30m general provision against bad debts. But, even if the plight
of lenders were the government's main interest in considering the scheme, it
could surely find a cheaper way of helping them.
Besides, it is not remotely as if Abbey itself is in need of such
assistance. Granted provisions are up 42 per cent on last year's second
half, and the bank is still relying on low margin treasury business to
offset the drop in its retail profits. But Abbey has done well to confine
itself to a fall of 12 per cent in pre-tax profit compared with the first
half of last year. There cannot be many financial institutions able to raise
their dividends by nearly 9 per cent and still cover the payment more than
three times.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's defence secretary, flies to Madrid for talks
with his counterparts on the troubled European Fighter Aircraft today amid
signs that Italy and Spain may be losing faith in the four-nation project.
Ministry of Defence officials said last night that the chief aim of the
talks remained to persuade Mr Volker Ruhe, the German minister, not to 'shut
the door' on joining the aircraft's production phase. Germany made clear in
May that it would not participate in the production phase, due to begin next
summer.
But well-placed UK industry officials believe that the gloomy economic
outlook is increasingly undermining the commitment of Madrid and Rome to
what is, at an estimated cost of Pounds 20bn, Europe's largest defence
collaboration project.
Italy's new defence minister, Mr Salvo Ando, gave the clearest indication to
date yesterday that his country was having second thoughts about the
project, at least in its present form.
Speaking in Brindisi he said the EFA 'needs the German contribution (to the
project)'.
Alluding to the new Italian government's financial troubles and spending
cuts, Mr Ando said: 'If Germany has problems with costs, imagine the
position of nations which aren't adrift in gold like Italy and Spain.'
Since Germany's announcement, the UK has fought vigorously to persuade Spain
and Italy to proceed with the aircraft as a three-nation consortium.
Last month, Mr John Major, the prime minister, wrote to Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the Spanish prime minister, asking him to 'confirm publicly' his faith in
the project and a readiness to study the feasibility of production on a
three-nation basis.
However, Mr Gonzalez has so far failed to do so. Instead, the Spanish
government has appeared to offer tacit support to the German proposal that
the project, still in its development stage, either be adapted to build a
more modest aircraft or should be replaced.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Letter: Single measures cannot rescue British industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SIRIPURAPU K RAO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Balls ('Too lean for a long life', July 27) puts his finger on
the most worrying aspect of the current economic situation in Britain when
he says that, even in the depths of the recession, current account is in
deficit by nearly 2 per cent of the GDP.
The intention to continue within the ERM at the present exchange rate is
damaging to industry. Edward Balls clearly sees devaluation as the answer.
I agree that devaluation is necessary. I do not believe, however, that there
is any one simple measure that will be sufficient.
What is needed instead is a package of policy. I see three elements to it:
a devaluation by, say, 15-20 per cent within the ERM framework;
a sharper reduction in public spending as a proportion of GDP than is
currently intended;
and increased public spending and improved incentives, within the diminished
total public expenditure, in support of investment in manufacturing, and
training.
While a devaluation would be inflationary, a realistic adjustment of the
exchange rate, coupled with a commitment to stay within the ERM, should help
to improve confidence which is fast evaporating.
Such action may accordingly prove less damaging to interest rate prospects
than might have been feared.
At the same time, a declared intention to reduce public spending in the
medium term (as the government has done, but needs to go further) would help
to undermine inflationary pressures, and improve prospects for cuts in
interest rates.
Finally, a reordering of priorities in public spending, within a diminished
total in favour of manufacturing and training, need not be at the expense of
health, education or the necessary welfare expenditures.
In the wake of reduced east-west tensions, there is an obvious opportunity
for it through even more aggressive cutbacks in defence expenditure than the
government has been prepared for so far.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOMER HABIBIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Berin Lewis ('Turkish Cypriots suffered', Letters, July 22) does
injustice to the concept and to the substance of your leading article of
July 16 ('They must be stopped').
Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, when the Cyprus government had been
overthrown by a coup which was stage-managed from Greece; 200,000 members of
the Greek Cypriot majority community were expelled by the invaders from the
occupied area in a blatant act of state-sponsored 'ethnic cleansing'.
Your editorial is supported by the formal findings of the Council of
Europe's Commission of Human Rights, published on April 2 1992. (Report on
Application No. 8007/77 Cyprus against Turkey.)
Neither during the intercommunal incidents of 1963-64, nor in the period
before the 1974 invasion, was there any state-sponsored cleansing or killing
of Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus. The UN peacekeeping force, on the spot since
early 1964, can provide independent testimony exposing the falsehood of your
correspondent's claim.
On the other hand, it is on historical record that Turkish air force planes
bombed Cypriot Greek villages in 1964; that the Cyprus government offered
economic incentives to Turkish Cypriots to return to their native villages;
and that from 1968 to 1973, Turkish Cypriot leaders took part in
intercommunal talks with Greek Cypriots for a negotiated agreement.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Letter: Catalan flags fluttering in Olympic city make a
passionate point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELISABETH MIRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Peter Bruce's article 'Catalan socialists and nationalists
play games with the Games' (July 24). While I respect and applaud a
diversity of opinions about the economic and political reality of Catalonia,
and recognise that it must be difficult for a person outside Catalonia fully
to understand the feelings of people who were born or who live and work
here, I must take issue with parts of Mr Bruce's article.
When he states that Catalonia is a 'small, semi-industrialised region on the
margins of Europe', he is ignoring economic statistics (Catalonia's gross
domestic product in 1991 stood at 102.28 per cent of the EC average), and
permitting prejudices to influence his definition of marginal. Many other
political and economic observers are, on the contrary, naming Barcelona,
Catalonia's capital, as the capital of the Mediterranean.
When he refers mistakenly to 'poor Madrid' as having had to fund half of the
Olympic housing, etc, may I remind Mr Bruce that Catalonia has always been a
net payer of taxes to the Spanish state and is merely receiving now public
investment that should have been undertaken years ago. Mr Bruce warns that
an 'occasional youth wearing 'Free Catalonia' on his T-Shirt' might throw
himself in front of the cameras. I suggest that Mr Bruce should visit
Barcelona and count the Catalan flags hung from balconies. He may conclude
that not only an occasional extremist youth feels Catalonia is his country,
but the majority of the population.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Retirement at 65
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL Security Advisory Committee, an independent body set up by the
government, has done its creator proud. Yesterday's report on equalising the
state pension age says what the Treasury would most like to hear: that the
retirement age for women should be moved from 60 to 65, to equal that of
men. The packaging of this fiscally prudent suggestion is politically
alluring. 'A significant part of the money saved,' says the report, should
be used 'to improve the well-being of the most vulnerable groups.'
Even better, the cash should be diverted towards making the state pension
scheme of the future 'more responsive especially to the needs and
requirements of women'. These elements of the SSAC package form an
'indivisible whole'. In sum, backing is given to a proposal that will
eventually save some Pounds 3bn a year, provided that most of it is spent on
disadvantaged pensioners.
The suggestion is practical. Equalising the retirement age at 65 would bring
the UK in line with most west European countries. Italy and Germany are
moving in that direction, while France, the committee says, is currently
reconsidering the costs of an earlier decision to shift downwards to 60.
Moving to 65 would also allow the UK pensions industry to heave a huge sigh
of relief. It is still wrestling with the consequences of the EC court
judgement in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange Group. This ruled
against discrimination in occupational schemes, since when the trend has
been toward equalising at 65. If the government establishes that age for
state beneficiaries, it would be set in concrete.
Critics who accept that the cost of moving the pensionable age for men down
to 60 is prohibitive may prefer a flexible decade, during which retirement
could take place at between, say, 55 and 65. The SSAC report rejects this.
It describes it as a system for trading off the savings on those who retire
early and receive lower pensions against the costs of higher payments to
those who defer retirement to a later age. On this basis the long-term sick
and disabled, plus those for whom redundancy or unemployment in their 50s is
a form of involuntary early retirement, would need income support for the
rest of their lives.
The principal flaw in the SSAC's admirably succinct report lies in its
rationale for proposing piecemeal improvements to the social security
system. It wishes to avoid too great an increase in dependence on income
support. The latter is a means-tested benefit, with a lower take-up than
retirement pension. Certainly take-up should be encouraged in every way
possible, but the eventual phasing-out of universal benefits and their
replacement by better targeted payments to those most in need should be as
much an objective of government policy as the phasing-in of an equalised
state pensionable age of 65.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Tilting at Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT the responses to the Cadbury committee's report on the financial
aspects of corporate governance are in, it is clear that they amount to
something less than a ringing endorsement for a worthy but unconvincing
document. They also pose a dilemma for a committee that now has to consider
possible amendments to the report before its voluntary code of best practice
comes into effect for financial years ending on December 31 1992. This is
because the report, which seeks to strengthen the role of auditors and
non-executive directors and to improve standards of corporate reporting, has
been powerfully attacked from both ends of the spectrum.
One group, including institutional fund managers and the press, argues that
Cadbury's form of voluntarism is inadequate and that the code's approach to
enforcement via the stock exchange listing agreement and pressure from
institutional investors is unlikely to work. Significantly, the
Confederation of British Industry, while welcoming in principle a code of
best practice, has also expressed worries about enforcement.
At the other extreme some leading industrialists argue in private that the
report is so much bureaucratic nonsense. In public many support the line of
the Institute of Directors, to the effect that Cadbury's desire to impose
special functions on non-executive directors undermines the principle of the
unitary board.
Common sense
The problem for the committee is that while these lines of attack are
ostensibly at odds with each other, they both contain grains of sound common
sense.
The Cadbury report's origins lay in the spate of corporate scandals that
followed the Thatcher boom. Many company collapses appeared to have been
precipitated by dominant entrepreneurs who were not subject to adequate
checks and balances. Neither the institutional investors, the auditors nor
the non-executive directors appear to have exerted a sufficient restraining
influence. For want of proper accountability, companies were driven off the
rails.
Effective tool
A voluntary code of conduct is hardly the most effective tool for holding
dominant entrepreneurs in check. It will, admittedly, provide a useful
yardstick against which standards of boardroom behaviour and disclosure can
be measured. But where entrepreneurs choose to ignore the code, the Stock
Exchange's ultimate sanction of suspending the quotation will damage the
very shareholders that the code was intended to protect.
As far as Cadbury's proposals on auditors and non-executive directors are
concerned, there is much that is constructive in them. But they do not
address sufficiently squarely the conflict in the position of auditors who
are, in effect, hired and fired by the directors whom they are required to
monitor. And by asking non-executive directors to combine an increased
monitoring role with their existing managerial function, they demand too
much. As long as the legal definition of the duties of non-executives is the
same as that of the executive directors, they will tend to identify with the
executive camp.
In the absence of more effective proprietorial control, the answer must be a
separate legal definition of responsibilities for non-executive directors,
including clearly defined monitoring obligations. But it will take many more
scandals for the present government to accept that case. The corporate
sector will thus muddle on with Cadbury, more or less; and the scandals will
continue to come, too.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Amato plays the chaos card: Robert Graham on the coalition's
prospect for success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giuliano Amato's strongest card in his efforts to end Italy's political
inertia remains the dramatic prospect of Italy tumbling into chaos if his
government fails. In less than a month, Mr Amato has created a far wider
margin for manoeuvre than anyone thought possible for his four-party
coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals.
By exposing Italy's financial plight, he has established a consensus for
action. This was demonstrated by the way Mr Amato has managed in record time
to force through a L30,000bn (Pounds 13.96bn) emergency economic package
even though his coalition has a mere 16-seat majority in the chamber of
deputies.
The second card up his sleeve is the reluctance of the parties to face early
elections. The parties are divided, discredited and have no money, while the
electoral system is in need of reform.
Yet the resignation last week of Mr Enzo Scotti, the foreign minister, was
an uncomfortable reminder to Mr Amato that Italian politicians have little
sense of state. This was not a case of a minister resigning over a
disagreement on policy. It was entirely related to the internecine battles
within the Christian Democratic party.
The party has been in turmoil since the April 5 general elections, which saw
its vote total fall sharply. Its traditional personal feuds have been
heightened by confusion over how it should reshape itself in the
post-communist era.
Mr Scotti resigned because he refused to obey a controversial new rule that
cabinet members must resign their parliamentary seats. He opted to return to
his seat in parliament and will probably throw his hat into the contest for
the key post of party secretary.
The turbulence inside the party could derail the entire government since it
remains by far the largest party and has brokered power throughout the
post-war era.
Yet the 54-year-old prime minister's skilful negotiating ability and his
good cross-party contacts should not be underestimated. The parties appear
to recognise that Mr Amato has opened the flood-gates to change. The real
issue has become whether the Amato government can manage such change or be
overwhelmed by it.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXCITEMENT of this new play at the Bush Theatre by Roy Macgregor is the
way its characters are caught up in the waves of recent history. The date is
1989; the Berlin Wall is falling. Renata, a former terrorist who caused the
death of a West German bigwig and his daughter, knows that East Germany will
no longer be a refuge for her. Bruno, her former partner in crime, wants her
to keep his involvement secret, now that he is a prominent West German
journalist with a wife, family and distinguished in-laws. He buys her
promise of silence by arranging her reunion in Berlin with the father she
has not seen for years.
The play's beauty lies in all the detail that surrounds this. You see
Renata's father Frankie, initially in his poor New York abode. He was a jazz
musician; his Phoenix jazz club was burnt after his daughter had caused
those deaths. You see Renata's East German husband, Paul, who even knows her
by another name; and you see him and a friend, Rudi, following her on a
train to Berlin. They have never been West; and Rudi, determinedly hip,
insists 'It's gonna be a gas-gas-gas.' You see Bruno's wife, Gabi, and
father-in-law, Otto - who would himself have been assassinated by terrorists
but for an assiduous chauffeur.
The plot that links these people is worthy of Le Carre at his best. Renata
is drawn from her East German marriage, like a vixen from her lair, by her
need to see her beloved father again. For her and for the more duplicitous
Bruno, the past keeps becoming far more alive than the present. Even their
marriages become unimportant. And, for Renata the refugee from Western
justice, there is now no future anywhere. I will not reveal what happens;
you follow the narrative like a thriller.
Dominic Dromgoole has directed with marvellous concentration. Simple
encounters and confrontations acquire immense eloquence. Body language,
nuances of accent, details of behaviour all speak volumes without ever
spoiling the naturalistic tone of the play. Thanks to deft designs by Mark
Viner, the play moves briskly from one locale to another. (Only the use of
projections during the scene-changes misfired - too huge to be effectively
visible.)
The cast does the play proud. As Renata, Nicola Redmond is always calm and
inscrutable; whatever fires are left in her smoulder deep down. By contrast,
Niamh Cusack as Gabi is eager, trusting and transparent. Both acquire great
pathos as the play develops. Nick Dunning's burnt-out, inelegant Bruno is -
as the plot requires - the most mysterious character of all: which in turn
is repeatedly contrasted with the vivid, funny, tired old jazz-player
Frankie, as played by Trevor Ray. Patrick Godfrey as Otto, Ewan Stewart as
Paul and young James Hooton as Rudi all ensure that each scene feels like a
large and brimming chapter.
Continues at the Bush Theatre, London W12, until August 22.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Arts: Wisdom of the Aztecs, writ in blood - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WISDOM of the Aztecs was enshrined in a painted literature. As the
conquistadors observed, the great Aztec ruler Moctezuma had libraries full
of painted books and scrolls, the work of priest-scribes who 'wrote' in
colourful images rather like strip-cartoons. Human blood was dripped on to
the pages to feed the images.
The exhibition Mexican Painted Books: Before and After the Conquest, at the
British Museum in London, offers a rare opportunity to see these most vivid
survivals of a vanished civilisation. But it does not make much of a fist at
explaining the complexity of what 'reading' meant to the ancient Mexicans.
The American peoples were analphabetic. Essentially, the Aztecs and their
neighbours used pictograms and ideograms, although by the 16th century they
were beginning to evolve phonetic symbols. Page layout, the scale of
symbols, the way they are grouped, even colour values: all influenced
meaning. Decoding a book, as the Europeans commented, was a dual process,
the eye scanning the images which prompted the reader to recite oral
history.
Britain's museums and libraries own a remarkable collection of ancient
Mexican manuscripts, the large part of which can now be seen in the
exhibition. The earliest codexes to appeal to English bibliophiles reached
Oxford's Bodleian Library in the early 17th century
The magnificent Codex Mendoza was illustrated by native artists on the
orders of the Spanish ambassador, to show Emperor Charles V what his new
subjects were like. However, it never reached him - the galleon taking it to
Spain was intercepted by a French man-of-war. Bought by Richard Hakluyt, the
English ambassador to France, it ended up in the Bodleian Library at Oxford
University. Libraries at Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow have also loaned
books, maps and scrolls.
Perhaps inevitably, one's first impression of this show is one of gloom.
Ancient Mexican books are fragile so light levels have to be kept low: even
scholars normally have to make do with facsimiles.
Mexican books were written on animal-skins coated with gesso, or on native
paper made from the beaten inner bark of trees of the Moraceae family, such
as figs and mulberries. Paper (amatl to the Aztecs) was also used to costume
the statues of the Aztec gods and in burnt offerings.
Quite the most remarkable things in the exhibition are the elaborate
pre-Hispanic screenfold books, long accordions of painted animal-skins which
could be read on both sides. In Codex Egerton, a Mixtec genealogy, we see 26
generations of rulers, symbolised by husbands and wives seated on thrones
and passing mysterious presents to each other.
The Fejervary, Zouche and Laud skin-fold books are splendid, but baffling.
Zouche was one of the manuscripts which Cortes sent to Charles V. One side
(it will be turned during the show) relates the bloodthirsty career of the
hero Eight Deer. On the other side, there is a genealogy focused on
generations of goddesses all called Three Flints.
In the brilliantly coloured scenes in the Fejervary codex - red, turquoise,
and pale yellow within heavy black outlines - there are such ominous images
that the human sacrifices of the Aztecs come readily to mind. Gods hold
small figures by ropes around their necks. Severed heads are perched on
stools and a jaguar-headed god holds a human head between its jaws.
Figuratively speaking, these pages are spattered with the blood of
codicologists struggling to interpret them.
Post-Conquest books are, on the whole, easier to follow as native artists
painted for their foreign masters, and became progressively influenced by
the woodcuts in European books. Opportunely, there is a new book on this
topic: Serge Gruzinski's Painting the Conquest: The Mexican Indians and the
European Renaissance (Unesco/Flammarion, 231 pages).
This would be my candidate for the most desirable of all the new books on
the Conquest. Written by a specialist, it is both a pleasure to read and
beautifully illustrated from post-Columbian codices, especially the
Florentine Codex; none of the pictures, oddly enough, are from the BM's
collection.
In the exhibition itself, the Kingsborough Codex provides a vivid picture of
the fabulous wealth of the new country and of the cruel exactions of the
conquerors. Indians are grabbed by the hair to force them to disgorge for
the annual sailing of the tribute-ships for Spain, laden not only with gold,
'the divine excrement', but with furs, obsidian, shoes, pottery jars, and
brilliantly-coloured mantles and cloth.
In one scene, Cortes himself appears, ordering four reluctant tribute-payers
to be burnt alive. Remarkably, one such Aztec tribute-list now on view was
unearthed as recently as 1986 in the Ulster Museum. A charming little
treatise of the mid-17th Century shows the manufacture of cochineal, a red
dye made from crushed beetles, which remained for centuries an important
export.
As for Christianity, arguably Spain's greatest export to Mexico, it is
represented by an 18th century illustrated example of the popular Doctrina
Christiana. Here we see the radical disjunction between word and image which
initially was so foreign to the Indians. The woodcut shows Adam and Eve
expelled from the Garden of Eden. Was this a particularly poignant image to
these recent converts? The text is in Nahuatl, written in Roman script.
The BM's Aubin Codex, a history of the Aztec from 1168 to 1608, just might
jog visitors' memories. Aubin was a 19th century French ethnographer who
also gave his name to a pre-Hispanic codex of horoscopes which in 1841, was
presented to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. And then, ten years ago
this summer, a Mexican journalist 'liberated' it from its wooden box. By the
time the library authorities had noticed its loss, the book was in Mexico's
National Museum of Anthropology. Jacques Lang, French Minister of Culture,
objected, but nothing doing. The Mexicans are sticking to their precious
specimen of reverse plunder.
The exhibition runs until next spring.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Arts: The Death of Moses - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN inspired piece of programme-planning the Promenade concert at London's
Royal Albert Hall on Sunday brought together a pair of works based on the
story of Moses. Biblical themes have been fruitful ground for composers,
whether to serve as picturesque narrative in the 18th-century style or to
investigate universal themes for the present day.
The new work was The Death of Moses by Alexander Goehr. Not strictly a first
performance, as the piece had already been given two days earlier in Seville
(ironically a city which expelled its Jewish population exactly 500 years
ago). But this was among the major premieres of this year's Prom season and
the high standard of the performance by the Monteverdi Choir under John
Eliot Gardiner will surely have done it justice.
Its theme is Moses's rejection of death, or by implication the refusal of
man in general to accept his fate. In both John Hollander's words and
Goehr's music, both incidentally a model of clarity of expression allowing a
firm grasp of the issues the work seeks to address, that wider
interpretation is suggested with commendable sleight of hand.
The music's style is at once ancient and modern. Inspired by the sounds of
Monteverdi's Vespers, Goehr has sought to translate some of those
instruments into modern terms: the archlute becomes an electric guitar, the
chamber organ a synthesiser, the cornetti are soprano saxophones. But the
marvel of the small orchestra that he has assembled is its pungency, which
continually brings to mind the oldest instrumental traditions.
In this way the music reaches beyond any specified period. The work is not a
standard oratorio, certainly not an opera, although Moses's cry 'I will not
die' is placed with the sure dramatic sense of a composer well versed in the
operatic medium. In its half dozen or so short sections it rather offers
individual meditations on Moses's story, each specific in its aim,
economical in gesture. Sacred though it may be, the mood remains sharply
focused throughout.
All this is very much in the right vein for Gardiner and his highly
disciplined band of singers. The New London Children's Choir joined them for
the Goehr, but otherwise the cast was the same as for the first part of
Handel's Israel in Egypt before the interval, with Michael Chance the
counter-tenor, Nigel Robson the tenor, and the English Baroque Soloists. To
both narrators of the Moses story they proved exemplary interpreters.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I admit that I felt more than a little sceptical when I met the people who
claim to have developed a 'mind-controlled' computer - even if the research
had been done in the Medical Electronics and Physics department at London's
St Bartholomew's Hospital.
The idea is to operate the computer by relaxing or tensing up at the
appropriate time. Today's keyboard is recognised to be an awkward interface
between man and machine, but this seemed to be taking things a bit too far.
The front door of an average-looking house in Muswell Hill in north London
did nothing to reassure me. Could this really be the right address for
Menorah Software? It was, said Daniel Rogoff, Menorah's director, as he sat
me down on a suitably relaxing sofa, about six feet in front of an ordinary
looking PC clone - minus the keyboard.
I was soon wired up - with two small sensor pads strapped to the fingers of
my right hand. The wires led to a remote-controlled box about the size of a
cigarette-packet which resembled a cordless computer mouse.
The electrodes on my fingers picked up biofeedback signals, in the form of
skin resistance which, I was told, 'has been widely used over the last 80
years as a 'marker' which reflects the state of physical, emotional and
mental arousal of humans and animals.'
Skin resistance is a well-established parameter for measuring psychological
reactivity and was used by, among others, Karl Gustav Jung, the Swiss
psychologist, and has been popularised by its use in 'lie-detector' tests.
The signal, which varies according to how relaxed or stressed the person
feels, is sent back via an infra-red link to a receiver in the PC which
decodes the information and passes it along to the standard serial port of
the computer.
Now for the clever part. Software in the computer processes the incoming
data, displays it on the screen and communicates interactively with the user
through text, symbols, games and animation designed by some of the people
who worked on the film 'Who Framed Rodger Rabbit'.
Press the start button on the sensor control and the fun begins. The 'game'
I played, called Evolve, involved trying to move an animated fish. Relax,
and the fish moves from left to right, turns into a mermaid who climbs out
of the water, metamorphosing once again into a girl who walks up the beach,
sprouts wings, and flies off into space, finally turning into a twinkling
star. At least that's the idea. If, however, you tense up - as I did when
Daniel asked me about deadlines - the whole process goes into reverse.
Other software modules included with the basic Pounds 189 (plus VAT)
RelaxPlus package include 'Mind-controlled Car', a driving game which
requires the user to tense up as well as to relax, and two computerised
interactive tutorials, Biofeedback and Muscular Relaxation. More games,
including 'mind-powered adventure games for children, home healthcare
programs and a range of executive products for the office' are promised.
The least impressive thing about the system is probably the skimpy brochure
which, in the tradition of pure hyperbole, claims that RelaxPlus will 'help
you attain your full potential by teaching your conscious and sub-conscious
mind to communicate'.
Is RelaxPlus more than another wacky computer game? Its developers think so.
The system was devised by two healthcare innovation companies, Ultramind and
Medeci Developments, and is based on research by a medical team at St
Bartholomew's led by Ernesto Korenman in co-operation with Professor Bernard
Watson, professor of medical electronics.
They believe that it may find uses in hospitals, doctors' surgeries, at
home, and even in the office, where it might be used to help stressed
executives 'chill out'.
RelaxPlus is distributed by Menorah Software: 081 803 4269.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Technology: Chilling the chips - Andrew Baxter describes why
engineering in sub-zero conditions is becoming a hot topic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the public imagination, cryogenics conjures images of astronauts frozen
for science fiction's interstellar voyages or of rich Californians put on
ice until the secret of eternal life is discovered.
Cryogenics - engineering at extremely low temperatures - is a serious
business, however, with a range of applications in space and at a more
down-to-earth level.
Inside one of Carrier's air conditioning factories in Syracuse, upstate New
York, is a tightly-guarded prototype manufacturing laboratory where the
final touches are being made to a 'cryocooler', confidently expected to win
a distinctly frosty reception.
Carrier is among a number of companies and universities which have been
developing cryocoolers during recent years. Much of the work has been based
on adaptations of the Stirling cycle engine patented by the Rev James
Stirling in 1816, which can be used as a refrigerator if the direction of
rotation is reversed.
Other advances in cryocooling were made by Philips of the Netherlands after
the Second World War, while Oxford University's Department of Engineering
Science has been developing cryocoolers for the past 14 years and was the
first to produce a long-life maintenance-free cryocooler about 10 years ago.
Oxford's Stirling cycle cryocoolers are used almost exclusively for cooling
infra-red detectors to give clearer images - two of its machines are
installed on satellites - and its machines are now licensed to four
companies in the UK and US, with a fifth deal in prospect.
The phenomenon that has galvanised Carrier into developing cryocoolers is
slightly different. At extremely low temperatures, computer chips work much
faster, because the resistance in the copper interconnects is reduced and
the signals can travel more quickly. For reasons not yet clear,
superconductors do not work at all unless kept very cold.
At 77 Kelvin or - 321 deg F - CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor)
chips used in mid-range computers are twice as fast as when used in a
standard air-cooled environment. The 77 Kelvin benchmark is the boiling
point of nitrogen, used because nitrogen has always been an inexpensive,
convenient refrigerant, although the working gas in cryocooling is normally
helium.
The challenge for widespread commercial use of cryocoolers in electronics
has been in getting them to work unattended for a long period and in making
them cheaply, says Brian Hands, a research lecturer at Oxford.
In conditions of some secrecy, Carrier, part of United Technologies (UTC),
has been working with the computer industry and with the multi-disciplinary
United Technologies Research Centre at Hartford, Connecticut, to solve the
problem. In the past few weeks, it has unveiled the first 250W cryocooler
with an estimated 'initial maintenance-free power-on time' of 50,000 hours.
The Carrier cryocooler is designed to fit on the standard electronic
equipment rack at the bottom of a computer unit. The CMOS chip sits on the
cryocooler's six-inch copper plate cool head.
Carrier has spent some tens of millions of dollars on its cryocooler, says
Charles Lockerby, business development director of the Transicold division's
advanced electronics cooling unit.
Much of the effort has gone into improving reliability and reducing noise
and vibration down to a total of 45 decibels, but Carrier has also had to
work hard, says Lockerby, convincing computer manufacturers 'that it was
going to be OK putting something mechanical inside the temple of the
computer'.
Carrier's hope is that mid-range computer manufacturers will buy the
cryocooler in place of all the extra components currently used to make
computers run faster. Once in volume production - which may not yet be for a
year or two - the machines will cost about Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 10,500)
when bought in quantity.
Lockerby sees a market of at least 10 to 15 years for cryocooled CMOS chips.
The big question, however, is whether conventional developments in chip
design will yield the faster speeds anyway.
Hands sees more potential for cryocoolers in superconductors, where the
availability of reliable, inexpensive systems will assist in the development
of high Tc (critical temperature) applications. The availability of
mass-produced cryocoolers may well depend on their success in the much
bigger computer market.
There are many other possible applications. Carrier is beginning to develop
a cryocooler for magnetic resonance imaging machines which use low Tc
superconductors - MRI is used widely in medicine as an alternative to X-rays
 -and also sees uses for cryocooled superconductors in space and defence.
At very low temperatures, superconductors have zero resistance, but they can
also repel an external magnetic field, in such a way that a spinning magnet
can be held in a levitated position. Known as the Meisner effect, this
creates opportunities for cryocoolers in magnetically levitated transport
(Maglev) and for levitating flywheels to store cheap energy for electric
cars, says Lockerby. 'We'd love to put one in every electric car,' he adds.
At Oxford, there is particular interest in developing Stirling cycle 'green'
refrigerators - using nitrogen rather than ozone-damaging CFCs as the
refrigerant. The cool head of a cryocooler is very localised, requiring a
fan to distribute the cold and thus necessitating a complete redesign. 'The
biggest problem,' says Hands, 'is persuading the fridge manufacturers that
it's a good idea. They want a 'drop-in' replacement to CFCs.'
Carrier's forthcoming entry into the emerging, fragmented market for
cryocoolers could be very significant, although mass-production will have to
wait until the computer industry is ready to incorporate the machines in
their designs.
The project has been given a high priority within Carrier and UTC, and
Carrier wants to use its global marketing and distribution network to
support what is eventually intended to be a very broad range of cryocoolers,
says Lockerby.

Christies International is in talks with Sir Anthony Tennant, the out-going

although Christie's was not yesterday prepared to confirm that Sir Anthony
is its chosen candidate to succeed Lord Carrington as chairman.
An old Etonian - and art collector with a particular interest in British
works including Scottish contemporary paintings - Sir Anthony combines the
necessary establishment connections with the strongest of commercial
pedigrees. During the past five years he is credited with putting Guinness
back onto its feet after the scandal, and it is assumed that, even with the
Christie's job under his belt, the 61-year-old will be in the market for
another big industrial post after he retires from Guinness at the end this
year.
Lord Carrington has chaired Christie's since 1988, presiding over a very
tough time for the art world. While Christie's now claims a 49 per cent
share of the global market - its highest record since the 1950s - thus
treading heavily on the heels of Sotheby's, it has seen a period of
stringent cost-cutting with Christie's directors taking the lead and voting
themselves 20 per cent pay-cuts this year.
At 73, the former foreign secretary and NATO secretary-general, who, as the
EC's chief negotiator, has been trying to bring peace to the former
Yugoslavia, is likely to step down from Christie's next May at the time of

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is estimated that 70 per cent of all trading documents printed by
computer are re-keyed into another computer by their recipients,
representing considerable time and cost.
One way to reduce this wasted effort is to introduce electronic data
interchange (EDI) which allows for computer-to-computer handling of
structured information like orders, delivery notes, invoices, credit notes
and other commercial communications between trading partners.
In the UK, booksellers are the latest retailers to embrace EDI. First
Edition, of Otford, Kent, began supplying EDI services to the book community
last month following a three-month pilot scheme involving five publishers
and four booksellers/suppliers.
The potential market for EDI among booksellers is substantial. As Mark
Hodder-Williams, managing director of First Edition, notes: 'This is an
industry with 15,000 producers and over 500,000 product lines.'
Dillons, one of the biggest UK booksellers, estimates that it alone handles
1.5m invoices a year which, if placed end to end would reach from London to
Leeds. The company spends about 11,000 hours a year keying them into
computers.
First Edition, formed by Book Data, the book database company, and Vista
Computer Services, the computer systems market leader in the UK book
publishing industry, is providing EDI to the book industry based on the INS
Tradernet service. First Edition subscribers receive the INS Intercept-Plus
software for use on any PC clone, an electronic mailbox, full installation
and consultancy, plus staff training.
The service provides publishers, wholesalers, the library community and
bookshops with access to a low-cost, fast and reliable 24-hour
computer-to-computer service for exchanging commercial documents in agreed
formats defined by the Book Industry Communication, the official
co-ordinating body for EDI in the book industry.
EDI is expected to offer a number of advantages to booksellers including
speeding up communications, eliminating repetitive data entry, increasing
accuracy, enhancing customer service and reducing operating costs.

There is a degree of symmetry, if not poetic justice, in the fact that Nigel
Hughes, formerly chief executive of the Defence Research Agency before he
was replaced by John Chis-holm who was lured from the private sector, should
himself have now touched down at a big public company.
Hughes, a scientist and engineer with a long career at the Ministry of
Defence, is the new director of technology at Smiths Industries' aerospace
and defence group, succeeding John Hollington, who is retiring after 36
years at Smiths.
'Any civil servant always has a question mark at the back of his mind as to
whether he can survive in the private sector,' says Hughes, who is 54. 'I am
delighted to have the opportunity to give it a whirl.'
He explains that since his early days working on aircraft blind landing
systems, he had worked alongside Smiths. 'I understand their product range
and technologies.'
Moving on from the Royal Aircraft Establishment to the Ministry of Defence
central staff in 1980, he became deputy chief scientific adviser in 1984.
Two years later he was promoted to become director of the Royal Signals and
Radar Establishment, whence he masterminded the launch of the Defence
Research Agency in April 1991.
But after two years as chief executive designate and chief executive of the
DRA, he is philosophical about the MoD's choice of Chisholm to continue the
job from last September. 'All is fair in love and war,' he says now.
From his new base in Cheltenham, Hughes will be in charge of the research
and development function relating to civil and defence avionics at Smiths -
which is understood to involve an annual research and development spend of
around Pounds 100m.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Learning lessons from the
Olympics - Diane Summers reports on new initiatives in local economic
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is almost impossible to run a business without tripping over countless
agencies intent on stimulating local economic development and providing
business support.
The government's Urban Regeneration Agency is the latest body to join the
list of statutory, voluntary and private sector organisations attempting to
get in on the act. The problem is that there is often little co-ordination
between these bodies and, on occasions, there is even hostility and wasteful
competition.
Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, highlighted the problem
when he addressed a conference of Training and Enterprise Council leaders.
The country could no longer afford 'turf battles' between the bodies, he
said.
Heseltine then promptly announced another addition to the scene - a network
of 'first-stop shops', eventually to be 200-strong, which will provide
business support. The first shops are not likely to be in business until
next year. Even if they are successful, there remains the problem of
co-ordinating the wider strategic questions of local economic development.
Here the government is likely to look closely at a report by Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the accountants, and published this week by the business-led
voluntary organisation, Business in the Community.*
The study examines four European regions - Catalonia in Spain, Lombardia in
Italy, Limburg in the Netherlands and Hamburg in Germany - and compares
their local economic development records with the UK's. The report's main
conclusion is that current initiatives in the UK are too fragmented and lack
the necessary 'critical mass' to be effective. Consequently, individual
geographical areas in the UK are unable to compete with regions in the rest
of Europe.
One topical example is Barcelona's achievement in winning the staging of the
Olympic games against stiff worldwide competition. Barcelona and Catalonia
have detailed, interrelated plans for the future development of the region,
backed by investment programmes under local control.
The study finds strategies are based consistently on Barcelona's role as the
capital of a leading 'Euro-region' spanning the French-Spanish border. The
machinery was in place for city, regional and national government to work
together to capture the Olympics, in spite of political differences.
Catalonia's historical and political development as a region cannot be
mimicked overnight but the report suggests ways in which UK co-operation can
be stimulated and the necessary 'critical mass' - economic strategies
covering populations between 1m and 9m - can be achieved.
The initiative to set up pilot projects, building on the work of partnership
experiments already under way in Birmingham and Nottinghamshire, should be
'bottom up', says the report. Central government's role is principally to
spread the message of co-operation and provide some financial incentives,
perhaps along the lines of the City Challenge programme.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Cash mountain in search
of a home - Ian Hamilton Fazey looks at the venture capital industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is mounting on Britain's venture capital industry, the world's
biggest after the US. The continuous growth of the 1980s has stopped and
about Pounds 1.8bn of funds is available but uninvested.
A resultant pause in fund-raising is giving the venture capitalists' own
backers - mainly pension funds - time to think. In spite of the clamour from
companies to swap debt for equity to help them through the recession, or for
working capital to help finance their way out of it, the uninvested funds
are not available for these purposes.
They are for growth, for gambling on higher-than-average returns for
higher-than-average achievement. They are not even for long-term investment.
Venture capitalists - and the pension funds that back them  - want returns
of 30 per cent in three to seven years in exchange for taking the risk of
losing all if a company they support fails.
Since they get their returns from the flotation on the stock market of the
companies they back, or from the sale of the whole business or just their
stake in it, recession affects them badly. If the funds cannot exit easily
from existing investee companies, this inhibits them from backing new ones.
At the same time, pension funds which have backed the venture capital funds
are still being charged management fees of up 2 1/2 per cent of their
investments, even if the money has not yet been put into any growing
businesses.
Peter Folkman, a former 3i director who now runs North of England Ventures
in Manchester, says: 'What is now very clear is that this is a cyclical
business. You cannot raise money in the UK at the moment, certainly not in
the quantities that were available in the late 1980s.' He questions whether
the pension funds will ever again be as enthusiastic as they used to be when
they are tapped again for money next year or, more likely, in 1994, when
present stocks are depleted. 'There will start to be a real shortage of
funds in about a year's time,' Folkman says.
The figures show what is happening. If 3i's network of more than 20 offices
in London and the regions is excluded as an ever-present background of
long-term development capital from the clearing banks, significant change in
the venture capital industry is quickly apparent.
According to Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, UK funds invested Pounds 1.39m
in 1988 in promising companies. This rose to Pounds 1.65bn in 1989, then
fell back to the 1988 level before dropping to Pounds 1.15m last year. Since
around Pounds 200m a year goes overseas, the UK position is worse than this
looks. Yet while the market was turning down, the total pool available for
investment was continuing to rise as pension fund managers got on to what
most still saw as a bandwagon.
Venture Economics, a consultancy which analyses the industry, puts the pool
of uninvested money at Pounds 384m in 1988, rising to Pounds 1.45m in 1989
and Pounds 1.85bn in 1990, when another Pounds 900m was, none-the-less,
raised to carry forward.
Folkman has been analysing the UK's figures for the last three years. With
overseas investment stripped out, these show Pounds 1.42bn invested at the
1989 peak, declining to Pounds 989m last year, a fall of 30 per cent.
This pressure told on numbers of funds, with a shake-out from 124 in 1989 to
114 last year. However, the number of deals fell by only 8 per cent, from
1,302 to 1,196, so that the number of deals done by each fund - 10.5 last
year - was the same as in 1989. To make these numbers add up, there had to
be a fall in the value of investments made by each fund - from Pounds 11.5m
in 1989 to Pounds 8.7m last year, a drop of 24 per cent.
However, this is not entirely bad news for the funds, as Folkman's further
analysis reveals. Of the Pounds 989m they invested last year, 28 per cent
was in the Midlands and north, the area where Folkman's fund operates. This
was worth Pounds 277m and compared with Pounds 256m in 1990 when the
regions' share was 23 per cent. Moreover, the same regions' share of the
1,196 deals in 1991 was 34 per cent, or 406. The comparative figures for
1990 were 29 per cent and 354.
The trend, therefore, is for more deals in the regions where recession has
not had such a serious effect as in the south, but at lower individual
value. This is good news for regional funds, which grew from a handful in
1985 to more than 70 now. However, the regional funds are small, having only
Pounds 5m-20m each to invest. This means that none is likely to put more
than Pounds 1m into any single deal.
Charles Sherwood of Schroder Ventures says this is likely to lead to
important changes in the industry. The first signs came in May when Schroder
backed the purchase of Sumit Equity Ventures, one of the oldest regional
groups, from AE Sharp, the Birmingham-based stockbroking and financial
services company. Sumit has three funds worth Pounds 43m. It will now be run
by Lindsay Bury, previously a founder of Apricot Computers. AE Sharp retains
10 per cent but Bury's other shareholders will be Schroder Ventures and
Folkman's North of England fund, which Schroder also backs.
Sherwood says the industry is now mature and is segmenting. The strength of
London funds is in big, complex, international or specialised
high-technology deals. This is making it hard to compete in the regions. 'We
don't have the ability to respond quickly to deals outside London and we
don't have enough regular contact with intermediaries in regional centres to
develop trust between them and our funds.
'If you have a small deal in, say, Leeds and don't need anything more than
generalised venture capital skills, why even think of taking it outside
Yorkshire?' he asks. He sees Schroder's tie-up with Folkman and Bury as akin
to a franchising operation, with London money made more easily available for
medium-sized or bigger deals in the regions.
It means a regional fund manager can score on local knowledge and contacts
with the growing professional networks of Manchester, Leeds or Birmingham,
but then get over the problem of only being able to invest about Pounds 1m
at a time.
There are, of course, other structures for disbursing funds from London,
such as 3i's national network or County NatWest's chain of regional offices.
But Sherwood thinks the new alliance between Schroder, Sumit and North of
England offers small regional funds an alternative to syndicating promising
deals with competitors.
He thinks it will also appeal to pension funds when they start investing
again, so it is a model other London funds are looking at. The potential
benefits are also obvious for any growing business outside London that is a
genuinely good venture capital prospect - however fraught the industry's
struggle with the economic cycle.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE quarters of British employers have policies to deal with problem
drinking at work, according to a survey of 450 organisations.
More than 50 per cent of organisations either incorporate policies on
alcohol abuse into disciplinary procedures or operate an 'unwritten
understanding' on it, according to the IRS Employment Trends, the magazine
of the pay research group.
Policies often stipulate strict penalties for those found drunk at work,
which often include dismissal. A growing number of employers now test and
search employees for alcohol, especially in safety-sensitive areas such as
transport and offshore oil exploration.
The survey finds that organisations are beginning to treat problem drinkers
with greater sensitivity. More are offering counselling and other services
to employees who accept that they have alcohol problems.

FT  04 AUG 92 / US-style legal funding re-examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW SOCIETY is to re-examine US-style 'no win, no pay' contingency fee
arrangements as an alternative to legal aid as part of an overall review of
methods of funding court cases.
Solicitors are concerned that restrictions on legal aid have put the cost of
going to court beyond the reach of people on average incomes. The review
will examine whether contingency fee arrangements, where lawyers are paid
only if they win the case, could cut the cost of legal aid, which is
expected to exceed Pounds 1bn in 1992-93.
Government attempts to control the rising cost of legal aid by imposing
standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts have been
opposed by solicitors who have threatened to withdraw from legal-aid work.
The society believes that a more radical solution to the drawbacks of the
legal aid system must be considered. The review will examine whether
contingency fees would increase access to justice or simply encourage the
pursuit of hopeless litigation. It will also ask whether legal aid should
continue to be available in a case that could be funded on a contingency fee
basis and whether insurance cover could be devised against the risk of
paying the other side's costs.
Mr John Appleby, a member of the society's governing council who will head
the review, said yesterday: 'Going to law has become prohibitively
expensive.'
Under present rules, solicitors are not strictly allowed to charge clients
only if they win the case. The government provided for the introduction of a
limited form of contingency fee arrangement in the Courts and Legal Services
Act 1990, but the relevant section has not yet been brought into force.

FT  04 AUG 92 / High-tech trials urged: Blue Arrow judge calls for computer
support for fraud cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGES should make greater use of computer technology to help to keep
complex fraud trials manageable, Mr Justice Brooke, the second Blue Arrow
trial judge, said yesterday.
Mr Justice Brooke - who replaced Mr Justice McKinnon after the first Blue
Arrow trial - was speaking after formally acquitting the remaining four
defendants charged with fraud over the affair.
Not-guilty verdicts were returned against Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim
Brown, both former equities directors with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew; Mr Charles
Villiers, the former chairman of County NatWest; and Ms Elizabeth Brimelow,
County's former compliance director. Their costs, thought to approach Pounds
1m, were awarded from public funds.
Contributing to the debate on reforming the handling of large fraud trials,
Mr Justice Brooke said the public and business community were 'justifiably
looking with impatience' to the courts' finding ways to manage such trials.
Judges in such cases faced an enormous intellectual and physical burden, he
said. Computer support was crucial.
American experience had shown that the use of laptop computers by judges
could save much time and cost. Edited evidence could be recorded on computer
within 20 seconds of its being given. With the judge freed from making
handwritten notes, up to 10 per cent more evidence could be heard in a day.
'It is, I believe, incumbent on English judges to be willing to learn new
techniques if they may make such a substantial difference to the length of a
trial or the overall cost of proceedings,' said Mr Justice Brooke, who had
planned to use a laptop in the now cancelled second and third Blue Arrow
trials.
To reduce court time further, he called for firmer timetabling of legal
arguments heard when juries are out. He added that his suggestion, made
during an earlier hearing, that electronic clocks should be installed in
courts to register the mounting financial cost of trials every 15 minutes
was not entirely a joke.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Employers offered training cash incentive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUILDING industry trade association is offering employers subsidies of
more than Pounds 1,000 for each trainee they recruit in an effort to avert
skills shortages.
The Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association, which organises
training in its industry, is offering employers who are not members of its
association a one-off grant of Pounds 300 and payment of two years' training
fees, at Pounds 375 a year, in return for taking on a trainee funded by the
Youth Training scheme.
The incentive is one of the most radical by an employers' organisation at a
time when employers generally have cut the number of training places for
young people. That has put a strain on the YT scheme under which companies
take on young trainees either temporarily or permanently.
One of the main reasons that Training and Enterprise Councils, which
administer the YT scheme in England and Wales, have found it difficult to
uphold the government's guarantee of a training place for all young people
who want one has been a shortage of places with employers. Part of the YT
training period has had to be spent with an employer and not just in
college.
There has been a sharp reduction in training places in the heating and
ventilation industry - in the 12 months to July there were about 3,000 craft
and technician trainees; This September the new intake is projected to be
around 1,200.
The HVCA, is offering the same incentives for its 1,200 member companies,
with the one-off grant increased to Pounds 400. The association said it had
more than adequate funds for the scheme.
Mr John Clarke of the HVCA said: 'If we do not continue to train now, there
will be a very severe skills shortage when the recession ends. Companies
will then have to pay over the odds for staff and that will be reflected in
contract prices.'
He said most employers in the industry employed about 10 people and
companies were finding it a struggle to keep on adult staff, with little
left over to recruit apprentices.
Mr Clarke said at least two colleges in London had stopped offering courses
for the industry and he feared more might close. The HVCA said there was no
difficulty about its funding of the initiative - the more employers who
wanted to take up the offer, the better for the industry.
Cuts in training by employers were said yesterday to be one of the reasons
for a fall in the number of young people leaving YT with qualifications.
According to a survey published by Youthaid, a charity concerned with young
people in the labour market, the proportion of young people leaving YT with
qualifications fell from 38 per cent in the 12 months to March 1991 to 35
per cent in the 12 months to July 1991.
The survey also showed a further effect of the recession, with the
unemployment rate for young people leaving the scheme rising from 20 per
cent in the 12 months to March 1991 to 23 per cent in the same period to
July 1991.

FT  04 AUG 92 / House prices continue to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE prices are continuing to fall in many parts of the country, according
to separate surveys published yesterday by building societies.
The reports will further diminish hopes of a return of confidence in the
housing market, which might have heralded the start of a recovery in the
economy generally.
Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, said that prices on
average fell by 0.5 per cent last month after a similar fall in June. The
average price of a home last month was Pounds 55,414 - 6 per cent lower than
during the corresponding month last year.
Northern Rock building society, in a separate report, said that prices in
northern England fell by between 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent during the
three months to the end of July.
Mr John Hutchinson, a Nationwide director, said fears about unemployment and
the state of the general economy were preventing the market from recovering.
He said that the housing market had a central role to play in the recovery
of the UK economy. It was vital, therefore, that everybody involved should
search for practical initiatives to end the uncertainties that were
depressing the market.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Single-member company change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES can now be created with a single shareholder, under legislation
published yesterday in response to the EC twelfth company law directive.
The Companies (Single Member Private Limited Companies) Regulation amends
the 1985 Companies Act, which previously required at least two people to
create a company with limited liability.
It also protects from insolvency or the loss of limited-liability privilege
existing companies that become single-member companies, after events such as
the transfer of shares.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the legislation
represented a simplification of red tape in company formation, in accordance
with the EC directive introduced in 1989.
The DTI denied that it was likely to create more fraudulent companies, with
only one person required to create a company. It said that was no more
likely than under existing legislation with just two shareholders, one of
whom could be a nominee and therefore offer little more protection.
The regulation for single-member companies provides safeguards by requiring
that contracts, corporate decisions and other information are put in writing
and specifies criminal penalties for any breaches.
The Inland Revenue has tightened the regulations over profit-related pay
schemes that it will accept for registration.
A new statement of practice says any schemes that give a formula for the
distribution of profits without specifying the figures used will no longer
be accepted. Existing legislation permits schemes that use either a fixed
percentage of profits or a pool for a specified amount to be accepted. The
use of formulae in place of figures was allowable in schemes registered
until yesterday. PROPOSED Treasury guidelines on money laundering are
burdensome and omit certain important groups, the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. A
submission to the government from an institute working group raises
questions over the idea of creating an offence for any person acting in the
course of any trade, business or profession not reporting money laundering
suspicions to the authorities. It says that is a considerable extension from
original proposals covering simply credit and financial institutions. It
emphasises that secondary legislation on laundering should be extended to
the unregulated financial sector, to include businesses such as Bureaux de
Change, which are currently not mentioned.

FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: South America may go back to its trade
roots - John Barham on plans for a five-nation water corridor on the
continent's second largest river system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONQUISTADORES, explorers and traders once used the rivers of South America
to penetrate, subdue and settle the continent's heartland. But today the
rivers which form some of the world's greatest navigable waterways are
underused and vast regions of the interior isolated and impoverished.
But there are signs that the Parana-Paraguay rivers, which together form
South America's largest river system after the Amazon, could become an
important trade corridor linking the distant, landlocked interior with
seaports at the River Plate estuary.
Developing the rivers' transport potential should be easy because there are
few physical or natural obstacles to traffic. But petty national jealousies
and suspicions have held up progress for years.
The five countries through which the rivers flow - Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - agreed in June to sweep away bureaucratic
restrictions that blocked trade and navigation.
Next, they plan to hire consultants to study how the 3,442km waterway, known
as the Hidrovia (Waterway), can be made into a low-cost artery navigable day
and night all year round. This first stage of engineering and environmental
consulting work will be financed by the United Nations, the European
Community and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Officials say an initial studies show that a few relatively cheap and simple
engineering projects estimated at Dollars 240m (Pounds 125.6m) would ensure
the Hidrovia's navigability. These costs would be borne by governments.
A further series of investments of about Dollars 740m needed to upgrade
ports and buy barges would be made by the private sector. Officials say it
would take about 10 years to make the Hidrovia fully operational and put the
total bill at Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn.
Mr Edmundo Soria, Argentina's transport secretary, said: 'We don't want
grand Pharaonic projects. We will be very careful with the projects we carry
out and restrict the state's financing to the minimum possible.'
The Hidrovia project is part of a wider trend towards greater political
co-operation, economic integration and free markets that is sweeping Latin
America. Other privately-financed infrastructure projects being studied
include a 45km bridge across the River Plate, a motorway linking Montevideo
and Porto Alegre in southern Brazil and a Dollars 200m gas pipeline
connecting gas fields in Patagonia with Chile.
At the moment, the rivers are only partly navigable. Still, Argentina uses
river ports on the Parana to ship a quarter of its exports and Paraguay
imports most of its fuel along the Paraguay river. But the Paraguay is only
navigable on average for about six months of the year above the capital
Asuncion.
Mr Jesus Gonzalez, Argentina's director of port construction and waterways,
says the potential economic benefits are clear: 'In Brazil's centre-west
there are 6m hectares of land ready for cultivation. But to take one tonne
of soyabeans to port costs Dollars 56 now. With the Hidrovia, transport
costs would fall to about Dollars 18 a tonne.' Also, Bolivia's
under-developed eastern regions have potentially rich agricultural land and
contain promising mineral deposits that would only become economically
viable with a cheap and efficient transport system.
A preliminary feasibility study found that while 4.3m tonnes were shipped
along the river in 1987, cargoes could reach 21m tonnes a year by the turn
of the century. It estimates an internal rate of return of between 16 per
cent and 23 per cent for the Hidrovia investments.
Although the impact of the Hidrovia would be felt mainly in the heart of the
continent, ports on the River Plate estuary would also benefit. Nueva
Palmira in Uruguay is expected to become the main transhipment centre. It is
expected to handle 7m-9m tonnes of cargo a year by 2000.
Planning is the easy part. But the hard decisions on who is to pay for the
project and how the money is to be raised have yet to be taken. The
Argentines are insisting that the private sector pay for most of the work in
exchange for the right to charge tolls or build private ports.
The Brazilians, who must carry out the costliest projects, say the state
will probably have to play a leading role. For their part, the smaller,
poorer countries balk at the sums involved.
Then there is the problem of the environment. That means more than just
curbing water pollution by barges or preventing damage of riverbanks by the
vessels' wakes. Brazil's Pantanal marshes, the world's largest wetlands
which lie along the Paraguay, must also be protected.
There is also a risk that the Hidrovia would attract large populations to
barren regions and that intensive farming and mining damage ecosystems.
There is also a danger that the Hidrovia could become a smuggling corridor
for Bolivia's cocaine cartels.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US, CANADIAN and Mexican trade ministers and their negotiating teams were
haggling in Washington's Watergate Hotel yesterday over the final details of
the North American Trade Agreement (Nafta).
While they worked to 'capture the momentum', in the words of Mrs Carla
Hills, US trade representative, opponents of the pact were keeping the fax
lines busy with press releases. Mr John Cregan, president of the
protectionist-leaning US Business and Industrial Council, warned: 'Los
Angeles could burn again, and the fire may spread to dozens of US cities if
Nafta becomes law. Hundreds of thousands of semi-skilled and unskilled
manufacturing jobs held mainly by minorities will be lost to Mexico.'
Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer with Mr Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, saw the
Watergate, focus of the scandal leading to President Nixon's resignation, as
'the perfect location to wrap up the Nafta talks: a symbol of secrecy,
broken promises to the American people, and ultimately, the end of a
presidency.' She said a poll released by the San Diego Union Tribune Latinos
and people living on the US-Mexico border opposed Nafta (two groups on which
the Bush administration was relying for support).
Many US companies are excited about Nafta. Mr Ari Bousbib, of Booz, Allen
and Hamilton, a New York consulting company, is busy arranging 'strategic'
alliances between US or foreign and Mexican businesses. A number of Mexican
groups, accustomed to a quasi-monopolistic environment, were shoring up
their competitive positions. US companies were looking at their networks to
overcome distributional problems in doing business in Mexico.
He believed US prices would fall because of competition but that would be
balanced by a 4 per cent rise of consumption in the US and 8 per cent in
Mexico. The US would gain jobs as US companies expanded to service the
Mexican market. Production costs would fall, making North American products
more competitive. If the pact failed in Congress, it would have short-term
consequences in the financial markets, delaying some investments.
A study by the Mexican office of Arthur D. Little management consultants
shows that if Nafta is agreed, US exports to Mexico will keep growing at
20-30 per cent a year for 1993-1996. Without a pact, exports would grow at
perhaps half the 22.3 per cent annual compounded rate of the last four
years.

THE year 1992 is likely to be a boom one for Sri Lankan tourism, the
country's tourist board said yesterday, Mervyn de Silva reports from
Colombo. 'We are likely to pass the half-million mark,' an official
predicted. The previous record was 402,000 in 1982. Anti-Tamil riots in 1983
cut the total to 200,000, but political stability was the main reason for
the improvement.
Europe continues to top the list, with Germany ranking first, and Italy,
France and the Netherlands showing a sharp rise in numbers. The board
believes the half-million mark can be reached if Air Lanka expands its
European service. But the carrier's plan to buy six Lockheed TriStars has
been criticised by the World Bank and IMF.

group, Japan's largest chemical company, had lodged an appeal against an
earlier court ruling to cease production at its plant near Ipoh, in northern
Malaysia.
But proceedings at the supreme court were adjourned after about 2,000
protesters from Ipoh arrived outside the court buildings. Riot police
prevented them from entering the court complex.
Asian Rare Earth produces minerals used in making electronic components.
Last month the Ipoh High Court had found there was enough evidence to show
that the health of local residents had been threatened by emissions from the
Asian Rare Earth factory, with a growing number of cases of leukaemia,
infant deaths and congenital diseases reported in the surrounding area.
The factory had been ordered to shut down within two weeks, though no
compensation was paid as the judge found that negligence by the company had
not been proven.
Soon after the Ipoh court ruling local residents were angered when Asian
Rare Earth succeeded in getting an interim stay of execution on the closure
order from the Supreme Court. Yesterday's hearing was to decide on the
validity of the original Ipoh High Court verdict.
While local residents have been involved in a lengthy campaign against Asian
Rare Earth's activities, the issue has not received much publicity in
Malaysia as a whole.
In Japan, however, several environmental groups have seized on the issue as
showing that Japan is exporting its polluting industries overseas.
The Supreme Court hearing of the case is now scheduled for tomorrow.

INDIA'S prime minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, yesterday denied that his office
had 'interfered or brought pressure' on Mr K. Madhavan, the head of the
official investigation into the Bombay financial scandal. Mr Madhavan
resigned last week, prompting speculation of political interference.
Mr Rao rejected opposition allegations that he had asked the joint director
of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to 'go slow' with an
investigation against ministers and senior officers.
He said: 'Nothing would be allowed to come in the way of a complete
investigation. The guilty would be punished, and there was no question of
any attempt to protect the guilty, no matter who the individual, or what his
position in government or society.' The prime minister also denied
allegations that cabinet ministers were involved.
Mr Madhavan denied he had laid down conditions to withdraw his resignation,
and said the inquiry was 'not dependent on one person' and would go on.
Mr George Fernandes, leader of the Janata Party, said: 'The prime minister's
remark that he 'would have liked Mr Madhavan to complete the important task
entrusted to him' implies that they would like him to go.' Mr Fernandes has
said he was approached by the government to persuade Mr Madhavan to change
his mind and withdraw his resignation.
Suspected Sikh militants shot dead 29 Hindus, including three women and two
children, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, Reuter reports from
Lucknow.
Police said yesterday the bodies of the victims were found on the banks of
the Khannaur river.
The latest deaths take the number of people killed in separatist violence in
Uttar Pradesh to 200 in the past year.
In a separate incident in Punjab, at least five Sikh militants and an Indian
army soldier were killed in a day-long gun battle near Amritsar.

FT  04 AUG 92 / US and Iraq pursue warof political gestures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Iraq continued their war of political gestures yesterday with
American marines preparing to land on the beaches of Kuwait and Baghdad
vowing never to renounce its claim to the tiny neighbouring country it
invaded two years ago.
Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, bolstered by his success in delaying the
entry of UN inspectors to the agriculture ministry in Baghdad, is again
trying to portray himself as the only Arab leader willing to confront the
US.
Baghdad newspapers repeated yesterday that Kuwait was Iraq's 19th province
and that the invasion on August 2 1990 was 'the greatest historic epic in
the contemporary history of Iraq'. They insisted that one day the province
of Kuwait would be returned to its 'rightful' owners.
The US response has been to bring forward planned manoeuvres with Kuwaiti
troops and to send more Patriot missiles to defend against possible attacks
by Iraqi Scud missiles. However, western diplomats do not expect Mr Saddam
to initiate any military action against Kuwait, although he is continuing to
root out pockets of dissent among the mainly Shia population in the south of
Iraq.
Up to 1,900 US marines and some 5,000 other troops will be participating in
the manoeuvres, which will continue throughout August. Kuwait has been
slowly rebuilding its armed forces but given the available personnel,
officials accept that the country's defence will remain for the foreseeable
future in US hands.
An opposition newspaper in Kuwait accused the government yesterday of
confusing the public by failing to explain the arrival of US troops. It said
the additional missiles and the troop deployment had raised fears about a
second Iraqi invasion rather than providing intended reassurance.
The anniversary of the invasion also served as a reminder of the estimated
800 Kuwaitis who are still being held in Iraq. In several countries Kuwaiti
embassies sought to focus attention on these people by taking out newspaper
advertisements.
In Tehran, hundreds of Iraqis demonstrated in support of the Shias in
southern Iraq. They called on the UN Security Council to halt the 'genocide'
by Baghdad's forces. A UN investigator last week accused Iraq of
indiscriminate bombing in the south and said large numbers had been killed
and many more forced to flee their homes.
Efforts to tighten UN sanctions against Iraq drew protests from Jordanian
officials yesterday who complained that vessels approaching the port of
Aqaba were being subjected to excessive delays.
Mr Tawfiq Kawar, head of Jordan's Shipping Agents Association, told Reuters
that in the past 10 days four ships had been delayed for up to three days
due to more rigorous inspection procedures by western warships patrolling
the Straits of Tiran.

NEW ZEALAND'S prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, has responded angrily to
advertisements to be launched by the Australian Labor Party in the state of

The advertisements feature New Zealanders complaining about low wages,
inadequate social welfare and poor business prospects, blaming their
government's free market policies for the problems.
They warn that Victorians would feel similar pain if the opposition Liberal
Party won the election.
The Liberal Party is presenting a package of state and federal policies
similar to those in New Zealand, including a goods and services tax and a
deregulated labour market.
The adverts will launch the Victorian state election campaign in October. Mr
Bolger said the Victorian state government was desperate to find someone

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's general strike and mass action campaign in South Africa takes
place against a crescendo of alarm bells about the weak state of the
country's economy.
Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance, said last week that although the
short-term disruption caused by the strike would be substantial in terms of
jobs lost, income forgone and general disruption, there was also a danger of
more lasting damage.
'If this stayaway becomes prolonged for purely political reasons, if it
becomes more than simply a gesture of protest, the verdict of the overseas
markets is going to be adverse and there is no court of appeal,' said Mr
Keys.
Mr Keys's comments coincided with a warning by the Old Mutual, the country's
largest financial institution, of the damage being caused by political
uncertainty.
Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist, said it needed to be asked 'whether the
economy will recover at all until such time that the current political
disputes have been settled and greater certainty reached about the political
situation in general'.
Mr Mohr added: 'Put differently, there is growing concern that the long-term
deterioration in the domestic growth performance may persist for some years
to come'. The growth performance of the economy over the past three years
has been the poorest for any three-year period since the second world war.
The economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in 1990 and 0.6 per cent in 1991.
Earlier this year, there was consensus among economists that a positive
growth rate of up to 2 per cent would be achieved in 1992.
Slower recovery in world markets, an unexpected deepening of the domestic
recession and a disastrous drought, however, have resulted in a drastic
downward revision of forecasts.
Old Mutual is now forecasting a decline of 1.5 per cent or more in real GDP
for the year, while ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group, is
forecasting a 1 per cent decline.
The further slowdown in the economy has serious fiscal implications. The
Treasury was forced to concede recently that its revenue forecasts for
fiscal 1992-3, on which a forecast budget deficit of 4.5 per cent had been
based, now looked 'somewhat optimistic'.
'Old Mutual says that a deficit of 'well over 5 per cent' is 'very likely',
while ABSA is forecasting 6.1 per cent.
The strike was broadly effective yesterday in urban centres but patchy in
the mines which produce much of the nation's wealth. Mining houses said gold
and platinum production was virtually normal but coal was hit, Reuter adds.
The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) said the workers' stayaway was
influenced by intimidation, transport difficulties and contingency plans
made by employers. There were wide disparities in regional and business
sector absenteeism, it said.
'The full (economic) impact on business has still to be evaluated,' it
added. 'The total stayaway is not likely to have exceeded 2m workers in the
private sector.'

FT  04 AUG 92 / Labor claims a 'gold medal' for economic policy: Australia's
government is trying to turn the spotlight from the jobless to prices and
trade figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government has pounced on improvements in the consumer
price index and balance of payments to divert the spotlight away from record
unemployment levels.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, described the government's economic
policy as a 'gold medal performance'. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
said Australia had 'snapped the inflation stick'.
The principal cause of the hyperbole was a reduction in the annual rate of
inflation from 1.7 per cent in the three months to March to 1.2 per cent in
the June quarter.
Success on the inflation front was followed by figures showing a 25 per cent
reduction in the current account deficit to ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 4.5bn)
for the 12 months to the end of June, from ADollars 15.7bn in the previous
year.
From the government's point of view, the inflation and current account
figures provide a welcome diversion from its embarrassment at presiding over
record unemployment of 11.1 per cent.
While the Australian economy is clearly in better shape than a year ago,
there is plenty of evidence that the patient may have to spend longer in the
sick room than Mr Keating is prepared to admit. This could present a serious
problem for Labor, which is trailing the opposition conservatives in the
opinion polls, but must call a federal election by June next year.
The good news is that inflation is likely to remain fairly low, although the
inflation stick appears more likely to have been bent than snapped. Most
economists expect the annual rate to fall further this year before edging up
again to between 3 and 4 per cent next year.
The government accepts that the improvement in the figures is largely a
result of the deflationary effects of the 1990-91 recession, when gross
domestic product contracted or was flat for seven of eight consecutive
quarters.
But it will take some of the credit for restraining wages through its
'accord' with the trade union movement, which recently agreed to link pay
demands to inflation expectations.
The bad news is that, despite government pump-priming and a series of
interest rate cuts, the recovery has failed to gather pace since the end of
the recession late last year. In his February economic statement, Mr Keating
announced a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 890m) spending programme intended to help
deliver gross domestic product growth of 4.75 per cent in 1992-93, followed
by average growth of 4 per cent in the next three years.
Since February, the government has increased the forecast budget deficit for
1991-92 from ADollars 6.8bn to nearly ADollars 10bn, delivering a further
fiscal stimulus. Official interest rates have also been cut from 7.5 per
cent to 5.75 per cent.
But growth remains stubbornly low, mainly because of muted business
confidence and the preference of both the corporate sector and consumers for
debt reduction rather than consumption.
Most economists think the economy probably slowed again in the fourth
quarter of 1991-92, indicating that growth for the year will be less than Mr
Keating's forecast of 2 per cent.
Bowing to the inevitable, the government recently reduced the target for
1992-93 to 4 per cent, but most economists doubt that even that is
achievable. The National Australia Bank, the most bearish of recent
forecasters, says growth may be as low as 3 per cent.
Few observers think such an outcome would be enough to redeem the
government's promise of single-digit unemployment before the election. But
there are indications that even at the current slow pace of recovery, the
economy may run into external constraints.
At ADollars 11.7bn, the 1991-92 current account deficit is equivalent to 3.1
per cent of forecast GDP, the lowest ratio since 1979-80, and a considerable
improvement on the 6 per cent deficit two years ago.
However, the seasonally adjusted deficit has deteriorated in recent months,
culminating in a much larger than expected monthly deficit of ADollars 1.2bn
in June. Much of the increased deficit was caused by a rise in imports to
the highest level since 1989, suggesting that imports accounted for a
disproportionate share of increased retail sales.
The government has preferred to point to the surplus on merchandise trade,
which improved by 35 per cent over the year to ADollars 3.9bn. But the trend
figures indicate that growth in exports is decelerating just as import
growth improves, raising awkward questions about the sustainability of the
current account improvement.
Mr Keating's last chance to make significant changes in economic policy
before the election will come when the 1992-93 budget is delivered on August
18. However, the government may have left itself with very little room for
further pump priming.
Most economists say the financial markets would be concerned by a forecast
deficit much above ADollars 13bn, which would put pressure on the Australian
dollar and could lead to a sell-off of government bonds.
What is unfortunate for the government is that the minimum budget deficit is
also forecast at about ADollars 13bn, depending on the impact of any
recovery on tax revenues.
This means that extra spending intended to stimulate growth will have to be
offset by politically difficult cuts elsewhere in the budget, unless Mr
Keating is prepared to take on the markets.

FT  04 AUG 92 / If it's in Spanish on the box, it must be Televisa: Damian
Fraser tracks the Hispanic media empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCH a soap opera in Lima, Caracas, Mexico or Miami, and the chances are it
will have been made by Televisa, the giant Mexican television company. Turn
on the international news, and it will probably have been produced by Echo,
Televisa's Spanish-language alternative to CNN. Buy a Spanish-language
glossy magazine, and it may well have been published by a Televisa
subsidiary.
Televisa is rapidly becoming the Hispanic world's dominant media group. It
has recently bought large stakes in television channels in Chile and Peru
and has joint ventures with others in Venezuela and Argentina.
In April, it bid, with partners, Dollars 550m for Univision, the largest
Spanish-language network in the US. Last week it paid Dollars 130m for the
American Publishing Group, distributor of some 80 Spanish-language titles,
turning Televisa into the world's largest Spanish-language publisher.
The company has a near total stranglehold on entertainment in Mexico,
controlling 90 per cent of the television market, 10 radio stations, the
largest cable station, record labels, two national football teams, the
national bull ring, popular magazines, and one of the best museums.
If Televisa succeeds in its ambition of dominating Latin America's airwaves,
Mr Emilio Azcarraga, the company's president, will become not just the
continent's most powerful media baron, but arguably as important in Latin
America as William Randolph Hearst was in the US in the 1920s. Mr Azcarraga
known as El Tigre, is already Mexico's richest man, worth Dollars 2.8bn,
according to Forbes magazine.
Televisa's purchases of Hispanic channels are intended to let it take a
bigger slice of profits generated from its hugely popular soap operas
(telenovelas). Televisa produces about 40 per cent of all Spanish-language
television shown in Latin America and the US. At present it earns just the
distribution fees - around 15-25 per cent of profits generated by their
programmes. It would like to increase this to at least 50 per cent, explains
Mr Fernando Diez Barroso, Televisa's vice-chairman.
But many Televisa watchers see a different plan. The larger and more
powerful Televisa becomes in the Hispanic world, the harder it can squeeze
its competition, its long-suffering advertisers, and its huge in-house
stable of Spanish-speaking performers.
The Mexican government is about to privatise two network channels, 7 and 13,
and Univision - until Mr Azcarraga acquired it - was a rumoured bidder.
'Televisa wants to have a quasi-monopoly in the Latin world,' explains
Hermann von Bertrab of the Bertrab Mexican Report, 'partly because of
excellent growth prospects in the Hispanic market, but also to protect its
home turf from entrants.' Televisa's near-monopoly in Mexico enables it to
charge advertisers in advance, and it has raised rates 180 per cent in two
years.
On the production side, Televisa's influence is so pervasive that many Latin
performers live in fear of it. Televisa makes most of its employees sign
exclusive contracts, forbidding them to work for other companies. The fewer
alternatives there are, the more leverage Televisa has. Multivision, the
cable network competition to Televisa, already has to pay its performers a
premium because they fear being blacklisted by Televisa.
Mr Diez Barroso, the nephew of Mr Azcarraga, denies such a black-list
exists, but says: 'If somebody under contract walks away, of course there is
a problem.'
He readily accepts that Televisa's vast presence gives it an advantage over
competitors. 'We can offer actors a soap opera for six months, then a movie.
After that they can work in a nightclub. And if the lady sings we can cut
her a record, and it is distributed throughout the world.' In return, 'we
are going to ask her to behave in a certain manner. Its like the star system
in old Hollywood.'
Hispanic groups in the US have objected to Televisa's intended minority
purchase of Univision - still subject to approval by the Federal
Communications Commission - in part because of the feared cultural effects
of having this monolith responsible for US Spanish-language television.
Several groups have formally filed complaints before the FCC against the
acquisition, claiming that Mr Azcarraga has used an American investor, Mr A.
Jarrold Perenchio, as a frontman to circumvent FCC rules that limit foreign
ownership of stations to 25 per cent. Mr Diez Barroso describes the charge
as ludicrous, given that Mr Perenchio is a respected producer in his own
right.
Ms Esther Renteria, head of the National Hispanic Media Coalition in Los
Angeles, is also fearful about biased news coverage. Televisa rarely
criticises the Mexican government, almost never covers demonstrations
alleging vote fraud, or embarrasses it in any way. 'The Mexican government
uses newspapers to form political opinion, and Televisa to shape public
opinion,' explains Raymundo Riva Palacio, a columnist for El Financiero
newspaper.
Televisa already has an option to increase its stake in Univision, if the
proposed North American Free Trade Agreement changes FCC rules with regard
to Mexican purchases. Mr Diez Barroso is clear about his company's ambitions
in North America: 'We see this as one market in years to come, speaking two
different languages. We will be number one in the Spanish-speaking part.'

<TEXT>
THE Purchasing Managers' Index - a closely-watched indicator of the health
of US manufacturing - registered a small rise last month, suggesting factory
output is continuing to grow sluggishly.
The index rose to 54.2 per cent, against 52.8 per cent in June, a bigger
increase than generally expected in financial markets.
However, the index remained below its recent high of 56.3 per cent in May
and far below the levels expected in a normal economic recovery.
The report provides no comfort for the Bush administration, which was hoping
for a significant acceleration of growth in the second half. Also, the
index's resilience argues against a triple-dip recession involving a fresh
decline in output.
Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Management, said
the figures pointed to continuing economic growth at the sluggish pace
registered in the second quarter. Gross domestic product grew at an annual
rate of 1.4 per cent in April-June, according to a preliminary Commerce
Department estimate published last week.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has won 55 per cent of the votes in the
country's first presidential election since gaining independence from
Yugoslavia.
In the concurrent parliamentary poll on Sunday, his ruling Croatian
Democratic Union party (HDZ) looked set to gain a majority in the 124-seat
parliament after winning 41 per cent of the votes.
Mr Tudjman's critics said the result cast a shadow over the development of
democracy in Croatia. Mr Zarko Puhovski, a professor of political philosophy
at Zagreb University, said he was concerned the vote would be seen as a
mandate for Mr Tudjman and HDZ to rule single-handedly.
'If they have been elected in both presidential and parliamentary elections,
then they will understand the results as the legitimisation of their
authoritarian rule,' said Mr Puhovski. 'This is the worst possible outcome
in terms of democracy. Tudjman has ruled from some kind of court for years.'
The vote for Mr Tudjman and the HDZ also appears unlikely to bring Croatia
closer to a resolution of the Serbian question. Ethnic Serbs, who make up 12
per cent of the 4.5m population, generally abstained from voting - with the
exception of urban Serbs. The 200,000 Serbs living in the UN-patrolled zones
and 200,000 Serbs who fled the war to Serbia did not vote.
Mr Tudjman's victory is likely to radicalise Croatia's rural Serbs, who
waged a nationalist war against independence after the HDZ came to power in
1990. About 10,000 people were killed and towns destroyed in the war. David
Owen reports from London: Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, ruled out
any immediate prospect of a militarily imposed solution in the former
Yugoslavia, saying the international community could not be united behind
such a policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S financial markets rebounded strongly yesterday in response to
abolition of the scala mobile wage indexation system and signs that Prime
Minister Giuliano Amato's new government is having some success in
countering the country's economic ills.
Shares at the Milan stock exchange had one of their best days in months; the
Comit equity index closed at 416.64, up almost 15 points from Friday's close
of 401.72.
The lira recovered strongly in the foreign exchange markets, breaking
through the psychologically important barrier of L755 against the D-Mark, to
be fixed at L754.95, its highest level against the D-Mark for weeks.
Equity dealers described the deal to end the scala mobile, agreed on Friday
night, as historic, even if many details of future wage bargaining
arrangements have still to be fleshed out. Mr Nino Cristofori, the labour
minister, said yesterday that negotiations between the government, employers
and unions would restart in early September at the latest, with a view to
concluding talks by the middle of the month.
However, some brokers cautioned that yesterday's surge in prices came
against a thin market, which had also been affected by a breakdown of the
screen-based dealing system and signs of selling by some foreign investors.
Mr Leonida Guadenza, a leading Milan broker, warned against over-enthusiasm.
Some bankers felt that the country's new mood of industrial harmony could be
shattered by the consequences of Saturday's resignation by Mr Bruno Trentin
as secretary-general of the CGIL union federation.
Mr Trentin's decision could prompt uncertainty and division within Italy's
biggest trade union group, whose executive is split between a majority
sympathetic to the Democratic Party of the Left - which groups most of the
former members of Italy's communist party - and the Socialists, and a
faction aligned with the Reconstructed Communism party, which includes many
of the hard-left members of the former communist party.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Sejm strengthens Polish PM's hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish parliament (Sejm) has voted to strengthen the hand of government
and tackle the long-standing conflict with President Lech Walesa which led
to political instability and delayed economic reforms and foreign
investment.
Under constitutional amendments which received the required two-thirds
parliamentary majority at the weekend, Ms Hanna Suchocka's government will
be able to bypass lengthy parliamentary procedures and make economic policy
decisions by decree.
President Lech Walesa is expected to approve this shortly although he is not
entirely happy with changes which could improve government efficiency but
diminish his own freedom of manoeuvre.
The latest amendments give Mr Walesa greater say in forming new governments
but make it much harder to dismiss them. The president is recognised as the
highest representative of the state in both internal and external relations,
but the amendments included in the so-called 'small constitution' make it
possible for the government to rule by decree.
Parliament's willingness to give greater powers to the government reflects
awareness of public disapproval of the government's inability to react
quickly to economic problems and frequent government crises. The latter have
been exacerbated by the ill-defined division of powers between the president
and governments proposed by him.
The strictly constitutional aspects are only part of a wide-ranging effort
to improve the efficiency of government and reform the military and security
structures inherited from the communist era.
At a meeting with provincial governors at the weekend Mrs Suchocka said she
wanted to set up a professional, apolitical civil service and improve the
management of the many enterprises still in state hands. The government was
also looking at ways of increasing workers' share of enterprise ownership
but had decided against any automatic debt relief for beleaguered state
enterprises.
Meanwhile the National Defence Committee, the top level defence planning
body chaired by Mr Walesa but including the prime minister and the ministers
of foreign affairs, internal affairs and finance, has worked out a new draft
defence doctrine.
This has at its heart an apolitical, smaller army of 250,000 distributed
around the country. It will have far fewer generals, 150 instead of 450, and
professional staff officers. Poland will also create a rapid deployment
force from which Polish contingents to future international peace keeping
operations will be drawn. Mr Walesa stressed that Poland's long term aim is
'full integration with the North Atlantic Alliance and the European Union'.
Apart from its defence functions, the armed forces must also be able to cope
with internal threats which may emerge during the transition to a market
economy, Mr Walesa said.
There are strikes over pay in the Polish copper industry and at the
small-car plant recently bought by Fiat. Overall however the Polish economy
appears to be recovering after three years of steep recession in the public
sector, accompanied by rapid small scale privatisation, with rising exports
helping to create a nearly Dollars 1bn current account surplus over the
first half of the year.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Europe's spending on advertising falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN advertising expenditure declined sharply in 1991 according to
figures published yesterday by Zenith Media, the media buying and planning
wing of the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising group.
Advertising revenue in Spain collapsed last year, following six years of
real growth in excess of 11 per cent annually. Zenith expects the decline to
continue this year, despite the impact of the Barcelona Olympics and
Seville's Expo '92. The recent proliferation of television channels in the
country has led to heavy discounting of advertising space.
In France, the world's fifth largest advertising market by expenditure, a
return to real growth is not expected before 1994.
The French industry is forecast to grow in nominal terms by 2.4 per cent
this year, representing negative real growth of 0.6 per cent.
Negative real growth is also expected in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland.
Zenith suggests there is ground for optimism in the UK, with television
advertising expenditure up by 2.1 per cent in real terms in the first half
of 1992. However, the figure must be set against a real decline of 4.1 per
cent in UK tele-vision advertising revenue last year.
The US advertising industry also saw slight improvement in the first half of
this year. According to the study, US advertising - which accounts for about
39 per cent of world major media expenditure - should move from decline into
real growth in 1994.
But Zenith has revised downwards its forecasts made last December for global
advertising spending in 1992; moving from 5.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent
nominal growth, or 0.6 per cent in real terms.
Advertising Expenditure Forecasts, available from Zenith Media Worldwide,
Bridge House, 63-65 North Wharf Road, London W2 1LA. Pounds 175.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Britain seeks to defuse border control dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is examining how further to lighten the
burden on European Community citizens posed by British immigration and
passport controls, in an attempt to defuse the long-running dispute over
Britain's intention to retain border checks beyond the end of this year.
But the European Commission is maintaining that all border controls must be
lifted from January 1, 1993.
According to the Home Office, Mr Clarke has given an undertaking to Mr
Martin Bangemann, European internal market commissioner, that he will
'reflect on what more could be done to lighten the touch on EC nationals'.
Mr Bangemann yesterday denied reports that the Commission had already agreed
to allow the UK to keep border controls on people. He said Brussels stuck to
its interpretation of the Single European Act, which aims to establish a
barrier-free internal market.
He and Mr Clarke will meet again on September 1 to discuss the issue.
In theory the Commission could take any member state which retains border
controls to the European Court of Justice. It is more likely that the
January 1 deadline will be postponed, as other EC members are worried that
external borders will not be strong enough to allow all controls to be
lifted.
The Home Office said that Britain's determination to retain immigration
controls on third-country nationals travelling from EC countries would
require a 'light' passport check on EC nationals 'simply to establish their
nation-ality'.
Mr Clarke told EC immigration ministers in June that it would not be in
anyone's interest to have 'a major row' on the issue, 'especially given the
difficulties surrounding ratification of the Maastricht treaty'.

Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai industrial empire and a candidate in
this year's South Korean presidential election, does not want foreigners to
think he is mooning around. So he has changed the English name of his
political party from the Unification National Party (a faithful translation
from the Korean) after advisers suggested that foreigners might confuse it
with the controversial Unification Church, alias the Moonies.
The new name is not without problems, however. The United People's Party
sounds as if it belongs in Stalinist North Korea and seems inappropriate for
an organisation led by a businessman with a personal fortune estimated at
Dollars 3bn.
But perhaps it is not so wide of the mark. After all, it was Chung who
pioneered trade ties with Pyongyang and recently broke a political taboo by
suggesting that South Korea's underground Communist party should be
legalised.

What price Companies House? Now that the annual report of the government's
central corporate information service is in the public domain it is worth
doing a few sums to see what Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine
might get if he decides to privatise the 1,150-strong executive agency.
Valuing it at 15 times the operating surplus, for example, would make it
worth Pounds 23.5m, which is virtually identical to the value of the fixed
assets. However, no attempt has been made to value its huge historical
database on all public and private companies. This is what makes Companies
House such a plum asset for the right sort of buyer.
However, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, one of the obvious contenders, says,
appropriately enough, that it needs more information before expressing an
opinion.
If it wastes too much time searching for information it might miss its
prize.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Observer: Female takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's banks are famous for many things, but sex changes are not one of
them. Not, at least, until the beginning of this month, when the three-way
merger of Rome's big banks created Banca di Roma - the country's largest
financial institution.
The new group is a mixed bag of male and female institutions. Banco di Santo
Spirito is a venerable gentleman of Italian finance. The Cassa di Risparmio
di Roma, the city's savings bank, whose managing director Cesare Geronzi is
very much in the driving seat, is a big earner, but virtually unknown.
Meanwhile, Banco di Roma is one of Italy's most international, if least
profitable, banks.
Adopting the latter's name allowed for instant recognition in Italy and
abroad, says Geronzi, a former Bank of Italy whizz. But the change of sex
from the Banco to Banca (the normal gender for banks) will give the new
company a more contemporary image, he claims.
Whatever the gender, Geronzi, who is chief executive of the new bank,
crowned its first day with a prize catch; Guido Carli, Italy's former
treasury minister and Geronzi's one-time boss as governor of the Bank of
Italy, is to be its special consultant for international finance and foreign
affairs.
Good to know that 78-year-old Carli's failure to win a Senate seat at
April's general elections has not dented the enthusiasm for public service
of one of Europe's best-known financial statesmen.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Observer: A labour safe seat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The speculation about the future of Norman Willis, the 59-year-old general
secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is bound to raise a few wry smiles.
While the current recession has seen a record number of trade unionists
losing their jobs, and quite a few company chairmen who failed to perform
have been forced to walk the plank, the job of running the TUC seems to have
been one of the safer occupations around.
Certainly, the TUC is conscious that it needs to improve its image as a
national institution. The Conservative and Labour parties and the CBI have
all changed their leaders recently and are hoping that some fresh young
faces will improve their public image. So why not the TUC?
Norman Willis has been doing his job since 1984 - longer than most company
chairmen. If he stays until retirement, he has another six years to go, and
will have done the job longer than any of his predecessors, save Walter
Citrine. However, even if Willis were to step down early, it is highly
unlikely that he would be replaced by anyone more exciting than another TUC
official, and on present form 45-year-old John Monks, the deputy general
secretary, is the favourite.
The idea that a woman might get the job - ex-print union boss Brenda Dean's
name has been mentioned - is rather exciting, but that is equally unlikely.
Ever since Citrine took the job in 1925, the general secretary has been
recruited from within the TUC.
Norman Willis himself was a relative newcomer. He spent his first 25 years
with the TGWU, the transport workers' union. However, he worked at the TUC
for a decade before getting the top job. Despite its well publicised
problems, it would be surprising if the TUC broke with tradition now.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Break-up of Black Sea fleet delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YALTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE and Russia yesterday decided to postpone a carve-up of the Black Sea
fleet until 1995, ending at least temporarily a dispute which had threatened
the peace between the republics.
The decision by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President Leonid
Kravchuk to share the fleet and its land facilities under a united command
answerable to both leaders follows negotiators' failure to make headway
implementing a two-month-old presidential agreement to divide it up.
The move may be interpreted as a climbdown by Ukraine, which has been keen
to create its own navy as fast as possible. But the decision provides a
breathing space for both men whose people, already worn down by economic
hardship, are tired of bickering between the republics.
The irony is that the fleet itself, although the size of the British navy,
has no real strategic significance and costs more money to maintain than
either Russia or Ukraine can afford.
The two leaders, who said they had set up a telephone hotline to deal with
future flashpoints, also agreed to allow visa-free travel between their
republics and to share out former Soviet embassies and other property
abroad.
They plan soon to sign a friendship treaty which will be accompanied by
agreements on oil, sugar and grain.
The deal was struck at an exclusive dacha half way between Yalta, where the
fate of post-war Europe was decided, and Sebastopol, home to the disputed
fleet. It was also near the house where former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev was holed up during an abortive coup last year.
A row has broken out inside the Russian government, and between the
administration and central bank, over the issuing of a further Rbs1,000bn of
credit by the central bank to prop up large state companies struggling under
vast loads of debt, John LLoyd adds from Moscow.
Mr Pyotr Fillipov, chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee for
privatisation, said the move would 'push the country to the edge of an
horrendous economic crisis' and raise inflation to between 70-80 per cent a
month from the present 15 per cent.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the new acting chairman of the central bank,
promised to issue the credit at the end of last week - although the majority
of government ministers appear to be strongly opposed. However at least two
 -Mr Georgy Khizha, deputy prime minister, and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
minister for fuel and energy - were reported yesterday to support the move.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Image belies reality in violent capital: Thousands have died
but yesterday Pietermaritzburg was quiet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGE belied reality on a balmy day in Pietermaritzburg yesterday.
More than 3,200 people have died in the Midlands region surrounding the
Natal capital since January 1987, victims of the bitter rivalry between the
African National Congress and Inkatha. So far, however, the tensions of the
two-day ANC strike have not turned into widespread violence.
The townships outside Pie termaritzburg have for long been part of the front
line in one of the most strife torn regions of South Africa, and tensions
built up considerably in the last few weeks as the strike grew closer. Both
the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the two main war ring political
groupings suffered attacks over the weekend.
But yesterday it was mostly quiet. This was borne out by a three hour trip
through the main IFP and ANC support regions.
Mr Radley Keys, an unrest monitor for the Democratic Party, did say, he had
received a number of reports of people being 'intimidated' to stay away from
work.
Not all parts of Natal were as fortunate as Pietermaritzburg. Twenty one
deaths were reported in the province on Sunday and Monday. Eleven of the
victims were shot on Sun day night in four separate, but related incidents
in the Esikhawini township near Empangeni, north of Dur ban.
Police said they had no knowledge of who was responsible for the attacks or
whether they were related to the strike.
Mr MG Ramcharan of Guy ana, one of the ten UN officials in the country to
monitor the violence, flew to the scene to investigate. His American col
league, Mr John Renninger, monitored the Midlands region - both in
helicopters.
In the Northern, poorer end of Pietermaritzburg, taxi ranks servicing the
main black areas like Imbali, Edendale, Swee twaters and Vulindlela were
deserted. Mr Keys said: 'This gives one an idea of the stranglehold on
transport that is being exercised.'
From Pietermaritzburg we drove to Mpophomeni, the small ANC stronghold near
Howick which has been a scene of bitter conflict in the past. Yesterday
there was a relaxed atmosphere.
Schools were closed and pupils at home, but there was no marching in the
streets. The same pattern was found in Edendale and Imbali, where Mr Alphas
Sibiya, a member of the local civic described the staya way as 'very quiet,
but very supportive."
In Durban roads leading to Kwamashu, Umlazi and other large townships were
barri caded to prevent people getting to work.
According to the South African rail commuter corporation, trains which
normally carry about 50,000 people every morning were running at 2 per cent
capacity.
Preliminary figures from the South African labour bulletin estimated a 75
per cent staya way in Durban.
Two journalists were shot and wounded in a South African township yesterday
while cov ering a general strike called by the African National Con gress
(ANC), Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Mr Paul Taylor of the Wash ington
Post was shot in the left shoulder and Mr Phillip van Niekerk of South
Africa's Weekly Mail and the London Guardian was shot in the mouth by gunmen
who stole their car in Sebokeng south of Johannesburg, police said. Both men
were flown to clin ics in Johannesburg. A clinic official declined to
comment on Mr van Niekerk's condition but a Weekly Mail reporter said it was
believed to be stable. An official at the clinic treating Mr Taylor said he
was stable and was to undergo sur gery last night to have a bullet removed.
Police last month advised non-residents not to enter Sebokeng, one of the
most vio lent black townships. Police regularly come under auto matic fire
from residents in some sections of the impover ished settlement outside Ver
eeniging. Mr van Niekerk, the Mail's political editor, also writes for Dutch
newspaper Volkskrant and the Toronto Globe and Mail of Canada.

FT  04 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling helps uncertain equity
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN IN the London stock market over sterling was eased yesterday by
commitment to a strong pound from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and
by news of a pro-Maastricht opinion poll in France. An improvement in the
sterling rate against the D-Mark in late dealings found a ready response
from UK share prices, although trading volume remained relatively light.
The London stock market jousted with the FT-SE Index around the 2,400 mark
in early dealings and it was a lead from the stock index futures sector
which first took the Footsie firmly above this benchmark level. But the
overall mood of the market remained cautious as economic commentators
continued to call for government action to promote recovery from the
economic setback. The market was only about 10 Footsie points ahead until
the late upswing in sterling doubled the earlier gain.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,420.2, a gain on the day of
20.6 points. But initial trading, when neither the Nikkei Average, Friday's
Dow reading, nor the London futures market gave much encouragement, saw the
Footsie down by more than 10 points at 2,389.
The seemingly unending flow of woe in the City continued yesterday when
Oxford Economic Forecasting, the Confederation of British Industry and
National Westminster Bank all bore witness to the depth of the recession and
in some cases urged changes in official policy.
Nor was the mood lightened when Abbey National, one of Britain's largest
mortgage lenders, called for tax help for prospective house sellers after
disclosing a 12 per cent drop in its half-time profits.
The late improvement in sterling helped to calm fears in the market over the
near-term outlook for domestic interest rates. While hopes of further cuts
in UK base rates have receded significantly since the rise in money rates in
Germany, London remains fearful that a full-flown sterling crisis could
force UK rates higher.
Traders were wary of putting too much faith in yesterday's firmness in the
London stock market. Turnover remained unexciting, with Seaq volume at only
329.6m shares; Friday's 378.1m shares reflected only Pounds 812.6m in terms
of customer, or retail, business, no great figure by standards of market
profitability.
Among interest rate-related stocks to benefit directly from the pound's
firmer tone, the high street retailers stood out well. But construction
issues continued to suffer from doubts over the continued profitability of
the industry.
Equity strategists agreed that the market outlook for this week will be
dominated by prospects for the interim trading report from British Petroleum
on Thursday and, in particular, by the decision taken on the dividend
payment by the board of the blue chip oil company.
BP opened sharply lower yesterday after the UK press had commented bearishly
on the outlook, suggesting that the impending trading statement might be
taken by the board as an opportunity to write off costs in less profitable
areas.

FT  04 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious comments hit BOC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL gases group BOC fell sharply in early trading as analysts made
cautious comments ahead of the nine-months' results, due on Thursday. The
shares were down 14 at one stage before rallying with the market to close 4
off at 593p.
Some of the weakness was prompted by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which recently cut
its full-year forecast to Pounds 345m, believed to be at the bottom of the
analysts' range.
Mr Alasdair Nisbet of UBS said he was predicting Pounds 85m for the quarter
and Pounds 248m for the nine months. The figures are below the market
consensus and Mr Nisbet has based his caution on recent figures from BOC
competitor Air Products, problems in BOC's vacuum business and the adverse
effect of a weaker dollar.
Also, BZW reduced its 1993 prediction by Pounds 15m to Pounds 390m and
turned seller, arguing that BOC's anaesthetic gases arm will be hit when its
key product comes off patent early next year.
Vodafone firmer
Telecoms group Vodafone gained 5 to 316p in response to positive
recommendations from several brokers. Most focused on the fact that the
shares have been under pressure for the past two months, with the threat of
increased price competition from rival Cellnet, and now look good value.
Analysts also expect good trading news from this Friday's agm.
Mr Martin Mabbutt at Nomura, moving from a hold to a buy, said: 'While
Vodafone may suffer some loss of revenue from Cellnet's price plan, it is
operating in a long-term growth market and the shares look attractive. We
believe they have a 15 per cent relative upside over the next 12 months.'
Hoare Govett also likes Vodafone, but only on a short-term view, believing
that the threat from Cellnet and the new Personal Communications Network
will adversely affect revenues.
GEC report
The weekend publication of defence group GEC's annual report provided the
spur for the day's trading in the stock. Analysts were particularly cheered
by the increase in the pension surplus revealed in the report, and by
accountancy practices at the company.
Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett, who remains positive on the stock, said: 'The
conservative nature of the accountancy report reinforces the group's
defensive attractions.' The shares responded by firming 4 to 225p in brisk
trade of 7.3m shares.
British Gas continued Friday's slide, ending 4 lower at 236p, following the
referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of access to the gas
transportation and storage system operated by the group.
However, Mr Fergus Macleod of County NatWest said he expected the 8 per cent
yield on the shares 'to provide the backstop fairly soon', and Mr Keith
Morris of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said he was a 'gentle buyer' at these levels.
Weekend press reports that BP might announce restructuring charges of up to
Pounds 1bn when it announces second quarter results on Thursday sent the
stock into an early spin. However, the shares were given a lift from the US
as dealers reported Prudential America as advising clients to switch out of
Mobil and into BP.
The positive US comment helped the stock to rally comfortably to close
unchanged on the day at 212 1/2 p.
Insurers bounced in a thin market, recovering from recent underperformance.
General Accident was the biggest gainer, climbing 19 to 390p.
Insurance analysts said some investors were buying on a view that the group
would hold its dividend when it announces interim results next Tuesday.
Fears about a dividend cut have dogged the shares in recent weeks.
Commercial Union appreciated 13 to 442p and Legal &amp; General 2 to 340p. The
rises were helped by buying to cover short positions.
Tired old suggestions, repeated in the weekend press, that MEPC had been
talking to Hong Kong Land added spice to an otherwise dull properties
sector. The shares advanced 10 to 246p.
Interim results below the range of analysts' forecasts sent Abbey National
down 3 1/2 to 255p.
Stock overhanging the market was said to have held back Laporte. The
specialty chemicals group fell 7 to 514p.
Weekend press comment following last week's reorganisation announcement
helped ICI move forward 9 to 1172p.
Following worries last week over quality and metering, water shares bounced
back. Among the main movers yesterday, North West and Thames both jumped 12
to 414p, Yorkshire 16 to 434p and Anglian 9 to 392p.
More big volume in Grand Metropolitan saw the shares advance 12 to 422p with
6.2m traded as its recent poor run was considered overdone. US investors
were reported to be prominent among the buyers. The shares were also helped
by a push from securities house Smith New Court, which also recommended
Guinness, 9 higher at 544p.
Technical positions helped selected food manufacturers. Short positions in
Cadbury-Schweppes, up 6 at 481p, and Unilever, ahead 14 at 956p, assisted
the shares as marketmakers chased stock. The latter was also helped by
anticipation that good second quarter figures will be reported this Friday.
Reports that a building company belonging to a director of hotel group Savoy
had gone into receivership had a predictable effect on the share price.
Savoy dropped 30 to 500p as market worries over the group's exposure, later
proved unfounded, to the failed builder depressed the stock.
Marketing services group WPP improved 7 to 47p after major shareholder
Fidelity Investments said it would support the advertising group's
restructuring.
Takeover hopes lifted Mirror Group Newspapers a further 5 to 76p. The hopes
were buoyed by Friday's news that Dublin-based Independent Newspapers
Holdings had acquired a 1.3 per cent equity stake.
Hopes of a tank order at Vickers helped the shares firm 4 to 125p. TI Group
shares were wanted ahead of today's interim statement, gaining 5 to 314p.
Turnover in business services group BET rose to 14m shares after two large
trades went through the market. The stock finished a halfpenny firmer at 110
1/2 p.

THE FIRMER performance by sterling, which followed news of an opinion poll
showing a majority of the French public in favour of the Maastricht treaty,
helped to boost stock index futures already strengthened by an early
squeeze, writes Joel Kibazo.
The FT-SE futures contract for September delivery opened at 2,402 and was
soon in demand as independent traders moved to cover short positions. This
early strength helped to lift the underlying cash market from weakness seen
at its opening.
The squeeze in the contract continued and by mid-morning it was trading at
2,425. News of the opinion poll only served to add to the upward momentum,
as did strength in gilts. The firm opening on Wall Street also provided
further help and the session's high of 2,449 was reached just before the
official market close of 2,445. This was 31 up from the previous close and
around 18 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover at 6,184 lots was poor.
The volume in traded options reached 26,312 contracts in a session said to
have lacked strong features. The FT-SE 100 option recorded 10,051 lots, with
the Euro FTSE option trading 4,624.

thin trading

Wall Street
US STOCK markets traded in a narrow range yesterday after last week's heady
gains, as investors showed little reaction to the latest report from the
country's purchasing managers, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.62 up at 3,395.40, having rarely
strayed far from opening values all day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed
0.88 to 425.09, while the American SE composite gained 2.02 at 390.87 and
the Nasdaq composite was ahead 1.53 at 582.36. New York SE turnover was
light at 164m shares, and rises led declines by 966 to 774.
Last week satisfied a lot of pent-up demand in the market, the Dow having
jumped more than 100 points in the wake of a sharp fall in long-term
interest rates. Analysts had expected the market to open easier as investors
consolidated their recently won gains.
The day's most important economic news was from the National Association of
Purchasing Management, which reported that its index of manufacturing
conditions rose modestly in July to 54.2, from June's 52.8. The figures
confirmed that the economy is still expanding, but at a painfully slow rate.
The most intriguing part of the report was the decline in the employment
component of the index, which suggested that July's key employment report,
due out on Friday, might display continued weakness in the labour market.
The Commerce Department yesterday reported a 1.5 per cent fall in June
construction spending, a worse figure than expected but one which had little
effect on the market.
Monsanto fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 in active trading after
broking house PaineWebber lowered its rating on the stock to 'sell' in the
wake of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to approve a
generic version manufactured by rival group Ivax of a Monsanto drug for the
treatment of hypertension. PaineWebber also upgraded Ivax following the FDA
decision, helping the stock climb Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 29 on the
American Stock Exchange.
McDonald's also suffered from a broker's downgrade, the fast-food chain
slipping Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 3/4 after Merrill Lynch reduced its
intermediate-term rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'above-average', citing
the discontinuation this weekend of the market testing of new dinner menu
products.
Lincoln National rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 after the insurance
holding company reported second quarter net income of Dollars 1.50 a share,
down from the Dollars 1.75 of a year ago but above the mean of most
analysts' estimates.
Plains Resources, in which trading was halted on Friday because of concern
about the state of its Miami Fee oil wells, dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars
15 on the Amex after saying that its Miami Fee Number 3 well had been
unsuccessful so far.
On the Nasdaq market, Borland International lost Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46
on news that the company will have to pull some disputed features from a
spreadsheet program after a court ruled late on Friday that Borland had
illegally copied part of a Lotus program. Mr Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs
cut his earnings estimate for Borland to reflect the ruling's impact on the
company's bottom line.
Toronto was closed for a public holiday yesterday.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Very bearish mood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS IN the sterling money market were unwaveringly bearish yesterday, as
cash rates reached their most expensive levels since base rates were cut to
10 per cent.
There were no significant indicators affecting the sterling market
yesterday, but the speculation about a currency devaluation continues to
haunt dealers. Over the weekend, British business leaders continued to press
for the UK government to change its view on sterling's place in the European
Monetary System. The meeting of the Bundesbank council on Thursday is also
anxiously awaited, even though few analysts expect a Lombard rate rise this
time round.
Under these pressures, period rates firmed to new highs. Three-month money
was offered at 10 7/16 per cent, compared to 10 3/8 per cent on Friday
night, while the one-year rate was up to 10 1/2 per cent from 10 7/16 per
cent. Both figures discount a half-point increase in base rates this year.
Trading in sterling futures was similarly bearish. The September short
sterling contract dipped 5 basis points yesterday morning to a low of 89.58,
but recovered to close at 89.66. The September contract has dipped to the
mid-50s since base rates were at 10 per cent, and one commercial bank trader
expected it to be back down there soon.
'The market is unlikely to be in a better mood before the French referendum
on Maastricht in mid-September,' he said, 'and we will easily see those
levels again.'
The Bank of England's operations in the cash market were much easier, now
that the end-of-month difficulties are over. The Bank operated at the
established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent
for the repurchase agreement (repo) repayable on August 24.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 112m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds
30m of Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 670m in the repo. Later the Bank bought
Pounds 211m in Band 1. In the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 100m in Band 1.
Late assistance was provided of Pounds 70m.
In Germany, call money rates held firm, with traders reporting scattered
demand in morning trade. They quoted rates of 9.65-9.75 per cent for
overnight money, broadly unchanged from Friday.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls back on indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was boosted against the D-Mark by a new threat of central bank
intervention yesterday, but later lost ground on a lacklustre set of US
economic indicators writes James Blitz.
An unnamed official at the Bank of Italy said the central banks were
prepared to intervene in the market again to keep the dollar off its lows,
and this boosted the currency by  1/2 pfennig up to DM1.4765 in the European
morning.
The currency slipped later as a mixed bag of indicators showed no clear sign
of an economic upturn in the US. Construction spending in the US fell by 1.5
per cent in June, while the National Association of Purchasing Managers
Index for July rose to 54.2 per cent from 52.8 per cent, with supplier
deliveries the slowest since March 1989.
The dollar finished a net  1/2 pfennig down at DM1.4760. In New York it gave
further ground to close at DM1.4733.
There is uncertainty in the markets as to whether the central banks have a
firm policy to keep the dollar above its all-time low.
According to analysts at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London: 'The threat of
another bout of central bank intervention will continue to deter the
establishment of aggressive short dollar positions.' But other traders feel
that the authorities in the US may be willing to see the dollar drop below
the historic low of DM1.4470 after all.
One London-based analyst wondered why there was no official intervention
last week when the dollar fell below levels at which the central banks had
intervened on July 20. 'If the central banks do not show their hand shortly
between DM1.4600 and DM1.4470, they will risk losing credibility in the eyes
of the market,' he said.
The D-Mark lost some ground to the dollar and European currencies after an
opinion poll conducted by French newspaper La Liberation showed that 57 per
cent of those polled would vote in favour of European political and monetary
union in next month's French referendum. Signs that the Maastricht treaty
will be ratified weakened the D-Mark because the treaty commits European
Community member countries to stringent convergence criteria.
However, this was not enough to offset the D-Mark's increasing
attractiveness. Sterling ended the day lower at DM2.8400 from a previous
close of DM2.8430, while the German unit edged up to FFr3.3790 after a
previous FFr3.3780.
The Italian lira was firm against the D-Mark yesterday following the Italian
government's decision to abolish the scala mobile, which has set
inflation-linked wage rises for most of Italy's workers since 1945. The lira
closed at L755.3 to the D-Mark, compared to L755.9 previously.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: British growers reap crop of
frustration - The cereal harvest is early but there is disappointment over
yields, quality and prices / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK cereal harvest is three weeks early this year. Normally our combine
harvester rolls into barley, sown the previous autumn on our Norfolk farm,
during the last week of July.
Spring planted barley is usually ready in the first half of August and
autumn-sown wheat can be relied upon to be fit for harvesting between August
18 and 23. This year we began the barley before mid-July. We could have
started sooner if the weather had not been wet. But it was mainly dry once
we got going and that allowed us to complete all of our autumn and
spring-sown barley without starting the grain drier and indeed, to deliver
it to a merchant for onward sale to the brewers.
Moreover, on July 30 when we finished combining the barley we moved into the
earliest ripening wheat. It too was ready and dry enough to store without
expensive artificial drying and so we worked through last weekend to take
fullest possible advantage of the favourable weather. It was the first time
in more than 30 years of farming that I had harvested wheat in July. By last
evening we had completed more than one-third of our total harvest and within
that more than 20 per cent of our wheat had been gathered in excellent
conditions.
Farmers up and down the country have had similar experiences. As a rule of
thumb those in the balmier south are even further forward than we are in
Norfolk. Those in the chillier north, as always, are a few days behind.
So that's the good news. Now for the bad. First there was the disappointment
at the price we got for the barley. For years we have tried to grow best
quality, for which the brewers would pay a generous premium because it was
ideal for best beer. The chief characteristic of such barley, apart from
being able to germinate, is that each ear of grain should contain the
minimum of nitrogen.
This has been more difficult for us to achieve than for some other farmers
because our land is relatively fertile and has regular applications of
farmyard manure from our sheep and pigs. This manure contains nitrogen,
which is transmitted through the soil and the root system of the barley to
the grain.
But this year, for some unaccountable reason, our barleys contained much
lower percentages of nitrogen than usual. At last, it seemed, we were going
to make some real money.
Imagine my frustration when I was told by the merchant that not only had
most other barley farmers grown similar low nitrogen crops but that the
market did not want much of it anyway. The story is, apparently, that the
low nitrogen crops were needed in the past for making pale ales. Nowadays
most beer drinkers choose lager and that requires rather higher levels of
nitrogen than we had grown.
I am assured that there is more than an element of truth in the story. But I
could not help thinking that it might also be a convenient ploy to talk down
the price. In any event the premium over animal feed barley price that we
were offered was rather more modest than I would have preferred.
At least the yield of the barley, particularly that which was autumn sown,
was up to expectations. But the weight of the wheat we have been combining
since appears to about 20 per cent per acre down on last year and this seems
to be general across the country.
Paradoxically wheat crops looked better this year than last through most of
the summer in spite of the spring drought. Indeed, when the rains began in
June and some of the moisture deficit began to be made up, many farmers,
myself included, privately began to think we would harvest big crops this
year. That only goes to show how little we know about the components of high
yield.
It is clear now that we had too much June and July rain for wheat. Some fell
in heavy storms and knocked whole fields virtually flat - in the trade we
say those crops have 'lodged' - and although modern harvesters will do a
remarkable job of picking them up, when they go down as early as June we
know they will not ripen evenly and that the quality of the grain will
suffer.
But the rain brought other problems too. It produced the kind of moist
micro-climate in the developing ears of the wheat that was ideal for the
spread for fungal diseases, particularly one called fusarium. Crops all over
the country have been affected this year and in spite of attempts to control
the disease by spraying with a fungicide it has still reduced yields
significantly.
Instead of the bold, bright and well-rounded wheat grains we have been
fortunate enough to harvest over the last few years, most farmers are
finding that a worrying proportion of their crops are producing shrivelled,
dirty-looking samples. This is the result of the ear disease and the main
reason for lower yields.
It is also likely to detract from the value of the grain. For the fact is
that the UK has, in recent years, grown an exportable surplus of some 5m to
6m tonnes a year. If my experience of reduced yields is repeated across the
country this year that tonnage will also be lower. Nevertheless UK farms
will still produce significantly more than is needed for domestic
consumption.
Following the excellent quality of UK grain gathered from the last few
harvests merchants, supported by the export agency British Cereals Exports,
have been able to open up new overseas markets and have been remarkably
successful at selling virtually all that was not needed at home.
However, this year's lower quality must raise questions as to whether that
success can be repeated. Much will depend of course on what other supplies
are available on the market. Reports from several other European countries
suggest that they too have had problems and so the situation may not be as
bad as it appears.
Meanwhile, to add insult to injury it has just been announced that the
European Community's farm policy reform package, agreed last May, will, with
the tacit acceptance of British Ministry of Agriculture officials, remove
all price support from feed wheat. Only common, or bread wheat, will be
eligible to be accepted into intervention stores.
As has happened - so often and so illogically with other EC farm commodities
in the past - this will mean that the best quality is locked away from the
market. Even more serious for British wheat growers, it will mean that 70
per cent of the varieties that grow best in this country and for which there
is a market both domestic and for export, have had their price safety net
withdrawn. It also means that French farmers, whose climate allows them to
grow the necessary quality far more easily than we can and who overproduce
by double the percentage that we do, compared with domestic consumption,
have once again won the political battle to get the best deal.
British officials, it is reported, sat on their hands in Brussels and
abstained from voting on the matter, allowing the member state that produces
the vast majority of the EC's cereal surpluses to get away with it again.
Are they determined to destroy British agriculture.? If they are, they are
going the right way about it.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought adds to eastern
European farm problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN European farmers, already struggling to cope with life in the
private sector and disappearing subsidies, are also contending with one of
the region's worst droughts in years, reports Reuter from Vienna.
The result is that the huge grain surpluses built up last year will
disappear, and many of the countries will have to import grain to feed their
people or rebuild reserve stocks.
The farmers have been caught in the pincers of falling demand for their
produce and higher prices for the inputs they need to produce it.
Proper agricultural markets have not yet developed and the scope for
distorted prices or outright speculation is great.
Crucial to the formation of a healthy farm sector is the development of
related industries, such as those producing fertilisers or farm machinery,
the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies said in a recent
report. But the necessary privatisation of these operations depends on
foreign investment and capital, which has so far been slow in coming, it
said.
On a national scale the market reforms have also sown confusion.
In Czechoslovakia co-operative and state farms transformed into private
agri-businesses or genuine co-operatives are operating in an environment of
legal uncertainty. At the same time the country's restitution laws, which
allow the original owners or their heirs to reclaim property confiscated by
the communists, have seen much land taken up by people who do not want to
farm it but just lease it out.
Czechoslovakian radio said in a recent commentary that the situation is a
vicious circle of supporting overproduction followed by state-funded export
subsidies.
An ambitious privatisation of farmland in Romania has left the authorities
in the dark about what is going on.
'It is very difficult to make a forecast of crops, as Romania switched from
100 per cent state ownership in agriculture in 1989, to 82 per cent private
land ownership at present,' said Mr Radu Mateescu, agriculture ministry
spokesman. And Romania's agriculture lacks infrastructure for modern
data-gathering and forecasts.
Romania has some of Europe's most fertile land, but is importing 1m tonnes
of wheat this year. The government will set up a wheat monopoly to fend off
speculators.
Since 1989 Romania has faced a steady drop in farm output, mainly because of
chaos on the land as it switches to a market economy and private enterprise
after 40 years of communism.
But the authorities see farming as one of the country's potential strengths,
and grain acreages are to be increased.
Hungarian farmers have sown wheat on 25 per cent less land than usual, the
daily Nepszabadsag said. Mr Ferenc Nyujto, an agriculture ministry official,
said the grain harvest this year would be average.
But he conceded that because of drought the yields on the lower acreages
would be 10 to 20 per cent down on last year's.
The result, according to London traders, is that Hungary, the region's most
successful agricultural producer, will cut its wheat exports to 450,000
tonnes in 1992-93 (July-June), compared with 1.5m tonnes in 1991-92.
Hungary is likely to be the only exporter this year from the region, which
was once the bread basket of Europe, and has the potential to become so
again.
The drought means Poland, another big producer, will import between 1m and
2m tonnes of grain this year after last year's 150,000 tonnes, Polish
traders say. The agriculture ministry says the Polish harvest will drop to
21.2m tonnes this year from 27.8m in 1991.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia reinstates palm oil
allocation system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA has reinstated an allocation system for the sale of crude palm oil
from state plantations while 'difficult negotiations' with private sector
businesses on deregulating sales continue, industry officials have said.
The state-plantations produce about 70 per cent of Indonesia's palm oil
production, which is forecast to exceed 3m tonnes this year, up from about
2.5m in 1991.
The peak season is just beginning and industry officials expect about 40 per
cent of the state plantations' production to be designated for export.
Government officials estimate that the state plantations exported 45m kg of
palm oil in May, and 30m kg in June.
Production and sales from private plantations is not regulated but is almost
entirely devoted to domestic refineries.
Last year the government introduced a sealed tender auction for state
plantation production, forcing local and foreign buyers into direct
competition. In March, however, the auction system was suspended because of
government concern at the rising cost of domestic cooking oil.
Players in the palm oil sector include some of Indonesia's largest and
politically most well-connected businesses, such as the Salim Group and the
Sinar Mas Group.
Under the new system, foreign buyers must either buy from domestic companies
that have received allocations, or negotiate directly with the state
marketing board. Industry officials say the price under the allocation
system is based on the previous month's Rotterdam cif price, less Dollars 40
a tonne.
Domestic demand for crude palm oil is expected to increase sharply with the
completion of new refining capacity. Industry officials estimate refining
capacity will rise from from 1.7m tonnes in 1991 to about 2.5m tonnes by the
end of this year.
Industry officials warn Indonesia may be following in Malaysia's footsteps
by over-investing in refineries. Competition among refiners for palm oil
would provide upward pressure on prices in a deregulated market.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Knuckles rapped over salmon
price fixing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH AND Norwegian salmon farmers have been reprimanded by the European
Commission for trying to fix minimum prices for their fish.
The commission has not imposed any fines on the three Scottish salmon
farming associations involved because the price-fixing agreement was
abandoned last October. The Norwegian Fish Farmers' Sales Organisation (FOS)
went bankrupt a month later, ending its own minimum price system.
Officials in Brussels described the move as 'knuckle-rapping after the
event', and said they had issued a statement to make it clear that private
anti-competitive agreements were unacceptable even when a market was under
pressure from alleged 'dumping' by third country producers.
Brussels' statement probably marks the final episode in the most recent saga
of strained relations between EC and Norwegian salmon farmers.
Scottish salmon farmers started to co-operate on fixing minimum prices in
December 1989. At the time, the Scottish industry was in crisis and blamed
Norwegian competitors for over-producing salmon and breaching their own
system of minimum pricing.
Community producers complained to the EC about the alleged dumping of
Norwegian salmon. The commission found that there was dumping but did not
impose protective duties because the Norwegians agreed to stick to their own
system of minimum prices in future and to freeze any excess production.
After talking to the Norwegians the Scottish Salmon Farmers' Marketing
Board, the Scottish Salmon Growers' Association and the Shetland Salmon
Farmers' Association - which account for about 80 per cent of Scottish
salmon production - urged their members to bring prices into line with the
FOS system. As a result, salmon prices, which had dropped by nearly 25 per
cent in Scotland since 1988, leapt by 27 per cent in January 1990.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum and gold prices fall
despite S African strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE START of a two-day general strike in South Africa, the world's biggest
producer of gold and platinum, was followed yesterday by sharp falls in the
prices of those precious metals.
Dealers suggested that this was because there were no reports of widespread
violence. 'Fears of supply disruptions were heavily exaggerated,' said one.
Gold closed in London last night at Dollars 353.50 a troy ounce, down
Dollars 4.45 from Friday's close. Dealers reported that the price tested
Dollars 352.50 an ounce in late trading.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of the Banque
Bruxelles Lambert group, pointed out that yesterday's gold price movement
was predictable. Many investment funds had bought the metal two weeks ago at
Dollars 343 an ounce and were disappointed when the price failed to break
conclusively through Dollars 360 - although it did briefly touch Dollars
361.
The funds were consequently expected to take their profits as the price fell
back to Dollars 355.
Dealers confirmed this happened yesterday. 'Two weeks ago the funds were
buying. The reverse happened today,' said one. 'Probably they expected more
from the South African day of action.'
Whereas dealers reported good two-way trade in gold yesterday, activity in
the platinum market was very subdued as traders sifted through news from
South Africa and attempted to analyse the implications. South Africa
supplies about two-thirds of the world's platinum requirements.
Platinum closed in London at Dollars 379.50 an ounce, down Dollars 5.75 from
Friday's close.
Although the Confederation of South African Trade Unions claimed that 60 per
cent of miners stayed away from work yesterday, Mr Tony Warwick-Ching,
analyst at the London-based Commodities Research Unit, pointed out that two
days was 'pretty irrelevant in terms of platinum production'. Also the
platinum price had risen strongly last week because of the strike threat so
'most of the news has been accounted for by the market for some time'.

FT  04 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: European bond investors take heart from
French poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH voters sent a strong, positive message to European bond investors
yesterday, helping to repair some of the damage done in all the major
European government markets last week. According to the latest official
poll, 57 per cent of voters intend to back the Maastricht proposals on
economic and monetary union at the referendum on September 20.
The French bond market itself was one of the strongest gainers. Bond prices
leapt by up to a point, pushing the yield on the 10-year benchmark OAT due
2002 down to 9.11 per cent, compared with 9.24 per cent at the end of last
week. This helped to narrow the gap between French and German bond yields,
although at around 95 basis points the differential reflects concern about
the September referendum.
IN THE Italian market, the news from France put further weight behind a
strong rally which had been under way since trading opened. After the gloom
of recent weeks, prompted by fears of a lira devaluation, the market was
cheered by the first concrete sign that the new Italian administration may
be able to achieve economic reform, rather than simply talk about it. This
was the deal, agreed with trade unions, to scrap the scala mobile, which
automatically inflation-proofs the wages of Italian workers.
The Italian bond futures contract on Liffe gained two points on the day.
Having ended last week at 91.58, the contract opened higher at 92.10 and,
with over 30,000 contracts traded during the day, settled at around 93.59 by
the close.
In a surprise move after the markets had closed, the Bank of Italy took the
opportunity to cut its discount rate - raised twice in recent weeks to
defend the lira - to 13.25 per cent from 13.75 per cent. It also cut the
Italian Lombard rate from 15.25 per cent to 14.75 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds also bounced sharply yesterday after last week's
losses, thanks both to the news from France and a technical rally in the
futures market. On Liffe, the bund futures contract, which had opened at
86.58, jumped to nearly 87.00 before settling at around 86.93 for the day.
However, an issue of 10-year bonds due tomorrow from the Bundespost is
likely to hold back any further gains. The German postal authority is
expected to raise between DM4bn and DM6bn, issuing bonds at par with a
coupon of 8 1/4 per cent.
IN THE UK, gilts ended half a point higher after a weak start, as traders
pushed prices higher on news of the French poll. With little domestic news
on the horizon, traders were pleased to find a reason to push the market
higher, after its recent weak performance. However, the rally did not appear
to spark substantial investor interest.
Comments by prime minister John Major over the weekend, which stressed his
commitment to maintaining the strength of the pound, did not influencethe
gilts market.
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the gilt
future contract closed at 97.06, up  5/8 point on Friday's close.
US Treasury prices were little changed across the maturity range yesterday
in the wake of a purchasing managers' report that reaffirmed the softness in
the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 106
1/2 , to yield 7.445 per cent, having recovered from early weakness. The
two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding 4.382.
The market was looking for a direction in early trading but the report from
the National Association of Purchasing Management that its index improved
marginally to 54.2 in July (from 52.8 in June) provided little inspiration
for investors. The figure was in line with expectations, although analysts
noted the decline in the NAPM index's employment component suggested July's
employment report, out on Friday, could show continued weakness in the
labour market.
The only other feature of the morning was some selling of short and
intermediate-dated securities as players continued to make room for last
week's auctioned issues of two-year and five-year Treasuries.

Cigna
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, yesterday unveiled
underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.09-a-share compared with
Dollars 1.88 in the same period of 1991.
Cigna's chairman, Mr Wilson Taylor, blamed the shortfall on weak worldwide
property and casualty markets and high catastrophe losses, particularly from
the Los Angeles riots.
Earlier this month, the company warned that its results would fall below
analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1.25 a share, but did not give
specific reasons.
Mr Taylor said that the company had started reviewing its London property
and casualty reinsurance operations because of recent concerns about the
London reinsurance market.
The company is looking particularly closely at 'those losses arising from
large catastrophes occurring over the last several years.'
'The effect of the review is not reasonably estimable at this time, but is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation's
consolidated financial condition.'
Cigna's pre-tax catastrophe losses climbed to Dollars 55m, including Dollars
39m from the Los Angeles riots, from Dollars 11m a year earlier.
Net income for the three months to June 30 were Dollars 125m, or Dollars
1.74 a share including one-time gains of Dollars 47m.
A year earlier, Cigna had net income of Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.38
including one-time after-tax gains of Dollars 36m.
For the first half, Cigna had net income of Dollars 231m, or Dollars 3.22 a
share, including after-tax gains of Dollars 70m.
For the same period of 1991, Cigna earned Dollars 218m, or Dollars 3.05 a
share, including extraordinary gains of Dollars 41m.
Premiums and fees for the group overall in the second quarter were Dollars
3.45bn compared with Dollars 3.6bn a year ago, while net investment income
totalled Dollars 970m compared with Dollars 960m.
For the first half, premiums and fees stood at Dollars 6.9bn while net
investment income totalled Dollars 1.96bn.
A year earlier, premiums and fees were Dollars 7.2bn while net investment
income was Dollars 1.93bn.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the US manufacturing, services and technology company,
yesterday underscored the increasingly global nature of its business by
appointing Mr Paolo Fresco as the first non-American member of its top
executive team.
Mr Fresco, a 59-year-old Italian who runs GE's international business
development operations from a London base, has been appointed a
vice-chairman of the group and one of four members of GE's policy-making
corporate executive office.
Mr Frank Doyle, 61, a senior vice-president of GE and a labour relations
expert, was also named yesterday to the executive office and given the new
title of executive vice-president.
The two existing members of the office are Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, and
Mr Edward Hood, the company's other vice-chairman. They had been its only
members since the departure from the group of two other executives over a
year ago.
Mr Fresco, who became the first non-American member of the GE board in 1990,
has been with the group since 1962 and has headed GE International since
1985. This arm is responsible for developing new international business
alliances and acquisitions and liaising with foreign governments.
Important deals in which he was involved include GE's acquisition of a
controlling interest in Hungary's Tungsram light bulb company and its joint
ventures with Britain's General Electric Company.
Mr Fresco, who spends up to 50 per cent of his time travelling worldwide,
will retain his position at GE International. He said yesterday his
appointment would give him further opportunity to foster globalisation at GE
and bring a non-American perspective to the company's decision-making.
GE also announced yesterday that the heads of the group's 13 business units
would now have the title of president and chief executive officer for their
particular businesses.
Mr Welch said the change recognised the fact that all 13 businesses were the
size of Fortune 500 companies and five were the size of Fortune 100
companies.

AMERICA West Airlines, which is operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, has
reached agreements in principle to expand its debtor-in-possession financing
by at least Dollars 45m and up to Dollars 60m, Reuter reports from Phoenix.
In addition, America West said that it expected to obtain 'additional
financial benefits' of more than Dollars 137m from aircraft providers and
other sources, including aircraft lessor GPA Group of Ireland.
America West, which operated chiefly in the south-west and west of the US,
said that the new financing would 'significantly enhance' its ability to
file a plan of reorganisation in the near term. It would also support the
airline's recently announced strategic cuts and related route realignments.
America West said the agreement in principle on the expanded
debtor-in-possession financing was subject to conditions, including the
receipt of commitments on terms acceptable to both America West and its
lenders for Dollars 10m of the minimum Dollars 45m. It said talks for the
commitments were in final stages.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long and tortuous battle for ownership of LTV's aircraft and missiles
businesses intensified yesterday when LTV announced plans to sell to Martin
Marietta for Dollars 440m and a rival bidding team, led by Loral and the
Carlyle Group, countered with an offer of Dollars 445m.
The flurry of activity followed last week's announcement that Loral wanted
to buy LTV's missiles business for Dollars 240m. This would be in a joint
bid with the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm, and defence
company Northrop, which would bid Dollars 190m for the aircraft side.
The result was a package deal worth Dollars 430m.
However, LTV said yesterday morning that it had reached a preliminary letter
of agreement with Martin Marietta on a Dollars 440m bid, consisting of
Dollars 396m in cash and Dollars 44m in preferred stock.
Last night, Loral said that it and Carlyle would be making a bid of Dollars
445m, of which Dollars 424m would be in cash and Dollars 21m in preferred
stock, which it said was superior to the Martin Marietta deal.
Any final package still needs the approval of the bankruptcy court which
oversees the assets of LTV, which has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy since
1986.
Loral said last night that it hoped that the court would give due attention
to its latest offer.
Martin Marietta first appeared in the bidding in April when, in conjunction
with Lockheed, it made a Dollars 385m bid for the LTV businesses. However,
that bid was rejected by the courts in favour of a Dollars 450m offer from
Thomson-CSF of France and Carlyle.
Thomson withdrew from the bidding process last week, as Loral came in, after
the French company ran into hostility to its bid in Washington, where there
was concern over the possible leaking of US defence secrets to foreign
powers.

SYRIA and Turkey have decided to revive joint ministerial meetings on water
and agriculture.
During a weekend visit, Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister,
reassured Mr Farouq al-Shara, his counterpart in Damascus, that Turkey would
continue the supply of water to Syria, as under previous agreements.
Turkey controls the Euphrates river and has plans to irrigate more than 1m
hectares close to the Syrian border as part of its Dollars 32bn Gap project.
Water, however, is also vital for Syrian agriculture, and domestic and
industrial supply.
Under a 1987 protocol, a flow of 500 cubic metres a second, or about half
the average discharge, was guaranteed at the common border, while Turkey's
Dollars 4bn Ataturk dam was under construction.
Turkish water officials say Syria can only use about a third of that amount,
given saline soils and a higher rate of evaporation. Even so, Turkey has
proposed various joint projects, including a plan to flood the common border
to maximise power generation. It has also offered to supply power to cities
in northern Syria.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, last month strongly rejected
Syrian calls to share the water: 'We do not say we should share their oil
resources. They cannot say they should share our water resources.'
However, Mr Cetin's visit could pave the way for financial assistance for
the Gap from World Bank and other western donors, which have been wary of
supporting a project under dispute. Co-operation will be further enhanced by
the weekend decision to revive the joint agriculture and water meetings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government was confused yesterday by reports that Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, has prepared a new proposal to settle a
dispute over the ownership of four islands known in Japan as the Northern
Territories.
Tokyo was surprised by a suggestion from Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, Russia's
deputy prime minister, who arrived yesterday for a five-day visit, that the
US may be involved in an agreement on control of four of the Kurile Islands.
The dispute dominates relations between the two countries, and Japan is
unwilling to offer Russia substantial financial assistance until control of
the islands, occupied by Soviet troops in 1945, is returned.
Mr Poltoranin said the US could be involved in an agreement to ensure the
demilitarisation of the disputed islands, and added that Russia would abide
by a 1956 agreement in which the Soviet Union agreed to hand back two of the
islands.
The suggestion of US involvement bewildered Japanese officials. Japan still
sees the fate of the four islands as a bilateral issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has broken out inside the Russian government, and between the
administration and the central bank, over the issuing of a further
Rbs1,000bn of credit by the bank to prop up large state companies struggling
under vast loads of debt.
Mr Pyotr Fillipov, chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee for
privatisation, said the move would 'push the country to the edge of an
horrendous economic crisis' and raise inflation to between 70-80 per cent a
month, from 15 per cent now.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the new acting chairman of the central bank,
promised to issue the credit at the end of last week, though most ministers
appear to be strongly opposed. However, at least two - Mr Georgy Khizha,
deputy prime minister, and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, minister for fuel and
energy - were reported yesterday to support the move.
Even so, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, is said to
be against the plan.
All three ministers were brought into the cabinet in June, in a move seen as
aimed at diluting the radicalism of the cabinet of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
acting prime minister.
In an article in the newspaper Izvestia yesterday, Mr Fillipov said Mr
Gerashchenko's decision would destroy the economic policy of President Boris
Yeltsin and the government. The largest share of credits would go to
enterprises which had run up the largest debts because they sold nothing
anyone wanted to buy or had put up their prices beyond consumers' reach.
Mr Gerashchenko's policy - which is to support industry, attempt to pay back
foreign debts and postpone both the struggle against inflation and any
attempt to make the rouble convertible - is opposed, with increasing
directness, both to the policy of the government and to measures recommended
by the International Monetary Fund.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: Significance of BMW plant in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY MAZULLO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article, 'Union hits at BMW plans for US plant' (July 29), fails to
place the proper emphasis on the significance of IG Metall's opposition to a
BMW non-union plant in South Carolina.
The entity which the author refers to as BMW's 'oversight council' (a direct
translation from the German word 'Aufsichtsrat') is in fact BMW's
supervisory board.
The supervisory board plays a significant role in the German corporate
governance system. German companies are governed by a two-tiered board
structure composed of a management board and a supervisory board.
As the title implies, the supervisory board is responsible for the
supervision or oversight of the management board, which in is responsible
for the daily management of the company. Approval of the supervisory board
is required for a number of corporate actions, and the supervisory board
influences corporate policy.
The composition of the supervisory board is determined by German Securities
Law and German Co-determination Law, the latter of which prescribes employee
representation on the supervisory board. BMW's 20-member supervisory board
consists of ten shareholder representatives and ten employee
representatives.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, second chairman of the board of management of IG Metall,
is an employee representative on BMW's supervisory board. As such, he
advocates the union's labour relation policies, and therefore is pressuring
BMW to employ union workers at its South Carolina plant.
BMW's decision to open a non-unionised plant in the US is a major event in
German industrial relations. It will be interesting to follow IG Metall's
efforts to secure union representation at the South Carolina plant, both
through Mr Zwickel's impact as a member of BMW's supervisory board and
through co-operation with US unions.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Pop goes the music business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cancellation of Michael Jackson's Wembley concert on Saturday minutes
before he was due to perform to 72,000 people - may dent the star's image.
But it will cause only slight consternation to the music promoters that have
earned large fees from this summer's series of big pop concerts around the
country. The large number of events has helped to lift the spirits of
another industry knocked by the recession.
The Jackson concerts are among 40 large rock events recently staged around
the country, by bands such as Simply Red, Guns'n'Roses and Genesis, which
are expected to gross around Pounds 60m by the end of the summer.
The five-day Michael Jackson extravaganza which began last Thursday, is
expected to gross Pounds 12m - a figure that some small quoted companies
would be happy to make in a full year, and which equals the total for the
whole of 1991, when only three large acts played in the country.
Observers say this year's bonanza represents one of the last echoes of the
Gulf war. The previous summer was out because managers tend to book summer
tours in January or February. In January 1991 - in the midst of the Gulf war
 -nearly all the big US acts except Guns'n'Roses pulled out.
But, for all the glamour and glory of the mega-gigs, not even rock can
escape the ravages of recession. The signs have even been seen at concerts
once expected to generate strong demand. Nowhere was this more striking than
at a recent Stevie Wonder concert where the star played to a less than full
Wembley Arena - the smaller, indoor venue which has a capacity of 12,000.
For the last of Dire Straits' London concerts the promoters were forced to
resort to continuous radio advertising to boost interest.
The impact has been greater at smaller venues around the country although
some, such as the 3,500-seat Hammersmith Odeon in west London, say they have
benefited from increased bookings from bands frightened by the prospect of
playing at half empty, larger venues.
But it is records, cassettes and compact discs, the mainstay of the
industry, with retail sales in the UK last year of Pounds 1.26bn, that have
really suffered. According to figures from the industry's own trade
organisation, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), in the four-year
period 1989 to 1992, albums delivered to retailers fell by 15.2 per cent,
and singles fell by 8.3 per cent. The most recent figures disclosed that the
downward trend was continuing with a 5.7 per cent fall in album deliveries
in the year to March 1992.
Mr Maurice Oberstein, chairman of PolyGram UK and current chairman of the
BPI, said: 'The music industry is not recession-proof. Young people who make
up a large part of our audience are usually the first to become unemployed.'
As well as unemployment, demographics have also had a part to play. A trade
still heavily geared to teenage consumption has had to contend with a fall
of 1.5m people within its target audience in the six years since 1986.
Computer games have proved strong competition. Nintendo, the expensive
Japanese video game, has increasingly displaced artists such as Def Leppard
in the affections of many teenagers.
Record companies have been forced to act. BMG Records, part of Bertelsmann,
the Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.6bn)-a-year German entertainment group, which owns
the RCA and Arista labels, admits to having reduced its workforce by 40 to
300 over the past 18 months, a loss that included two managing directors.
Others have been forced to make similar cuts although, this being show
business, the illusion of all being well must at all times be maintained.
With the UK still in the grip of recession, predictions earlier in the year
by some in the industry of a return to the Christmas bonanza, traditionally
the most lucrative part of the year, now appear to be premature and
optimists have been forced to scale back expectations. This is a feeling
that some Michael Jackson fans only know too well.

FT  03 AUG 92 / N-plant cottage attracts buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST one house for sale in Britain looks likely to find a buyer even
though it has the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant as its
next-door neighbour.
Coombe Cottage, a detached three-bedroomed property with a pink bathroom
suite and imposing views of the Sellafield complex, stands a few yards from
the north gate of the site and within its 2km emergency evacuation zone.
Although in a cul-de-sac, it suffers from heavy traffic at shift changes as
many hundreds of Sellafield workers drive past.
Yet while appealing properties in quiet avenues all over Britain languish
for lack of buyers, this bizarrely situated home has attracted offers,
including one just Pounds 2,500 short of its Pounds 47,500 asking price.
Mitchells Lakeland Properties, the estate agents, say the location of the
cottage - the nearest private property to the Sellafield site - has neither
deterred would-be buyers nor deflated the asking price, which is on a par
with freehold houses elsewhere in west Cumbria. It is understood it is being
sold by the family of an elderly woman who lived there until recently.
'There's been quite a lot of interest in it,' the agents said. 'We have a
couple of offers on it and it's standing at Pounds 45,000 at the moment.
It's a nice little cottage - it's been very popular.'
British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, owns some formerly private
farms on the coast around the site. The agents said BNFL was interested in
Coombe Cottage, which has been on the market since March, but declined to
say whether it had made an offer. The company said it would not
automatically buy a property because it was so near the site.
The keenest buyers would probably have been anti-nuclear groups, for whom it
would have been ideal as a 'shop window' for protests but the price has
deterred them.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Small businesses brave harsh trading climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S manufacturers are facing harsher trading conditions, particularly
among small companies, according to three reports released today.
Small manufacturing companies have suffered a fresh fall in new orders and
are less confident about business prospects than three months ago, according
to the Confederation of British Industry.
The London Chamber of Commerce predicts increasing insolvencies in coming
months among small manufacturing companies in the capital after a worsening
of cashflow in the second quarter of this year.
More broadly, the latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers says
manufacturing activity has fallen since June while orders have declined
significantly.
The three reports bear out the gloomy conclusions of last week's quarterly
survey of manufacturing trends from the CBI, which pointed to falling output
and further job cuts over the next four months.
Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI Small Firms Council, said the
decline in new orders was slower than at any time last year. 'This can
hardly be described as an encouraging development,' he said. 'In April,
small businesses were predicting an increase in business. That failed to
materialise.'
The London Chamber of Commerce found that many of the 242 companies polled
expected falling profits in the next six months and no increase in turnover.
'Small manufacturers are being hit by weak demand, high interest rates and
the late payment of debts,' said Ms Jacqui Ginnane, chief economist.
The Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which claims to represent UK
purchasing managers spending a total of Pounds 250bn a year, said its latest
purchasing managers' index presented a discouraging picture. The index,
which reflects managers' reports about data, including output, new orders
and employment, fell to 48 in July from 50.2 in June and was well below the
55.1 level recorded in April.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Fiscal boost is sought to spur economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is urged today to consider fiscal stimulus for the economy,
including help for the housing market, amid forecasts that output may
contract by about 1 per cent this year.
In separate reports, Oxford Economic Forecasting, an independent economic
research company, and Midland Montagu, the investment bank, forecast that
British gross domestic product will fall by 1.1 per cent and 1 per cent
respectively this year.
In its latest Economic and Financial Outlook, National Westminster Bank
predicts a 0.3 per cent drop in UK GDP this year, compared with the
government's Budget forecast of 1 per cent growth.
Both OEF and NatWest advocate temporary fiscal expansion to cope with the
recession.
Mr David Kern, NatWest's chief economist, said the government should
'seriously consider higher public spending on infrastructure and specific
help for the housing market' as a way to regain the political initiative and
to counter the criticisms of UK membership of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The Oxford forecasting team suggests that the government should re-examine
the nature and composition of its fiscal policy instead of simply defining
it in terms of the PSBR and the medium-term aim of balancing the budget. The
outlook for public infrastructure investment - which it described as a
proven pump primer for the construction sector - appeared especially bleak
at present, it commented.
The OEF report advocates a stimulus to the housing market through relaxing
controls on the supply of building land.
The report urges the government to look at ways of promoting private-sector
investment in market-oriented ways. One way would be through an
across-the-board subsidy to 'demonstrably new projects started in the next
six to 12 months' to compensate for the high level of interest rates.
The OEF warns that a realignment involving a devaluation of the pound would
not cure the UK economy's ills. It would not lead to lower interest rates
and would fail to give a sufficient boost to exports.
In his report, Mr Roger Bootle, Midland Montagu's chief economist, says
there may be a radical shift of government policy aimed at achieving lower
interest rates after the end of the UK's six-month EC presidency if the
government is unable to deliver sharply lower rates within the ERM
constraints. Mr Bootle said markets should expect the government to attempt
a 'radical breakout' in policy next year if UK inflation is low, there is no
UK recovery in sight and no meaningful cut in German interest rates is in
prospect.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Industrialists raise pressure for realignment: FT writers
report on the continuing economic difficulties and the rising volume of
voices offering solutions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is under growing pressure from senior directors of depressed
British companies to use its presidency of the European Community to press
for a realignment of currencies in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Executives emphasised the need for European countries to cut interest rates
to boost faltering economies and forestall further company failures.
That would be best achieved, according to many directors, either by a
revaluation of the D-Mark or by a devaluation of a range of European
currencies against the D-Mark. They recognised that neither move could rely
on the support of the Bonn government, which has raised interest rates to
help to pay for German reunification and to curb inflation.
Mr Ken Schofield, chief executive of MTM, the chemicals group, said: 'We are
paying real interest rates of about 10 per cent and we will never get out of
recession at that sort of rate. We really need real rates of about 6 per
cent.
'There are two things that need doing. First there should be a realignment
of all the currencies in the ERM apart from the D-Mark. That might allow
interest rates to come down to 7 or 8 per cent.
'Secondly we need to move forward as quickly as possible to a single
European currency . . . Otherwise, as the German economy recovers, the
D-Mark will have an ever-increasing distorting effect on the European
economy.'
He said recent returns from his own group and from motor manufacturers
Chrysler and Ford suggested that lower interest rates were helping growth in
the US.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said: 'The government has
closed off so many avenues if they want to stimulate the economy.
'They are not going to increase public expenditure, they are talking of
reducing it. They don't want to devalue nor leave the ERM. I believe we
should stay in the ERM. We went in at too high a level, but devaluation
raises too many questions about whether they have gone far enough.
'There may be an argument for a revaluation of the D-Mark. The Bundesbank is
damping German inflation with high interest rates and is dictating to the
rest of Europe . . . In the UK we need to lower interest rates.
'There is a lack of consumer confidence, people are uncertain about the
future. The housing market needs lower interest rates and sectoral help is
needed for the construction industry.'
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electronics retailer, opposed
unilateral devaluation but said Britain should use its presidency of the EC
to initiate discussions on the subject of realignment.
Mr Fred Hadfield, chairman of Ingersoll-Rand UK, the industrial and
construction equipment group, said that a cut in interest rates would be the
best stimulus for the UK economy, but that might require a withdrawal from
the ERM, which might undermine the concept of a united Europe.
Unilateral devaluation of sterling would not work, either, because the
benefits of previous devaluations had proven only transient. As for a
realignment of the ERM, Mr Hadfield said most of the parities were
reasonable except that of the D-Mark.
In the machine tool industry, Mr Stan Vaughan, managing director of Hahn &amp;
Kolb Great Britain, agreed that withdrawal from the ERM would be a
retrograde move. He said: 'The D-Mark should be revalued - that's the one
that's out of step.'
Mr Vaughan advocated a cut of about 2 points in UK interest rates to
stimulate the economy. While conceding that would be difficult for the
government with its ERM commitments, he said Britain could not 'sit around
waiting for something to happen'.
Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group, the machine tool and
mechanical handling equipment producer, proposed a different solution. 'The
mistake we have always made in this country is to defend the pound at too
high a level, whereas the Japanese and the Germans do the opposite.
'We should be setting up our fiscal and economic policies to maximise our
industrial potential, and let the markets decide the level of the pound in
the ERM.'
Meanwhile Mr Andrew Harrison, finance director of Courtaulds Textiles, said:
'A realignment to a new parity will not lead to an interest rate cut because
the government will have to defend the new level. It might help exports, but
demand overseas is slow. Realignment might import inflation too.
'The only way to get interest rates down is to float sterling like the
dollar, which would import a lot of inflation.'
He concluded: 'The government should try to persuade the Germans to increase
taxes rather than interest rates, and I don't see that happening.'
Mr Donald Parr, chairman of William Baird, Britain's third-largest textiles
company, said: 'The greatest problem for clothing and textiles is the
dollar. With US interest rates at 3 per cent, UK base rates at 10 per cent
and the exchange rate Dollars 1.92, you have cheap imports from the whole of
south-east Asia and the US and exporting is very difficult.'

FT  03 AUG 92 / US denies provocation of Iraq: Cheney says task force sent
to Kuwait under a deliberate programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US decision to dispatch 2,400 troops to Kuwait this week is designed to
send a message to Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, but not to provoke him,
according to US officials.
Mr Dick Cheney, secretary of defence, said at the weekend that the presence
of the reinforced armoured battalion and its participation in joint military
exercises was part of a deliberate programme.
This, he said, 'allows us to demonstrate to would-be adversaries that the US
is ready to go on short notice and to reassure our friends - such as the
Saudis, such as the Kuwaitis and the other Gulf states - that we are
prepared to come to their assistance it it is needed'.
But he added it was as wrong to suggest the US was seeking to provoke Mr
Saddam as it was to accept that there was any basis in the Iraqi president's
claim to sovereignty to all or part of Kuwait.
There is concern in the US government that Iraq has begun to reassert such
claims, much as it did prior to its invasion of Kuwait two years ago
yesterday.
The inclination is to see this as a pattern of bluster by Mr Saddam, also
known as 'cheat and retreat', of which denial of access to United Nations
inspectors was a part. But failure to take such signals seriously two years
ago is a mistake that the administration knows it cannot afford to repeat.
The battalion-sized task force, drawn from the 1st Cavalry division in Fort
Hood, Texas, and the 5th Special Forces group based in Fort Campbell,
Kentucky, combines tanks and mechanised infantry. Both units fought in the
Gulf war and will take part in exercises code-named Operation Intrinsic
Action, scheduled to start in September but now brought forward.
This operation - plus two others due to start today involving naval, marine
and amphibious forces - stem from last September's defence co-operation
agreement between the US and Kuwait. The decision to advance them was taken,
according to the Pentagon, 'when the difficulties started with inspections
in Baghdad'.
The new US military presence in the region is not of a size to suggest a
combat mission against Iraq is imminent, although the contingency plans for
air strikes against Iraq, involving US, British and French aircraft, were in
an advanced state of preparation during the recent confrontation with UN
inspectors in Baghdad.
Reuter reports from Baghdad: An unidentified gunman shot at a UN guard in
front of a Baghdad hotel yesterday in the latest of a series of problems
faced by UN staff in Iraq.
A UN official said the shooting was the latest of a series of security
'difficulties' for the guards.
No one has been hurt since security problems in Baghdad increased
dramatically in July. But vehicles have been daubed with paint and staff
have been insulted, spat on and intimidated.
Meanwhile, Iraq repeated its claims to Kuwait yesterday. The daily Babil
newspaper published a front page colour photograph of Mr Saddam praying on
the Kuwait City seafront in October 1990 with the headline: 'It will happen
again, God willing.'

FT  03 AUG 92 / Indonesian bank managers warned of loan crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS of Indonesia's seven state-owned banks would be sacked if found
granting loans as personal favours, Mr JB Sumarlin, Indonesia's minister of
finance, warned at the weekend.
The state banks dominate the banking sector, accounting for about half the
sector's Rupiah 118,000bn (Pounds 29.8bn) of outstanding credits. The
government is undertaking a programme to restructure the banks, reduce bad
debts and improve management.
In April the government changed the status of the banks from state
enterprises to limited liability companies, a move designed to give the
banks greater autonomy. On Saturday Mr Sumarlin completed a reshuffle of the
banks' boards, swearing in 72 new directors and commissioners.
Mr Sumarlin stressed: 'Should any government bank be known to have
channelled its funds on the force of a mere personal memo 'from up above',
it would be the bank leaders who would be hanged, not the author of the
memo,' the state-owned Antara news agency reported.
Bankers say Mr Sumarlin's statement is a tacit acceptance that the problems
faced by state banks are partly the result of lending under pressure from
businessmen, often politically well connected, for schemes which are not
commercially viable.
His statement, however, appeared to stop short of directly criticising those
exerting pressure for unwarranted credit facilities. Years of poor credit
control have left the state commercial banks with bad and doubtful debts of
between 15 and 25 per cent of their portfolios, donor officials estimate.
The government's restructuring programme will include raising the state
banks' capital adequacy ratio to 8 per cent of performing assets, in line
with Bank for International Settlements guidelines, by the end of next year.
Bankers say this will require an injection of up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn)
of new capital.
The World Bank is expected to provide over Dollars 300m to assist the banks'
recapitalisation and to improve the supervisory capacity of Bank Indonesia,
the central bank. Government officials say once the restructuring is
complete, they intend to float a minority shareholding in each of the state
banks.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Turkey faces formidable economic tasks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S economic policies are broadly on the right path but the country
faces a formidable task in maintaining growth and cutting inflation, the
Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warns in
a report published today.
In its first report since Mr Suleyman Demirel's coalition government was
formed last November, the OECD calls for radical reform of state-owned
industries, wage restraint in the public sector and closer co-operation
between government and central bank on financing the budget deficit.
The OECD says the 'broad lines of the new government's economic programme go
in the right direction' but warns Turkey faces a tough task to maintain
growth, to meet the increase in the labour force and at the same time tackle
the perennial problem of 'persistently high inflation'.
Turkey's gross national product is projected to grow by 5 per cent in 1992,
falling to 3.75 per cent in 1993. The recovery will be driven by household
consumption, bolstered by the generous pay increases of 1991. The current
account is forecast to remain in surplus at around  1/2 per cent of GNP over
the next two years. With a tight budget and monetary restraint, inflation
should fall in 1993 from around 70 per cent, the report says.
Much will depend on being able to cut public borrowing, the report says.
This jumped to a record 12.5 per cent of GNP in 1991. This year, it is
forecast at 8.8 per cent of GNP.
The OECD warns that failure to curb public borrowing could result in higher
inflation, and a faster depreciation of the Turkish lira, boosting the
interest payments on Turkey's foreign debt. This in turn will fuel domestic
interest rates, causing a shortfall in projected budget appropriations for
domestic debt.
The OECD calls for spending discipline and a more reliable revenue
generation mechanism, suggesting that many of the deficit reducing measures,
such as the tax amnesty, are of an irregular nature, and will be difficult
to repeat in 1993.
The OECD urges the government, when financing the deficit, to limit its use
of short-term advances from the central bank, which increase the money
supply and fuel inflation. Under the budget law a ceiling was set for
short-term advances from the central bank. However the government has
already exceeded that figure.
In addition to monetary restraint, the report says unit labour costs will
need to trail prices if Turkish exporters are to regain their competitive
edge, and new employment opportunities created. Given the weight of wages in
government expenditures, the report says the 'public sector has an important
responsibility' in restraining wage growth.
However, the report concludes that only through comprehensive reform will
the state sector industries 'cease to be a drain on public finance and a
threat to macro-economic stability'.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Clifford wins early BCCI trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary indicted last week on
criminal charges relating to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) scandal, has won his request for the trial to be held unusually soon,
Alan Friedman writes from New York.
A Washington judge has set October 26 as the date of the trial of Mr
Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his protege and law partner.
The two men were indicted in Washington and New York last week. The
Washington charges allege that they misled federal banking regulators about
their knowledge of BCCI's secret ownership of First American Bankshares, a
Washington bank they ran during the 1980s. Messrs Clifford and Altman have
entered pleas of not guilty in response to these charges.
The setting of an early Washington trial date is something of a tactical
victory for the two accused. Lawyers for both men argued for a quick trial
date, claiming that Mr Clifford, 85, might not live long and wished to clear
his name by winning a verdict in his favour.
But legal experts speculate there may be another advantage in being tried on
the Washington charges before having to face the indictments brought in New
York. The Washington charges are far less serious than those in New York;
these include conspiracy, the taking of bribes, falsifying business records
and scheming to commit fraud.
Under New York state law it is considered possible that 'double jeopardy'
provisions might mean a favourable verdict in Washington could preclude a
New York trial.
Another complication arising out of Mr Clifford's winning of an October
trial in Washington is that it might result in a delay of the separate and
unrelated trial of Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former Reagan administration
defence secretary indicted recently in the Iran/Contra scandal. This could
be because Mr Clifford and Mr Weinberger both have the same lawyer, who
might find it difficult to prepare simultaneously for the equally complex
Iran/Contra and BCCI trials.

TWO ARAB members of the Israeli parliament were yesterday appointed deputy
ministers in prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led coalition, the first
time in two decades that an Arab has been included in the government.
The cabinet also decided to accept an invitation from the US and Russia,
co-sponsors of the Middle East peace negotiations, to resume bilateral talks
with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians in Washington on August 24.
The talks are scheduled to last a month in an attempt to achieve a
breakthrough. They will be the first talks since Mr Rabin took power last
month promising to accelerate the peace process which made little progress
under his predecessor, Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
Further underlining the contrast with Mr Shamir's hardline government, the
cabinet voted to appoint Mr Nawaf Masalha, a Labour MP, deputy minister for
health. Mr Walid Sadek, of Labour's left-liberal coalition partner Meretz,
is to be deputy interior minister.
Reuter adds: Israeli settlers in occupied Arab lands vowed yesterday to
continue building new homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip despite a
government decision to freeze new construction. Members of the group said on
Israeli television they would raise funds privately.
It was not clear whether such private building was legal. An adviser to the
minister of housing said the legal aspects of the proposal would be checked.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Interception of Haitians to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government may continue to intercept Haitian boat people on the high
seas and return them home - at least for the next few weeks.
On Saturday, after several days of conflicting legal judgments, the Supreme
Court refused to reinstate the ban on interceptions ordered by a lower court
judge last week.
The highest court, however, did not pass judgment on the legality of the US
policy, enunciated by President George Bush on May 24. It gave the
government until August 24 to request a formal hearing on this critical
issue.
Since there have been two conflicting judgments on the legality of the US
policy at the appeals court level, the Supreme Court will find it hard to
duck a judgment. One hint of its likely division on this issue was evident
on Saturday when the two most liberal justices, Harry Blackmun and John Paul
Stevens, opposed extension of the ban.
This court has generally shown itself unwilling to throw out government
policy, even when it is patently uncomfortable with that policy. This was
most evident two months ago when it refused to invalidate on legal grounds
the extradition of a narcotics suspect from Mexico.
In arguments to the Supreme Court, the justice department had said that to
change policy now would precipitate a humanitarian disaster in the Caribbean
by encouraging countless Haitians to leave the island in unseaworthy
vessels.
Not directly addressed was the issue most troubling the appeals court in New
York last week, that forcible return of would-be refugees without first
ascertaining the legitimacy of their claim to asylum was in contravention of
both US law and international practice.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE ministers of the US, Canada and Mexico were meeting in Washington
yesterday for a final push to complete a North American Free-Trade
Agreement, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
'We simply must capture the momentum', said Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative, appearing on television yesterday on a programme taped on
Friday. 'You can't drag your feet and say we can't do it this week.'
The ministers had been 'on standby' since the previous weekend when they met
in Mexico City and failed to achieve a final breakthrough on the most
difficult issues. They flew into Washington on Saturday night and began a
series of unannounced meetings yesterday.
That they came at all indicates their top negotiators, who have been holding
meetings in Washington since Wednesday, were close enough to agreement to
allow the ministers to make the final, most difficult, compromises in areas
such as energy, agriculture, cars and rules of origin.
Mrs Hills, on television to make the case for the controversial pact to an
American public worried about the loss of manufacturing jobs to Mexico, said
US exports to Mexico would hit Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn) this year, up from
Dollars 12bn in 1987.
The US and Mexico had 'a wonderful fit,' and exports would continue to grow
in computers, capital goods and food products, creating thousands of new
high-paying jobs in the US.
She said letters had been sent to 160 US business leaders asking for
suggestions about a worker adjustment programme. This will be included in
the Nafta-implementing legislation, which must be approved by Congress
before the pact becomes reality.
Mrs Hills has said it could take at least three to four weeks to prepare the
pact before submitting it to Congress. It must be accompanied by 40
private-sector adviser reports.
The negotiators were hoping for congressional passage this year but they
have run out of time. The pact must first be submitted for a 90-day
notification period. When the new Congress meets next year it will have 90
legislative days to debate the pact.

A European science satellite encountered guidance problems yesterday hours
after its deployment from the space shuttle, the US space agency Nasa said,
Reuter reports from Florida.
Astronauts aboard the Atlantis shuttle said the Dollars 426m (Pounds 223m)
satellite appeared to pitch over shortly after its gas jets ignited to boost
it to its working altitude of 325 miles. The shuttle chased the European
Retrievable Satellite, known as Eureca, in an effort to help ground
controllers maintain contact with it but no rendezvous was planned.
The shuttle is scheduled to return to Earth on Friday.

Violence erupted in Borno state in the north, where agents for some of the

Mexico yesterday put its democratic reforms to the test in elections in six

month in the border state of Chihuahua, held high hopes of adding another
governorship in Durango, just to the south.
Elections for governor were also being held in four other states, while Baja
California voters were choosing mayors and state legislators.
A series of opposition victories could cause tension within the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). The Chihuahua victory was only the
second gubernatorial victory by an opposition party in any of Mexico's 31
states since the PRI was formed in 1929. Some polls showed the two parties
neck and neck in Durango.

PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday authorised the first subsidised sales of
pork to the Commonwealth of Independent States, an action long sought by US
grain and pork producers, Reuter reports from Washington. The move will let
the former Soviet republics buy up to 30,000 tonnes of pork at prices
subsidised by the US government.
'This initiative will enable an otherwise competitive US industry to fight
unfair competition and gain an important market share in a potentially vast
market,' Mr Bush said. The initiative marked the first time pork had been
offered under the Export Enhancement Programme which had been used in the
past mainly to promote wheat and rice sales abroad. The White House called
the decision to authorise pork sales 'pro-farmer, pro-jobs and pro-trade as
it fights unfair foreign competition'.
The CIS has made virtually all of its purchases of US food with US loan
guarantees and has used up outstanding credits authorised by the Bush
administration.

FT  03 AUG 92 / End of road for Italian pay hikes: The ending of wage
indexation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE agreement at the weekend to abolish Italy's scala mobile wage indexation
system represents the second success in a week as the new prime minister, Mr
Giuliano Amato, struggles to reform radically the country's finances.
Struggling with a mere 16-seat parliamentary majority, Mr Amato turned
Italy's beleaguered economic position to his advantage in reaching the
accord with unions and employers on revising the pay system, which links
wage rises to inflation. In doing so, he achieved what the much stronger
government of his predecessor, Mr Giulio Andreotti, had failed to do in much
longer negotiations this time last year.
Coupled with his success in pushing through parliament a L30,000bn (Pounds
14.1bn) package of spending cuts and revenue increases last week, Mr Amato
had a firmer foundation for his appeal yesterday to foreign investors not to
sell the lira and to give his government time to push through crucial
reforms.
Mr Franco Reviglio, the budget minister, described the government's approach
as 'shock therapy' to improve the competitiveness of Italian industry
compared with its European Community partners. Italy needed a high degree of
responsibility and a political consensus to avoid 'a very serious financial
crisis', he said.
Mr Amato still has much more to achieve if he is to restore confidence in
the Italian economy and enable the country to meet its commitments under the
Maastricht treaty for economic and monetary union.
While last week's approval in the lower house of parliament for the
government's emergency budget, designed to cut L30,000bn from the deficit,
was a major step, the real battle for Mr Amato will come next month, when
draconian measures are expected to try to reduce state spending.
Mr Amato further strengthened his government's credibility on Saturday,
naming former premier Mr Emilio Colombo as foreign minister. The 72-year-old
Mr Colombo is widely respected for his European Community credentials.

<TEXT>
REFUGEES in a desperate plight in Croatia were yesterday divided over who
would be the best new leader for their war-torn republic.
'Franjo Tudjman will lead us out of the crisis. . . If he hadn't been
president Croatia would never have been recognised,' Mrs Anka Capan, a
refugee for 10 months, said yesterday.
The war and the need for Croatia to gain control over its territory
dominated the elections. Mrs Capan and other refugees from the village of
Slunj have been living in Karlovac, 50km from Zagreb, in homes previously
owned by Serbs. Shrapnel-scarred buildings, sandbags and boarded-up windows
indicate the fears of renewed violence between Croat and Serb militias.
Yesterday, many refugees said they had voted for the 70-year-old former
communist army general in Croatia's first elections since winning
independence from Yugoslavia.
Mr Tudjman was yesterday already claiming victory for himself and the ruling
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).
However, a poll in Slobodna Dalmacija, an independent Croatian daily, has
predicted Mr Drazen Budisa, president of the Croatian Social Liberal party
(HSLS), the strongest opposition party, will win in the second round, if the
Croatian president fails to gain over 50 per cent of yesterday's vote.
Some of Croatia's 750,000 refugees yesterday said Mr Budisa would bring
change faster than Mr Tudjman. Mr Zlatko Druzar, a refugee from Toranj now a
soldier, said the HSLS and the Croatian People's party (HNS) were more
'democratic' than the ruling HDZ.
Another opposition party is the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP); its members
claim to be the followers of the pro-Nazi Ustashe, who during the second
world war killed hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gipsies.
Special polling stations have been set up for refugees in the parliamentary
elections for the 124-member lower chamber, but balloting is not being held
in the zones now patrolled by the United Nations.
The exact number of voters is unknown but it is estimated at some 3.5m.
It could not be confirmed yesterday whether the poll was being held in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose inhabitants were recently granted dual
citizenship. First unofficial results were expected today.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European construction equipment market outside Germany is forecast to
fall 18 per cent this year, according to a report which further underlines
the combined effects of German unification and recession elsewhere.
Corporate Intelligence Group of London, in a mid-term review this week,
identifies Germany as the only market that will grow appreciably this year,
with unit sales predicted to rise 16 per cent from 36,429 last year to
42,480.
The group's forecast for the European market overall this year remains
unchanged at 5 per cent. But its forecast for Germany contrasts sharply with
its prediction in the spring of a fall in demand this year as
post-unification equipment buying tailed off: there is continuing
'phenomenal' demand for wheeled loaders, mini-excavators and wheeled
excavators, according to the group's latest review.
The better-than-expected performance in Germany is balanced by predictions
of much sharper declines in Italy, Spain, and France, where prospects have
worsened over the past three months. And apart from Norway, where a marginal
1 per cent increase from a low base is predicted, all Scandinavia will fall
further into deep recession.
The UK market is likely to fall a further 4 per cent from 9,212 units to
8,860 this year, says the group.

A SNIPER killed two young children aboard a bus evacuating orphans from
Sarajevo at the weekend, while Moslem forces battled to break the Serb hold
on the besieged Bosnian capital, agencies report from Sarajevo.
The children were among 50 being taken from a local orphanage to meet German
officials in nearby Fojnica on their way to refuge in Germany. They had been
waiting for six days to be evacuated, unable to fly out because of heavy
fighting.
United Nations peacekeepers in Sarajevo denied being asked to escort the
bus, although the charity that organised the evacuation said such protection
had been requested.
A German official later said the children had reached a 'secure' town about
40km from Sarajevo. They would be moved to Split, in Croatia, today before
being flown to Germany.
The UN compound in the city was attacked yesterday when shrapnel from an
exploding mortar crashed through the headquarters building. Mr Mik
Magnusson, a UN spokesman, had earlier warned that Bosnian forces were
endangering peacekeepers by setting up weapons too close to their monitoring
positions.
A protest was also lodged with the Serbs for firing back at well-marked UN
positions, he said.
Throughout the weekend, Moslem and Serb forces traded conflicting claims of
military success around the city, each accusing the other of launching
offensives and each claiming to have beaten back attacks. Moslem forces have
been trying to capture hills used by Serb gun batteries to pound Sarajevo,
where 380,000 people are trapped.
In a BBC interview, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said the west should
arm Moslems to defend themselves against Serbs who outgun them. 'I ask
myself sometimes, does Europe known what is going on here?' he said. 'Do
those responsible in Europe really know about concentration camps, about the
mass killings (in Serb-held areas)?'

FT  03 AUG 92 / Making refugee safe zones work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION continues to surround the concept of 'safe zones' for refugees
from Bosnia-Hercegovina, an idea spawned at last week's United Nations
conference in Geneva on refugees in the former Yugoslavia.
With an estimated 500,000 refugees in the region without adequate shelter
for the coming winter, and tens of thousands of others continuing to knock
on the doors of other countries, a co-ordinated solution for the Bosnian
refugee problem has become a matter of extreme urgency.
Rejecting the proposal by Germany, which has taken more than 200,000
refugees from the region, that country-by-country quotas should be
established, most of the participants agreed that local and regional
solutions should be found for the problem.
Both France and Britain have stressed that transporting refugees abroad
could encourage the very process of 'ethnic cleansing' - creating ethnically
pure regions - for which the Serbs have been condemned by the international
community. Moreover, that would make the return of the refugees to their
homes, which everyone agrees should be the ultimate objective, much more
difficult, it is argued.
However, treating the refugee problem 'close to home' is easier said than
done in a country where fighting is going on in widely dispersed localities
and where clearly defined front-lines do not exist. It presupposes the
setting up of safe zones, which are not only administered by the UN, but
which require at least some military protection.
Since the concept of safe zones was not clearly defined even by those who
proposed them at the Geneva conference, it is hardly surprising that many
initially saw them as similar to the Kurdish 'safe havens' set up in
northern Iraq after the Gulf war. It has since become clear, however, that
the main protagonists of the idea recognise the impracticality of such a
solution.
The safe havens set up in northern Iraq were made possible by the
co-operation with the US-led coalition of a neighbouring Nato ally, Turkey,
which provided it with military air bases, and also by the comprehensive
defeat of the Iraqi armed forces in the Gulf War.
In the case of Bosnia, however, a large number of troops armed with mortars
and artillery, and backed by aircraft based in Italy and on US and allied
aircraft carriers in the Adriatic, would have to be provided for an
indefinite period if refugee areas were set up in a war zone. That would be
tantamount to a full-scale military intervention, which most western
countries want to avoid.
What is envisaged, therefore, is to set up protected refugee zones either in
regions of Bosnia not been affected by the conflict, or in Croatia, where UN
monitors are already on the spot, or even on the other side of the Yugoslav
border in neighbouring countries.

FT  03 AUG 92 / PM stresses commitment to keeping strong pound: Fresh calls
for realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is willing to endure a 'bitter autumn' of personal
unpopularity as the price for sticking to the government's policy of keeping
sterling at its DM2.95 parity in the European exchange rate mechanism.
According to Whitehall officials, the prime minister is determined to shake
off the government's present embattled image over economic policy by making
a virtue out of the government's anti-inflationary zeal.
He will present the Conservative party's annual conference in October with a
vision of Britain having the lowest inflation rate among the world's leading
industrial powers and - in time - interest rates below Germany's.
But senior directors of depressed British companies are stepping up their
calls for the government, which currently holds the presidency of the
European Community, to seek a realignment of currencies in the ERM.
Executives are stressing the need for European countries to cut interest
rates to boost their economies and stem company failures. The most effective
action, many believe, would be either a revaluation of the D-Mark or by a
devaluation of a range of European currencies against the D-Mark.
Downing Street officials at the weekend underlined that Mr Major and Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would be unwavering in their commitment to a
strong pound, even to the extent of keeping sterling pegged to the German
currency in the event of a realignment of ERM parities or a revaluation of
the D-Mark by Germany.
Signs that the government is prepared to take a stronger line in the battle
against inflation came as a Mori opinion poll carried out for The Sunday
Times put Labour ahead of the Tories for the first time since the general
election and registered a sharp decline in consumer confidence last month.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, will stress the
government's determination to combat inflation through the control of public
spending in letters to cabinet members which will contain proposals for
spending cuts in their departments.
Although it is clear that the current public expenditure round will be one
of the toughest on record, government officials made light yesterday of
pressure from some senior Conservative backbenchers for a total freeze on
public sector pay rises next year.
It was pointed out that many salary scales are directly linked to the
findings of independent pay review bodies which have yet to report for the
coming year.
Both the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and some senior
backbenchers are arguing, however, that Whitehall pay rises should be
trimmed to levels below the inflation rate in preference to capital spending
cuts.
About the only area in which there is any possibility of policy flexibility
is the housing sector. While the Treasury insists that no moves to bolster
the troubled housing market are planned, it is understood that contingency
measures are being prepared.
Away from Whitehall, pressure continued to mount for action to combat the
recession.
Two economic forecasting groups - Oxford Economic Forecasting and Midland
Montagu - predicted that national output will drop by about 1 per cent this
year in contrast with the Budget forecast of 1 per cent growth.
The CBI, the London Chamber of Commerce and the Institute of Purchasing and
Supply, which represents the UK's purchasing managers, warned of worsening
business conditions among man-ufacturers, and especially among small
companies.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, repeated the charge
that the government had misled the public into expecting a recovery and
called for measures to defend small businesses. 'When you are heading for a
precipice, there is nothing wrong with doing a U-turn,' he said.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Nissan UK receives demand for Pounds 237m unpaid tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue has issued estimated assessments for unpaid tax totalling
Pounds 237.6m against Nissan UK, the former British distributor of Nissan
vehicles controlled by Mr Octav Botnar.
The accounts of Nissan UK Holdings and its subsidiary NUK have been heavily
qualified by Kidsons Impey, the company's auditors, because of the potential
impact of the Inland Revenue investigation.
A warrant was issued at the end of January for the arrest of Mr Botnar, the
78-year-old NUK chairman, but he was abroad at the time and has not since
returned to the UK. He is believed to be living in Switzerland.
According to the company's latest annual report, just filed at Companies
House, NUK has lodged a formal appeal against the assessments and is
pursuing the appeal 'vigorously'.
The tax assessment, which was issued in October last year according to the
annual report, is based on Inland Revenue claims that NUK consistently
understated its profits in the period from October 1971 to July 1989.
Earlier this year Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing
director of NUK, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former NUK finance director, were
committed for trial at Southwark Crown Court on charges of corporation tax
fraud relating to the alleged profit manipulation.
Kidsons Impey claims that it has not received 'all the information and
explanations which we have requested' in connection with the Inland
Revenue's assessments and criminal charges.
The auditors state that they cannot form an opinion as to whether the NUKH
financial statements 'give a true and fair view of the state of affairs' of
the group, nor whether the statements fully disclose directors' transactions
and emoluments.
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern,
but Kidsons Impey says that this may 'not be appropriate'.
Adjustments may have to be made 'to reduce the value of assets to their
recoverable amount, to provide for any further liabilities which may arise
and to reclassify certain fixed assets as current assets'.
The annual report discloses that the company doubled its dividend payment in
1991 to Pounds 40m, of which Pounds 11.38m was transferred from reserves, as
profit after extraordinary items totalled only Pounds 28.62m. Mr Hunt, who
is the beneficial holder of a 10.63 per cent stake in NUKH, received a
dividend payment of Pounds 4.25m.
The main shareholder and 'ultimate parent undertaking' of NUKH with a 71.5
per cent stake is the Panama-incorporated European Motor Vehicles
Corporation, which is controlled by the trustees of a settlement made by Mr
Botnar in 1974.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Electronics suppliers blamed for EC price distortions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING suppliers of consumer electronics products are keeping prices
artificially high in some European countries by restricting cross-border
trade, according to two Europe-wide retailing associations.
One of the associations, Expert International, which represents 2,500 small
dealers in 14 European countries, plans to ask the European Commission's
competition directorate to take stronger action to ensure free movement of
products within the Community.
Mr Wim van den Toorn, Expert's managing director, says in a draft letter to
the Commission that surveys by his organisation have found that the prices
paid by its members for identical products vary by as much as 50 per cent
across Europe.
He alleges that an authorised dealer who tried to sell products to an
authorised dealer in another country 'would experience a negative attitude
from his supplier with practical consequences'.
The allegations come four months before the official deadline for the advent
of the single market, which is intended to eliminate all internal trade
barriers within the Community.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, has emphasised that
competition from unrestricted flows of unauthorised 'parallel' imports
within the Community is essential to the success of the single market. Such
imports should make wide price differentials unsustainable.
Mr van den Toorn said Expert and its members so far had not asked suppliers
to supply products for sale in other countries. However, he feared that if
dealers attempted to make parallel imports, suppliers would threaten to cut
off future supplies of products and spare parts.
Mr Marcel Vloemans, head of Euronics, another association representing 5,000
small electrical retailers in seven European countries, said his
organisation had tried to buy products in low-price countries for sale in
high-priced ones and had been unable to do so.
Mr van den Toorn said Expert had discovered wide and consistent geographic
disparities in trade prices for the consumer electronics brands stocked by
its dealers. These are Philips, Grundig, Sony and Panasonic, made by
Matsushita of Japan.
He said he had sought for more than two years to persuade these
manufacturers to narrow the price differentials, but had so far made little
progress. The companies said they were not aware of Mr van den Toorn's
approach.
Mr van den Toorn plans to ask the Commission to ensure that suppliers'
dealership agreements provide explicitly for unrestricted trade in products
between authorised dealers in different countries.
Though some agreements already contained such requirements, he said they
were not fully effective.
Several manufacturers said the differences in their trade prices were
smaller than alleged by Expert, and that they reflected local market
conditions.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Italy ends link between wage rises and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN AGREEMENT to end Italy's 47-year-old system linking wage rises to
inflation was yesterday hailed by Mr Giuliano Amato, the new prime minister,
as an important boost to the country's competitiveness.
Business leaders also welcomed the deal, which was agreed late on Friday
night at a meeting between ministers, trade unions and employers.
Mr Amato, speaking on state radio, appealed to investors to take heart from
the agreement and have confidence in the Italian economy and the lira.
'The most important point for the Italian economy and for those who watch it
from the international markets is that it must have a phase of tranquillity
(to allow us) to work, produce, and become competitive again.
'From this point of view, what is decisive in this accord is what it makes
possible for factories, companies, the industrial sector.'
The lira has been under severe pressure for six weeks, reflecting investors'
anxiety about economic prospects and fears of a possible devaluation.
Central bank intervention to support the currency has contributed to a fall
in reserves at the end of June to L79,383bn (Pounds 37bn) against L86,341bn
at the end of May and L109,442bn at the same time last year.
Abolishing the scala mobile, which has set inflation-linked wage rises for
most of Italy's workers since 1945, was a central part of Mr Amato's
attempts to reduce inflation from its current level of 5.5 per cent and
lower the huge budget deficit. The government has set an inflation target of
3.5 per cent for 1993 and just 2 per cent for the following year.
Under the deal, workers, instead of looking forward to automatic wage rises
in line with inflation, will get a small payment of L20,000 a month for 13
months, starting in January next year and lasting to the begining of 1994,
including the normal Christmas bonus. This is considerably less than rises
under the scala mobile.
In return, the government has pledged to freeze public sector tariffs and to
consider allowing workers to claim against tax for any unexpected future
rise in the cost of living.
Eliminating the system has been a long-standing aim of the country's
employers. Mr Cesare Romiti, chief executive of Fiat, the largest private
sector company, said the deal, which will be finalised in September,
represented a vital step to improving industry's competitiveness.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Personal View: The lessons of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAWRENCE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the developing country debt crisis behind us? The part of the crisis that
started in Mexico a decade ago, essentially involving commercial bank loans
to middle-income countries, is largely over.
To date, almost 40 per cent of private bank debt in highly indebted
countries has been covered by comprehensive debt reduction deals.
Arrangements under negotiation for Brazil and Argentina will raise that
figure to almost 70 per cent. A collapse of the international financial
system has been averted, and commercial banks have strengthened their
capital bases by building up reserves large enough to cover likely losses in
developing countries.
The two main ingredients of success were economic policy reform in the
debtor countries and co-ordinated action by the creditors. Official agencies
played an indispensable role in bringing together creditors and debtors, and
in helping to avoid divisions among creditors. The mix of effective debt
reduction and policy change to tackle fiscal imbalances and structural
impediments to growth has been a potent combination.
About Dollars 40bn (Pounds 21bn) flowed into, or back to, Latin America in
1991, especially to those nations, such as Mexico and Chile, that have gone
furthest in policy reform and commercial bank debt reduction. But it is too
soon for the world to turn its attention away from debt. A substantial
unresolved debt problem of low-income countries remains, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa. And there is a new debt problem looming with the Dollars
70bn held by the collapsing republics of the former Soviet Union.
Some 26 of the poorest debtor nations, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, have
received official support through concessional lending, debt restructuring
and forgiveness. This support is linked to domestic policy reform which
improves their economic prospects and debt-servicing capacity. Yet most of
them continue to have unsustainable debt burdens. On average, these
countries allocate a quarter of export earnings to debt service but only
cover half of their contractual obligations. In the last decade, their
incomes per head have fallen by 20 per cent to less than a dollar a day.
Growth has been recovering in countries from Ghana to Tanzania, but it will
clearly be a long haul. Troubled low-income debtors cannot grow out of their
debt problem, the core of which lies in official debt - that is,
government-to-government bilateral loans. For many countries, a resolution
will involve substantial debt forgiveness, frequently going beyond the 50
per cent reductions of recent agreements under the Paris Club of official
bilateral creditors.
Official sources will have to continue to be the main providers of finance
for low-income countries, whether in the form of new concessional inflows or
debt reduction.
Relative to income, the sums required may be large for the poor debtors, but
they are small for the rich nations. Doubling all net resource flows to
severely indebted low-income countries last year would add Dollars 16bn - or
1 per cent of what the world spends on defence each year - to the budgets of
the industrialised world. This is a small price to pay for reversing the
decline in health, education and living standards that would otherwise
guarantee a bleak future for more than half a billion people.
Finally, there is the newly emerging debt problem for the former Soviet
Union. The debt-servicing difficulties of the past year will not evaporate
overnight. It is also clear that the key to restoring creditworthiness lies
in a sustained programme of structural reforms. But these will take time to
yield benefits and need to be adequately financed.
Given that imports have already fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, further
import compression is not the answer. A combination of new (largely
official) money and debt relief from existing creditors is. To be effective,
this must reduce the uncertainty associated with the current short-term
roll-over arrangement. A key lesson of the last 10 years is that
comprehensive debt relief programmes require official leadership. This
lesson is just as applicable to the former Soviet Union.
The crisis in Latin America may have passed, but if we are not to wait
another 10 years for the resolution of the crises of sub-Saharan Africa and
the former Soviet Union, it is important to apply the lessons of the past.
Resolving a debt problem requires strong domestic policy change supported by
adequate debt relief, with governments of rich countries and official
agencies helping with both resources and action.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: Herald of market reform - Jacob Frenkel,
governor of the Bank of Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacob Frenkel is an Israeli who made a name for himself as an economist
on the international stage. But a year ago, he decided to trade in the world
for the more limited confines of home.
As economic counsellor and director of research at the International
Monetary Fund, Prof Frenkel could count himself as one of the world's most
influential economists. He rose from Jerusalem's Hebrew University to a
professorship of international economics at the University of Chicago and
later to the pinnacle of his profession at the IMF.
Then in mid-1991, Mr Frenkel accepted an offer from Mr Yitzhak Shamir, then
prime minister, to return home to serve as governor of the Bank of Israel,
the country's central bank. An important job, no doubt, but somewhat
parochial after the heady heights of the IMF, not to mention rather less
well paid. He now probably nets less than 20 per cent of the Dollars 150,000
tax-free salary he enjoyed in Washington.
Mr Frenkel, however, clearly seems to be enjoying the change. 'Very often
you feel happier driving your own little car than driving a huge Mercedes
that is rented,' he says. 'That's what it boils down to.'
His appointment did not meet with universal approval in Israel. A right-wing
cabinet minister objected to bringing in a man who had been abroad for 18
years and had not shared the military reserve duties of his fellow-citizens
during his exile. To be an emigrant from the Jewish state carries a stigma -
the Hebrew word for emigrant, yored, literally means 'one who is going
down'.
Mr Frenkel's arrival at the central bank was meant to be a signal of change
in Israel at a time when the country was experiencing a tide of mass
immigration from what was then still the Soviet Union. Although the flow has
sharply declined in recent months, it has to date brought some 400,000
newcomers. The national aim is to attract some 1m immigrants by 1995,
swelling the population by a fifth.
Mr Shamir's government said that in order to cope with the economic
challenges posed by immigration, market reforms had to be unleashed to
revitalise a long-stagnant economy. As Bank of Israel governor, Mr Frenkel
was billed as a key player in the reform process, with his statutory role as
chief economic adviser to the government.
It was clearly this challenge that attracted him to the job. Mr Frenkel
calls it 'one of the most exciting periods in Israel's economic history'.
But a year into his tenure, it seems legitimate to ask whether Israel's
economy really can be reformed and revived.
Mr Shamir's right-wing coalition government, which was defeated in last
month's general election, failed to match its economic promises. In fact,
huge state spending on housing, both in Israel and on Jewish settlements in
the occupied territories, and a stalled privatisation programme have
resulted in a big increase in the government's share of the economy, not a
decrease. Government spending rose from 50 per cent of GDP in 1988 to 68 per
cent in 1991.
Now the Labour party, under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, is back in power.
Historically, Labour, with its roots in east European collectivism, is the
party which put the country's socialist structures in place in the early
days of the state. Indeed, it is tempting to conclude that Zionism, with its
emphasis on the welfare of the Jewish people, is eternally at odds with the
notion of a market economy. But Jacob Frenkel sees no ideological reasons
why Labour cannot succeed where Mr Shamir failed.
'When you speak about the goals of Zionism, those are the goals of providing
a homeland for the Jewish people here in Israel - which is viable
economically. Those are general political objectives. When it comes to the
instruments by which those objectives are achieved, here it is a purely
professional question. It is not an ideological issue any more.'
Mr Frenkel makes no secret of his high hopes for Mr Rabin's new coalition,
which has espoused the need for reform. He says he is convinced of Labour's
commitment to a market economy, remarking that it may indeed take the Labour
party to grasp the nettle of recasting a system it set up in the first
place.
The task facing the new government is certainly great. Immigration has
pushed up unemployment to a record 11.5 per cent. Inflation, though falling,
is predicted to be at 10 per cent for the year. Exports have declined in the
past 18 months. As a result of immigration, the country has a surplus of
doctors, dentists, musicians, engineers and academics for whom there are no
opportunities. 'We now have mining engineers in a country with no mines,'
says Mr Frenkel.
Most of all, he argues, Israel needs time to cope with the economic problems
created by the influx of newcomers. 'Look at the unification of Germany,' he
says. 'Multiply (the difficulties) several times and you get the elements of
the task Israel has to face.'
Somehow Israel has to produce unprecedented, sustained growth that will
provide employment for the immigrants and prevent the state sinking under
the burden of providing for them. This year, GNP is expected to grow by
about 5 per cent, slightly less than last year. That looks impressive. But
when population growth is accounted for, and a non-recurring housing boom is
stripped out, even these levels of growth are well short of what is
required.
Mr Frenkel's prescription is for a radical programme of reform, investment
and cuts in social spending. Above all, he wants market reforms -
privatisation of the big state industrial holdings, lower taxation for
business, open trade policies, foreign exchange liberalisation and a
dismantling of the hold on labour markets held by the Labour-affiliated
Histadrut trade union federation. 'There is no way out from structural
reform,' he says.
Controversially, perhaps, Mr Frenkel also backs a drive by the government to
raise Dollars 20bn in foreign borrowing over the next five years. The key to
this is winning US loan guarantees for Dollars 10bn which Mr Rabin is hoping
to secure from President Bush later this month. Such borrowing will
dramatically reverse a downward trend in its foreign debt burden. In recent
years, Israel reduced the ratio of its foreign debt to GNP to 27 per cent
from about 80 per cent. Meanwhile, there is also a domestic debt burden of
more than 100 per cent of GNP.
A big government borrowing binge appears to be the exact opposite of the
reversal of the state's role in the economy that Israel is supposed to be
achieving. But Mr Frenkel defends the borrowing plan, saying it is essential
for the government to fund infrastructural investment.
'The logic of this is that the immigrants bring with them a lot of human
capital but no physical or financial capital. We have to make sure the
physical and financial capital grows at a very fast rate to complement the
human capital that is coming to us in a massive flow.'
Labour's plans to pump billions of shekels into projects such as
communications have the governor's support. 'Even I, who thinks that the
government should be smaller and should step out of the market place, think
this kind of investment is blessed because it does not crowd out private
investment, but rather crowds in private investment.'
It is here that the real test will come. Will Mr Rabin's Labour-led
government also carry out the structural reforms and the cuts in Israel's
big welfare programmes that Mr Frenkel says are essential for getting the
economy off the ground? As an insurance policy, the governor has worked
closely with US officials to frame economic conditions for the loan
guarantees designed to try to ensure such reform takes place.
But Mr Frenkel's faith in the new government is such that he says it does
not need outside prodding to do the job. 'The issue is not philosophical,
the issue is the political capacity to implement (the correct policies). The
jury is still out. But I am optimistic.'

FT  03 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO events this week will help to persuade dealers whether the tensions in
Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism are about to grow, writes James Blitz.
The first is the Bundesbank Council Meeting on Thursday. Only a few analysts
think the German central bank could raise the all-important Lombard rate
this time. The German discount rate was raised three weeks ago, and the
Bundesbank will need more time to see what impact this has had on M3 money
supply. Analysts were also comforted by comments last week from Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, that the Germans are concerned about
the impact that their policies are having on other European countries. A
Lombard rate rise would turn the calls for an EMS realignment in the UK and
Italy into a deafening clamour.
The markets will also look carefully at the latest opinion poll on the
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, to be held on September 20. In
the last poll, held on July 1, 37 per cent said that they would vote Yes to
Maastricht and 23 per cent said that they would vote No. However, the market
is expecting a considerable increase in the anti-Maastricht vote this time
in a poll which should be published on Wednesday in the weekly, Paris Match.
Tensions inside the ERM could relax if the dollar manages to break out of
its tight ranges against the D-Mark. Analysts believe that the dollar could
challenge DM1.50 if the National Association of Purchasing Managers index
shows a rise today. The big indicator of the week will be the non-farm
payroll figure for July, with the market expecting a rise of 109,000.

FT  03 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Major opts for incredibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sounds more and more like King Lear defying the storm. He now
intends, according to the latest leak, to make sterling the strongest
currency in the EMS, displacing the D-Mark. One must suppose that this
nonsense is supposed to send the speculators who have the pound on the floor
rushing for cover, and so permit a cut in interest rates, rather than make
himself look silly; but it does not matter much. He still looks silly.
Currencies, as this column pointed out last week, are not effectively
defended by huffing and bluffing. The markets have grown doubtful about the
British commitment to its present EMS parity. They marked sterling down when
Mr Major attempted to raise the stakes by claiming that if there were a
realignment, sterling would remain pegged to the D-Mark. A reasonable man
might read a warning here; but not Mr Major.
How does he suppose dealers will receive this attempt to steal Mr
Beregevoy's rather tattered suit of clothes - and in broad daylight? The
charitable will assume that the leak is ill-informed; those who believe it
will conclude that the prime minister is getting desperate, as well he might
after the battering of the last week.
In terms of economics, the project is laughable. France has succeeded, after
some years of pain, in meeting every convergence criterion, and in making
the franc credibly strong. Inflation is below German levels, the fiscal and
foreign balances are sound, and the economy is still achieving some sort of
growth. Despite all this, the markets demand a modest interest premium on
the franc. They have very long memories.
In the British case, they need no memories at all. Inflation may be dipping
into the Maastricht range, thanks to the most stubborn recession for 60
years; but in almost every other respect, one would think that things could
hardly be worse - until the next official figures show that they are indeed
worse. The foreign and fiscal deficits are unsustainably high, hopes of even
a feeble recovery have been deferred for another year; and above all, even
the most respectable business leaders are openly discussing devaluation.
Seen from overseas, this is a simple case of 'I told you so'. The DM2.95
rate was regarded as implausible from the start. I was still in Washington
when Britain's decision to join the EMS was announced. It was a some days
before I stopped getting calls from friends in the Fed, the German Embassy
and other parts of the international policy community. Many of the callers
started with the same words: 'Has your government gone mad, or what?'
Perhaps this accounts for my own persistent doubts.
It is different at home, of course. It is only in the last few days that
high-level doubts about the entire strategy have come into the open; and
these doubts will percolate down only slowly. Popular opinion is still
astonishingly supportive of the hair-shirt strategy, and this is Mr Major's
last remaining high card. Mr Beregevoy must know that his chances of
remaining prime minister beyond next March are almost invisible, but Mr
Major has some years to go.
Political stability does help to reassure markets, but only up to a point.
There has been no financial panic at the apparent internal collapse of the
Bush administration in the US, and only a modest tremor so far at the
prospect that French voters may get their revenge on an unpopular government
by voting down the Maastricht treaty.
The fact is that the markets are never as credulous as politicians hope.
They are therefore much calmer than the politicians about the possibility of
all their cherished plans going wrong. They have begun for some time now to
discount an EMS realignment, and indeed a modest sterling adjustment.
They will now edge towards discounting something worse, and something
sooner. It will only look like a crisis when they think the change will come
in a matter of weeks, not months. Not just yet, anyway. Until then
discretion, not bluffing, is the better part of valour.

FT  03 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Banks hungry for capital as Basle
deadline nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS ARE still hungry for capital, as the deadline for meeting Basle
capital adequacy ratios at the start of next year approaches.
Investment bankers are responding by creating some ingenious ways of
structuring debt offerings so that they will meet investors' rather picky
appetites and satisfy regulators.
While many US banks have taken advantage of the strong stock and credit
market conditions prevailing for most of this year to raise fresh capital,
their European counterparts have generally been slower to move.
Consequently, the next wave of bank capital financing is likely to be
concentrated among European - and perhaps Japanese - banks.
Last week four financial institutions - JP Morgan of the US, Credit Local
and Societe Generale of France, and Germany's Landeskreditbank, - raised
Dollars 700m of subordinated floating-rate notes (FRNs) in the Eurobond
market, using an unusual 'collar' structure, incorporating minimum and
maximum interest rate levels. The notes qualify as lower tier 2 capital
under Basle capital adequacy rules.
At this point in the US interest cycle, with US rates at historical lows -
money market rates are around 3 1/2 per cent - investors are less keen to
lock in fixed-rate returns, and an initially higher coupon appears
attractive.
Kidder Peabody, which is active in the secondary floating-rate note market,
had noted a strong appetite among Swiss investors for outstanding bank FRNs
with the same structure. A spate of such issues, then known as mini-max
floaters, was launched in 1985, but have since been a virtually forgotten
casualty of the fall-out from the collapse of the perpetual FRN market in
1986.
Some of the bankers who remember the panic-selling of the crashing
floating-rate note market remain sceptical about these instruments.
A floating-rate note incorporating an interest rate cap and floor is
structured in this way: effectively, the issuer buys a cap from the
investor, and then sells a cap in the market to hedge that position. The
issuer effectively sells a floor to the investor and hedges that position by
buying one in the wholesale market. However, the issuer benefits from the
spread between the wholesale market and the terms offered to the FRN
investor.
'Investors are not getting fair value for the cap, but they do not care,
because they are being offered a high initial coupon to compensate,'
explained one banker.
Consequently, the market for such paper is limited to specific pockets of
demand. The Dollars 700m of paper launched so far has already stretched that
demand, according to some underwriters. While the Dollars 200m JP Morgan
deal launched by Kidder Peabody met strong demand due to the rarity of the
name, later deals met a less favourable reception. The pocket of Swiss
demand was only accessible to credits of double-A and above. European
markets are effectively closed to lesser credits, which will have to find
other sources of capital.
Most likely, they will turn to the US, where the market in dated
subordinated fixed-rate debt has been expanding. However, the heavy supply
of paper in the US market has caused yield spreads over US Treasuries to
widen by about 20 basis points in the last month.
The US market is virtually the only source of tier 1 capital, apart from
straightforward equity financing. The US market in preferred stock has been
active recently. European banks such as France's Banque Indosuez and Spain's
Banesto have raised preferred stock, and others are set to follow.
Bankers said investors were buying preferred shares which offer a premium
over rates available on dated bonds sufficient to repay principal after 17
to 20 years. Because of the steep shape of the US yield curve, preferred
shares are also attractive to borrowers.
A further seven borrowers have added D-Mark options to their medium-term
note (MTN) programmes. From today, borrowers can issue D-Mark medium-term
notes under multi-currency programmes, following a liberalisation of rules
announced a month ago by the German Bundesbank.
Previously, D-Mark MTNs could only be issued under a separate programme,
which involved substantial costs including legal and listing fees. Bankers
said the cost of adding a D-Mark option to an existing programme amounted to
around Dollars 2,000. A D-Mark MTN programme would cost over Dollars 100,000
to set up.
The seven borrowers are: Norway's Export Finance, Finnish Export Credit,
Halifax Building Society, Woolwich Building Society, Monte dei Paschi di
Siena, the Italian bank, GMAC Europe, the European finance arm of General
Motors of the US, and Compagnie Bancaire, the French financial services
group.
Merrill Lynch Bank in Germany is acting as arranger of all these D-Mark
options. Halifax has abandoned its planned D-Mark MTN programme, which had
run into technical problems prior to the liberalisation.
Another 10 borrowers are to add similar options to their programmes this
week, in addition to Abbey National and Nationwide Building Society, which
did so earlier. On Friday, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development signed the first new programme to incorporate a D-Mark option.
The signing of the Ecu1bn programme was delayed to allow the D-Mark option
to be included.
A NUMBER of European banks are considering raising capital in the US using
an innovative structure which offers greater flexibility, writes Tracy
Corrigan.
Barclays Bank, National Westminster Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and
Sweden's S-E Banken were among the banks looking at the structure,
investment bankers said. With little opportunity to raise capital in Europe,
many European banks are turning to the more receptive US market.
The structure would allow banks to raise upper tier 2 capital, with the
option later to convert it into tier 1 capital. Certain proportions of both
types of capital must be held by banks to meet the Basle capital adequacy
standards, which come into force at the start of next year. Although UK
banks are among the best capitalised, most banks are seeking means of
raising increasingly scarce capital.
Under the structure, a bank issues undated subordinated debt, which
qualifies as upper tier 2 capital. But this can be exchanged, at the option
of the issuer, into preferred stock, which qualifies as tier 1 capital. The
issuer would pay a premium to investors for the conversion. It is based on a
recent offering by Bankers Trust.

FT  03 AUG 92 / European Bonds: Doubts about Maastricht Treaty trouble the
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S government bond markets have had a terrible summer, tumbling to the
bottom of the performance tables in June and July. Concern about the future
of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union, and worries that
the Bundesbank intends to keep German interest rates high for the rest of
this year have troubled the markets in recent weeks, and these factors are
likely to dominate the bond markets in the foreseeable future.
The Italian, Ecu, Spanish and French markets were the worst performers in
July with losses of 3.53 per cent, 2.36 per cent, 1.98 per cent and 1.23 per
cent respectively in local currency terms, according to Kemper Investment
Management. Meanwhile, the dollar bloc and Japan gave the best returns in
local currency terms, helped by lower interest rates. The Canadian
government bond market gained 4.87 per cent, followed by Australia (3.87 per
cent), New Zealand (3.6 per cent), US (2.78 per cent) and Japan (2.67 per
cent).
The European markets - particularly the high-yielding ones - were thrown
into chaos after Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty. Now, they are
focusing on the French referendum on September 20.
Last week, French bonds tumbled on fears that the next opinion polls would
show growing disenchantment with European economic and monetary union.
Unemployment continues to rise, doing little for the popularity of the
government, which is keen to secure a yes vote.
A French vote against Maastricht would not help the Italian and Spanish
governments to stick to their convergence policies, although Italy is
preoccupied with its own political problems. The resignation of the Italian
foreign minister last week appeared to undermine the credibility of the
month-old government and came as a shock to the Italian government bond
market - which suffered a sharp setback.

FT  03 AUG 92 / German Bonds: Selling again lifts average yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT COULD be that now is a very good time to buy German bunds.
After all, it may be that the Bundesbank's move to increase the discount
rate just over a fortnight ago - by 0.75 of a percentage point to 8.75 per
cent - represented the high point in the Bundesbank's battle against
inflation.
Following good inflation data last week, which should mean that July's
annual figure falls to 3.3 per cent, the question is: are the effects of the
Bundesbank's policies now being felt?
All that is needed, if this is the case, is a couple of months of declining
growth in M3 money supply. Then the bank will be free to start cutting rates
again . . . and bund yields will tumble.
Unfortunately for the optimists, M3 grew at an annualised 8.7 per cent in
June and a revised 8.8 per cent in May - inconveniently far from the
Bundesbank's target of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Money supply growth was
cited as the main reason for the interest rate rise on July 16, and the
target seems unlikely to be dropped in spite of attempts to discredit the
bank's logic in relying on such an indicator.
When rates were increased investors sold decisively, and they sold again
last week when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president commented that
there was no imminent prospect of an interest rate cut.
Since July 16, average bund yields have climbed from 8.32 per cent to just
short of 8.4 per cent. The yield on the 10-year-benchmark bund has climbed
to 8.15 per cent, up from about 8 per over the last month.
This contrasts markedly with investors' attitudes to the Bundesbank's
December rate increase. This prompted heavy buying, with average yields
tumbling to 7.97 per cent by the third week of January, compared with 8.6
per cent at the end of November.
Then, investors believed interest rates had peaked. In the event, they had
not - at least not in the case of the discount rate. Now, investors seem
less willing to take risks unsupported by evidence of a change in policy.
This is perhaps not surprising, given the attractions of the shorter end of
the yield curve: why suffer the opportunity cost of investing in
10-year-bunds when the return on bunds with one-year maturity is 9.19 per
cent?
Moreover, the 3.3 per cent annual inflation figure expected for July is
attributable less to a fall in underlying inflationary pressures than to
'one-off' factors: the impact of the higher D-Mark on fuel prices; the
removal of the effect of last year's energy tax from the comparable figures,
and sharply lower prices for fruit and vegetables as a result of a bumper
crop this year.
Thus this figure alone is not going to induce a relaxation of policy,
especially if the money supply figures do not show a dramatic improvement.
The best many investors are hoping for this year is no change in monetary
policy. It remains possible that the Lombard rate will also have to be
increased during the course of the next few months.

FT  03 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Eyes focus on July unemployment figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL eyes will be focused on the July unemployment figures due on Friday,
amid signs that the number of non-farm jobs created last month might have
been more than 100,000.
This would be a significant reversal on the June loss of 117,000 jobs, which
was taken as a sign of the weakness of the US recovery, pleasing the bond
market and contributing to the logic behind the last discount rate cut by
the Federal Reserve.
The jobs data this Friday could dampen the bond market's recent bullish
mood, just as any sign of a more positive trend in the US economy is
negative for bond investors.
On the other hand, a growing number of players in the Treasury market would
probably agree that inflation is no longer an immediate concern, the US
economy seems more stagnant than recovering and the lack of consumer
confidence will continue to weaken the recovery for some months to come.
It was the very weakness of consumer confidence last Tuesday that caused the
yield curve - the graphic depiction of interest rates on various maturities
ranging from short-term notes to the 30-year benchmark bond - to flatten for
the first time in months.
Another factor was a second-quarter 1.4 per cent growth rate for gross
domestic product, down from 2.9 per cent in the first three months of 1992.
This number told the US economic story quite well.
The 11.6 point drop in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index
caused the Treasury market to stage quite a rally on Tuesday, marking the
30-year paper a point higher and sending the yield down to 7.43 per cent. On
Wednesday the yield even briefly touched a very low 7.35 per cent.
Profit-taking and uncertainty about the next round of statistics took some
of the gloss off the rally.
By Friday evening the 30-year bond had eased  13/32 on the day, but still up
enough on the week to produce a yield of 7.455 per cent, down from 7.56 per
cent a week earlier.
While some speculate that the 30-year yield could drop below 7 per cent if
the Fed goes ahead with another interest rate cut in early September, the
analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ) say the market is assuming
the economy to be far weaker than it really is.
DLJ predicts the yield will end 1992 at just below 8 per cent, which assumes
the US recovery will strengthen during the third and fourth quarters.
Other statistics to be watched this week are today's national purchasing
managers' index, which could rise to 56 from 52.8 in June; and the index of
leading economic indicators which is due out tomorrow, and could be down by
0.3 per cent.

FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Gilts: Putting the argument for underfunding the PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government is in a predicament. Because of its commitments to
the European exchange rate mechanism it cannot cut base rates.
At the same time, it has ruled out fiscal measures to stimulate the economy
by pledging to rein in public spending. Meanwhile, calls from industrial
leaders for the government to do something about the long recession are
getting louder.
So what can the government do to appease its critics, other than to sit
tight until the economic cycle takes its course? One avenue, about which
there has been much speculation recently, would be to under-fund the public
sector borrowing requirement deliberately.
This would mean breaking with the full-fund rule whereby the authorities are
obliged to fund the net total of maturing debt, the PSBR, and any underlying
increase in the foreign exchange reserves by sales of debt outside the
banking and building societies sectors.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Montagu, argued recently that
under-funding would stimulate the economy by leading to lower long rates of
interest and higher equity prices, thereby raising wealth levels and
reducing the cost of capital to companies. It would automatically imply an
increase in the rate of growth of the money supply.
Speculation that the authorities might choose to follow this route has been
gathering strength if only because a number of economists, such as Mr
Bootle, have argued in its favour. Furthermore, the Bank of England has not
cut the prices of a tap stock that has been sitting on its books for three
weeks, giving the impression it is in no hurry to sell.
Because of this, attention this week will focus on the possible announcement
of a gilts auction to be held on August 26 - the last Wednesday of the
month.
The Bank's unofficial auction schedule means that the market expects an
auction roughly every two months. If there is no announcement then some will
jump to the conclusion that the authorities have decided to under-fund.
This could be a wrong conclusion. The Bank is still ahead of its schedule.
Last week's final monetary figures showed that net official gilt sales in
the year to June were Pounds 10.3bn. It could therefore afford to skip an
auction in the quiet month of August. But would a decision by the
authorities to underfund have the desired effect of easing monetary
conditions?
'The effect might be large, or it might be small, but it would surely be in
the right direction,' says Mr Bootle.
Mr Nigel Richardson, at Warburg Securities argues that the move could have a
negative effect.
'A decision to underfund would not result unambiguously in a lower level of
yields. It might indicate to some people that the Bank of England had
decided there was not enough institutional demand for gilts or, more
significantly, it might place a question mark over the long-term direction
of policy.
'If the government is desperate enough to consider easing through
underfunding, it might be prepared to consider rate cuts or a realignment
within the ERM,' he said.
Many analysts therefore believe the Bank will go ahead with the auction
anyway and are wondering instead, what kind of stock will be issued.
The Bank will probably sell stock into areas where it perceives demand to be
strong - namely longer dated stock for the domestic market.
In spite of better-than-expected overseas sales of gilts in June, revealed
in the Bank's final monetary figures last week, overseas demand appears to
have weakened in July.
Sterling weakness and fears that French voters may reject the Maastricht
Treaty in a referendum on September 20 have made overseas investors nervous.
Last week, traders were saying that anxiety about whether or not Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, could withstand pressure from industry and from
within his own Conservative Party to devalue sterling was adding to jitters.

NOVA, the Alberta natural gas transporter and petro-chemical producer, is
emerging quickly from its 1989-91 over-expansion problems, writes Robert
Gibbens.
Second-quarter net profits were CDollars 41m (USDollars 34.10m) or 10 cents
a share, a turnround from losses of CDollars 6m or 4 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues fell to CDollars 750m from CDollars 778m.
First-half net profits rose to CDollars 73m or 18 cents a share, from
CDollars 32m or 8 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn, down from Dollars
1.6bn.
*****
Export Development Bank (BRE) of Poland has reported that the public sale of
47.5 per cent of its shares, which valued the group at Dollars 23m, and
ended last week, was oversubscribed, Christopher Bobinski writes from
Warsaw.
BRE said 2 per cent of its equity has been allocated to Girocredit Bank of
Austria. Other leading shareholders included two Polish private companies,
Realbud, a construction group, and Galtex, a food and textiles exporter and
retailer, with 5 per cent each.
*****
Elders Pastoral, New Zealand's second-biggest livestock group, has been sold
to its managers, by Fosters' Brewing, its former Australian owner, writes
Terry Hall from Wellington.
The price was not disclosed but assets of NZDollars 20m (USDollars 10.9m)
were transferred.
Mr Trevor Kamins, managing director, said the company had returned to
profitability after reducing losses over the past year.
*****
Petro-Canada, the country's second-biggest integrated oil company which was
partially privatised in 1991, earned net profits of CDollars 38m or 18 cents
a share in the first half, against losses of CDollars 149m or 49 cents a
year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.3bn, against CDollars 2.5bn, writes
Robert Gibbens.
The result benefited from accounting changes, but the company attributed the
turnround to reduced overheads.

SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the largest private enterprise in the Philippines,
has announced a 3 per cent increase in its first-half net income to 1.56bn
pesos (Dollars 63.6m).
Consolidated net sales totalled 28.8bn pesos, up 15 per cent from the same
period last year. Before extraordinary expenses arising mainly from its
employee-separation programme, consolidated net income was up 42 per cent at
1.67bn pesos,
San Miguel has been cutting its labour force in unprofitable activities,
particularly in some of its packaging lines. About 2,000 of its 36,000
employees are expected to be affected by the retrenchment.
The company said sales for the full year could be about 15 per cent higher
than last year, in spite of government talk of raising taxes on beer and
soft drinks, San Miguel's main product lines which account for about 60 per
cent of annual turnover.
Successive increases in the ad valorem tax on beer since late 1990, which
hit 60 per cent at the beginning of 1991, hurt San Miguel sales.
'We have not fully recovered from the volume declines in sales since then,'
the company said.

<TEXT>
SHOWA SHELL Sekiyu, the leading Japanese oil refiner and distributor
affiliated with Royal Dutch Shell, suffered a fall in non-consolidated sales
and profits for the first half to June, due to falling crude oil prices and
higher costs.
Pre-tax profits slid 27 per cent to Y18.7bn (Dollars 149.6m) on a 4.3 per
cent fall in sales to Y764.8bn. Operating profits declined 33.3 per cent to
Y25.8bn and after-tax profits slid 21.6 per cent to Y10.8bn.
Showa Shell blamed the decline on weak crude oil prices, higher distribution
costs, and lower profit margins due to the economic downturn in Japan.
Non-operating losses were down by 45.6 per cent at Y7.1bn. Interest and
dividends received fell 52 per cent to Y3.1bn and foreign exchange losses
totalled Y2bn, but a 47.7 per cent decline in interest paid to Y9bn helped
cut losses at the non-operating level.
For the full year, Showa Shell forecasts a 14.7 per cent fall in
non-consolidated taxable profits to Y37bn.
Shell Canada is trimming its capital and exploration budget this year by
about 12 per cent to CDollars 745m (USDollars 620.8m) in response to
continuing problems in its upstream and downstream businesses, writes Robert
Gibbens.
First-half net losses were CDollars 7m or 6 cents a share, against losses of
CDollars 95m or 84 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.04bn,
down from CDollars 2.45bn. But changes in inventory accounting began on
January 1 and the latest losses would have been CDollars 17m or 15 cents a
share.
Upstream operations remained modestly profitable, under pressure from lower
natural gas and sulphur prices. Oil prices improved in the second quarter.
The company said downstream margins continued under severe pressure and
restructuring of the loss-making oil products division were continuing.
Chemicals should break even in the second half.

DYNO INDUSTRIER, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in
chemicals, has reported flat first-half pre-tax profits of NKr154m, (Dollars
26.4m) and warned of little increase in sales in the second six months.
Operating profits edged ahead in the first half to NKr254m from NKr249m a
year earlier, on turnover of NKr3.83bn, against NKr3.93bn.
The company warned that it was unlikely that markets for Dyno's main
products would improve significantly during the remainder of the year.
Improved profits had to be achieved through restructuring and
rationalisation measures.
Mr Tom Jebsen, executive, said Dyno was in the middle of a restructuring
programme which had seen the closure of an explosives plant in the US and
three plastics plants in Scandinavia. Work was under way to close a domestic
powder resins production plant.
Group operating expenses in the first six months of this year were reduced
by NKr100m to NKr3.36bn.
Group second-quarter pre-tax profit fell by NKr17m to NKr107m. Operating
profit declined by NKr17m to NKr134m while revenue slid to NKr1.95bn from
NKr2.08bn.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANDERS, the Wolverhampton-based paint, ink and property group, yesterday
forecast annual profits of at least Pounds 8.2m and a 20 per cent rise in
the dividend as part of its defence against the Pounds 89m bid by rival
paints group Kalon.
The forecast, which compares with 1991 profits of Pounds 6m, accompanied
interim results showing a 66 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
4.1m.
The interim dividend, payable on November 9, is being raised 30 per cent to
2.6p which, with the forecast final of 5.8p, makes an 8.4p (7p) total.
Mr Roy Amos, chairman, said the interim rise showed 'the underlying strength
of Manders' businesses even in the midst of a recession.' The group refused
to specify the contribution from Windeck, the paint manufacturer purchased
for Pounds 5.66m in December.
Mr Mike Hennesy, managing director of Kalon, believed the underlying
performance without Windeck was disappointing.
Mr Roger Akers, Manders' chief executive, said the profits rise was due to
acquisitions and organic growth. However, it also reflected the sale of the
loss-making tile distribution business in March.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 56.1m.
Earnings improved from 5.26p to 7.74p.
Mr Akers was scornful of Kalon's 8-for-3 offer, valuing Manders shares at
241p. He compared the 18 per cent fall in Kalon's share price since the
offer was launched in June with the 10.6 per cent decline in the FTA
All-Share. 'At this level, it is far too cheap,' he said. Kalon's shares
closed steady on Friday at 90.5p, while Manders rose 10p to 239p.

YEOMAN Investment Trust has announced plans for a restructuring which will
extend the life of the trust until 1999.
The trust was due to be wound up this year, after having been converted into
a split capital trust in 1986.
Capital shareholders will be offered the chance to convert their shares into
new zero dividend preference shares at liquidation asset value (the value
they would have received has the trust been wound up). The liquidation asset
value will be set on August 18.
The new zero dividend shares will entitle holders to receive an annual gross
redemption yield of 10 per cent over the lifetime of the trust.
Some capital shareholders may want to realise their holdings for cash.
Accordingly Yeoman has agreed to find purchasers for the new zero dividend
shares, up to a total of Pounds 23.5m. Yeoman has also agreed to place 1m
zero dividend shares.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES of Pounds 45,042 before tax were announced by the African Lakes
Corporation for the half year to March 31.
The group, which has interests in motor trading, agriculture, mining,
engineering and computer supplies, achieved profits of Pounds 81,322 last
time.
Although turnover improved to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 19.7m) profit margins
were substantially reduced. Losses per share emerged at 5.01p (1.49p).

FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Company News: S&amp;P may downgrade ICI debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of long-term debt
has been placed under review for possible downgrade by Standard &amp; Poor's,
the US rating agency, following Thursday's announcement that the group may
be divided into two separate public companies.
Moody's, the other leading US rating agency, said it is expanding its review
of the company's debt to include the rating implications of the split.
Moody's placed ICI's debt under review for possible downgrade on July 15,
prompted by increasing evidence of a slower pace of recovery in
profitability.
ICI's debt is currently rated AA- by S&amp;P and AA3 by Moody's.
Although the future capital structures of the two companies has not been
determined, S&amp;P expected 'a large portion of existing debt' to remain at
ICI, which would then consist of the less profitable and more cyclical
industrial chemical operations.

FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Nissan UK counts the mounting costs of
legal battle - NUK to concentrate on property after loss of car franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN UK Holdings, the former British distributor of Nissan vehicles
controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 65.4m in
the year to end-July 1991, a small decline from Pounds 68m in the previous
year.
Turnover dropped by 26.5 per cent to Pounds 599.4m but profits were
maintained by a substantial jump in income from parts and accessories
operations. Some 22 per cent of Nissan UK profit came from property and
investment income.
Nissan UK lost its exclusive, lucrative franchise to import and distribute
Nissan vehicles with effect from the start of 1992, following a long
conflict with Nissan Motor, the Japanese car maker.
The company, previously the most profitable independent vehicle
importer/distributor in the UK, will continue as 'a property investment
company' once it has disposed of its remaining vehicle stocks, says the NUKH
annual report.
It is facing rapidly mounting costs as a result of the array of legal
battles that are being fought by the Botnar-controlled companies both
against Nissan Motor and against the Inland Revenue, which staged its
largest ever corporate raid against NUK last year.
The NUKH accounts disclose net extraordinary charges of Pounds 8.67m. The
charge for legal fees arising from the Inland Revenue investigation totals
Pounds 3.63m, while legal fees and other costs arising from the loss of the
Nissan franchise total Pounds 5.04m.
Last month the High Court ruled that it must also pay damages of Pounds
804,000 for breach of contract and the wrongful dismissal of a former Nissan
UK assistant managing director.
NUK, itself, is seeking damages of several hundred million pounds from
Nissan Motor for the loss of the franchise in arbitration proceedings
currently under way in Tokyo.
In the NUKH annual report the company accepts, however, that 'the likely
amounts receivable are impossible to quantify'.
NUK is also pursuing a claim for Pounds 6m against Nissan Motor in the
British courts for what it alleges are 'unpaid advertising contributions'.
Mr Botnar, who has remained outside the UK since January following the
issuing of a warrant for his arrest by the Inland Revenue - he is presently
believed to be living in Switzerland - received a salary, excluding pension
contributions, of Pounds 353,000 last year from NUKH. In addition he
received Pounds 130,000 from Automotive Financial Group Holdings, the
related motor dealer group of which he is also chairman.
NUKH's 'ultimate parent undertaking' with a stake of 71.52 per cent is the
Panama-registered European Motor Vehicles Corporation. It is controlled by
the trustees of a settlement made by Mr Botnar in 1974, which also control
GF International Finance and Investments, the 'ultimate parent undertaking'
of AFGH, which is incorporated in the Bahamas.
Combined, the Botnar-controlled companies NUKH and AFGH achieved a total
pre-tax profit in 1991 of Pounds 130.1m (Pounds 142.6m) on a turnover of
Pounds 1.44bn (Pounds 1.76bn). Total dividend payments were tripled to
Pounds 60m (Pounds 20m) with Mr Michael Hunt, NUK deputy chairman and
assistant managing director, receiving a total of Pounds 6.38m as a result
of his 10.63 per cent beneficial holding in both companies.
The NUKH annual report indicates that the group's finances have been
radically restructured since the end of the last financial year following
the loss of the Nissan franchise.
In May this year the fixed and floating charges on the group's assets, which
had provided security for both its bank borrowings and the bank borrowings
of other related companies totalling Pounds 330.4m, were released.
Mr Botnar has reduced the companies' dependence on bank finance. Automotive
Financial Services, the finance arm of the group of companies controlled by
Mr Botnar and a subsidiary of AFGH, has replaced a 'significant' part of its
banking facilities.
It has gained medium term funding by securitising a large part of its hire
purchase receivables through a Pounds 220m issue of floating rate notes
through a newly-created subsidiary, Auto Funding.
NUKH remains a major contributor to charities with donations totalling
Pounds 2.77m in 1991. It is committed to paying Pounds 8m towards building a
new wing for the Great Ormond Street children's hospital in London.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VOLUNTEERING to go before the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is like
offering to stand before a firing squad playing Russian roulette. Anyone who
survives would not relish repeating the experience.
The fact that British Gas has brought this fate on itself was seen as a
reflection of the extent to which relations between it and its regulator
have broken down.
A vital part of a company's strategy or an industry's whole basis of
operation can depend on a few hours' grilling by a team of highly expert
interrogators at their offices in Carey Street, the site in London of the
old bankruptcy court.
They can ask anything, and there is little guidance on which aspect of a
takeover, merger or suspected monopoly position they will pick on.
The commission takes a different attitude to people giving evidence to an
inquiry, when they are more likely to listen politely.
One who has been through the experience is Mr Tim Clement-Jones, company
secretary of Kingfisher, the retail group which bid Pounds 568m for rival
Dixons in December 1989. The bid was referred to the MMC in January and the
commission was given three months to report. Eventually the bid was blocked.
Mr Clement-Jones says that being summoned before the tribunal, whose members
sit round a semi-circular table, gives 'a feeling of corporate nakedness
that can best be compared to appearing before the House Unamerican
Activities Committee. It is a very thorough process'.
Others who have suffered the same fate say it is like having an oral
examination on a thesis.
After producing evidence inches thick, involving hundreds of hours of senior
management time, the commission's members can ask questions on any point.
The wise rehearse well beforehand.
Mr Clement-Jones' tip is to provide lots of evidence based on market
research. 'They seem to be very influenced by market research,' he says.
Lawyers can help produce the evidence, but when it comes to the meeting it
is the directors of the company themselves who the commission's members want
to see. If they are not satisfied after the first meeting they can recall
their victims for further questioning.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Simmering row comes into the open: Review of British Gas
could lead to a radical shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radical shake-up in the UK gas market may follow the decision by Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to ask the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to conduct a comprehensive review.
Meanwhile, British Gas shareholders, employees, customers, and competitors
may face more than a year of uncertainty, which could bring the share price
under pressure and delay development of competition.
The utility has long complained that sometimes conflicting demands from the
industry regulator Ofgas, the Office of Fair Trading, and the department of
energy, was making it impossible to plan effectively.
British Gas came close to calling in the MMC last year when it was forced by
Ofgas to submit to a tough price-capping formula soon after agreeing to OFT
demands to halve its share of the industrial gas market and hive off its
pipeline and storage business.
British Gas felt the pressure those agreements would put on future earnings
meant it should be allowed to earn a reasonable rate of return on its
pipeline business. It was failure to reach even a compromise agreement on
this with Ofgas that led to the MMC being called in.
Observers suggest the promotion of Mr Cedric Brown to chief executive was
also an important factor. While Mr Brown said on his appointment he wanted
to 'build bridges' with the regulator, he is known to be combative and
uncompromising.
After three meetings with Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the
two concluded agreement was impossible.
'In fairness, Sir James McKinnon was caught between the devil and the deep
blue sea,' a British Gas source said yesterday. 'On one hand he had the
Major Energy Users Council asking him to keep the rate of return at the
present 4.5 per cent to keep prices down. On the other, he had independent
suppliers who want to build their own pipelines asking for an even higher
rate of return than British Gas.'
Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said in spite of the inevitable
period of uncertainty, he broadly welcomed the MMC inquiry which would be
'an opportunity to go over the whole field and establish a stable regime for
some years.'
'I don't think one should regard it as a failure of the (regulatory) system.
The MMC is part of the system, it is planned for, and I think the public
will benefit from references like this from time to time.'
However, if regulatory changes made medium and long-term planning difficult
for British Gas, the MMC investigation will make it virtually impossible.
Aside from uncertainty about the findings, the review will put heavy demands
on management time.
Planned changes may have to be put on ice. A thousand British Gas workers
are already refusing to move from London to Solihull as part of a management
shake-up because of fears of further restructuring.
The share price, too, could languish or begin a long slide.
The City of London has reacted positively to rumours of voluntary
restructuring by British Gas. But the length and unpredictability of an MMC
inquiry is likely to have the opposite effect.
'I think people are inevitably going to start dumping the shares,' one
analyst said yesterday. 'Even though the MMC report could eventually bring
good news, it will be a long time to wait.'
The Department of Trade and Industry said on Friday the MMC was required to
report within nine months, but observers felt an extension may be necessary.
The last MMC inquiry into the industrial gas market - with a narrower scope
than the coming review - began in November 1987 but did not report until
October 1988. Even if the MMC reports within nine months, the government
will need time to assess its findings.
Industry observers believe the government is committed to radical
restructuring of the gas market, and would impose sweeping changes if the
MMC report supported these.
It has already attempted to accelerate competition. Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, moved quickly after the Conservatives' general election victory to
announce that British Gas's monopoly threshold would be lowered from 25,000
therms a year to 2,500 therms a year. This would allow 200,000 smaller
commercial and industrial consumers, and bodies such as schools and local
authorities, to receive gas from independent suppliers.
Mr Eggar said he would consider opening the household market to competition
in May next year - three years earlier than expected.
More recently, at a conference of the Major Energy Users Council in London,
a DTI official outlined a radical programme of possible changes in the gas
market, including developing a spot market for gas trading, promoting
competition in transportation and storage and opening the market to more
imports from Europe.
Mr Jonathan Stern, a gas consultant and industry researcher, suggests that
at the least, the MMC will modify arrangements to introduce competition into
the market. It may propose a further review of the progress of competition
after, say, five years, with the threat of breaking up British Gas then if
progress has been too slow.
'But there is a more than 50-50 chance it will recommend the immediate
break-up of the company,' Mr Stern added.
The MMC could recommend British Gas hive off both its regional supply
businesses and pipeline arm. The government might then use competition laws
to persuade British Gas to sell these businesses.
There are dangers with such an approach. One is that supply companies in
Scotland and eastern England could charge less for gas because of lower
transportation charges, while those further from North Sea terminals would
have to charge customers more. Protests from customers about such moves
could increase the political controversy which already exists over gas
supply.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Economics Notebook: Powerhouse of the UK runs out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Britain's imbalanced regional economic structure proving bad for the
nation's welfare?
For some years the concentration of economic and political power in the
south east of England has appeared increasingly anomalous in a Europe where
regional influences are of growing importance. But the ability of the south
to function as a powerhouse for the UK economy has tended to offset such
concerns.
Now, with the economy showing no signs of coming out of recession, fears are
growing that conditions in the south may instead be acting a as brake on
recovery.
The recession has been less savage in northern England, Scotland and Wales
than in the heavily indebted south east. Unemployment increased 111 per cent
in Greater London between April 1990 and June 1992 and jumped 192 per cent
in the rest of the south east. But it rose only 16 per cent in Scotland and
29 per cent in the north of England over the same period.
In the past week, two reports suggest that this trend will continue in the
short term at least. Business Strategies, a consultancy specialising in
regional issues, forecasts growth of 1 per cent in the small East Anglian
economy this year, 0.8 per cent in the north west and 0.5 per cent in
Yorkshire and Humberside. By contrast, it expects output in the south east
to drop by 0.4 per cent this year and in Greater London by 0.8 per cent.
In his latest 'Economic and Financial Outlook', published today, Mr David
Kern, the chief economist of National Westminster Bank, expects the south
east economy, including Greater London, to contract by 1.1 per cent this
year and that unemployment in the region will jump by 19 per cent in the 12
months to next June.
By mid-1993, around one in three of Britain's expected 3.05m jobless will be
in Greater London and the remainder of the south east. However, output north
of a line from the Wash to the Bristol Channel will be barely changed with
unemployment in these regions only slightly higher, Mr Kern believes.
Economists at James Capel, the London stockbrokers, have taken the study of
regional economic trends further. They say the regional imbalance in UK
economic growth and unemployment explains the failure of consumer spending
to recover and pull the economy out of recession.
Consumer spending is the largest component of demand in the UK and has in
the past 10 years acted as the main engine of economic growth. But it
declined in real terms by 1.8 per cent last year and a further 0.7 per cent
in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 1991.
Most explanations for the poor performance of consumer demand have centred
on the after-effects of the sharp rise in household indebtedness in the late
1980s, especially in the south east. However, the James Capel team, headed
by Mr Keith Skeoch, the company's chief economist, argues that the problems
of debt and the housing market fail to provide a full explanation of the
fall in consumption.
The Capel study concludes that unemployment in the south east has a more
powerful impact on spending than suggested by its direct effect on real
income growth and debt service obligations. Increases in unemployment in the
region seem to affect strongly the savings habits of people who are in work
and do not have debt problems.
The Capel team sum up their findings in a simple mathematical formula. 'If
the unemployment rate in the south east rises by 1 per cent relative to the
national rate, national consumption will fall by 1 per cent,' they say.
The reasons for this lie in the south east's traditionally high levels of
consumption. The region contains just over 30 per cent of the UK population
but accounts for more than 35 per cent of total UK consumer spending because
consumption per head is 17 per cent higher than the national average.
The south east spends nearly 25 per cent more per head on housing compared
with the rest of Britain, making the region especially vulnerable to a
housing market slump. Personal disposable income in the south is 14 per cent
higher than the national average.
These figures explain how the south east was the powerhouse behind the
economic boom of the 1980s and why rising unemployment in the region has a
big impact on consumer spending. The problem has been exacerbated by a sharp
rise in savings in the south east by people not directly affected by job
losses.
Saving in the south east slumped in the 1980s, with the result that personal
savings as a percentage of personal disposable income fell in the region to
less than 3 per cent in 1987. Since then, the sharp rise in unemployment in
the south east has coincided with - and triggered - a sharp recovery in the
region's savings ratio.
The Capel economists calculate that between 1987 and 1990 (the most recent
date for regional savings figures), savers in the south east accounted for
45 per cent of the increased flow of personal savings in Britain. This
trend, which subdued consumption at the national level, is assumed to have
continued.
If the link between high south east unemployment and consumer spending is
valid, the future must surely be grim. NatWest's Mr Kern, for example,
anticipates an increase of 150,000 in the number of jobless in the south
east over the next 12 months.
But Mr Skeoch's team hesitates to pile on the gloom. Although the sharp rise
in the saving ratio in the south east has been a major factor depressing
consumption, they believe that the 'worst may well be behind us' because
consumers will have adjusted their balance sheets and worked off their
excess debt. Even more important, they say that real income growth may have
picked up since the first quarter of this year.
These conditions could produce a 'robust revival' in consumer spending by
the end of the year. For Mr Lamont and his embattled Treasury colleagues
that will not be a moment too soon.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Walbrook directors face High Court fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Walbrook Insurance, the insurance and re-insurance company
which has net liabilities of Pounds 170m, are expected to fight a last-ditch
attempt in the High Court in London tomorrow to stave off liquidation.
If they fail, Walbrook will pass into the hands of provisional liquidators,
triggering substantial payouts from the Policyholders' Protection Board, the
UK insurance industry safety net, and opening the way for potentially long,
costly and complicated insolvency proceedings.
Walbrook, a subsidiary of London United Investments which is in
administration, was a leading insurer of US liability business in the London
market during the 1980s.
The winding-up petition in the High Court has been brought by Transit
Casualty, a Missouri-based insurance company in receivership since 1985,
which opposed an informal plan proposed by the directors last month.
The directors still have the option of requesting a formal scheme of
arrangement under Section 425 of the 1985 Companies Act, which would allow
them to remain in charge of the company. They are believed to be urging
creditors to attend the court and speak out in favour of the scheme.
Transit has proposed that partners with Cork Gully act as provisional
liquidators. However, their role as liquidators to the Kelm companies,
another part of the LUI group, raises the prospect of a conflict of
interest.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Banks win battle over WPP rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSIDENT shareholders in WPP, the worldwide media services group, dropped
their opposition to a proposed restructuring plan after accepting that the
banks were likely to put the company into receivership, costing them their
investment, a leading shareholder said.
Fidelity Investments, the US-based investment company which holds a stake of
about 10 per cent in WPP, announced on Saturday it would support the
restructuring plan, an abrupt reversal of its earlier position.
Fidelity has led an unusually public campaign to persuade WPP's preference
shareholders that terms of the reconstruction give too much to the company's
lenders.
Fidelity and other shareholders had said they believed the banks were
bluffing and did not intend to act on their threat to place WPP in
receivership if the restructuring was rejected.
Mr Anthony Bolton, senior investment director at Fidelity, said that
although most of the group still believe the restructuring plan unduly
favoured the banks, shareholders realised the banks could protect their own
stake by a controlled receivership known privately among the lenders as
'Plan C'.
The banks were said to have spent more than Pounds 700,000 in legal and
other fees over the past few weeks devising Plan C.
Mr Bolton said that following a conference call with a group of preference
shareholders - who between them hold 30 to 40 per cent of all preference
shares - investors agreed to back down.
He said that rather than be the sole dissenter, Fidelity approached the
lenders and offered to drop its opposition. In exchange the preference
shareholders' gain the right to recommend a candidate for a new
non-executive director on the WPP board.
'We went through in some detail the plans for administrative receivership.
Although it is very complex, it appears perfectly legal,' he said.
The plan called for the banks to put the WPP holding company into
receivership and transfer all its operating subsidiaries - many of which are
profitable - into a new company. This would have left shareholders owning
the worthless holding company while the banks held the profitable
subsidiaries.

FT  03 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade on from the debt crisis, capital is again flowing into Latin
America. The channels are different this time around, with the bond market
and equity offerings in privatised companies taking the place of the banks.
On the debt side, Latin American economies have been the direct
beneficiaries of low US interest rates. Retail savings have flowed into
high-yield bond funds and, since the demise of the domestic US junk bond
market, Latin debt has been a natural destination. The incentive is clear:
last month an Argentinian bank raised one-year money in the Euromarket at a
rate 5.5 percentage points above US treasury paper. It remains to be seen
whether retail dollar inflows will show a reversal in line with the US
interest rate cycle.
Equity investment in Latin American markets still requires a leap of faith.
On conventional methods of equity valuation Latin American equities already
look heavily over-bought. Even after a sharp reversal, the Argentinian
market is trading on a current year multiple of 25 times earnings.
Proponents of the region argue that earnings are artificially depressed
because companies are in a recovery phase following depression in the 1980s.
Still, the 33 per cent fall in Brazilian equities over the last three months
served as a reminder that Latin American stocks are not for the
faint-hearted. Telebras, the telecommunications company which attracts the
bulk of overseas investment in Brazilian equities, has shown a trading range
of Dollars 5.26 to Dollars 36.22 per thousand shares over the last year and
currently stands at around Dollars 18.
The recent volatility of equity markets across the region has stemmed from
the corruption scandal involving President Collor of Brazil. The whole sorry
saga has underlined that the shift towards market-oriented economics and the
hopes for a sharp earnings recovery in the region rest squarely on political
stability. As with so many developing markets, investment in Latin America
is a bet on long-term reform.

FT  03 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The allocation of institutional assets between bonds and equities continues
to stir debate. Pension fund managers, though, seem more interested in more
mundane choices between bond markets. Provisional figures produced by the
performance measurement specialist Caps for the first half of this year
suggest UK pension funds increased their gilt weighting, including
index-linked, from 5.1 per cent to 6.9 per cent over the period. This slow
build-up was at the expense of overseas bonds rather than domestic equities.
The average allocation to overseas bonds fell from 5.5 per cent to 4.1 per
cent over the period. UK equities were steady at 58.5 per cent.
Institutional cash has been flowing into gilts faster than this suggests.
Bank of England figures show domestic investors buying Pounds 6.8bn of gilts
in the last quarter alone. Anecdotal evidence points to life companies as
more enthusiastic buyers. Norwich Union, which sparked the bonds/equities
debate last year by switching Pounds 1bn from equities into gilts in a
single week, is now directing the bulk of its cash flow to UK government
bonds. Its main with-profits fund is now 25 per cent in sterling bonds. A
few institutions, such as Scottish Equitable, admit to a weighting as high
as 60 per cent.
Even so, the behaviour of pension funds is a reminder that the relative
value of gilts against other bond markets is an important factor in
determining overall demand. This is equally true of overseas investors. The
government needs the support of both if its funding programme is to proceed
at current yields or lower. The gilts market knows as much: figures showing
a resurgence of overseas buying in June were greeted with relief.
The broader question is whether demand will be sustained. Judged against
continental European markets, UK government bonds look expensive. As the
chart shows, the yield spread between gilts and French government bonds at
the 10-year maturity has narrowed from 1.2 per cent in January to 0.3 per
cent at the end of last week. In terms of economic fundamentals, France
offers lower inflation, a lower budget deficit and no less room for monetary
easing. Either the French market is oversold ahead of the Maastricht
referendum, or the risk premium on gilts is too low.
If France does vote against Maastricht on September 20, pressures for an ERM
realignment will intensify. This is not just a problem for France. So far
this year the weakness of sterling within the mechanism has encouraged
overseas investors to buy gilts in anticipation of a currency gain. If the
credibility of current ERM parities is seriously called into question, the
effect could be reversed.

These are bad times for big rights issues. Last Friday BET's shares closed
at 110p, bang on the price for its Pounds 200m issue which closes this
Wednesday. BET's is the 12th rights issue of more than Pounds 100m in the
past year. Of the other 11, eight have underperformed the market since the
issue was announced. Even allowing for striking successes like De La Rue and
Bowater, the crude average is an underperformance of 11 per cent. Extending
the list back to last spring brings in real turkeys like Trafalgar House and
Taylor Woodrow, which have underperformed the market by 73 per cent and 75
per cent respectively.
The reasons for underperformance are various. Mostly, they come down to the
fact that the companies wanting money were either in struggling sectors -
contracting, hotels, building materials - or were struggling themselves,
like Asda or British Aerospace. The other common theme is that the
institutions ought to have known that perfectly well at the time. Either
they were resigned to throwing good money after bad, or they were still
naive enough to be drawn by the spurious promise of something for nothing.
The institutions are bound to catch on sooner or later. For companies, the
rational response would be to exploit the growing institutional fashion for
bonds rather than equities. The UK corporate bond market is still grossly
underdeveloped. But if the outlook really is for low inflation and low
growth, long-term fixed rate finance should suit borrowers as well as
lenders. Finance directors might argue that they cannot be sure of servicing
fixed rate obligations. If that is so, they have no business calling on
their shareholders either.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: A lot expected of shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID CRAINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So the Confederation of British Industry (July 30) wants to remove what
little teeth to enforce corporate governance the Cadbury Committee is
proposing, and seeks to place responsibility for the enormous task of
transforming company culture in this country solely on the shoulders of
shareholders. Yet under current legislation shareholders have no means even
of influencing the agenda of company annual general meetings, let alone
effecting actual change.
Large shareholders beware, for the CBI is expecting a lot. The task to be
undertaken must not be underestimated. Reports indicate that over half of
the top 100 companies fail to meet the Cadbury Committee's standards. The
closed world of British business will struggle hard to resist scrutiny.
Until it opens up, criminal and unethical activity will flourish. Good
business practice will be the victim and with it will fall Britain's
competitiveness and international respect.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter (4): Devaluation, a common currency and the answer to
Britain's current account deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord EZRA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to query two points made by Mr Walter Eltis. He states
that 'on balance when taken together there is net borrowing by the personal
sector, companies and government.' I do not believe that is a correct
statement of the present situation. Assuming GDP to be approximately Pounds
580bn, private savings at the current level of 11.5 per cent would amount to
Pounds 66bn whereas the corporate deficit is presently running at some
Pounds 10bn and, assuming the PSBR to be at a level of, say, Pounds 35bn,
the net effect of these three is still substantially on the positive side
because of the very high level of private savings.
The risk I see in Mr Eltis' reasoning is that it lends support to the
accepted view that the PSBR must be substantially cut back. If this included
a cut back in productive investment in the public sector I would consider it
quite wrong. The problem the UK faces is the progressive diminution in
productive investment in the private and public sectors. These trends need
to be reversed before confidence can come back and people encouraged to
spend more.
Also, where Mr Eltis states that 'as the economy recovers, companies will
raise investment and personal savings will fall', I feel it should be put
the other way round. So that the economy can recover, companies need to
raise investment and personal savings need to fall. In other words, unless
there is a recovery in productive investment it is difficult to see how
confidence can return and private spending can be stimulated. What is needed
is a stimulus to companies to invest more, which could be helped by an
increase in investment allowances, and for public spending in productive
sectors, such as construction, transport, training and research, to be at
least maintained and if possible increased. If the government were to bring
forward its major capital projects it would achieve the benefits of their
being undertaken at very low cost, given the state of the construction
industry, and could lead to corresponding investment in the private sector.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter (3): Devaluation, a common currency and the answer to
Britain's current account deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof BRIAN TEW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Walter Eltis states that 'the devaluers appear oblivious to the
possibility that a persistent trade deficit can be macroeconomic in origin,
so that only reductions in net borrowing by the private sector or government
can cure it', which implies that a cut in government expenditure would
reduce the UK's trade deficit. Such is undoubtedly the case, but the causal
route by which this 'remedy' would work is unfortunately via an aggravation
of the present recession. If government expenditure is cut, national income
falls and goes on falling until income receivers are sufficiently
impoverished for the consequential reduction in their saving plus tax
payment plus purchases of imports to balance, in aggregate, the reduction in
government expenditure.
It is in this way that Mr Eltis's equality between 'an excess of investment
over saving' and the 'automatic' trade deficit will be achieved. Not
surprisingly, devaluers do not favour the prescription, though their own,
too, would undoubtedly have unwanted side effects.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter (2): Devaluation, a common currency and the answer to
Britain's current account deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Walter Eltis is quite wrong to argue that, since the current account
deficit can be viewed macro-economically as a deficiency of domestic savings
in relation to domestic investment then the microeconomic/structural
explanations for our trade imbalance, rooted in the economy's lack of
competitiveness, can be ignored.
The correct perspective is to appreciate the interactions between all three
elements.
Thus, is it any wonder that savings are depressed in an economy whose
relative economic performance has been weak for decades, culminating in a
recession more severe than any other industrial country (bar Sweden and
Finland)?
Poor long-run performance depresses the growth of real incomes relative to
aspirations for increased consumption - making for a chronically low
household savings propensity. Meanwhile, the adverse impact of recession on
savings - squeezing corporate profits and pushing up government borrowing
through lowered tax receipts and increased spending - are obvious.
Contrary to Eltis, devaluation can, in principle, impinge positively on the
external balance via improvements in the savings-investment balance both
through its direct effects on the latter and its indirect effects working
through improved international competitiveness. Thus, the impact of
devaluation is typically to bring about a redistribution of income in favour
of profits, implying an increased propensity to save. Of course, any such
beneficial effects on the trade balance resulting from increased savings
could be more than offset by a rise in investment - induced by a successful
strategy - causing the external deficit to persist. But, this would be a
healthy situation, as is the foreign borrowing of many vigorous young
economies. Deficits of a mature, not to say senescent, industrial power in a
deep slump are deeply pathological. And the UK trade balance worsens even as
the slump persists and deepens]

   From Mr KEITH TUNSTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Walter Ellis's fascinating analysis (Personal View, July 29) leaves one
ultimately stranded. What is to be done?
The message seems to be that we should not be borrowing abroad to invest at
home. The demand for foreign borrowings to invest is surely not the problem
it was. But how much of current borrowing is forced by the need to service
previous borrowings? And how far is the government now having to borrow to
finance the public sector borrowing requirement and so keeping up the demand
for foreign capital?
Lower interest rates would discourage foreign lenders. And as long as we
keep interest rates higher than the rate of inflation then there is a good
chance we can keep high domestic savings. But that brings us back full
circle as to whether lower interest rates would force devaluation and raise
inflation.
Clear, the problems of defending the pound and worrying about our current
account deficit would disappear if we had a common European currency.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to see Yvonne Bennion defending the Industrial
Society's outmoded team briefing drill. Team briefing has failed as a
management tool because it is a one-way channel of communication - top
downwards. It offers no facility whatever for ideas and information about
the performance of the business to flow from the workforce back up to senior
management.
The Industrial Society used - perhaps it still does - to promote team
briefing by saying it was a technique modelled on the way the Roman army
briefed troops before a battle. Doing business in Britain today may feel
like fighting in a battlefield, but all the evidence is that successful
companies are the ones tha harness the goodwill and enthusiasm of their
people to the future growth and vitality of their business. Management tools
that simply pander to the autocratic style of management that is all too
prevalent in British companies merely contribute to the continuing failure
of those companies to climb out of the recession and hide the ineptitude of
chief executive officers who, unfortunately, lack leadership skills required
of Roman generals.

Sir, Yvonne Bennion (Letters, July 30) may well be right in stating that the
phrase 'team briefing' has become part of the workplace vocabulary. Since
other equally appealing phrases such as 'project manager' and 'early

terms this hardly proves a great deal, however.
Team briefings may well be a useful way of informing staff of developments
but in my experience they are rarely as brief, or as informative, as one
would like them to be.

<TEXT>
Whether or not Britain's economic tide is still ebbing, management theorists
are in full flood with fresh slogans - sorry, 'metaphors' - aimed at
inspiring company chiefs to follow their ideas.
In particular, perhaps because top executives are often sailing buffs, the
metaphor-mongers are going overboard on seafaring imagery. An example is
'permanent white water', used to represent the ceaseless change now facing
companies.
The nautical natter has clearly impressed the esteemed Tavistock Institute
of Human Relations. 'Such metaphors,' says its latest annual review,
'conjure up visions of organisations emerging from tedious and dutiful
voyages down well-charted and sluggish waterways to face a tempest-lashed
open sea.'
'Aye, 'appen,' said the FT's resident sceptic on management theories when he
was shown the review's prose. But there was one thing, he added, that calm
or tempestuous, the climate would never change. 'Whatever the water, it's
shark-infested.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor literacy is a problem the world over. But China, where the authorities
have just also ordered a crackdown on basics such as spelling, might seem to
have special difficulties.
In English-speaking nations, for instance, the problem usually results in
nothing worse than puzzling new words (an 'enjuiced' pregnancy, for example)
which, with a bit of thought, can be decoded from the context. The
equivalent in China, however, is the distortion not just of words but the
individual characters.
Fortunately, Observer's checks reveal that literate Chinese can still work
out the intended meaning, even if - as one translator said - 'it's sometimes
like looking at a bit of finished knitting and divining what should have
been in the pattern'.
As a by-product of the checks, too, there's news for the innumerable public
speakers on management who're forevertelling their audiences that the
Chinese word for 'crisis' is formed by linking together the characters for
'danger' and for 'opportunity'. It is true.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A top official appearing in court with a bandaged hand might not set tongues
a-wagging in most countries. But it did in Russia when Boris Yeltsin's
special representative Sergei Shakhrai arrived wearing a bandage at the
hearings on the legality of the former Soviet Communist party.
Suspicions of a sinister attempt to nobble him were increased by news that
the injury was one he'd been lucky to escape with. He suffered it when his
speeding car hit a tree after being forced off the road by another, which
then raced off.
But it turns out that his assailants were not so much political as
paralytic. Apparently Shakhrai's limousine had earlier overtaken the other
car with an arrogance that nettled its three drunken occupants - the chief
of a Moscow hairdressing salon who owned it, and two companions. So they
caught up and made a ramming attack.
As its success seemed worthy of celebration, they parked a mile away and
took to the bottle again. The car's owner then staggered back alone to the
scene of the crash, where he overheard bystanders saying who had been hurt.
That sent him back to his friends and a third go at the bottle, during which
they resolved to conceal their guilt.
Their efforts, however, were in vain. The number of the car had been noted
when it made the attack, and the barber-shop manager was put under locks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Would readers care to help in stopping what, in Observer's experience at
least, is a growing nuisance besides a pernicious one. The root cause is the
numerous traders who have joined publishers of free newspapers in
distributing unsolicited bumf from house to house.
It is not so bad when the stuff is pushed right through the letter boxes
because, then, it is easily binned along with other junk mail. The trouble
is that the bumf-bringers often stop short at sticking it only half through.
Hence when the householders are away, the other half remains outside the
door as a signal to any casing criminal that the place is unoccupied.
So if that leads to burglary, how do the victims stand? Not at all well,
thinks Observer's legal colleague.
The odd thing, he says, is that if the inviting signal was the householders'
fault - for going away without cancelling the newspapers they pay for -
their insurers might well refuse to pay up. But when the householders have
been set up by the fault of someone else, however clearly identified, it is
unlikely that the culprit could be successfully sued.
At the very least the householders would need to have written beforehand to
the producer of the particular piece of offending paper, requesting that
such deliveries should cease. If the tell-tale bumf came from anybody who
hadn't been so forewarned, hard luck.
It is a position which, given the encouragement to crime, seems antisocial
as well as unjust. It also seems easily rectifiable. All it needs is a bit
of legislation putting the onus on the bumf's originators to ensure that it
doesn't remain on view from the outside - although it might be time to ask
by what right people go around invading others' property with objects they
have not said they want.
If any readers feel the same way, perhaps they'd like to write in. Then,
given enough support, we'll see what can be done to change things.

FT  03 AUG 92 / A strike at the heart of the democratic struggle: South
Africa is bracing itself for an unprecedented week of industrial action and
demonstrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's struggle for democracy this week enters its most perilous
stage since Mr Nelson Mandela's release two and a half years ago.
Ravaged by political violence, its leaders at loggerheads, and the economy
deep in recession, the country is bracing itself for a 48-hour general
strike that begins today.
It marks the start of an unprecedented week of industrial action, partly a
protest against the slaughter that the government seems either unable or
unwilling to halt, partly an effort to jolt President FW de Klerk into an
acceptance of majority rule.
Mr Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) president, however, may find
himself hoist by his own petard. The week ahead could prove to be less a
challenge to Mr de Klerk's authority than a test of his own leadership.
Within the ranks of the ANC and its main allies - the South African
Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)  -
are those who question a strategy that may have been flawed from the start
and has since been overtaken by one development in particular: the emerging
role in South Africa's peace process of the United Nations, ten of whose
officials arrived yesterday to observe this week's events.
On the home front, government measures have helped prepare the ground for a
resumption of constitutional negotiations, called off on June 23 by the ANC
in the wake of the massacre of 42 residents of Boipatong township.
The government has responded to most of the ANC conditions for a resumption
of talks. It has agreed to disband three controversial security force units,
promised to reform migrant worker hostels which were implicated in much of
the violence. and agreed to tougher measures against carrying weapons in
public, including so-called traditional weapons carried by Zulu supporters
of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
'Mr de Klerk must put promises into practice', comments one ANC official.
But he concedes that Mr de Klerk has taken significant steps towards
fulfilling an important condition: the demand for an international inquiry
into the massacre. Foreign experts have been assisting the Goldstone
commission, a standing judicial investigation ofpolitical violence.
But the most important development of all came at the Security Council last
month, which met to debate the South African crisis.
Its decision to appoint Mr Cyrus Vance, former US secretary of state, as
special UN envoy to South Africa marked the start of the international
body's direct involvement in the search for a settlement.
When Mr Vance reports this week, he will almost certainly suggest that the
UN send an observer team, whose members would be attached to existing local
bodies.
But he has already made his mark. While in South Africa on a ten-day visit
he played the role of broker, helping to arrange last week's meeting between
Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, and Mr Thabo Mbeki, his ANC shadow.
The official purpose of the meeting was to discuss the release of political
prisoners. But few observers doubt that more was discussed in a meeting that
effectively marked the resumption of bilateral talks.
Whether international intervention can save South Africans from themselves
is a moot point. But Mr Vance apart, outsiders are already making their
mark. For example, reports by the experts invited to join the Goldstone
commission have produced indictments of the South African Police.
What alarms members of Mr Vance's team, however, is the prospect of what ANC
and labour leaders have termed 'rolling mass action', with all the risks of
violent confrontation the policy entails.
The small number of UN observers envisaged - 'tens rather than scores and
certainly not three figures', says one official - will already be hard
pressed to monitor existing levels of conflict.
Thus UN officials will be eager to avoid extended industrial unrest in South
Africa.
This all adds up to a predicament for Mr Mandela in which he has little to
gain and much to lose.
If the week of action wins widespread support Mr Mandela will emerge with
his authority intact. But it will hardly be enhanced. What, it can be asked,
will have been achieved?
Anything less than a big turnout, however, will be a severe blow. With its
military wing all but inconsequential, trade sanctions a lost cause, and the
shortcomings of its industrial muscle demonstrated, the ANC will return to
negotiations with its limitations exposed.
As Mr Benny Alexander, secretary general of the radical Pan Africanist
Congress says: 'If they (the ANC) fail to come up with successful mass
actions Mr de Klerk will become more arrogant.'
Moreover, the divisions in black politics will have been exacerbated.
From Chief Buthelezi, strongly opposed to the mass action campaign, comes a
warning: 'If negotiations cannot get off the ground then violence will
escalate. We might be pushed into a situation in which violence will have to
run its course before we can again begin negotiations.'
Not only have relations between the ANC and Inkatha sunk to new and
dangerous depths. The Pan Africanist Congress, which used the funeral of the
Boipatong victims to resurrect the Patriotic Front alliance of
anti-government forces, is opposing today's strike.
Furthermore, the strike has revived the quarrel of the classrooms: with some
groups arguing that students should boycott their schools and others
(including the ANC) urging pupils to attend classes.
The greatest burden Mr Mandela carries is the danger that events this week
could set in train a process of radical change, but in a way that he does
not intend, and which he could find hard to control.
The threat of violence will be ever present. Potential flashpoints include;
hostels housing supporters of Inkatha who are determined to go to work;
factories where strikers confront the security forces; or wherever the
extreme right attempts to provoke conflict.
But de Klerk has his own burden of responsibility. The most fundamental
issue of all - who holds power in post-apartheid South Africa - remains
intractable. And nothing Mr de Klerk has said since talks broke down
suggests he is prepared to accept Mr Mandela's demand for a majority rule
constitution.
As positions harden and enmities deepen, the warning of Rhodesia (now
Zimbabwe) seems increasingly relevant: black nationalist leaders were
released (1974), a constitutional conference failed (Geneva 1976) and 30,000
people were to die before talks eventually succeeded in December 1979.
Certainly one prominent South African politician has said there is a lesson
to be drawn.
'I think great mistakes were made in Rhodesia. When the opportunity was
there for real, constructive negotiation it was not grasped.'
'Insofar as things went wrong, they went wrong because they (white
Rhodesians) waited too long before engaging in fundamental negotiation and
dialogue'.
These words are from President FW de Klerk, in an interview shortly before
Nelson Mandela's release. They seem all the more pertinent this week.

<TEXT>
Sir, The end of the Third World debt crisis is more tricky to predict than
the beginning of the UK economic recovery. Bank of England governor, Mr
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said in 1982 he thought the international debt crisis
'is over' ('Debt crisis at end, says new Bank head', December 31, 1982) and
every year since has seen similar claims.
I will not join you ('Latin American debt crisis', July 30) in proclaiming
its end on the tenth anniversary of its start, not least because of its
concentration on just a few countries and the fragility of financial flows
back into Latin America. The region is still deeply in debt and the legacy
of coping with it in terms of poverty and a degraded natural resource base
will not easily go away.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: What ICI's accounting really says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D R MYDDELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Proposals for radical restructuring of ICI are certainly overdue ('ICI
sets out radical plan to split its operations', July 31). After proper
allowance for inflation, the results over the last 20 or 30 years have been
truly awful.
In real terms the dividend is lower than it was in 1979, before the famous
nominal cut in the 1980 dividend. Indeed, in real terms ICI's dividend per
share is lower than it was as long ago as 1959.
Even more shocking is that ICI's historical cost accounts significantly
understate depreciation of fixed assets. Using constant purchasing power
accounting to allow for the effects of inflation, I reckon ICI has actually
made a real loss in ten of the last 15 years.
And according to my calculations, real CPP earnings have not fully covered
ICI's dividend in any single one of the past 17 years.
This is an indictment of ICI's performance. It is, however, also a sad
commentary on the state of UK accounting.

<TEXT>
Sir, There need be no conflict between privatisation (of Companies House or
anything else) and the requirement in the First Companies Directive that
information should be made available at cost.
Mr Fleming (Letters, July 29) might like to hear that Registry Trust was set
up as a non-profit company in 1985 and has now operated the registry of
county court judgments for the Lord Chancellor's department for six years
with uncontested success, playing an important part in the control of
indebtedness. For most customers and most of the time, higher efficiency has
been delivered at a lower price.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Leading Article: British Gas takes the test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS's decision to volunteer itself for scrutiny by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission is an indication of the company's profound
frustration with the regulatory regime under which it operates.
It guarantees that the company's senior management will spend much of the
next nine months dealing with MMC inquiries and raises the possibility that
the process will end with the government breaking up the utility. It is
difficult to recall a precedent for such a high risk corporate gamble.
It is evident, however, that British Gas felt it had no real choice. Having
been privatised in 1986 as a single, monopolistic entity, against much
vociferous advice to the contrary, British Gas was bound either to ride
roughshod over the interests of consumers or to face a shoot-out with its
regulators. Since the powers of Ofgas, the main gas regulator, stop short of
forcing the industry into the competitive structure the government should
have sought in the first place, a good deal of friction was inevitable.
After a deceptively calm beginning, recent months have seen a series of
squabbles, which no amount of pressure of British Gas's new chief executive,
Mr Cedric Brown, has been able to resolve. In the latest conflict, over
rates of return in the pipeline business, Ofgas has pressed a pricing plan
unacceptable to the utility. Faced with an impasse, the MMC is available as
a referee, but British Gas has decided that the commission should review the
entire gas industry rather than confining itself to the matter immediately
at hand.
Desirable step
This is a bold step, but a wholly desirable one. Although British Gas can be
criticised for its shameless pursuit of a monopolistic preserve at the time
of privatisation, it has since found itself buffeted between Ofgas, which
regulates prices, and the Office of Fair Trading, which has intervened with
far-reaching criticisms of British Gas's structure. It was an OFT report in
October last year which proposed the creation of the pipeline and storage
subsidiary. But it was with Ofgas that British Gas had to negotiate over
pipeline tariffs. British Gas complains that this regulatory whipsaw has
made medium- and long-term planning very difficult.
No doubt these problems have sometimes been made more vivid by the
personalities of those involved. British Gas surveys the world, some think
haughtily, from its Thames-side headquarters and has been known to consider
Ofgas an irritating pipsqueak. Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas director general,
has sometimes perhaps savoured the scrap as much as his strategic
objectives. But it would be wrong to conclude that the system has broken
down because it has been badly administered. It has broken down because its
design was fundamentally flawed.
Privatisation successes
In conducting its inquiry, the MMC will want to acknowledge some successes
of privatisation: more dynamic management, reduced costs, somewhat greater
transparency and a reasonable deal for shareholders. British Gas claims to
have cut the price of gas to domestic consumers by 19 per cent since
privatisation, although this has been against a background of weak energy
prices.
The MMC will also not want lightly to throw away the basis of price
regulation in Britain, whereby companies receive an incentive to hold prices
at an agreed level below inflation and so to be more efficient. But the
commission will also need to explore thoroughly the central question of
appropriate rates of return for different parts of the business given the
varying degrees of competitive pressure. The MMC's findings here will be of
great importance for all the utilities.
The MMC will also ask how much more competition can be brought into the gas
industry, perhaps by breaking British Gas up into a series of regional
companies, with a centrally owned pipeline company, perhaps by encouraging
British Gas's competitors in the industrial gas market to enter the domestic
business in force. It will also need to reconsider the industry's regulatory
structure.
If the outcome is to break up British Gas, Mr Brown should not necessarily
conclude that he lost the gamble. After all, one of his Thames-side
neighbours, ICI, has just proposed precisely that.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Leading Article: The task for George Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush will have to run hard if he is to win a second
presidential term on November 3. The national opinion polls give his
Democratic party challenger, Governor Bill Clinton, an overwhelming lead.
More to the point, local polls suggest that, had the contest taken place
last week, Mr Bush would have lost California and New York, not to mention
smaller but nevertheless important 'swing' states like North Carolina,
Missouri, and Washington. The magnitude of Mr Clinton's popular advantage
has led some Republicans to speculate aloud that perhaps the president
should stand down in favour of someone likely to win. US conservatives,
still unhappy about Mr Bush's failure to stick to the letter of President
Reagan's agenda, have taken to musing that a Clinton presidency might be
preferable to another four years of Mr Bush.
There is still time for the president to turn this adverse current round. He
started from well behind Governor Michael Dukakis in 1988 and ended up
convincingly ahead. A large part of Mr Clinton's lead is the product of the
'bounce' in popularity that a candidate usually enjoys in the weeks
following his party's convention. The effect is more marked this year than
in most recent presidential elections, but that may be due to the switch to
the Democratic candidate of support formerly pledged to Mr Ross Perot. The
Republican convention which ends on August 20 should in the normal course of
events produce bounce in favour of Mr Bush. That could still be of
sufficient magnitude to ensure victory - if he manages to convey the
impression that he has a serious programme of action to put forward.
Aimless policy
The question is, 'does he?' His fall in popularity is mainly explained by
the prolonged recession and Mr Bush's seemingly aimless policy of
laissez-faire. The president, hamstrung by a Democratic Congress, has in
consequence appeared to be immobilised. He has not put forward any positive
domestic programme for action, either to reduce the budget deficit or to
promote the return to a better rate of growth. America's poorly-performing
educational system, its lack of housing for the poor, and its costly but
inefficient welfare provisions are all running sores to which Mr Bush has
paid little visible attention.
This is not to say that Mr Clinton's proposals, which involve high spending
and a certain lack of clarity about how they are to be financed, are without
flaw. The Democratic platform has been subjected to insufficient national
scrutiny. For the moment, however, that is a secondary matter. What is being
questioned by Americans is the president's purpose in seeking a second term.
Mr Bush has so little to say about his country's economic and social malaise
that he is starting to look like a man who may not deserve re-election. That
allows his opponent to present himself as a man who will both propose and
execute positive programmes, the right person if voters want change.
Quayle factor
It is conceivable that Mr James Baker, who was in strategic command of Mr
Bush's campaign against Mr Dukakis, may rescue his old friend once more. The
secretary of state is thought likely to return to the White House soon,
either as controller of domestic policy, or, some surmise, as a replacement
for Mr Dan Quayle as Mr Bush's running-mate. In 1988 Mr Baker guided Mr Bush
through a wholly negative strategy. Mr Clinton and his running-mate, Mr Al
Gore, can see that coming and prepare their defences.
What Mr Bush needs this time is something better - a set of serious domestic
policies and a campaigning style that persuades his own people that he knows
what has to be done and understands how to do it. This is a matter of moment
well beyond the shores of the United States, since the Bush administration
has until recently been remarkably adept at foreign policy.
If Mr Baker, who knows from personal experience how much the world at large
has benefitted from American policies over the past four years, cannot
enliven the president's domestic programme, he should ask himself about how
best to provide the electorate with a proper choice in November.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Personal View: Fudge in fourth estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Television programmes about Northern Ireland ..viewers turn off at the very
mention of the subject. The story has been going hopelessly round in circles
for decades. There is no sex, no laughs, no charm, no hope.' That was Liz
Forgan, Channel Four's Director of Programmes, writing two months ago ahead
of last week's court judgement which fined the Channel and programme maker
Box Productions Pounds 75,000 for contempt.
She may nonetheless feel that the money was well spent. For the government,
in resorting to the draconian provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act
(PTA) to force journalists to reveal their sources for the first time since
the legislation was enacted in 1974, rescued the little noticed Dispatches
programme 'The Committee' from obscurity.
When it was screened last October it caused hardly a ripple. But now
millions know of allegations of systematic collusion between the locally
recruited security forces and loyalist terrorists in a campaign of sectarian
murder. The unprecedented legal battle has also backfired on the government
in another way. Despite the prospect of prosecutions under Section 18 of the
PTA, which carry a maximum five year jail sentence, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary has failed to extract the name of one of the programme's
sources, known as 'Source A'. This individual provided first-hand testimony
of how a secret committee, composed of RUC officers, loyalist terrorists and
prominent businessmen, sanctioned and organised the execution of Republican
supporters and, in one notorious case, an innocent catholic youth.
The Channel Four board was unanimous in its resolve to disclose these
matters in the public interest. Its confidence rested on the extensive
research and close supervision of the project exercised by the Channel's
most senior executives at every stage of production. From the outset those
involved were aware that the undertakings given to the programme's sources
could bring them into conflict with the PTA. They assumed, wrongly, that in
handing over virtually all their research material to both the RUC and
Scotland Yard they would have satisfied the demands of the law.
The dossier given to the RUC after transmission contained information on 19
members of the committee including the chairman - a member of the RUC
reserve who had met the programme's main researcher, shown him his police
medal, brandished a revolver and, as the court was to hear, had boasted,
'makes you wonder who runs this country, doesn't it'.
Shortly after the broadcast the RUC intimated to sympathetic journalists
that the programme had been hoaxed. There had been no terrorist conspiracy.
Yet the RUC seemed unembarrassed by its own use of emergency legislation in
the PTA to unmask the supposed hoaxer. After seven months of legal argument,
held in secret, the case finally surfaced amid a glare of publicity before
Lord Justice Woolf in the High Court.
The core of the case was the conflict between two different public
interests: exposure of a scandal, as against full compliance with the terms
of a valid legal order to produce materials deemed relevant to a terrorist
investigation - even if such compliance might prove fatal for Source A. This
clash was inevitable because Parliament, in passing the PTA, did not
envisage officers of a British police force promoting terrorism instead of
preventing it, which was precisely what the Channel Four programme claimed.
At the start of the proceedings, Lord Williams QC, counsel for Channel Four
and Box, made the position clear. 'We will bow the head, but will not bend
the knee,' he said. For the Crown, Mr Andrew Collins called for Channel Four
to be taken off the air if necessary to force compliance.
Lord Justice Woolf defused this confrontation with a characteristically
British fudge. He dismissed sequestration but rapped Channel Four on the
knuckles with a fine equal to the cost of a mere 15 minutes of advertising
time. And he failed to resolve the clash between the two public interests,
by proposing, wholly unrealistically, that Channel Four and Box should have
given only a qualified undertaking to Source A, saying that they would not
name him unless asked to do so by a court. Source A, who took weeks of
persuasion to appear in heavily disguised silhouette, would naturally have
declined the offer.
This weekend the RUC once again sought to discredit the programme by coming
up with a new hoaxer, witness X. The most striking feature in this is the
identity of the solicitor who witnessed his statement. Of all the solicitors
in Northern Ireland who could have acted for Mr X the RUC chose one of the
19 people identified by Channel Four and Box as members of the Committee.
Interestingly, witness X did not claim to have met any member of the
production team.
If Sir Hugh Annesley, the chief constable, has nothing to hide, as he
continues to insist, it is hard to see why he would not welcome the public
inquiry for which Channel Four has called.

FT  03 AUG 92 / A flight back to basics: BAe is preparing a radical
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors driving in to central London from Heathrow airport used to be
greeted by a stylish billboard advertising British Aerospace executive jets.
This summer, it has been replaced by a poster plugging an American fast-food
chain.
It is a small but telling reflection of what is happening in Britain's
biggest manufacturing company and exporter of manufactured goods.
From the City's point of view, BAe is in bad shape. In the past year its
share price has fallen by about two-thirds, from 570p to 209p at last
Friday's close. Its total market value is less than Pounds 800m (Dollars
1.5bn). At this rate, it is set to fall out of the FT-SE index of the UK's
100 biggest companies.
Late next month, with the company's interim results, the new chairman, Mr
John Cahill, will reveal further drastic measures to restructure the
company. His first move will involve the troubled regional aircraft
business.
'We have been working fairly feverishly for the past six weeks on a
solution,' Mr Cahill says. 'By September we will have one. That will be a
new beginning for this company. It's been dragging baggage behind it for a
number of years, and we're just starting to face up to it.'
The company has been searching for international partners to acquire a stake
in its regional jet and turbo-propeller commuter aircraft activities. If
these efforts fail, the regional aircraft business is likely to be scrapped.
But that is likely to be only the first stage of a broader programme to
refocus the company around its military aircraft operations and its 20 per
cent stake in the European Airbus consortium.
Central to the group's problems is its chronic inability to generate cash.
Last year it shocked the City with a surprise Pounds 432m rights issue. Even
after that cash injection, its net debt was nearly Pounds 400m higher by the
end of the year.
It is a problem which Mr Cahill should be qualified to address. The company
in which he spent most of his working life, the conglomerate BTR, is
renowned for its tight financial controls.
'We have to get the company cash-positive,' he says. 'Otherwise it eats
itself alive. My view is that there is around Pounds 250m stuck in the
system here. We've got to drive it out. Then we can close the warehouses and
turn the lights out. And we need to keep de-manning.'
The roots of the problem, he concedes, lie in the company's history. 'The
company for years was a cash cow. It was a defence business, with research
and development funded by Her Majesty's Government and by payments for work
in progress.
'It has probably never been managed for profit or for cash. All that used to
take care of itself. That's now changing. In the 1990s, we're not going to
get high inflation or explosive volume growth. So you've got to get the
costs down. If you look across the road to BTR, that's exactly what we did.'
In strategic terms, the process of re-shaping the company could take three
or four years. It may also have far-reaching implications for the group's
other activities, including the Rover car operations, its property business
and perhaps even some of its defence interests.
Mr Cahill's room for manoeuvre is hampered by depressed demand across the
group's businesses. 'That is the other thing that is bugging the business,
besides regional aircraft,' he says. But he cannot afford to wait too long
before wielding the scalpel.
'Radical surgery is required,' says Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst
at Shearson Lehman, the US investment bank. 'It's the old story: there can
be no gain without pain and the incoming chairman must attempt to get
everything right in the first year. He can't have a second crack at it.'
A revealing insight into the history of the group's problems is contained in
a letter in the latest edition of the Royal Aeronautical Society journal
from Professor Ivan Yates, a former head of BAe's aircraft group and the
group's deputy chief executive responsible for engineering until 1990.
According to Prof Yates, things started to go wrong in the late 1980s after
government aid was cut to the point at which it no longer covered the
financial risk of the company's commercial aircraft programmes. BAe's
response was to diversify into armaments, construction, motor manufacture
and property.
'This strategy underpinned the acquisition of Royal Ordnance (the armaments
company, acquired from the government for Pounds 190m in 1987), Ballast
Nedam (the Dutch construction concern, also bought in 1987), Rover (bought
from the government in 1988), and, by extreme extrapolation, the property
company Arlington (bought for Pounds 278m in 1989),' Prof Yates explains.
But, he claims that strategy had two significant drawbacks. 'First, it used
up cash which would otherwise have been invested in the aerospace business .
. . Second, it exposed the company, as is now clearly demonstrated, to
increased risk in other markets such as the highly volatile consumer and
property sectors.'
BAe's recovery strategy was set out in its rights-issue document last year.
The group is to be focused round its four main businesses: defence,
commercial aircraft, cars and property. Mr Cahill's challenge is to
accelerate this strategy by selling off non core-activities and shedding
loss makers.
This is likely to involve heavy write-offs. The City estimates that the
company will write off about Pounds 750m with its interim figures. But the
gloom should not be overdone. BAe has two big strengths - defence and
Airbus.
Defence. Although the defence market is contracting, this remains the
company's largest profit centre. 'BAe is one of the world's best
manufacturers of military aircraft and even without the European Fighter
Aircraft this business will continue to make decent profits over the next
four to five years,' says Mr Hodgkinson of Shearson Lehman. BAe is the
world's third-largest defence contractor and the biggest in Europe.
The defence activities, which made Pounds 550m in operating profits last
year, are also underpinned by the company's long-term relationship with
Saudi Arabia, which will continue to provide BAe with some Pounds 2bn in
annual revenues over the rest of the decade. However, BAe's overall military
business is likely to shrink as a result of defence spending cuts. The
company would clearly suffer a huge blow if the European Fighter Aircraft
were cancelled, but the new fighter would not have any significant impact on
profits and revenues until 1995-96.
While building on its military aircraft and systems strengths, BAe may again
seek a joint venture for its missiles business after failing with
Thomson-CSF of France two years ago. In the long run, the Royal Ordnance
armaments group does not appear to constitute a core activity. In France,
the aerospace and armaments industries are separated, and some analysts
believe this would also make sense for the UK.
Airbus. Although in the past BAe has been anxious about its participation in
the European Airbus programme, it now regards its 20 per cent stake in the
consortium as its second big asset. It would like to increase its stake, but
it is difficult to see the two lead partners, Aerospatiale of France and
Deutsche Aerospace, giving ground.
Airbus has firmly established itself as Boeing's main rival in the market
for large airliners. Its extensive family of aircraft, built up over the
last 20 years, has given it a 26 per cent share of the world market. That
could grow to around 30 per cent. Last month Airbus made a spectacular
inroad into Boeing's domestic market by winning a Dollars 5bn order from
United Airlines, a traditional Boeing customer.
BAe now clearly intends to concentrate its efforts in the commercial
aircraft business on Airbus and its wing-manufacturing activities for the
European consortium. Last year, BAe picked up about Dollars 45m of the
consortium's Dollars 260m operating surplus.
BAe has also decided to sell its profitable corporate jet business because
it no longer sees this as a core activity. If it had decided to remain in
the corporate jet market, it would have been forced to invest heavily in the
development of new products at a time when it is seeking to keep a tight
rein on capital expenditures. The sale will also help reduce company debt.
The two other legs of the group are Rover and property. Although the company
does not appear to be in any rush to make any radical moves, both are
unlikely to remain with BAe in the longer term.
Rover. The vehicle business is expected to report another loss this year,
with few encouraging signs of market recovery. Rover is continuing to cost
BAe significant sums in the modernisation of new plant and the introduction
of new models.
BAe is still bound by a five-year standstill agreement with the government
until August next year, when it could sell Rover if it chose to. But the
company is concentrating on making Rover as lean and competitive as any
company in the world market. Once this process is complete, and Rover starts
achieving good profits, BAe is expected to look for a buyer. This could be
either a bigger European manufacturer, or possibly Honda of Japan, which
already owns a 20 per cent stake in Rover's manufacturing operations.
As BAe sees it, Rover's problem is one of volume. It builds about 400,000
vehicles a year, many in car market segments which require volumes of 1m to
2m a year if development costs are to be properly amortised. 'Whatever
ultimately happens, Rover is unlikely to remain in BAe's portfolio,' one
City analyst forecasts.
Property. BAe's hopes that property development profits would become a big
cash generator for the group have disintegrated. In the depressed state of
the market, the company is marking time, hoping that the market will
eventually recover and its property assets become more liquid.
Mr Cahill's task of restoring BAe's sense of direction is by no means
impossible. Others have succeeded. In the US, Lockheed and General Dynamics,
two of the biggest defence contractors, appear to be well on the way to
achieving successful restructurings focused on their core defence
businesses.
But the new chairman cannot afford any error. 'This is probably the last
chance for BAe, just as Mr Cahill won't be given a second chance if he gets
things wrong now,' says one executive of another large UK aerospace group.
The problem is that building aircraft has always been a seductive process
and the industry has traditionally suffered from over-optimism. Mr Cahill
can clearly continue to hope for the best, but in the present circumstances,
he must also expect the worst. The trouble with BAe has been that it has
always hoped for the best and expected it.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Arts: Building with an eye on history - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAS MODERN architecture designed to be part of history? The answer has to be
yes and no. Many of the pioneers of modern architecture derided history and
were determined not to build for a long future. Many modern architects in
this century have associated the idea of creating monuments with tyranny,
privilege and the class system. They wanted, instead of being part of the
weight that architectural history and preservation lays upon the earth, to
be lightweight, functional and part of the motion of change.
Many architects who have been working in the UK in the recent past must have
been surprised to find that their buildings are the subject of examination
by official historians for the purposes of statutory listing and protection.
Last week English Heritage and the Royal Commission on the Historical
Monuments of England presented an exhibition and held a Seminar at the Royal
College of Art in London on the subject of the listing of post-war
buildings. The exhibition, 'A Change of Heart - English Architecture Since
The War, A Policy for Protection' - is open on weekdays from 10 am to 8 pm
at the Royal College of Art, Kensington Gore, London, SW7. It is going on
tour to Chelmsford, Birmingham, Bradford and Exeter. It is sponsored by
Pearson (owners of the FT) and the Obayashi Corporation - the two most
recent owners of the first post-war building to be listed, Bracken House in
the City of London, once the home of this newspaper.
The period under examination is 1945-1975 - a period that it is hard to
think of as history. A new approach is needed for post-war architecture
because, unlike so much of the architecture of the past, it concerns not
just a relatively few listed buildings but often a mass of housing estates,
new towns and whole universities.
It is a period that is difficult to look at with clear, unprejudiced eyes,
and it will take time to analyse and establish objective standards of
judgment. The fact that many of the creators of the post-war environment are
still alive makes it more interesting, but in my view much more difficult
for historians to make totally independent judgments.
At the seminar in London, attended by historians and architects, there was
clearly already a division of opinion about the best way to proceed on this
thorny subject between Miss Jennifer Page, chief executive of English
Heritage, and Mr Martin Cherry, who is in charge of listing buildings. Miss
Page stressed the importance of the political context and demonstrated her
own lack of political skills (or was she showing how independent a quango
English Heritage has become?) by making invidious and personal remarks about
a previous Secretary of State for the Environment and his attitude to
listing. English Heritage's role is to offer the best impartial advice to
ministers on historical matters, not to bite publicly the hand that feeds
it.
Mr Cherry seemed to feel that politics is not the most important aspect of
the context of post-war buildings and that the listing criteria should be as
historically objective as possible and based upon sound art-historical
principles. He is a medievalist and so his historical training would seem to
lend his judgments the appropriate distance. Miss Page has done good
service, I suspect unwittingly, by demonstrating the dangers of sullying the
purity of debate by playing politics.
The modest exhibition, and Mr Andrew Saint's brightly argued booklet that
goes with it, both show the need for a debate on this delicate subject. It
was Sir John Summerson, writing about the past in the future in the 1940s,
who saw that preservation was susceptible to 'fatuity, hypocrisy,
sentimentality of the ugliest sort and downright obstructionism.' Anyone
thinking about how to make an objective list of post-war buildings that
should be preserved should remember Sir John's thoughts.
What is the point of preserving the recent past? It must be to show our own
humility as a minute part of the flow of human history. We acknowledge the
moments where we think human achievement has reached an honourable level -
we cannot really do more than salute them. Ruskin was clearer on the subject
because he thought that we had no right to touch the buildings of past
times: 'they are not ours. They belong partly to those who built them and
partly to all the generations of mankind who are to follow us.' I long to
know what Ruskin would have thought of (a) a bureaucracy of historians and
(b) post-war architecture]
The exhibition includes some excellent new photographs taken by the Royal
Commission on Historical Monuments of some of the important buildings of the
period. It must be the design of the exhibition that did not allow for large
pictures - it is a pity that the excellent arguments are poorly served by
postage stamp sized photographs. I liked the historians' categories of
modern architects, from 'Ancients' who maintained the flame of tradition,
through 'Herbivores', to 'Modernists' and 'Team Men'. Examples of their work
include Bankside Power Station in London, Nottingham Polytechnic, Stevenage
Town Centre, war-time prefabs, the ghastly Trellick Tower in Kensal Green,
London, and even some developers' rubbish from the 1980s.
But some examples apart, the proposed three-year study of the period has to
be applauded. I would rely on historians such as Andrew Saint to ensure its
total objectivity. But I would not rely on a quick reform of public opinion
on this subject, or a sudden change of heart by ministers when it comes,
say, to the preservation of an empty Bankside Power Station that occupies
one of the most valuable sites on the Thames.
At the moment I would find it hard to see the Barbican as a conservation
area, but I am prepared to consider a change of heart given adequate time to
consider whether or not modern architecture ever wanted to become part of
the aspic-laden world of the preservationists. After all, many modern
buildings would make wonderful ruins once the inhabitants have been
released.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Arts: Edinburgh Festival - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are difficult times for arts companies as they try to maintain
sponsorship funding - difficult but not impossible. The Edinburgh Festival,
which opens in two weeks time, has managed, just, to exceed its target for
the year. It hoped to bring in Pounds 750,000, and actually achieved Pounds
770,000, the same sum as in 1991 and around 20 per cent of total Festival
revenue.
It is mainly the regular raft of companies who have rallied round, led by
the local banks, like the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland,
and the brewers, like Scottish and Newcastle.
These days the Fringe is not only as prominent as the Festival artistically;
it also garners its fair share of sponsorship. Much of it is specific aid -
Kwik-Fit, for example, provides the Fringe programme, and BP the daily
events diary - but the main Fringe venue, the Assembly Rooms, has signed a
major deal with a new sponsor, Whitbread, which is worth Pounds 60,000.
Whitbread's Stella Artois and Murphy brands will be all over the Rooms,
while the Dream Tent in the Meadows carries the Boddington's brand name.
Edinburgh's success probably reflects the comparative strength of the
Scottish economy. Things are much tougher in London. The Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, has a new season fast approaching, and none of its five new
opera productions has - to date - attracted a sponsor.
The revival of Turandot is being supported by UBS/Phillips &amp; Drew and the
gala night of Otello has received a mighty Pounds 200,000 donation from
Boeing, one of Covent Garden's largest sponsorships ever. But the ROH needs
lots of energy and luck if it is to better the Pounds 881,000 sponsorship
brought in last season, which in itself was well below target.
But the arts always have the ability to mount exciting ventures which will
draw in new sponsors. The theatrical producer Thelma Holt has formed a
company, Infinite Space, which, in turn, has signed up Alan Rickman to play
his first Hamlet, opening at the Riverside Studios in London in
mid-September for five weeks, before going on tour.
The exercise will cost Pounds 200,000, but sponsorship has provided a total
of Pounds 40,000, the money coming from the backing by two unusual first
time sponsors, Morgan Creek, the film production company, and First Call.
Morgan Creek made the hit movie Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, which Rickman
stole as the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham. First Call, the West End
ticket agency, is an obvious sponsor of the arts but apparently no one had
approached it previously for backing.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Arts: Three premieres - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sense of place can create a potent spell in music. To take English
composers alone, it is difficult not to hear in Elgar's music the rolling
expanses of the Malvern Hills, in Vaughan Williams the pastoral English
countryside, or in Britten's more abrasive style the wind-swept, open vistas
of the Suffolk coast.
In John Casken's music the place is the North of England, the mood
invariably grey and chill. In the works that introduced him to Promenade
audiences in 1986 it was Northumberland that set the scene. This year he has
returned to the North and chosen a disused mine in Weardale as the setting
for his song-cycle Still mine, a BBC commission which had its first
performance at the Royal Albert Hall on Friday.
At best, it is an evocative work, as so much of Casken's music has proved to
be. There are four poems by different authors, but under the influence of an
atmospheric score they combine to make a plausibly unified theme. A man
leaves home to work as a miner in the North and, subsequently exiled for
striking, writes to his wife of hisdreams of returning - a palpable feeling
of remembrance and yearning runs through the cycle.
That emanates from the orchestra, as does most of what is good about this
piece.
The orchestral textures are complex and alluring. The strings form the basic
richness and density of sound; then wind, vibraphone and bells are overlaid
to add brilliance to the surface. But the orchestra is large for a work of
this kind and Casken is not sparing in his use of it, with the result that
the score often sounded overwritten.
The voice simply did not dominate as it should, although that was not the
only reason why. Despite trying to suggest some of the images in the poetry,
the vocal part lacks a strong profile and Thomas Allen's mellifluous singing
of its winding lines gave it none of the punch or variety that might have
created one. The final impression was of a lovely sound-world, but vague,
somewhat monotonous, without any live contact with the poems.
The orchestral part was in the care of Matthias Bamert and the BBC Symphony
Orchestra, who had already given a carefully-detailed performance of
Debussy's La Mer, and the evening ended with an above average account of
Sibelius's Fifth Symphony, which kept its concentration through to a
splendid final peroration.
On Saturday night the BBC Concert Orchestra under Barry Wordsworth
celebrated its 40th birthday with a generous programme of Tchaikovsky,
Milhaud, Gershwin and two new works by Richard Rodney Bennett.
The first, another BBC commission, was unabashed entertainment in the
composer's easy listening mode: Variations on the nursery rhyme 'Over the
hills and far away", served in a sugary sauce and orchestrated with not so
much a nod, as a deep bow to Ravel.
The other was a Concerto for Stan Getz, the saxophone player, who died last
year before he could perform it. The soloist here was John Harle, a virtuoso
and artistic personality equal to the flamboyant music - one foot in jazz,
one in classical - that Bennett has provided. What sounds like American
urban aggression propels the outer movements along vigorously, while the
elegiac centre brings bluesy improvisation. It is a concerto strong on
impact, well crafted to show off its soloist, professional writing in the
best sense.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Arts: Sweet Temptations - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are times when it seems that the arts set out almost deliberately to
give themselves a bad name. Such a reflection occurred as Jan Fabre's Sweet
Temptations passed through London at the weekend on its way to represent
Belgium at Expo in Seville. The best thing about it is the title, which
turns out to be a deceit: there is nothing sweet about the production and
nothing tempting.
Fabre is a young (34) Belgian artist who also has a prolific list of works
for the stage behind him. His This Theatre Like It Was To Be Expected And
Forseen lasted eight hours. Sweet Temptations confines itself to 3 1/2 hours
without an interval and was performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Saturday and Sunday.
The dialogue is in a mixture of English and German - not that it greatly
matters, for there is not a lot of it. Two middle-aged men, probably twins,
sit in wheel-chairs which occasionally revolve round the stage, possibly
reflecting the movement of the planets. Much of the time they sleep. When
they are awake, they talk - very slowly - about owls, appearance and
reality. They repeat, frequently, the line 'times, they are a'changing'.
There are obviously meant to be cerebrally very intelligent: equally
obviously they are bored. Perhaps the boredom is cosmic. There is more than
a touch of Beckett in slow motion.
The point about Beckett, however, is that he knew when to stop, and he did
write plays. About three hours of Fabre's piece is taken up with
distractions. These include the odd military intervention - a symbol, no
doubt, of Europe over the ages, what is described as 'another excuse for a
party' when the piece's many extras repeatedly break into dance, and a good
deal of sex.
The publicity for Sweet Temptations quotes the Guardian as saying that
Fabre's work is 'the toast of the European avant-garde'. If it is still in,
it shows how profoundly, nostalgically reactionary the avant-garde has
become. I saw nothing experimental in Sweet Temptations and no new
frontiers,only a desire to prove that by going on and on, you are somehow
making a point. There is no theatrical virtue in repetitive slowness.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Arts: Michael Jackson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life has proved too much for Michael Jackson; he cancelled his Saturday
concert to the anguish of 72,000 fans. But on Thursday there had been so
signs of trouble. He arrived as Jumping Jack Flash, ejected on to the stage
from below through a blaze of rockets, like the Good Fairy of the Panto; he
left over two hours later as Rocket Man, flying over the earthlings,
projected by his personalised jet pack, symbolically quitting this planet
which is so obviously alien to him.
When the penny finally seems to be dropping among the public that assembling
near a pop star at a vast stadium is marginally less rivetting than watching
Tracey sing 'My Way' on karaoke night at the pub, along comes Jackson, with
a payroll of 235, 1,000 tons of equipment, and an investment equal to the
GNP of Burundi, to prove that while Wembley is hopeless at laying on music
it is a fine setting for spectacle.
The cameos keep coming like prize rock videos. There is Jackson the Monster
Man as he recreates 'Thriller' with dancing skeletons and ghouls; there is
Jackson the hoodlum, gunning down his troupe in a hail of stuttering
crackers at the end of 'Smooth Criminal'; there is even Jackson, the pop
star, gliding and sliding backwards through his Moonwalk to the pulverising
rhythms of 'Billie Jean'. One moment he is hauled on a crane above the
ecstatic fans in 'Beat It'; the next he has literally disappeared, the
crouching heap at the back of the stage turning to nothing while Jackson has
somehow transposed himself to the front.
It helps that the eyes are transfixed because the ears are in for a bad
time. Jackson could profitably spend a million dollars or two fixing the
acoustics, and his voice will never progress beyond the piping. When he is
on stage alone, ruefully feeling his crotch as if searching for the first
signs of puberty, he looks a lost waif.
Only with the bangs and the rockets; the lasers and the ascending and
descending stage; the dancers and the band fleshing him out does Jackson
transform into the mega star of pop. His inspired showmanship sees him
through, especially when he gets the tallest, blondest, thinnest, female
guitarist in the world, dressed of course in the head-dress of a New Guinea
chief, to boogie with him on stage.
But when the images on the vast screens that side the stage show home movies
of the early Jackson Five, and this little black kid stares out at you, you
start at the contrast with the present, at the blanched androgynous sylph
uncomfortably coping with the besotted girl he has rashly hauled on stage
from the crowd. That has become this; that is childhood and perhaps this is
the ultimate kid's party.
And near the end, as a band of children, dressed in costumes of the nations,
hold hands and circulate round a giant inflatable globe in the bathetic
'Heal the World', your heart goes out in a sentimental gush.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading water reclamation works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES has been awarded an Pounds 11.2m contract by
Severn Trent Water for what is believed to be one of the biggest mechanical
and electrical (M&amp;E) contracts to be awarded in the industry this year.
Costain was one of seven companies bidding for the contract to extend and
refurbish the Netheridge Water Reclamation Works which serves most of
Gloucester's city urban area.
Built in the late 1950's, the plant is still geared to its original dry
weather capacity of 17m litres per day (ml/d). With population growth, the
capacity forecast for the year 2001 is 42 ml/d dry weather flow (DWF) which,
together with the need to process waste from a major new food plant,
requires the plant to be upgraded.
At present, Netheridge provides primary treatment only to storm water and
sewage. In order to meet the increased demand and the standards set by the
National Rivers Authority and European Community municipal waste water
directives, secondary treatment will be introduced. The capacity of the
works will be 108 ml/d DWF, with a storm treatment capacity of 235 ml/d.
Costain's work includes the design, supply, installation and testing of all
M&amp;E equipment, including high-voltage electrical supplies and SCADA systems.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Management: Time for a change when energy drains - Avoid
those tasks which get you down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN-LOUIS BARSOUX and ROSEMARY STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time management is about using time effectively and efficiently. Its
theorists believe the way to achieve more is by better organisation.
Contrary to what time management experts would have you believe, the secret
is not about squeezing more work into less time, but about having a vision
of what is possible, and having the stamina to see it through.
Considering how to use time effectively is where 'energy management' comes
in.
There are times when we abound with energy and other times when we have very
little. Some activities and some people enhance one's energy while others
deplete it.
When we are interested, we participate enthusiastically and even feel
revived at the end. When we are bored or frustrated our energy is sapped.
Most managers recognise the feeling that their energy reserves have sprung a
leak. For some it is the rigmarole of meetings which has that effect. For
others it is administrative work or strategic matters.
Some managers find particular types of people wearisome - customers,
salesmen, journalists, foreign counterparts.
Certain types of work have a disproportionate drain on managers - though
managers each differ in what they regard as debilitating. Ideally,
energy-depleting activities need to be minimised - either by limiting one's
involvement or by delegating them to someone who does not mind so much.
But there is another way of making one's energy supply go further, and that
is by increasing the initial stock. Unlike the expenditure of time, our
levels of energy can be replenished.
Some activities leave you 'on a high' afterwards. Some managers thrive on
the pressure of deadlines, others get a buzz from empowering others -
leaving them 'on a roll', ready to take on greater challenges.
But even the most stimulating activities are short-lived. Either the manager
reaches saturation point, or else the activity itself changes form.
There is often a symmetry in what managers like and dislike about their
jobs. They may like the variety of their work but dislike its episodic
nature; or relish the action but be frustrated by the lack of time for
reflection; likes and dislikes are often two sides of the same coin.
So, even where managers can identify something as 'energising', they will
also, at times, seek refuge from that activity. They tend to switch between
tasks to try to top up their energy levels. The sedate and familiar nature
of administrative work might provide welcome relief from the hurly-burly of
strictly managerial work. Technical work - a sales manager selling, a
production manager manufacturing - can be used like a revitalising hobby.
Engaging people in conversation is pleasurable and can provide relaxation in
anticipation of a heavy workload. Each type of work has its regenerative
benefits at different times.
Managers should be sensitive to their energy levels and take heed of the
diminishing return signals which are the cue to withdraw from a particular
activity. When managers can feel themselves drawing upon their energies just
to maintain their efforts at concentration it is time for a change.
Overall, the aim should be to find a balance between excitement and relief,
between exception and routine.
For example, an open door policy throws up varied and unexpected challenges.
But over a whole day, constant interruptions are distracting and exhausting.
The balance might come through setting aside fixed slots when the door will
be open. Grouping activities in this way, can reduce the unpredictability of
management work and with it the mental wear and tear of continually
switching attention.
More often than not, managers have too much to do. They can use their time
much more fruitfully if they keep up their energy level. But consciousness
of when to switch activities and how to boost energy levels would enable
managers to reduce the gap between what they think they should be doing and
what they have time to do. And while ultimate victory will always elude
them, managers will be able to claim that they are winning a bit more often.

FT  03 AUG 92 / People: Laporte loses another director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte, the specialty chemicals group, has lost another director; Keith
Sansom, who had been in charge of strategic planning, resigned last Friday.
'I enjoy running things,' says Sansom, 48, who headed Laporte's Australian
operation for seven years. He is off to explore the possibilities of setting
up his own venture capital chemicals business.
While he claims the parting is 'amicable', chief executive Ken Minton has
seen three resignations from his board in the past 18 months, which leads
analysts to suggest that his management style may have played a role. Hans
Seidl left the board recently, though he is still running Laporte's German
operations; Mike Fearfield left at the beginning of 1991.
Minton strongly denies any pattern. 'When you bring in a new chief operating
officer, you must expect that some directors will look to their future.'
David Wilbraham joined from ICI in April.
Sansom, who joined Laporte in 1968, was sent to Australia in 1980, and
promoted three years later to regional managing director. While there, he
says, he and his family became 'legally and spiritually' Australian
citizens.
Returning to England in 1990 he was put in charge of strategic planning for
the group as well as becoming operational head of metals and electronic
chemicals, and other areas. Asked whether he had regarded himself as a
candidate for Wilbraham's post he commented, 'Yes, two years ago, but
probably no as time went by'. He puts that down to 'style, through to the
shape of the company'.
Bringing in Wilbraham has meant that Minton himself has more time to devote
to strategic planning.
While the company said Sansom was 'returning to Australia in due course',
Sansom explains that might well be ten years off, if his venture capital
business takes off in the UK.

Rank Xerox has appointed Herve Gallaire as director of its new European
Research Centre.
Gallaire's move comes at a time when Rank Xerox is aiming to expand its
presence in Europe. The group recently announced that it was investing 235m
Ecu in manufacturing, development and research in Europe, expanding existing
sites in France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. A new Dutch factory will
open in September. Part of Gallaire's responsibility will be to set up a new
laboratory on mainland Europe, the site of which will be decided in the near
future.
Before joining Rank Xerox, Gallaire was vice president of software
development at GSI, a leading French software company, and has also held the
post of vice president of software development at Bull, the French computer
company. Gallaire set up the European Computer Industry Research Centre in
Munich, as managing director.

Sunleigh, a company which used to make machine tools and welding equipment,
now specialises in electronic golf carts, dinghies, catamarans and
sportswear. Among Sunleigh's customers are the St Andrews golf club, which
it provides with crested sweaters and shirts. To complete its move into the
leisure business, the company, a late 1980s management buy-out from
engineering group Babcock, has appointed Robert Upsdell non-executive
chairman. Upsdell, 58, held the same position at Gavel Securities, makers of
Laser Dinghies and Dart Catamarans. When Sunleigh acquired a majority
interest in Gavel it appointed Upsdell a non-executive director. Upsdell
previously held senior positions at Courage, EMI Leisure and Ladbroke. He
replaces Sandy Saunders.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Management: Stick to your knitting - After ICI's plan to
split in two, Andrew Campbell cautions companies against
over-diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries' plan to divide its business into two is the
strongest evidence yet that big, diversified corporations have had their
day.
By cutting itself up, ICI is following an increasingly popular path. Racal,
Courtaulds, and USX (the old US Steel) have all successfully created value
for shareholders in this way.
Although their motivation may have been to avoid the attentions of corporate
raiders, they have acknowledged that their companies were previously
over-diversified.
The past 12 months have been littered with examples of the dangers of
companies diversifying into too many different areas. British Aerospace
plunged into cars, property, construction and munitions - with such bad
results that the chairman and finance director quit. British Petroleum has
been reversing its unhappy moves into minerals and nutrition in an attempt
to bring some stability to its oil and chemicals businesses. The three most
recent big hostile bids - Ultramar, Hawker Siddeley and Dowty - have also
been examples of excessive diversification.
Managers are constantly being warned against diversifying. The best read
management book - 'In Search of Excellence' by Tom Peters and Robert
Waterman - devotes a chapter to the topic, entitled 'Stick to Your
Knitting'. Peters is not a lonely voice. Most management textbooks, articles
and researchers conclude that diversification is to be treated with caution.
The danger is not diversification in itself, but over-diversification:
managers getting into businesses they do not fully understand.
So why do companies do it? Why do well-intentioned managers risk their own
reputation and the independence of their companies by acquiring businesses
that they do not understand?
The first reason is to spread risk - which often means getting into
businesses that are unfamiliar. Managers are concerned to avoid excessive
focus. 'We mustn't be too dependent on the UK economy.' Or, 'We mustn't have
more than 40 per cent of our portfolio exposed to the building cycle'. Or,
'We are too reliant on sales to Marks &amp; Spencer'.
The desire for a spread of interests is very strong. But for whose benefit
is the manager seeking to spread risks? The shareholder is unlikely to
benefit because fund managers are able to spread risks much more efficiently
than corporate managers.
Neither are the employees likely to gain, because their skills are not
easily transferred from one business to another.
The main beneficiary is the corporate manager who can see greater job
security. If one leg of the business collapses he is still needed to look
after the other legs.
Yet this additional security is a fallacy. By getting into unfamiliar
businesses managers make their jobs less secure. They could protect their
future better by out-performing competitors at businesses they know, rather
than by hedging their bets.
The second cause of over-diversification comes from managers' deeply held
belief in growth. As the board member of one big company said recently: 'If
you don't want to grow your business, you should become a civil servant.'
Growth thinking is not wrong. Shareholders want growth in their investments
and employees like it because it provides career security and advancement
opportunities.
If the prospects for the industry are low growth, managers start looking for
higher growth opportunities.
Unfortunately, when low growth is the motivation for diversification, the
prospects for success are particularly low. Managers of maturing businesses
usually have little experience of other industries; when they are aware of
opportunities elsewhere, those opportunities have often been fully
exploited.
This causes managers to take risks in less familiar areas - the classic
over-diversification problem. It is not surprising, therefore, that the
failure rate is high. Take the oil industry.
Every big oil company lost confidence in the oil industry in the 1970s and
set out to find other, ideally high growth, businesses to exploit. The
record of success, based on 15 years' experience, has been very poor.
If the biggest and best companies in the world, able to attract the best
management talent, hire the best advisers, and spend billions of dollars,
are not able to succeed, it is unreasonable to expect lesser companies to do
better.
So what is the solution? Should managers in mature businesses focus on
managing their own decline? The answer, frequently, is yes. Focusing on
maturity can be far preferable to risking all in unfamiliar areas.
Unless there are growth areas where the company has or could create some
clear advantage, managers should avoid the macho of high-growth objectives.
Investors can be just as content with stable performance and high dividend
yields.
There is no reason why a company should not be ambitious to produce a
performance similar to an undated government bond (ie low growth but secure
returns). Moreover, so long as managers run their businesses better than
other management teams, there is no 'under performance' and hence no room
for a takeover bid. Managing in a stable environment can be attractive to
all stake-holders.
One of the best examples is Crown, Cork &amp; Seal. Spotted as a Harvard
Business School case in the 1970s, it has been a model for others to follow.
Unlike its competitors, Crown did not diversify away from the mature canning
business into higher growth packaging. Instead, Crown focused on becoming
the most flexible and most service-orientated canning company. It invested
in developing countries where canning operations still provided small growth
potential. Excess cash flow was used to pay attractive dividends and buy
back shares. During the 1980s the company bought back more than half its
total issued share capital.
The sense of Crown's strategy was underlined in the late I980s when most of
its US competitors decided to separate their canning operations from their
other packaging businesses through demergers and leveraged buy-outs. This
proved something that Crown managers had known all along  - that canning and
plastic packing do not fit comfortably in one portfolio: the skills needed
in the two businesses are different.
The distaste managers have for managing decline is widespread, and has
provided companies such as Hanson and BTR with easy stepping-stones to the
top of British industry. If the average manager's ego was less tied to
growth we would not need Hanson, Williams Holdings, or KKR to do other
people's dirty work.
Taken together, the fear of excessive focus and the desire for growth are
likely to continue to lead the unwary board of directors into trouble. It is
only by rooting out the woolly thinking that surrounds risk spreading and
growth objectives that directors can keep their companies safe from one of
industry's most deadly diseases.

The CIS team condemned weightlifter Ibragim Samadov for storming out of an

stripping him of his bronze medal and banning him for life.
Officials, who had earlier backed Samadov's claim that he left the rostrum

controversial incident.
'We all regret and are saddened by this case. We condemn such things. You
have to keep yourself in check,' said a spokesman for the team of former

It is win or burst time for Britain in defence of their Olympic men's hockey

secure a semi-final place.
Their 2-1 win over Argentina, courtesy of two first-half goals by Rob Hill,
kept the British defence alive - but Australia are much tougher. They came
into the tournament as one of the favourites and are unbeaten in their four
group A matches. The UK women reached their sem-finals, beating New Zealand.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Results Due
THE TWO largest UK banks, Barclays and National Westminster, announce their
half year results this week, together with Abbey National and Standard
Chartered.
Abbey National's profits today may well disappoint the market, at least by
comparison with the sparkling performances it has given in previous years.
High bad debts will probably push last year's Pounds 308m pre-tax profits
down to around Pounds 270m.
National Westminster tomorrow is likely to report profits not far from last
year's poor performance of Pounds 101m.
Standard Chartered turned in Pounds 83m at the interim stage a year ago.
Forecasts for its latest result on Wednesday range from around Pounds 60m to
slightly above last year's figure.
Barclays' results on Thursday will attract the most attention. Heavy
provisions are likely to drive its half-year figures well below its Pounds
378m pre-tax profit at the half-way stage last year. SG Warburg forecast
profits of only Pounds 120m - a very disappointing figure for the UK's
largest bank.
A dividend cut of up to 50 per cent is widely expected when British
Petroleum reports second quarter figures on Thursday. The June firing of Mr
Robert Horton, chairman and arch-defender of an unchanged dividend, cleared
the way for a more realistic payout. Income on an historic cost basis is
likely to have slumped to about Pounds 100m from Pounds 243m.
Royal Dutch Shell has fared much better and will turn in net income of about
Pounds 520m against Pounds 532m on the same day.
Unilever will report on Friday second quarter pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 490m (Pounds 448m). It will have benefitted from a cut of about
Pounds 20m in interest costs, thanks to debt reduction and from a pick up
from the tough year-earlier quarter. Sales of some products such as perfumes
were depressed then by lower tourism in the wake of the Gulf War.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Economics: Little joy in US indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is unlikely to be much joy for President Bush in this week's string of
US economic indicators. The decision to cancel his holiday and stay in
Washington could look like a good idea as further mediocre news on the
economy emerges.
July employment figures, out on Friday, are unlikely to show any significant
improvement from their depressing condition in June, when non-farm payrolls
fell a shock 117,000. Non-farm pay-rolls should have risen a modest 109,000,
while the unemployment rate should show barely any change from June's 7.8
per cent.
Economists are expecting this week's data to add to the general impression
that the US economy continues to grow in the third quarter, but only
sluggishly, at an annual rate of between 1.5 to 2 per cent.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently that
economic 'momentum' was going to take off in the second half of the year,
but worries about the resilience of the US economy are likely to continue
especially as the election draws nearer, and political uncertainty starts to
worry the markets.
Today's report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers is
expected to point to only a slightly more upbeat assessment of the outlook
among US manufacturers.
The following include some of the other economic events this week. The
figures in brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists'
forecasts.
Today: US, July National Association of Purchasing Managers index (54 per
cent), June construction spending (up 0.2 per cent); UK, July purchasing
managers index; Japan, July foreign exchange reserves.
Tomorrow: US, July leading economic indicators (down 0.2 per cent); UK, July
official reserves (-Dollars 100m).
Wednesday: US, Federal Reserve releases Tan Book for August 18 FOMC meeting,
auto sales July 21-31 (6.6m); Canada, July help wanted index (64.0); West
Germany, July unemployment (up 20,000), June employment (up 5,000), July
vacancies (down 7,000); East Germany, July unemploy-ment, July short-time
work.
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meeting; US, initial claims for week
ended July 25 (420,000), June wholesale trade, money supply data for week
ended July 27; Canada, May leading indicators (flat); Australia, July
employment (up 10,000), July unemployment rate (10.9 per cent).
Friday: US, July non-farm payrolls (up 110,000), July manufacturing payrolls
(up 12,000), July unemployment rate (7.7 per cent), July hourly earnings (up
0.3 per cent), July consumer credit (Dollars 1bn net repayment); Canada,
July unemployment rate (11.5 per cent), July employment growth (up 0.1 per
cent); France, June M3 (up 0.5 per cent).
During the week: Germany, June industrial production (down 0.1 per cent),
June manufacturing output (down 0.2 per cent), June manufacturing orders
(down 0.2 per cent), June trade balance (DM2bn surplus), June current
account (DM3.5bn deficit), June retail sales (down 2 per cent on year);
Denmark, June unemployment (11.2 per cent); Switzerland, July federal CPI
(down 0.3 per cent on month, up 3.9 per cent on year); Netherlands, July CPI
(up 0.5 per cent on month, up 3 per cent on year); Japan, June trade
balance, June current account; Italy, July CPI (up 5.5 per cent on year).

FT  03 AUG 92 / Minister urges employers to combat bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PATRICK McLOUGHLIN, the employment minister, has urged employers to
review their recruitment and promotion policies regularly to ensure that
they are not discriminating against any sector of society.
He was commenting on the publication of a report on the experiences of young
black people of education and the labour market.
The report, funded by the Employment Department, shows that although
proportionally more Asian and black young people continue in education or
vocational training after the age of 16 than their white peers, they have
more difficulty in getting a job.
Young people of Afro-Caribbean and Asian origin make up an increasing
proportion of the potential workforce in the UK, particularly in the inner
cities.
Mr McLoughlin said: 'If British employers are to deal effectively with the
challenges of European and international competition they must utilise the
skills, talents and abilities of all people, irrespective of race, gender or
disability.'
The report shows a high participation rate of young black people in
full-time, post-16 education - 37 per cent of whites, 51 per cent of
Afro-Caribbeans and 67 per cent of Asians. By the third post-compulsory year
the differences were even starker, with more than one in two Asians and more
than one in five Afro-Caribbeans remaining in full-time education, compared
with about 16 per cent of whites.
According to the survey, young black people were not finding their way
successfully into the labour market. Using a model that excluded those in
full-time education and comparing individuals with the same attainment,
education route and parental education, the survey found that for white men
from professional backgrounds the probability of being in employment was 84
per cent, for Afro-Caribbean men with parents in manual occupations the
probability was 70 per cent, and for Asian women with parents in manual
occupations the probability was 51 per cent.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Capital keeps grip on HQs

<TEXT>
LONDON'S dominant position in corporate and financial Britain continues
according to new research, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. That is in spite of
growth in professional services to keep more company headquarters near large
regional cities.
The figures have been compiled by Mr John Dyson, corporate services director
of BWD Securities, the Huddersfield-based stockbroking and financial and
professional services group. Mr Dyson produces BWD's quarterly review of
mainly northern companies, which he has been extending to give a broader
picture of quoted corporate life in the regions.
The picture drawn by his analysis of Britain's corporate structure outside
the south-east is of sizeable clusters of medium-sized quoted companies in
the west Midlands, the Yorkshire and Humberside area and north-west England,
but a thinning out to the north and the west, where the companies are also
smaller.
However, smaller numbers can produce local distortions. In the east
Midlands, for example, the average quoted company is worth Pounds 179m, but
Mr Dyson says that is distorted by Boots in Nottingham, which alone accounts
for 40 per cent of the aggregate value of the 63 quoted companies in the
region.
Mr Dyson said: 'It is possible there may be some change in the balance of
companies between London and the rest of the UK during the 1990s, but there
is thus far only limited evidence for it.'

FT  03 AUG 92 / East Kent seeks assisted status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYMENT blackspots in east Kent are campaigning to become the first parts
of south-east England to be granted assisted-area status to improve job
prospects.
Successive studies have confirmed that east Kent is facing a period of
significant structural change to employment, partly because of the planned
opening of the Channel tunnel next year. That will place such severe
pressure on the local economy that it will find it difficult to respond to
any general uplift in economic performance within the south-east or across
the country as a whole.
The public and private sectors have joined together in an east Kent
initiative under the chairmanship of Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive of
Eurotunnel, to establish a programme for action and to press for the
benefits that assis-ted-area status would bring.
They include infrastructure grants for industrial estates to create jobs,
grants for the capital cost of equipment, regional enterprise grants for
small companies, a greater prospect of developing industrial estates for
sale or rent, and, possibly most valuable of all, a much increased chance of
receiving European Community grants.
Worst affected areas are Thanet, with 14.2 per cent unemployment, Swale
(Sittingbourne and Sheerness) with 11.2 per cent, and Shepway (Folkestone,
Hythe and Romney Marsh) with 10.5 per cent. Dover also expects big job
losses because of the tunnel's effects on ferry and construction jobs and
the effect of the EC single market on Customs employment.
Supporters of the initiative say there is a strong case for assisted-area
status as Thanet, for example, has a higher unemployment rate than 15 of the
21 development areas in England and more than all 26 intermediate areas.
The government is expected to choose recipients of assisted-area status in
the autumn.

FT  03 AUG 92 / N-plant cottage attracts buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AT LEAST one house for sale in Britain looks likely to find a buyer
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even though it has the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant as its
next-door neighbour.
Coombe Cottage, a detached three-bedroomed property with a pink bathroom
suite and imposing views of the Sellafield complex, stands just yards from
the north gate of the vast site and within its 2km emergency evacuation
zone.
Although in a cul de sac, it suffers from heavy traffic at shift changes, as
many hundreds of Sellafield workers drive past.
Yet while appealing properties in quiet avenues all over Britain languish
for lack of buyers, this most bizarrely situated of homes has already
attracted offers, including one just Pounds 2,500 short of its Pounds 47,500
asking price.
Mitchells Lakeland Properties, the estate agents, say the location of the
cottage, the nearest private property to the Sellafield site, has neither
deterred would-be buyers nor deflated the asking price, which at is on a par
with comparable freehold houses elsewhere in West Cumbria. It is understood
that the cottage is being sold by the family of an elderly woman who lived
there until recently.
'There's been quite a lot of interest in it,' the estate agents said. 'We
have a couple of offers on it and it's standing at Pounds 45,000 at the
moment. It's a nice little cottage; it's been very popular.'
British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, owns some formerly private
farms around the site, previously coastal agricultural land. The agents said
BNFL was interested in Coombe Cottage, which has been on the market since
March, but declined to say whether it had made an offer. The company said it
would not automatically buy a property just because it was so near the site.
The keenest buyers would probably have been anti-nuclear groups, which would
have found it ideal as a 'shop window' for protests on Sellafield's
doorstep. The cottage's price has deterred them, though, especially as
recession has dented their income.
'The problem with anti-nuclear activists is they haven't got that sort of
money,' said Ms Janine Allis-Smith of Barrow-in-Furness based Cumbrians
Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (Core). 'It'd be great to buy it just
to have a foothold. But who in their right mind would want to live there?'

<TEXT>
PLANS for an international centre to fight the increasing incidence of
piracy in south-east Asian waters have been scuttled.
The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) had proposed setting up a 24-hour
regional centre in Kuala Lumpur to co-ordinate anti-piracy efforts in waters
off Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. But Indonesia, in
particular, has objected to what it sees as interference in its affairs.
At a Piracy in South-East Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur, Commodore
Sutedjo, director of naval operations and training in the Indonesian navy,
said that as long as piracy occurred within territorial waters, local law
enforcement authorities could carry out counter measures more effectively.
There is alarm at the growing frequency and ferocity of the pirate attacks.
More than 40 incidents have been reported this year in the Strait of Malacca
and in the narrow Phillips channel, off Singapore.
Shipowners say most attacks in the area seem to be carried out by
Indonesians who disappear in the labyrinth of Indonesian islands between
Singapore and Sumatra.
In one incident pirates boarded a supertanker carrying 240,000 tons of crude
oil in the Phillips channel. The crew was tied up and the tanker was left
cruising, unpiloted.
Shipowners have rejected proposals for a toll to keep the region's seas
safe. They say security is the responsibility of the states themselves. It
was reported last week that Indonesia and Singapore had agreed new measures
to combat piracy, including granting each country's marine police and navy
the right of hot pursuit.

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE spokesman of beleaguered Brazilian President Fernando Collor has quit,
the latest blow to a man who is facing serious corruption allegations.
Although the reason for leaving was described as 'purely professional' - a
dispute over the spending of government publicity money - the resignation of
Mr Pedro Luis Rodrigues is a further embarrassment to Mr Collor during the
current crisis.
In an interview with O Globo newspaper yesterday, Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, the
president of the Brazilian Congress, said he now considered the opening of
an impeachment process against Mr Collor 'inevitable'.
Mr Collor has been under fire for two months over his well-documented
financial ties to an allegedly corrupt businessman. In the event of
impeachment the president would be charged with the 'crime of
responsibility' and would need the support of one third of Congress in order
to survive.
The government is now concentrating its efforts on mustering the 168
congressional votes necessary to keep Mr Collor in place, through judicious
use of state money.
Despite the parlous state of the Brazilian budget, over the weekend the
economy minister announced extra finances for projects of the ministries of
transport and social action. After a battle between the ministers, the
political need to spend seems to be winning out over the economic need to
cut caused by a 10.4 per cent real drop in tax revenue in the first half of
this year and continued failure to meet the targets of its programme with
the IMF.

Thousands of people lined up to vote for a new leader in the former

presidential ballot since 1963, AP reports from Brazzaville.
Voting was slow but peaceful, except for one incident in which young people
attacked a police station they said was holding the national identity cards
they needed to vote.
Among leading contenders is discredited President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the
former Marxist military ruler who was stripped of all but ceremonial powers
last year by a national conference for democracy. It accused him of
assassinating opponents and stealing state money, but decided to forgive
him. He retains the support of the army and has been locked in a power
struggle with Prime Minister Andre Milongo, another contender who has led an
interim government to organise elections.

Violence and vote-buying marred the first of Nigeria's presidential

Violence erupted in Borno state in the north, where agents for some of the

openly distributed cash, the radio said. In Katsina state, also in the
mainly Moslem north, the independent Sunday Champion said: 'Agents of some
candidates watched helplessly as the electoral process was being raped.'
Primaries arranged by the left-of-centre Social Democratic Party (SDP) and
the conservative National Republican Convention (NRC), both created by the
army, were held in five states on Saturday. Similar exercises will be
conducted on the next five Saturdays until all 30 states of the federation
are covered.
The two winners will contest a December 5 presidential poll.

MEXICO yesterday put its democratic reforms to the test in elections in six
states, AP reports from Durango. As the polls opened yesterday morning, the
conservative opposition National Action party (PAN), fresh from victory last
month in the border state of Chihuahua, held high hopes of adding another
governorship in Durango, just to the south.
Elections for governor were also being held in four other states, while Baja
California voters were choosing mayors and a state legislators. A series of
opposition victories could cause tension within the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI). The Chihuahua victory was only the second
gubernatorial victory by an opposition party in any of Mexico's 31 states
since the PRI was formed in 1929.
Some polls showed the two parties neck and neck in Durango. The PAN
candidate, former Durango city Mayor Rodolfo Elizondo, is also backed bythe
leftist Democratic Revolution Party. He was opposed by Mr Maximiliano
Silerio Esparza, former head of the national peasants' union and of the
federal land reform agency. The Baja California election is the first
statewide election held in modern Mexico under an opposition party. The
government recognised the 1989 victory of Governor Ernesto Ruffo of PAN.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Boost for Amato as Italians agree to end indexation of wages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE agreement to abolish Italy's scala mobile wage indexation system
represents the second boost in a week for the new prime minister, Mr
Giuliano Amato.
Struggling with a mere 16-seat parliamentary majority, Mr Amato turned the
country's beleaguered economic position to his advantage in reaching the
accord with unions and employers on revising the pay system, which links
wage rises to inflation. In doing so, he achieved what the much stronger
government of his predecessor, Mr Giulio Andreotti, had failed to do in much
longer negotiations this time last year.
Coupled with his success in pushing through parliament a L30,000bn (Pounds
14.1bn) package of spending cuts and revenue increases last week, Mr Amato
had a firmer foundation for his appeal yesterday to foreign investors not to
sell the lira and to give his government time to push through crucial
reforms.
Mr Franco Reviglio, the budget minister, described the government's approach
as 'shock therapy' to improve the competitiveness of Italian industry
compared with its European Community partners. Italy needed a high degree of
responsibility and a political consensus to avoid 'a very serious financial
crisis', he said.
Mr Amato still has much more to achieve if he is to restore confidence in
the Italian economy and enable the country to meet its commitments under the
Maastricht treaty for economic and monetary union. The agreements reached on
Friday night have to be fleshed out, and some aspects of the deal, such as
the public sector tariffs freeze, could conflict with other aspects of
government policy, such as privatisation.
Bankers say a tariff freeze would make state companies such as the
generating authority, less profitable, and less attractive to investors.
While last week's approval in the lower house of parliament for the
government's emergency budget, designed to cut L30,000bn from the deficit,
was a major step, the real battle for Mr Amato will come next month, when
draconian measures are expected to be introduced to try to reduce state
spending as part of the 1993 budget.
Mr Amato further strengthened his government's credibility on Saturday,
naming former premier Mr Emilio Colombo as foreign minister. The 72-year-old
Mr Colombo is widely respected for his European Community credentials.

out of sight for years yet, institute says

WEST GERMAN inflation, the key to the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, is
not expected to approach the central bank's target of 2 per cent until the
second half of the decade, according to the Ifo economics research institute
in Munich.
It will be 'difficult' to hold consumer price increases significantly below
3 per cent before then, the institute says in a medium-term forecast
released today.
As a result there will be 'only a little' relaxation of monetary policy for
the time being. The institute, one of Germany's leading independent research
centres, rules out any cuts in interest rates in the immediate future.
The study's findings suggest that other European governments, clamouring for
relief from the Bundesbank's strictures, may have to wait longer than
expected, or find ways to stimulate domestic economic activity without
relying on reduced German interest rates.
From just under 4 per cent this year, average German inflation should
stabilise near 3.5 per cent during 1993, easing further as the decade
progresses to between 2 and 3 per cent.
The next few years will be characterised by 'a moderate but climbing growth
trend in the west and a permanent recovery process in the east'.
Pan-German growth will average 3 per cent a year, picking up from the 1.25
per cent expected this year. Increased competition for goods and labour,
combined with stability-oriented monetary and financial policies, should
keep inflation under better control.
Even so, the report warns, 'the risk of a loss of stability is still present
in the west because of the current conflicts between monetary, finance and
pay policy'.
But the greatest problem, it claims, will come from the labour market in
east Germany. Projections suggest that, after a further dip next year to
5.5m, the number of people productively employed will not increase for the
next seven years. This implies unemployment rates of about 20 per cent,
against 17 per cent at present.
Urging renegotiation of union agreements which have promised most employees
wage parity with the west by 1994-95, the report says that high pay will
discourage potential investors and worsen the already grim outlook for job
prospects.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Price flaws undermining EC's single market hopes: With
internal borders soon to fall, why should the same electrical goods cost 30
per cent more in Spain than Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL THE companies which have agitated for faster European economic
integration, none has done so for longer or more loudly than Philips, the
large Dutch electronics manufacturer. Indeed, Philips claims to have
invented the idea of the single European market, and top executives have
repeatedly called for its speedy realisation.
Yet, when it comes to applying the single market's central principles -
total liberalisation of trade and unrestricted price competition across EC
borders - Philips' business practices appear to diverge from its lofty
rhetoric.
The company freely admits the trade prices it charges for the same products
vary, though it will not say by how much. It also says it supplies products
to dealers only for sale in their own countries and refuses to supply them
for re-export to other EC countries - so-called parallel importing.
'If an authorised Philips dealer in Italy asked us to sell him products in
the Netherlands, we would tell him, very politely, that we have a
distributor in Italy and he should buy his products there,' said Mr Jack
Reemers, a spokesman at Philips' Eindhoven headquarters. Mr Reemers said
Philips had no intention of changing its approach once the single market
took effect at the end of this year by unifying its prices across the EC.
'What have unified prices got to do with the single market?,' he said,
adding that the company planned to continue existing policies 'until the end
of the world'.
The European Commission strongly opposes parallel import restrictions which
segment the EC market and can impose heavy penalties. Earlier this year, it
fined Dunlop Slazenger International Ecu5m (Pounds 3.5m) for limiting
exports of tennis balls from Britain to other parts of the EC.
Brussels is also investigating price disparities in the car industry.
However, its legal armoury is limited by the competition powers given it in
the Rome Treaty. Normally, it can act against restrictive distribution
practices only when it has solid evidence proving illegal agreements or
contracts, or the abuse of a dominant position.
Some companies have already moved unprompted to harmonise European prices.
Compaq, a US personal computer maker, says it seeks to limit variations for
most of its products to no more than 5 per cent around a central price.
Lego, the Danish toymaker, Mars, the US confectionery and petfood
manufacturer, and Rank Xerox, the office equipment supplier, have taken
similar measures.
But in consumer electronics, wide price differentials are far from unique to
Philips, according to electrical retailers. They say the prices of leading
brands such as Grundig of Germany and Panasonic and Sony of Japan also vary
substantially.
Expert International and Euronics, two pan-European associations of small
electrical retailers, say the prices of many of these companies' products
are 25-35 per cent higher in Italy and Spain than in Germany and the
Netherlands.
As the table indicates, the differences can in some cases be 50 per cent or
more. The brand names and model numbers of the products were supplied to the
Financial Times but have not been published, at Expert's request.
Expert has conducted quarterly trade price surveys since 1989, based on
actual prices paid by its 2,500 affiliated dealers in 14 countries. The
surveys do not cover Britain, because Expert has no members there, though UK
prices are generally considered among the lowest in Europe.
Mr Wim van den Toorn, Expert's managing director, said exceptionally high
trade prices depressed dealers' margins. Though he had repeatedly asked
manufacturers to harmonise prices and to allow Expert to buy centrally on
behalf of all its dealers, he had made no progress. Panasonic said it knew
of no such request.
A Panasonic spokesman and Mr Knud Thomsen, European sales manager of
Grundig, which is 32 per cent owned by Philips, said Expert's calculations
exaggerated the price differentials. However, Mr Thomsen would give no
figures of his own, saying he did not know by how much Grundig's prices
varied across Europe.
Philips says it sets prices to meet varying local competitive conditions,
while Grundig and Panasonic say their prices reflect national differences in
taxes, distribution and other costs. But Mr Thomsen would not say how much
such costs amounted to, arguing that this was confidential information.
Mr van den Toorn is unconvinced by these arguments. Though he concedes
special taxes distort prices, he claims variations in the costs of
distribution, transport and manufacturers' contributions to after-sales
service give rise to differences of less than 5 per cent in prices across
Europe.
'We know what the costs are. We ship goods to our dealers using the same
transport companies, trucks and roads as our suppliers,' he said.
He and other retailers complain price differentials are maintained by
obstacles to cross-border product flows. 'Suppliers never say explicitly in
their dealership agreements that you can't make parallel imports,' he said.
'But if you know the business, you can read between the lines. And what the
suppliers are saying is 'we can make life very difficult for you.'
'If we bought Philips or Sony products in the Netherlands and sold them in
Spain, the suppliers would boycott our dealers. Or maybe they would be told
that certain spare parts they needed would be out of stock.'
Mr van den Toorn's fears are shared by Mr Marcel Vloemans, head of Euronics
which, unlike Expert, has tried to make parallel imports. It is currently
trying to buy 10,000 Philishave razors in the Netherlands for dealers in
Italy, where Mr Vloemans says the price is 20 per cent higher.
However, Mr Vloemans says such attempts have repeatedly run into outright
refusal or resistance. 'If I buy products for parallel imports, suppliers
won't do repairs, send spare parts or provide service manuals. They can also
threaten to remove dealer discounts,' he said.
Mr Vloemans said Euronics had tried to telephone senior executives of
manufacturers to discuss his problems, but has been told they were out and
his calls have not been returned. Mr Reemers said he knew of no such calls.
Mr van den Toorn complains that lack of EC-wide product guarantees and
manufacturers' insistence that dealers supply the serial numbers of products
and their purchasers' names and addresses also make it easy to control
parallel imports.
Some manufacturers which distribute exclusively or selectively through
designated dealers register the agreements with the European Commission,
which prohibits them from restricting parallel imports.
However, such arrangements are rare in the consumer electronics industry.
Brussels says only Grundig and Saba, owned by the French Thomson group,
currently have EC-approved agreements in force. Mr van den Toorn says they
are not strict enough.
Grundig's 15-year-old agreement is due to expire shortly. Mr van den Toorn
plans to write to the Commission, providing information about price
differentials and asking that Grundig's new agreement explicitly require the
company to allow parallel imports.
The attitude of the Commission - and manufacturers - is not yet clear. But
unless changes happen, some consumers in the EC will continue to pay more
than others for the same products - and the grand idea of a single market
will stay on the drawing board.

THE Polish parliament approved constitutional amendments at the weekend
giving greater powers to the president and prime minister, agencies report
from Warsaw.
The Sejm (lower house) adopted the so-called small constitution by 241 votes
to 55, with 55 abstentions. The vote was just seven votes above the
two-thirds majority needed to pass the amendments, which redefine relations
between the government, president and parliament.
The package aims to prevent conflicts between the president and the
government such as those which accompanied the short-lived goverment of Mr
Jan Olszewski, formed in December 1991 and dismissed by the Sejm in June.
However, while the amendments allow the president to appoint a cabinet, they
prevent him from dismissing it.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Pursuit of price stability may prove a fruitless task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED EXCHANGE RATES may bring greater economic stability, although the
present turbulence within the European exchange rate mechanism suggests the
case is not clear-cut. They certainly produce headaches for politicians. As
the calls for a devaluation mount, and in the face of a persistently
stagnant economy, British government ministers have been driven to ever more
emphatic defences of the present parity and commitments to economic
austerity. Mr John Major's recently declared goal of reaching a zero
inflation rate by the next general election is the latest and most extreme
example.
The Euro-consensus around the desirability of 'price stability' may already
have passed its zenith. Yet even proponents of 'price stability' stop short
of advocating zero inflation as a serious goal for policy, being satisfied
instead with a measured inflation rate of between 0 and 2 per cent a year.
Even if the average price level is stable, improvements in the quality of
goods and changes in relative prices mean that any given basket of consumer
goods may well be rising.
Zero or negative inflation rates were once the norm. Money prices in both
the US and the UK in the 1920s were roughly the same as a century before.
More recent history suggests that Mr Major's target will prove elusive. Zero
inflation has been a rare occurrence for the world's most powerful economies
in recent decades. Germany has had zero or negative inflation rates for just
12 months in the past 30 years. Japan has managed just six months since
1970.
A positive inflation rate does not appear to have hampered Japan's growth
record. There is, in fact, no link between low or stable inflation and rapid
economic growth. Some countries fit the popular caricature: the UK has a
toothless central bank and a post-1945 record of high and variable inflation
and sluggish economic growth. But while countries with relatively
independent central banks - including the US, Japan and Germany - do tend to
have lower and more stable inflation rates, they are no more likely to have
high or stable growth rates.
Even successful independent central bankers appear willing to tolerate a
positive inflation rate. The Bundesbank, whose anti-inflation credentials
are unquestioned, has delivered inflation rates in excess of 2 per cent for
much of the past three decades. One reason is that, while inflation can be
costly, particularly if it is unstable or if savers cannot index-link their
capital, it may bring benefits, too.
The less compelling argument for a moderate and stable inflation rate is
that it acts as a lubricant, allowing companies to change relative prices
and wages without having to impose price and wage cuts. More important, a
positive inflation rate allows central bankers, if they choose, to cut
nominal interest rates to the inflation rate or below, making the real
interest rate negative. Companies can, in principle, cut nominal wages, but
nominal interest rates can never be negative, making inflation a
precondition of negative real rates.
When might negative real interest rates be desirable? When an economy is so
lumbered by accumulated debts that individuals are unwilling or unable to
spend and companies will not invest. The US economy has found itself in such
a debt trap, and the Federal Reserve has responded by cutting short-term
interest rates so far that real interest rates are now barely positive. Many
US economists argue that the Fed should go further and make short-term real
rates negative.
The UK economy is also abnormally burdened by debts. So the cost of trying
to achieve a zero inflation rate may be even higher than the half a million
more job losses that OECD calculations imply it would normally take to
reduce UK inflation to zero from its current level. UK short-term interest
rates remain above 10 per cent, implying real interest rates of 6 per cent.
With German interest rates unlikely to fall this year, the only route to
lower real rates in the UK would be through higher inflation. Lower
inflation may impede rather than speed recovery.
