FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (7): A truly global
competitor - Profile, Asea Brown Boveri
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<TEXT>
ASEA of Sweden and Brown Boveri of Switzerland kicked off the late 1980s
round of concentration in the world power plant industry by merging in 1988
to form ABB Asea Brown Boveri.
The Swedish-Swiss group then made another big step in 1989, taking over
Combustion Engineering in the US.
The effect, says Mr Goran Lundberg, executive vice president in charge of
power plants, has been to transform the new group from a mainly European
force to a truly global supplier that is the clear runner up to General
Electric of the US with sales last year totalling Dollars 5.7bn. Mr Lundberg
says that orders last year were roughly equally split among Asian, European
and American customers.
The power plant business is ABB's largest division, and accounted for about
a fifth of the group's overall sales of Dollars 28.9bn last year.
The division has grown especially quickly in the past year. In the six
months to April, it took in Dollars 5bn in orders compared with Dollars
6.4bn in the whole of 1991 and only Dollars 2.8bn in 1988.
It has admittedly been operating in a strong market during most of this
period. Mr Lundberg estimates that the total world market has grown from
about 30 gigawatts (1 gigawatt equals 1,000 megawatts) in 1988 to a likely
45 to 50 gigawatts this year.
He believes rationalisation is still the order of the day. In the mid 1980s,
there were 10 steam turbine makers in Europe with capacity to supply 120
gigawatts of new equipment per year.
Now only five suppliers remain and Mr Lundberg estimates that capacity,
including eastern European suppliers, is down to about 90 gigawatts. 'We
still have some things to do,' he says. ABB itself still has a bewildering
array of factories in Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Norway,the US and
Poland.
ABB is almost a full line supplier. It has two nuclear technologies, one
inherited from its Swedish subsidiary (the boiling water reactor or BWR) and
the other acquired with Combustion Engineering in 1989. CE is one of the US
PWR technology holders.
The group also makes coal and gas fired plants, hydro plants, boilers, steam
turbines and heavy duty gas turbines. The one technology it lacks is the
currently popular aero engine-derived gas turbine, used frequently in
combined heat and power generating plants.
Mr Lundberg does not seem worried about this gap, claiming that the
aero-engine derived market is 'very small', accounting for only about 4 per
cent of the total market.
ABB's strategy has three main components. The group tries to match its
products to customer needs. It invests heavily on innovative environmental
control systems for its plants and it tries to do its part to contribute to
the much needed rationalisation of the industry.
Mr Lundberg says the shape of the industry is changing rapidly. 'In the mid
1980s, everyone was a regional actor. Today, the survivors are working in
the global market.'
He believes the four largest groups - General Electric and Westinghouse of
the US, Siemens of Germany and ABB - will gradually pull away from smaller
competitors because of the growing level of investment required to stay
competitive.
Interestingly, he does not consider GEC-Alsthom, the British-French joint
venture, as a separate competitor, but part of the GE family. Similarly,
Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan are in the GE family, and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries is with Westinghouse, although it now appears to have the lead of
the Westinghouse family.
The customer side is changing also, as large utilities are broken up and new
ones enter the business. Mr Lundberg says they talk to each other more than
traditional customers did, and have become more demanding. Also, in most
countries, there are fewer and fewer distortions to open competition created
by governments.
ABB is particularly proud of its drive to make power generation a more
environmentally friendly process. 'The market is asking suppliers to make
big investments in efficiency and environmental protection, and we have been
able to keep our spending relatively high,' Mr Lundberg says.
ABB as a whole spends 8 per cent of its sales on research and development,
and Mr Lundberg points out that the power plant division, being the largest
in the group, has a big budget.
The group has set up a joint venture with Japan's Ishikawajima Harima
Industries (IHI) to market the pressurised fluidised bed reactor - an idea
first explored by British Coal in the 1970s - to provide a more complete
combustion of coal. It claims that emissions from these burners are well
below the most severe requirements - 10 parts per million of sulphur
dioxide, less than 50 ppm of NOx, and virtually no carbon. 'The dream was to
have a zero emission plant. We now call it a zero environmental impact
plant,' Mr Lundberg says. So far, the joint venture has won two orders for
the technology. 'We want to refine the system further and improve its
operating economy. There is already 10 per cent less consumption than in a
normal coal plant and we are aiming at taking out another 10 per cent.'
ABB has also led in removing NOx emissions from gas fired plants. 'We have
got it down to 10 to 15 ppm which is well below the 25 ppm standard.
Obviously, a major focus of research effort is on eliminating carbon dioxide
emissions, and Mr Lundberg thinks the most promising avenue is through
improvements in net efficiency.
ABB's other thrust has been into eastern Europe, and Poland in particular,
where it has made a number of acquisitions in the past two years and now
employs some 10,000 people.
ABB has found that it could bring manufacturing standards up to western
standard quite quickly. In particular, it has transferred gas turbine
technology and now uses Poland as a low cost source of machinery for world
markets.
ABB said in May that it was still expecting a difficult year and that
profits would probably not grow above last year's level. However, in June,
it announced a huge Dollars 1.8bn order for an oil and gas fired power
station and seawater desalination plant in Abu Dhabi. Its own share of the
contract would be close to Dollars 1bn, and it may well be that this and
other orders could make the year end better than expected.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (5): Even world leaders
need friends - Profile, General Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWERFUL combination of strategic alliances, technology leadership and
manufacturing expertise has helped General Electric (GE) retain its position
at the top of the generating equipment league throughout the upheaval of the
1970s and 1980s.
The US company is determined to keep it that way.
By most standards, the numbers generated by GE's power business are
impressive: the world's biggest installed base, with more than 12,000
operating turbine-generators in more than 80 countries; and 4,725 gas
turbines installed or on order - four times more than its nearest
competitor.
Last year, GE Industrial and Power Systems, of which power generation is the
most important part, was the US industrial group's fastest-growing business,
with revenues rising 7 per cent to more than Dollars 6.2bn.
The global reach of GE in power generation is illustrated by recent orders,
and might suggest that winning new business is a push-over for the
Schenectady-based concern. In Japan, for example, where US engineering
companies have traditionally found it hard to make headway, GE - working
closely with Japanese business associates Hitachi and Toshiba - is building
the world's largest combined-cycle power plant for Tokyo Electric Power
Company: a 2,800MW leviathan, scheduled to be completed in 1995.
A much smaller order, but equally significant in its own way, was announced
in March: a Dollars 16m contract, won with Elin Energieversorgung of
Austria, for two 40MW turbines to power a combined-cycle plant at Linz.
In fact, in a complex business heavily influenced by trade politics and
national prejudices, nothing is easy, even for a world leader.
GE has long recognised the need for partnerships to help it penetrate
markets which otherwise would be closed.
For GE the key to building a network of 57 business associates and licensees
worldwide, and to winning orders in markets such as Japan, is technology
leadership.
'If I lose that it all crumbles to nothing,' says Mr David Genever-Watling,
senior vice-president at GEIPS.
This is particularly true in the gas turbine business, where GE has clearly
benefited from the spin-off effect of aero-engine research and development.
Overall, with the help of its friends, GE has won about 50 per cent of
worldwide power generating equipment business for many years. And over the
past three years, it has made three important alliances to help overcome
trade barriers in Europe.
A series of agreements with Elin, last year, covers joint generator
development; these are seen as a stepping stone to power equipment deals in
eastern Europe.
Earlier this year GE signed a manufacturing and marketing deal with
Germany's Blohm &amp; Voss, covering both steam turbine and combined-cycle power
plants.
But the most important relationship in Europe is between GE and European Gas
Turbines, the subsidiary of Anglo-French GEC Alsthom. GE and EGT have
co-operated on development of the world's most powerful gas turbine, the
50-hertz Frame 9F, which has spearheaded GEC Alsthom's recent string of
successes in European contract battles.
The first commercial 9F, manufactured at EGT's factory at Belfort, in
France, is scheduled to enter service at Electricite de France's
Gennevilliers power station later this year. GE and EGT are also
co-operating in the development of low NOx combustion systems to reduce
emissions levels for GE Frame 3 and Frame 5 gas turbines; the new versions
will be available from 1994.
Along with other relationships in Europe (which have already included John
Brown Engineering of Scotland, Kvaerner Eureka of Norway, Thomassen of the
Netherlands and Italy's Nuovo Pignone), these deals enabled GE and its
partners to claim 62 per cent of the orders for gas turbines in Europe last
year.
The European steam turbine market, however, is a different matter.
Technologically, it is much more difficult for any company to gain an edge
in a relatively mature business. Thus, local buying preferences prevail. GE
has not sold a steam turbine in Europe since the days of the Marshall Plan,
but is working hard to change that.
Developments in GE's business associate relationships show clearly where GE
sees its priorities for the 1990s. Apart from the Blohm &amp; Voss deal, the
other important agreement announced this year involved Korea Heavy
Industries &amp; Construction (KHIC). Already a GE steam turbine business
associate, KHIC became the 10th gas turbine business associate in January.
The deal provides for both companies jointly to manufacture turbines based
on GE designs, and also allows GE-designed gas turbines, built solely by
KHIC, to be marketed in the Republic of Korea.
For Mr Genever-Watling, Korea is part of the industrial world - along with
western Europe, North America, Japan, Taiwan and Australia - where the issue
for GE is 'execution", holding on to its market shares.
He divides most of the rest of the world three ways. South-east Asia is
coupled with Mexico as the fastest growth opportunities of the 1990s -
requiring the company to 'shift its centre of gravity.' Earlier this year,
for example, GE reorganised its international operations, establishing a new
GEIPS Asian office in Singapore under Mr Donald Kucza, who has been with GE
for 25 years.
The Middle East, Turkey and Iran are grouped together as priority
lesser-developed markets for selective exports - via business associates, if
necessary for political or trade reasons.
This leaves what Mr Genever-Watling calls the mega-markets of the year 2,000
 -China, India, Eastern Europe and the CIS. Here, he says, the approach
needed now is to 'lay foundations.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (4): Two cheers for
competitive bidding - New EC power plant rules raise US fears of 'Fortress
Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JANUARY 1, a new era will begin for the power generating equipment
industry and its clients in Europe when the European Community's
controversial Utilities Directive comes into force, opening up public
procurement contracts in the energy sector to competitive bidding.
Most European suppliers believe the changes will, ultimately, sweep away the
sometimes cosy relationships between EC utilities and domestic suppliers. US
suppliers, however, remain deeply worried by the Directive, and particularly
its so-called 'Fortress Europe' provisions.
Certainly the long-standing links between customers and heavy plant
suppliers, often encouraged by national governments which saw heavy
engineering as an integral part of industrial policy, are unlikely to
disappear overnight. The pace of change and the need for it may also vary
considerably from one country to another.
The Utilities Directive was pushed through by the European Commission in
autumn 1990, in the face of considerable opposition by some national
governments. Removing obstacles to transparency and fairness in public
procurement was identified as a key prerequisite for a properly functioning
Single Market.
Electricity supply is an important area of public procurement - spending on
energy and water-related contracts accounts for 17 per cent of EC public
procurement as a whole. The Commission sees a clear link between the
historic lack of intra-EC trade in power generating equipment and
procurement practices.
The basic rules of the Utilities Directive seem plain enough. Any supply
contract worth Ecu400,000 or more (other than for telecommunications) and
any works contract worth Ecu5m or more fall within the scope of the
Directive, which sets strict rules for the publishing of the contract, the
tendering process, and the criteria for the award of the contract - whether
on lowest price or as the most 'economically advantageous' for the customer.
Utilities can also decide to use one of three contract award procedures: an
open method where all suppliers or contractors can submit tenders;
restricted procedures for candidates invited by the customer; and negotiated
procedures where the customer consults suppliers or contractors of its
choice and negotiates with one or more.
In both the restricted and negotiated procedures, however, there must be
enough potential suppliers to ensure adequate competition.
The thorny issues of contract specification and technical standards, which
have hitherto often been used by some countries as a non-tariff barrier to
trade, are addressed by measures enabling potential suppliers to obtain
enough information to meet the customers' requirements.
By the same token, suppliers will have to pay more attention to standards
than previously, and in particular to European-wide standards, because these
will be used to define the technical specification to be used in the
invitation to tender.
Even in the final months before its implementation, interpreting the
Directive is a difficult, and sensitive issue. At a recent London conference
on contracting in the new power industry, Mr Ernest Walker, European adviser
of the Institute of Purchasing and Supply, suggested two reasons why
contractors and suppliers are unwilling to speak publicly on how they plan
to respond to the procurement directives.
The first was ignorance of their contents and an unwillingness to disclose
this publicly, while the second was an unwillingness to risk losing a
competitive advantage to others.
Mr Walker also put forward two reasons why equipment suppliers should have
an adequate knowledge of the procurement directives.
First, a supplier might find himself in a contractual situation, such as a
management contract, where he is the agent of the client, and would then
have to apply the directives in the same way that the client does. Secondly,
knowledge of the directives will help a supplier know if he has been wrongly
treated by a client. He will then be able to seek conciliation or initiate
other remedial action.
This would be taken via the separate EC Remedies Directive, which will
provide legal sanctions against companies - effectively, against both
customers and suppliers - who fail to observe the Directive. 'Contracting
entities will be exposed to financial risk if they don't comply,' says Ms
Helen Charlton, a partner in the EC and Competition Group at the law firm
Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens.
For non-EC suppliers, the biggest problem in the Directive is two key
provisions collectively known as Fortress Europe.
Customers can reject a bid with less than 50 per cent of European content,
and must prefer the European bid where it is no more than 3 per cent dearer
than the best bid from overseas.
According to Ms Charlton, the Fortress Europe provision has significant
implications for non-EC suppliers. Indeed the major US suppliers, led by
General Electric of the US, are deeply worried by this aspect of the
Directive.
In this, they are supported by the US government, which has said that it
will seriously consider sanctions if the contentious Article 29 is enacted,
thus discriminating against US companies. The US industry is hoping that a
deal between the US and EC at Gatt level could lead to an amendment to
Article 29 removing US suppliers from its scope.
Ms Charlton points out that the '3 per cent' rule is itself open to
different interpretations: is the difference to be based on the higher or
the lower price? The UK draft legislation, intended to implement the
Directive, takes the less protectionist stance by basing the calculation on
the lower price.
A second problem is the fact that the Utilities Directive excludes
'services,' which could cause difficulty with turnkey contracts where much
of the value is based on supply of knowhow rather than equipment. The
Directive applies to siting and installation services, but is to be amended
to include services, though probably not by January 1.
Among more general issues for equipment suppliers raised by the legislation,
the extra cost of bidding is also important. Any further rise in bidding
costs - which already exceed Pounds 1m for a turnkey power station or Pounds
500,000 for supplying a batch of gas turbines or boilers - increases the
pressure on equipment producers to guess which projects are likely to
produce real orders.
A further question is the extent to which the public procurement directives
cut across other trends in the relationship between suppliers and customers
in the power industry, such as single sourcing or long-term partnering
agreements.
As usual in the power equipment industry, the introduction of the Directive
will require suppliers to keep well-tuned political antennae.
Dr Eugene Zeltmann, manager of trade and industry associations at GE
Industrial and Power Systems, made clear at the London conference that for
non-EC based suppliers, the use of strategic alliances to help break down
trade barriers remains crucially important.
At the same time, GE and its allies continue to seek ways to 'chip away at
the bricks in protectionist walls'.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (2): Engines for faster
economic development - The build-up of Asian power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reforms sweeping through developing Asia's state-dominated electricity
supply industry are expected to spur demand for more western-supplied power
equipment well into the next century.
The shakeup centres on the restructuring and commercialisation of largely
inefficient state utilities and the entry into the electricity supply field
of independent power producers to compete with national power companies.
Hand-in-hand with this is an accelerated programme to cut electricity tariff
subsidies and make such tariffs more commercial.
These reforms are being actively promoted by the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and the various bilateral aid institutions, such as Japan's
Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund. They stress that growing
commercialisation of Asia's power sector will broaden the financial base of
those countries most in need and will make it more possible for them to
continue to build up their power programmes to fuel economic growth.
The ADB recently pointed out that developing Asia's electricity capacity
will have to be increased by 300,000 MW in the 1990s if the region is to
maintain its economic growth, now running at around six per cent a year.
This would mean a doubling of existing capacity for a region comprising
3.1bn people, 58 per cent of the world's population. By comparison, the US
has 600,000 MW of capacity, and its population is 240m.
Mr James Rockett, the ADB's senior energy specialist, recently said this
would require a capital investment of about Dollars 501bn each year, all the
more reason for spurring privatisation. The ADB had lent Dollars 9.2bn to
the energy sector since 1969, and annual lending to the sector was now so
large that this figure would be eclipsed in only a few years at current
rates of lending.
The share of all Bank funds for the sector last year climbed by 10
percentage points to 36 per cent compared with 1990, Mr Rockett said. World
Bank lending last year to the power sector stood at Dollars 992m, and its
Asian energy loans this year were surging ahead and should easily surpass
last year's.
The various reforms imply that private sector growth will come from thermal
power stations, which can be put up relatively quickly by independent power
companies, depending on size. There will be much thermal power growth under
the long-range plans of state utilities as well.
Nuclear, particularly in the cash-rich Asian Far East, and hydro-electric
capacity, notably in China and India, also will be expanded.
But these also are longer-term projects that must run the gamut of
regulatory approvals. They are not private-sector friendly. The
pro-privatisation legislative changes have been spearheaded by Pakistan,
India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, all of which are now
pushing open their doors, to varying degrees, to independent power
producers. For its part, China in recent years has contracted out to several
Hong Kong companies, particularly Hopewell Holdings and New World
Development Group, the construction of coal-fired power stations in
Guangdong province.
Almost without exception, the reforming nations have announced plans to
nearly double capacity by the end of the century. The challenge was
underlined by India's Energy Minister, Mr Shri Kalp Nath Rai. He told a
recent Financial Times electricity conference in Singapore that India needed
to add 48,000 MW of capacity (it now has 69,000 MW) in the next five years,
but only 31,000 could be afforded out of state funds. 'The rest will have to
come from the private sector.'
The combination of big aid flows and the new ingredient of privatisation is
prompting aggressive sales drives by the world's leading producers of
turbines and boilers.
The usual modus operandi of such companies as Siemens/Kraftwerk Union of
Germany, the European ABB group; the Anglo-French GEC/Alsthom, the American
majors Westinghouse Electric and General Electric has been to establish
joint ventures with regional companies, such as India's Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd. (Siemens), for local manufacture of low- to
medium-technology turbine equipment. This would ease pressure on foreign
exchange.
This practice is now about to change, with big equipment suppliers now
poised to start taking equity stakes in Asian private power projects. Mr.
According to Andreas Kley, group executive manager for Siemens/KWU: 'The
trend towards non-utility power plants ..has encouraged our group to augment
our traditional role as a builder and now to participate actively as partner
and investor in the planning and development of independent power plants.'
The emerging consensus is that Asia's growth will focus on gas turbines and
combined cycle, largely because of speed of installation and gas's emergence
as the most environmentally friendly fuel for power plants. Mr DW
Williamson, vice-president, GE Industrial and Power Systems, says the
Asia-Pacific region will account for 29 per cent of the world's capacity
additions. 'Japan, Korea and Taiwan alone represent nearly 60,000 MW of new
orders between now and 1995,' he says. India is also a major market 'where
an emerging middle class of nearly 200m people is driving new load growth,
which will require 26,000 MW of uncommitted capacity additions over the next
decade'.
He sees gas turbines and combined cycle as accounting for 45 per cent of
global additions, with steam turbine plants holding at 35 per cent, and
hydro and nuclear playing a more limited role.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (3): A continental
patchwork - Europe's shifting policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market for power generation equipment in Europe has been transformed in
the past five years. The 1987 decision to privatise the UK electricity
supply industry seems to have been one of the triggers for this change.
Prior to this, the market was technologically and commercially stagnant,
comprising a trickle of orders for coal and nuclear plant generally placed
with long-standing suppliers. Now it appears highly dynamic, as five big
industrial groupings scramble for orders for combined cycle gas turbines
(CCGT).
The change is due to the availability of natural gas for power generation
and the encouragement of competitive forces in the power generation sector.
These were reinforced by a surge in electricity demand that accompanied the
economic boom of the late 1980s, the prospect of the EC's Single Market,
environmental concerns and the prospect of Eastern Europe becoming an
important new market.
These changes hastened a long overdue shake up of the world power plant
supply industry, reducing the world market to just five major players, the
three European-based suppliers, ABB, Siemens and GEC-Alsthom and two
US-Japanese groupings, GE-Hitachi-Toshiba and Westinghouse-Mitsubishi.
Previously, the last two had played little role in Europe, but now perceive
a chance to gain a toe-hold.
The changes have been most dramatic in the UK. Released from their
obligations to nuclear power, to British coal and equipment suppliers, the
generating companies have gone on a remarkable shopping spree. In the last
three years, more plant has been bought than in the previous 15 years,
despite little signs of conventional need for it. Firm commitments have been
made for about 20 GW of CCGT plant (equivalent to about a third of total UK
capacity) to enter service in the next five years. Most has already been
ordered and each of the five world majors has won a share.
The wave of ordering had nothing to do with the usual process of analysing
demand trends and ordering just enough of the most economical plant to fill
any gap. The sole criterion was whether the proposed plant had a good chance
of making money for its owner.
With equipment suppliers offering the plant on turnkey terms with strong
performance guarantees, gas suppliers selling gas at attractive and stable
prices and the distribution companies eager to sign up to take the output of
the plant, the risks to the new generation companies were minimal. This, and
the fact that they no longer had the pre-privatisation responsibility to
operate the transmission grid, meant that few of the traditional utility
skills of design and engineering were required. What was needed was good
accountants and lawyers.
Interests other than the plant suppliers will have found the results less
attractive. Not much of the British coal industry is likely to survive this
stampede to gas, while the scope for any nuclear revival after the 1994
Government nuclear review may well have been pre-empted.
Much of the new gas-fired capacity is likely to generate at costs higher
than the existing coal-fired plant that it will replace, but the contracts
the CCGTs have with distributors mean that it will be the coal plant that
has to go.
Ultimately, it will be the electricity consumers who will foot the bill for
this over-indulgence. The new Office of Electricity Regulation is under
pressure to find a way of halting the flow of orders and few now expect much
activity in the next five to 10 years.
Whilst other countries in Europe seem to be following the UK's lead in
reforming electricity supply, all is not what it seems.
In Southern Europe - Greece, Portugal and Italy - changes are occurring
which will allow independent power producers to get into the market.
However, the rationale is much more a matter of pragmatism than dogma. Here,
there is still plenty of potential for demand growth, as well as a current
shortage of plant. However, the mainly state owned utilities have long been
hamstrung by a chronic shortage of capital and, in some cases, public
opposition to new power station developments.
Allowing international companies to compete to build the required plants and
encouraging industrial producers to build extra capacity are probably the
only options open to them. Nevertheless, all the Southern European countries
are contracted to receive large new volumes of gas, not always with a ready
final market and the power plant suppliers can look forward to a reasonable
market for CCGTs to burn this gas.
The countries of Northern Europe have shown much more ideological commitment
to the idea of reform: the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden are at various
stages in restructuring their electricity industries. However, these are
relatively small, mature systems with little scope for demand growth, often
based on cheap hydro-power and reliable nuclear plant. The resulting volume
of orders for new plant is unlikely to cause too much excitement to the
suppliers.
The countries of Eastern Europe, prompted by lending institutions such as
the World Bank, are restructuring electricity supply to embody the free
market principles enshrined in the new UK system. However, even allowing for
the need to replace discredited nuclear power plants and polluting
coal-fired plants, these markets may prove a disappointment.
Economic recession and the introduction of more energy efficient processes
are cutting deeply into electricity demand making the shut-down of the worst
plant less painful. Investment capital is scarce and the first priority may
be remedial measures to salvage as much as possible of the existing plant
rather than building new stations.
The two largest national systems in Europe, those of France and Germany, are
notable absentees from the ranks of the reformers. The European Commission
may extract some marginal concessions under its Single Market provisions.
However, it seems unlikely that the formidable utilities at the heart of
these systems and their associated lobbies, nuclear in France and coal in
Germany, will readily give up privileges such as the ability to choose
where, when and what type of power plant is built.
The boom in plant ordering that has been seen in the UK is therefore
unlikely to be repeated in the rest of Europe, not least because of the
effects of the economic recession on electricity demand.
Nevertheless, even France and Germany will not be able to resist some
features of the new market indefinitely. Placing orders for plant with
favoured national suppliers and maintaining a monopoly hold on the
generation market are no longer sustainable policies. However, whether
governments in Europe will be happy to surrender their leverage over the
electricity supply to the market as completely as in the UKis more doubtful.

ANOTHER busy day in stock index futures saw a strong opening peter out into
retreat as the market turned its attention back to the worries over the
economy, writes Christopher Price.
After Wednesday's good performance and a sharply higher Wall Street
overnight, the September FT-SE contract started brightly at 2,447 and rose
to reach 2,454. However, this proved to be the high point of the day as BZW,
which had been a big buyer over the past two days, resorted to
profit-taking.
September went into retreat as the market returned to its gloomy prognosis
on the economic outlook, with comments from the Bundesbank chairman that
German interest rate cuts are unlikely in the foreseeable future dominating
sentiment. With gilts and short sterling both weak, September's slow
decline, albeit punctuated by technical rallies, continued throughout the
afternoon. The contract closed at 2,425, down 20 points from Wednesday, and
at only a one-point premium to estimated fair value. Turnover was a steady
9,226 lots.
ICI dominated traded options in an otherwise quiet day. The chemicals group
recorded 4,486 contracts out of a day's total of 20,783.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Government's plans lift
Nikkei by 3 per cent

THE Japanese government's decision to bring forward its plans to stimulate
the economy, together with Wednesday's rise in overseas markets, lifted
sentiment in Tokyo stocks yesterday, and the Nikkei average rallied 3 per
cent on short-covering and arbitrage-linked buying, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which registered a six-year low the previous day,
rebounded 459.65 to 15,555.60. The index opened at the day's low of
15,152.35 and rose as high as 15,586.31 in the afternoon.
Volume, however, decreased to 220m shares from 259m. Traders said
institutions remained on the sidelines and activity centred on buy-backs of
shares sold on Wednesday. Rises outnumbered declines by 656 to 319, with 125
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks recovered
22.55 to 1,193.48, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased a slight 0.67
to 946.85.
The government's plan to implement its economic stimulus package in August,
one month early, encouraged the market. Plans to bolster property prices by
government purchases of land for public works projects sparked buying in
bank and real estate issues.
Traders were relieved that the Nikkei found support at the 15,000 level.
However, Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities cautioned that the rise
was technical, and that the market had yet to hit the bottom. 'We have not
seen real demand from investors coming in,' he said.
Banks gained ground on short-covering as the market hoped that the
government's efforts to stop asset deflation would lighten the burden of bad
loans at banks. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y80 to Y1,710 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y100 to Y1,740.
Property shares also improved, Daikyo moving forward Y21 to Y520 and Sato
Kogyo Y30 to Y610.
Speculative theme stocks were actively traded. Meiji Milk Products continued
to head the active stocks list and regained Y29 to Y860, while Okamoto
Industries put on Y10 to Y1,030.
High-technology blue chips, which have been sold on fears of lower earnings,
showed only a slightly firmer tendency as some investors remained cautious.
Toshiba edged ahead Y3 to Y621 and Sony Y10 to Y3,810, but NEC dipped Y3 to
Y762 and Fujitsu Y3 to Y567 on continuing fears about profits.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 226.13 to 17,362.52 in volume of 13.7m
shares. Roundup
MOST Pacific Rim markets followed Tokyo higher.
HONG KONG reversed early gains after Sino-British talks on the financing of
the new airport failed. The Hang Seng index finished 27.46 down at 5,829.83
but after an intraday low of 5,811.21. Turnover came to HKDollars 2.1bn.
Property issues were moderately lower, with Hong Kong Land off 20 cents at
HKDollars 13.90.
AUSTRALIA gained ground in spite of the release of some disappointing
economic data showing a wider than expected balance of payments deficit. The
All Ordinaries index finished 8.7 ahead at 1,621.0 following turnover of
ADollars 288.2m.
North Flinders Mines rose 40 cents, or some 10 per cent, to ADollars 4.25 on
news that reserves at one of its sites were double previous estimates.
NEW ZEALAND was led lower by Fletcher Challenge, which saw its shares lose
22 cents to NZDollars 14.31 on rumours of a rights issue. The NZSE-40 index
slipped 14.31 to 1,514.17 in turnover of NZDollars 29.86m.
SINGAPORE advanced amid foreign institutional demand for selected blue
chips. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 19.43, or 1.4 per cent, to
1,449.02.
Banks rose on expectations of good half-year results being reported shortly.
KARACHI continued its downward slide on the last trading day of the week,
writes Farhan Bokhari.
The KSE-100 index fell 29.37 to 1,311.30, now down 6.4 per cent since last
Sunday. Concern about profitability in the textile sector and a setback in
the government's plans to sell off Pakistan's largest gas company weighed on
the market.
TAIWAN extended early gains to finish sharply higher. The weighted index
closed 82.21 up at 4,029.53 in moderate turnover of TDollars 21.55bn.
MANILA rose afresh in active trading. The composite index added 10.41 at
1,495.72 in combined turnover of 227m pesos. PLDT gained 30 pesos to 1,100
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR followed other markets higher. The composite index put on 7.85
to 598.56. Rises led falls by 125 to 110 after 53.5m share volume.
BOMBAY's BSE index dropped 56.42, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,698.83 on the last
day of the account on fears of high carry-over charges.

<TEXT>
BOURSES headed lower as cautious hopes of lower German interest rates were
dashed by comments from the Bundesbank president, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT weakened as Allianz came under renewed pressure following a
negative analysts' meeting on Wednesday. The insurer saw the value of its
shares tumble after Deutsche Bank issued a sell note and reduced its 1992
forecast of Earnings Per Share to DM28 from DM45.50. Allianz closed down
DM79 or 4 per cent at DM1,872.
Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, in which he
reaffirmed that there would be no cut in interest rates this year, added to
market gloom. The DAX index lost 4.16 to 1,623.99 while, at midsession, the
FAZ was 0.03 weaker at 643.02. Turnover fell to DM5.1bn from DM5.9bn.
Some analysts believe that Allianz may fall to around DM1,850. The market
has taken a view that the next two years will be difficult for the insurer,
since losses from its east German operations likely to continue. Increased
competition from other European insurers as the sector is further
liberalised is also likely to hurt its profit margins.
Car makers enjoyed a better day as BMW announced a 10 per cent increase in
first half group net profit. Its shares added DM3 to DM543. Volkswagen was
DM1 stronger at DM359.50.
Lufthansa slipped DM3.40 to DM108.50 on its plans to reduce services between
Germany and the US.
MILAN fell on selling by domestic investors, perturbed by the implications
of the resignation of the foreign minister, Mr Vicenzo Scotti. Dealers said
there were fears that the crisis within the Christian Democrat party could
topple the coalition government. The Comit index fell 3.41 to 397.73 in
turnover estimated at L100bn after L76.9bn.
News that a Turin broker was unable to meet his commitments and that
settlement of the account, due today, was likely to be postponed as a
result, also weighed on the market. Potentially good news, such as a 3.25
per cent increase in cement prices, was ignored.
Fiat fell L71 to L4,380 while Montedison dropped L55 to L1,105. Italcementi
fell L50 to L9,600 and its savings shares were suspended for excessive
losses.
Acqua Marcia was suspended by Consob after the company said at a
shareholders' meeting on Wednesday that it is planning a capital increase
for at least L139bn to avoid bankruptcy.
PARIS followed the bond market lower, weakened by worries about the
referendum on Maastricht and the prospect of high German interest rates for
the rest of the year. The CAC-40 index lost 19.06 or 1.1 per cent to
1,782.57 in thin turnover of FFr1.7bn.
Euro Disney continued to fall, losing FFr2.65 to FFr88. Other losers
included Saint-Gobain, down FFr19 to FFr545, while pessimism surrounding
Allianz, the German insurer, weighed on UAP, down FFr14.40 at FFr397.50, and
Axa, down FFr36 to FFr809.
But Credit Local outperformed the market, adding FFr4.10 to FFr249.50 in
good volume of 171,420 shares.
AMSTERDAM began firmly but weakened just before the close after the central
bank increased its special advance rate. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to
117.
DSM cheered the market with its first-half results and said that it would
maintain its interim dividend at Fl 2.65. Its shares advanced Fl 4.60 or 4.5
per cent to Fl 105. Akzo benefited from the results, gaining Fl 2 to Fl 144.
It publishes first half figures next Tuesday.
BRUSSELS rose on news that Solvay may issue American Depository Receipts.
The Bel-20 index advanced 4.14 to 1,141.18 in turnover of BFr554m.
The chemical group reported lower first half earnings but forecast that full
year results will be in line with 1991 figures. Its shares rose BFr250 or
2.1 per cent to BFr12,325.
ZURICH drifted lower on profit-taking. The SMI index shed 6.6 to 1,806.1.
Chemical stocks were stronger with Ciba-Geigy bearers adding SFr3 to SFr653
and Sandoz bearers up SFr10 to SFr2,870.
OSLO was led higher by Hafslund Nycomed which reported better than expected
first half results late on Wednesday. The all-share index rose 1.78 to
387.99 in turnover of NKr167m.
Hafslund A shares added NKr2.5 to NKr157.
VIENNA closed slightly higher. The ATX index gained 1.21 to 792.16 after an
intraday high of 805.94. Austrian Airlines lost Sch140, or 8 per cent, to
Sch1,570 after the group said that it might have to cut the 1992 dividend.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Giant smelter facing
'unbelievable problems'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S GIANT Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter is facing a mass of
'unbelievably complicated problems', according to Mr Vladimir Nikitchenko,
the deputy director, reports Reuter from Krasnoyarsk. But he insists that
the plant will maintain current output levels.
'In the last two months the cost of our aluminium has doubled from 50,000
roubles (Dollars 310 at the Russian central bank exchange rate) to 120,000
roubles a tonne,' he said this week. Electricity, which accounts for 60 to
70 per cent of the cost of producing aluminium, has recently doubled in
price.
'In the old days we knew a supplier would supply us, and he was obliged to
do so at a set price and within a set time. Today no one owes (anybody)
anything,' he said.
One of the plant's alumina (aluminium oxide) suppliers in Nikolayev, a town
in the newly-independent Ukraine, was 'playing up', but that was only part
of the problem.
Huge price rises and critical cash shortages had set off a vicious circle of
unpaid debts among domestic consumers and suppliers, he said.
'Our customers are in debt to us . . . and we are paying part of what we
owe. We are delivering metals to consumers without taking money because we
know they have none. But not taking money from our customers makes it hard
to pay our suppliers.'
The plant covers an area of 30 square km (12 square miles) and employs about
12,000 workers. 'This factory is colossal and no one will allow it to be
closed down,' said Mr Nikitchenko, adding that 70,000 people in Krasnoyarsk
 -a city of 1m people - depended on the plant as did 70m people across the
country.
Local ecologists say the plant's emissions are dangerous but Nikitchenko
claimed experts rated them as tolerable. He said the plant was involved in a
Dollars 30m long-term project with Kaiser Aluminum Corporation of the US to
modernise the electrolysis process and to build gas-cleaning equipment.
Nikitchenko said the plant was planning to privatise itself so it could
leave the state sector.

The cash LEAD price leapt Pounds 17 to a 13-month high of Pounds 353.50 a
tonne on the London Metal Exchange yesterday on news of a strike at the Doe
Run Herculaneum smelter in the US. The smelter has an annual capacity of
225,000 short tons (2,000 lb each), and news of the strike immediately
lifted prices in mid-afternoon, until which they had been little changed.
ZINC prices were also firm, reflecting continuing concern about a tight
supply situation created by several producers and a major trader building up
a big long position for October delivery. Other LME metals were weaker, led
by COPPER, the cash price of which fell Pounds 12 to Pounds 1,309 a tonne as
fears of a supply squeeze continued to fade. The three months ALUMINIUM
price slipped to Dollars 1,330 a tonne in afterhours trading, Dollars 43
below the 3 1/2 -month high reached earlier in the week. Three months TIN
was down Dollars 54 at Dollars 6,815 a tonne Dollars 435 below late-June's
31-month high, while three months NICKEL lost Dollars 72.50 at Dollars
7,492.50 a tonne. COCOA futures ended with pared gains as the market
continued to hold in its recent trading range. But concern remained over the
possibility of further producer selling.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IWC reduces crop estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has reduced its estimates of the 1992 world
wheat and coarse grains crops.
In its latest market report, published yesterday, the London-based agency
has cut the wheat harvest forecast to 546m tonnes from 548m tonnes in its
June report and that for coarse grains to 820m tonnes from 824m tonnes. Both
figures are up on actual 1991 output, however; wheat by 3m tonnes and coarse
grains by 25m tonnes.
The reduction in the coarse grains estimate mainly reflects deterioration in
European Community harvest prospects, particularly in Denmark and Germany,
where drought is expected to hit barley production severely.
The report attributes the cut in the 1992 wheat estimate to lower figures
for the EC and Canada, 'which were only partly offset by better prospects in
China and India.' The projection for the US is up 200,000 tonnes from the
June assessment at 60.7m tonnes, and is now 13 per cent higher than in 1991.
The IWC figures include a 400,000-tonne cut in the coarse grains estimate
for the Commonwealth of Independent States, but that would still be 11.6m
tonnes above last year's. The estimate for CIS wheat remains at June's 83.5m
tonnes, up 11.1m tonnes from 1991. Mr Bill de Maria, the IWC's chief
economist, warned, however, that while June-July weather had been generally
good in the CIS, dryness might be causing problems and the effects had yet
to be evaluated.
The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which did not join the
CIS after the collapse of the Soviet Union, are now expected to produce 5.7m
tonnes of grain between them in 1992, about 200,000 tonnes down from last
month's IWC estimate but up 500,000 tonnes from last year's actual outturn.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia 'exporting less
aluminium'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM EXPORTS from Russia have slowed to a trickle, according to some
traders. They suggest that Russian assertions that exports are being
sustained at about 75 per cent of last year's level do not stand up to close
examination.
Problems with raw materials and spare parts continue to dog Russia's
smelters, which are said to be particularly short of alumina, the essential
raw material, the traders report.
An official at one big trading house, who asked not to be identified, said
yesterday that only about 10 per cent of the alumina his company had sold to
Russia recently was finding its way to the smelters. Not only was there a
shortage of money to pay or goods to barter but transport within Russia was
in a chaotic state and there were no rail cars available to carry alumina.
To make matters worse, Hungalu, the state-owned Hungarian producer, has not
been able to agree terms of a barter deal with the Commonwealth of
Independent States and will ship no alumina there in the second half of this
year.
The company was scheduled to export 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes to the CIS in
the second six months of 1992 - enough to produce 125,000 to 150,000 tonnes
of aluminium. Consequently Hungalu is closing its 180,000-tonnes-a-year Ajka
1 alumina plant and 800 people will be laid off.
The Metals Week newsletter says, however, that Hungalu officials hint that
Hungarian alumina exports to the CIS will continue through western
intermediaries because the Russian aluminium industry is heavily dependent
on them, particularly after losing its supply from Yugoslavia.
The Hungarian officials suggest that some CIS smelters are so short of raw
material that alumina is being rushed from rail cars to smelters as soon as
it arrives. Hungary has been shipping 1,500 to 1,800 tonnes a day.
Some estimates suggest that Russian aluminium exports reached a record 1m
tonnes last year although other analysts put the total nearer 850,000
tonnes. Russia's official target for 1992 exports is 615,000 tonnes.
But some western traders suggest that the country's difficulties are so
great that it will be doing well to export 400,000 tonnes this year.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jam tomorrow for oil investors
in CIS - Efforts to establish a more friendly climate for western companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE who does not take risks does not drink champagne, runs an old Russian
proverb. Western oil company executives were recently reminded of it at a
London meeting with a Russian government official, lamenting the lack of
foreign investment in the energy sector.
Many companies could give a long list of reasons for their reluctance: fear
of political instability; the lack of a proper legal framework and tax
regime; a punitive export tariff; poor infrastructure and communications;
and nervousness about dealing with with a complex bureaucracy unaccustomed
to western ways of doing business.
Political stability cannot be guaranteed, and westerners who have negotiated
deals report that the end of the Soviet Union has done little to streamline
the decision-making process - at least in Russia. Foreign oil companies can
still find themselves negotiating simultaneously with production
enterprises, local government, regional government, the state committee on
property, the state committee on foreign investment and a range of
sub-committees.
But some of the other difficulties are beginning to be resolved and that
could soon make the former Soviet republics no more risky places to do
business than many other oil-producing countries.
Russia is in the process of developing what will ultimately be three tiers
of legislation covering the oil and gas industry.
Fundamental laws on foreign investment were passed last summer by the
Russian parliament. An umbrella law on subsoil resources has also been
effective since May 5, establishing the principle that the state owns
natural resources in situ but has the right to license them for development.
All future developments must receive a licence, expected to be issued by the
state committee on geology. Licences can be awarded either through
competition involving submissions of drilling programmes and development
plans, or by auction to the highest bidder.
Both non-exclusive licences for geological prospecting valid for five years,
and exclusive exploration and production licences lasting 25 years or
longer, will be available.
However, Mr David Moroney, a partner with the London legal firm Denton Hall,
which is advising the Russian government on oil and gas law, points to two
problems with the current law. One is that there is no provision for
licences to be awarded through direct negotiation between companies and the
government.
Neither does it provide for any disputes to be settled by international
arbitration.
The final step is to develop a detailed law, specifically covering the oil
and gas industry. A group of World Bank-sponsored experts from Houston
University, headed by Professor George Hardy, is currently working on
drafts, to be submitted to the Russian parliament by September.
But a competing draft law, prepared by a Russian academic institute and
supported by some petroleum associations, is also being considered.
Getting either law passed may be less than plain-sailing. Mr Sergei Roginko,
a member of acting Russian prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar's secretariat,
worried western companies by suggesting in London last week that enshrining
detailed oil industry regulations in law might be inappropriate.
'We might spend many months debating an explicit law that is ideal for
today, but tomorrow it could be out of date.'
Specific oil regulations could be established through presidential decrees
and parliamentary orders, he suggested. Such an arrangement might not
satisfy western investors - presidential decrees can be changed very easily
with a change of president.
World Bank experts are also working on new tax laws to replace the present
regime, which has emerged on a rather ad hoc basis. Made up of an export
tariff, royalties, withholding tax, profit tax, as well as a social security
tax and tax on expatriate earnings, the total take is close to 80 per cent
of revenue, which western companies and many Russian officials alike realise
is too high.
There is widespread pressure for a move towards a profit- rather than a
revenue-based tax, and a reduction in the punitive export tariff of Ecu26 a
tonne - more than Dollars 5 a barrel.
In the meantime, Mr Roginko pledged that 'serious' western investors could
negotiate exemption from the export tariff - which was imposed primarily to
discourage illegal exports by 'speculators'. As if in confirmation, the
operators of the White Nights joint venture in Siberia announced the
following day that they had been granted exemption.
Other hurdles remain to be surmounted. A treaty must be designed to cover
the 300,000km of oil and gas pipelines that now run through 15 different
republics, to establish ownership and regulatory controls, rights of access,
and tariffs.
There is also the knotty problem of breakaway regions and republics within
Russia, which was not solved by the signing of a new Federative Treaty
earlier this year. Areas such as Tatarstan, Bashkiria and Chechen Ingushetia
are demanding varying degrees of autonomy over their indigenous energy
resources. Moreover, while the law on subsoil resources established that 40
per cent of oil revenues should go to the Russian Federation government, 30
per cent to the district or city, and 30 per cent to the region or
autonomous republic within Russia, many areas are demanding a bigger share.
Such problems, together with a Russian oil industry that is itself in a
state of flux, may prompt foreign investors to turn to other republics which
now negotiate independently from Moscow, and are competing aggressively for
investment.
Kazakhstan, which has scooped up two of the biggest deals so far and has the
second-largest reserves after Russia, has already passed its own laws on
natural resources.
These are considered by western lawyers to be incomplete and inconsistent.
But, says Mr Robert Gray, country manager for the former Soviet republics at
JP Morgan, the merchant bank which has advised on oil deals with Kazakhstan,
the central Asian republic scores with a simpler negotiating process. This
is usually confined to the local producing association and the republican
government. Mr Gray also points to the personal commitment to attracting
foreign investment of Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president.
Kazakh tax conditions have so far been individually negotiated in each case,
and are the subject of some secrecy. They are, however, thought to be rather
better than those in Russia.
An important consideration for foreign investors across the old Soviet Union
is the sheer remoteness and total lack of infrastructure of some of the
fields.
Mr Vasili Fedorchenko, a member of Russia's supreme economic council and
former oil man himself, suggests the idea of special economic regions where
western companies would be allowed to develop at special tax rates, on
condition they constructed all the infrastructure - roads, schools, as well
as hotels and restaurants, and 'houses not like they build here, but like
you build in Windsor'.
'But,' he adds, 'I warn you. Russia is not an easy place to build. You might
find marshes and rivers, taiga and mountains in your way.'
The final article in this three-part series on developments in the oil

with western companies, will be published on August 7. The first article was

Pounds 430m from drought

THE TWO-month drought that hit Denmark from mid-May onwards will cost
farmers DKr4.7bn (Pounds 430m) in lost income from the sale of grain, peas
and oilseed rape, the National Plant Breeding Centre said yesterday.
This means that reduced returns from these crops alone will cut farmers'
income from the sale of arable crops by almost 40 per cent.
The harvest from spring-sewn rape will be cut by 65 per cent, spring barley,
oats and peas by 40-45 per cent and winter barley and wheat by a quarter,
according to the centre.
The impact of the drought varies substantially from region to region, but
the average income loss will be about 35 per cent, it estimated.
Denmark exported 2.7m tonnes of grain, worth just over DKr3bn, in 1991, but
in the current harvest year it will be necessary to import grain. This will
cut into the country's trade and current balance of payments surpluses, but
both are currently substantial. The surplus on merchandise trade in 1991 was
DKr22bn and the current account surplus was DKr14bn.

Pod borers have affected about 24,000 hectares of cocoa farms or 20 per cent
of the peninsula's cocoa crop, Malaysian Cocoa Growers Council officials
said yesterday.
Malaysian officials earlier said 9,400 hectares of the farms had been hit, 8
per cent of Peninsular Malaysia's cocoa area. Malaysia is the world's fourth
largest cocoa producer.

forced to depart

   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESIDENT of Bolivia's state mining corporation, Comibol, has been
forced out in a surprise move by the Bolivian Government.
No date has been set for the departure of Mr Alberto Ono Villegas, but his
replacement has been named as Mr Marcelo Perez Monasterio, a former
under-secretary in the foreign affairs ministry and president of the
inter-American commerce and production committee. Mr Perez does not appear
to have any previous experience of the mining industry.
This undignified end to Mr Ono's ten-month tenure as Comibol president has
been linked to continuing pressure from the World Bank. The bank recently
forced Comibol to undertake an extensive redundancy programme by withholding
a Dollars 22m credit intended for restructuring the corporation, part of a
Dollars 35m credit committed to the modernisation of the Bolivian mining
industry.
The departure of Mr Ono, perceived by many to favour a slower pace of change
than the World Bank was willing to put up with, combined with the latest
round of redundancies, signals the beginning of the end for Comibol. Mr
Perez is believed to be a committed free marketeer who is unlikely to stand
in the way of what Bolivian mining unions are calling 'privatisation through
the back door'. Comibol, at present employing about 6,000 workers, may soon
number its staff in the low hundreds as it winds down its mining operations
and concentrates on administrative joint ventures.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Financial institutions test Swiss
demand for FRNs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE financial institutions yesterday took advantage of a pocket of demand
among Swiss investors, to issue subordinated floating rate notes totalling
Dollars 600m.
JP Morgan &amp; Co, the US bank's holding company, Credit Local de France, the
French local authority financing agency, and the German government-backed
Landeskreditbank all raised 10-year subordinated debt which counts as Lower
Tier 2 capital under Basle capital adequacy rules.
All three deals were structured in the same way, with a floor, or minimum
interest rate, of 5 per cent and a cap, or maximum interest rate, of 10 per
cent. Dealers said that Swiss investors have been buying up 'floored'
floating-rate notes of strong credit quality in the secondary market for
some time. However, the amount of paper available is limited, since little
such debt has been issued since the mid-1980s.
With US interest rates at historically low levels, an initial coupon of 5
per cent proved attractive to Swiss investors. US money market rates are
around 3 1/2 per cent. As a result, many Swiss investors were prepared to
accept a cap of 10 per cent, in return for a high initial coupon.
Another important aspect of the paper's appeal was its high credit quality.
Dealers said the market would likely be closed to investors rated less than
double-A - a high cut-off point for subordinated debt issues, which
generally have lower ratings than senior debt issues.
Dealers said Swiss demand for such paper was nevertheless finite, and the
heavy volume of issuance yesterday had taken up much of the slack. JP
Morgan's Dollars 200m issue arranged by Kidder Peabody was generally
considered to have been the best received, due to the rarity of the name,
and the benefit of a head start.
Elsewhere, Paribas arranged a Dollars 40m issue of floating-rate notes
backed by the cash flows due from the sale of a Boeing 757 by Ansett
Worldwide Aviation to the Argentine government.

<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade was yesterday recognised as an overseas
investment exchange in the UK, clearing the way for UK-based users of
Globex, the screen-based futures and options trading system launched last
month, to trade CBOT products.
The move was welcomed by the CBOT, which hopes that the authorisation will
lift volume on Globex, which is languishing at under 2,000 contracts a day.
Globex, developed by CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, the
financial information and news company, gives subscribers in different time
zones access to markets outside exchange trading hours.
City dealers can trade, throughout the European trading day, the CBOT's
highly liquid futures and options on 10-year US Treasury notes, and on
five-year and two-year notes. Prior to the ruling, these contracts could be
traded on terminals in New York, Chicago and Paris.
The CBOT's long bond contracts, the CME's Eurodollar, Treasury bill and
one-month Libor contracts are due to be listed on Globex on August 16.
Announcing the authorisation, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, said the government welcomed overseas exchanges that were well
regulated and did not operate anti-competitively. 'The Chicago Board of
Trade meets these criteria and, through its activities on Globex, will bring
an important increase in the range of choice available to investors,' he
said.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Group to investigate Italian
bond problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of banks, brokers and clearing houses are to form an action group to
resolve the difficulties faced by international investors trying to reclaim
withholding tax paid on Italian government bonds from the Italian
authorities.
The group, headed by Euroclear and Cedel, and involving a number of
international banks and brokers, will meet in London in August to discuss a
fresh approach to the Italian Ministry of Finance.
A year ago, the Italian authorities issued rules on withholding tax refunds,
known as Circular 12. Although the rules were widely billed as allowing
foreign investors qualifying under double taxation treaties to reclaim
withholding tax paid on Italian bonds, the procedure excluded market
participants which have their tax residence in a different country from
their clearing system or global custodian.
Such participants, who account for a large portion of the market, have been
unable to submit refund claims, in spite of treaty entitlements according to
Euroclear and Cedel.
The prospect of withholding tax refunds helped lift international interest
in Italian government bonds last year. Currently, beset by economic problems
and concerns about the future of European union, the Italian government bond
market is at a low ebb.
Traders said such technical difficulties did not encourage international
participation in the market.
According to the International Swap Dealers Association's survey reported
yesterday, losses in the swaps market account for 0.0115 per cent of the
notional principal amount of swaps outstanding, not 0.115 per cent, as
stated.

GERMANY'S Futures and Options Exchange, the Deutsche Terminboerse (DTB),
yesterday firmly rejected charges that futures operators were manipulating
the market and deliberately pushing cash share prices lower, Reuter reports
from Frankfurt.
Some stock commentators have said a recent decline on the cash market for
German shares was a reflection of manipulation by DTB traders who had bought
the futures contracts and sold underlying stocks which make up the 30-share
German DAX index.
Mr Joerg Franke, one of DTB's two chief executives, said the sale of
underlying stocks against the purchase of futures was part of the normal

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand shareholders seek
a shift in power - A surprise resignation and recent boardroom turmoil at
Norway's largest insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI  N
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top echelons of Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, have been in
turmoil recently with the departure of the company's president and chief
executive and the board tendering its resignation.
Now some of its biggest shareholders, frustrated at the lack of progress at
the company, are intent on forcing a power shift within the company.
Disgruntled shareholders are campaigning for power within the company to be
transferred to the board from the executive administration where it has
languished under the leadership of Mr Jan Erik Langangen, who resigned last
Sunday.
Mr Langangen's surprise departure came amid sharp criticism by shareholders
from whom he had failed to win unconditional backing for a capital expansion
of between NKr1.5bn (Dollars 258.6m) to NKr2bn being planned for the autumn.
The capital expansion will enable Uni to meet international capital adequacy
requirements while giving the company 'breathing space' over the next year
to dispose of a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent shareholding in Skandia Forsakrings,
the big Swedish insurer. This stake was a key part of his strategy to create
a pan-Nordic insurance alliance.
Shareholders' disillusion has grown in recent months over Mr Langangen's
failure to create this alliance and the fruitless, hostile raid on Skandia.
The Skandia acquisition, they maintain, was a waste of resources on a
grossly miscalculated risk which gave the company no influence over the
Swedish insurer whose strict rules limit voting rights. In addition
Skandia's powerful leader, Mr Bjoern Wolrath, has stymied the prospect of Mr
Langangen making his vision a reality.
Shareholders were also disappointed at the progress Mr Langangen had made in
the company following a merger two years ago between Uni Forsikring and
Storebrand, out of which the group was created. They have seen Uni's Skandia
investment plunge in value by an estimated NKr2.5bn as Uni's share price
tumbled to NKr25 from NKr50, stifling its prospects for raising new capital.
Dissenting shareholders have demanded the resignation of Uni's board as a
condition for participation in that key share issue. Seeing that his freedom
to continue to decide company strategy had been significantly reduced, Mr
Langangen withdrew as the board tendered its resignation.
Uni's board appointed Mr Per Terje Vold, deputy managing director of the
group's life assurance company, as Mr Langangen's successor, but there are
also questions over his future. His experience in the industry is limited to
four years in the company although, to his credit, he was responsible for
the successful clean-up operation in 1989 of Storebrand Finans, Storebrand's
finance unit. It had plunged into deep losses after its lending portfolio
had gone bad as a result of the domestic recession and dubious loans.
But there are also differences among the dissenting shareholders, of which
Mr Vold's future as a president is only one element. Replacing all or part
of the board is another, and so is the question of whether to replace senior
executive staff, who had been loyal to Mr Langangen.
Mr Thorleif Borge, Uni's board chairman, will be forced out of his post, but
he could remain a board member since he represents the interests of the Uni
Foundation, Uni's biggest shareholder with a 26.6 per cent stake. Other big
shareholders, however, may seek to have Uni Foundation's stake decreased.
The shareholders' strongest candidate to replace Mr Borge is Mr Torvild
Aakvaag, chairman of the board of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest stock listed
company, and a current member of Uni's board.
'Mr Aakvaag is an experienced industrial leader who could restore
credibility to Uni Storebrand,' one shareholder believes. It is also widely
expected that Norsk Hydro will make a hefty contribution to Uni's capital
expansion.
Shareholders want a change of the board. 'With the existing board chairman
being the former chief executive of Uni (Forsikring), it is clear the power
of the administration of the merged company had grown too strong,' one
shareholder said. 'I think most shareholders will see to it that Uni gets
the capital it needs, but major changes to the board will have to be made,'
he warned.
Four out of Uni's top 10 shareholders are foreign interests, although there
is no foreign board member.
'The merger of Uni Storebrand is not yet absorbed. There is still a lot of
duplication. Expanding the company's capital is not enough. Assets need to
be sold and although people are ready to invest in Uni, board and management
changes are needed. If these changes are not made, Uni could find itself
heading in the direction of Hafnia,' a major foreign shareholder said.
Hafnia Holding, the beleaguered Danish insurer, saw its leadership toppled
after it became clear the group was on the verge of technical insolvency.
The appointment of Uni Storebrand's new board is expected to be announced on
August 10. The board will then have to decide the fate of the company's
interim president and senior executive management.
In addition, details of the planned September share issue will have to be
finalised and a strategy for the disposal of the Skandia shareholding
agreed.
The new board will also make clear the business priorities which Uni's
management will have to pursue and there is little doubt that improving
efficiency of the group since the merger will be a top priority.

GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor, plans to cut around 5,800 jobs
at its Fort Worth, Texas, division by the end of 1994, writes our Financial
Staff.
The company said yesterday the cuts were a response to falling defence
expenditures and a drop in the production rates of its F-16 fighter
aircraft. The Fort Worth division currently employs around 20,000 people.
Production rates for the F-16 were up to 30 a month at one stage, but are
now down to 16 a month.
General Dynamics - where Mr Warren Buffett, the investor, has just acquired
a 14.9 per cent stake - has been contracting its business generally
recently. It has been selling certain operations, such as its Cessna jet
division, reducing capital expenditures and buying in its own shares.

DURACELL, the battery company taken private by a leveraged buyout in 1988

The quarter is the last of Duracell's financial year, and it takes profits
for the 12 months to Dollars 127.8m, compared with a Dollars 34.2m loss last
time.
Part of the advance comes from sharply lower interest charges - Dollars

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent drop in the Canadian dollar and improved commodity prices helped
Noranda, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, almost
to double second-quarter earnings.
The latest earnings are still not sufficient to cover the quarterly
dividend. But Noranda is leaving the payout unchanged at 25 cents,
apparently in expectation of a further improvement in commodity prices and
earnings later this year. Several other Bronfman-controlled companies have
cut their dividends in recent weeks.
Net income rose to CDollars 32m (USDollars 27.1m), or nine cents a share,
from CDollars 18m, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dipped
slightly to CDollars 2.21bn from CDollars 2.28bn.
The mainspring of the higher earnings came from metals and minerals, whose
contribution advanced to CDollars 55m from CDollars 16m. Higher zinc prices
and the more favourable exchange rate helped this year's performance, while
earnings last year were depressed by a strike at Brunswick Mining and
Smelting.
Forest products moved from a CDollars 12m loss to earnings of CDollars 10m,
thanks to stronger lumber and panelboard markets, and the closure of some
loss-making mills. The company said that pulp markets are starting to show
signs of a turnround, but newsprint and other types of paper remain
depressed.
Interest charges fell to CDollars 94m from CDollars 116m, although long-term
debt rose to CDollars 4.8bn from CDollars 4.5bn.

AMERICAN International Group, one of the largest US composite insurers,
yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 425.6m in the three months
to end-June, a 6.1 per cent improvement on the same period a year earlier.
The result takes profits for the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 839.5m,
against Dollars 776.4m in the previous year. The figures are scored after
realised investment gains of Dollars 26.5m (against Dollars 31m a year ago)
in the second quarter, and Dollars 54.5m (Dollars 54.6m) for the six months.
Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, said the second quarter had been 'reasonably
good' for the company overall. The US property-casualty market continued to
be 'very competitive in most lines of business other than the specialty
classes', and catastrophe losses had been particularly heavy. But life
operations and sizeable overseas operations 'provided a counterbalance'.
General insurance operations made an underwriting loss of Dollars 15.9m in
the six months, compared with a profit of Dollars 41.8m a year earlier. But
higher investment income meant that operating profit fell only 1.5 per cent
to Dollars 599.8m (Dollars 608.8m). Net premiums were Dollars 4.63bn against
Dollars 4.62bn.
The life operations, by contrast, pushed up operating profits by 16 per cent
in the first half, to Dollars 295.2m (Dollars 254.5m). Premium income rose
to Dollars 2.26bn from Dollars 1.91bn.
Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group planning to
divest its property-casualty insurance operations, reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 60.3m for the quarter to end-June against Dollars 55.1m a
year ago. Profits from the businesses which will form the continuing group
rose from Dollars 43m to Dollars 97.5m.
Half-year after-tax profits stand at Dollars 143.9m (Dollars 63m).

MR CHARLES CORRY, chair-man of USX, the US steel and energy group, said
yesterday he expected both sides of the business to perform better in the
second half of 1992 than in the first half, excluding the impact of special
items.
On Tuesday, USX announced second-quarter net income of Dollars 226m for its
Marathon business and Dollars 6m for its US Steel group. The Marathon
figures included a Dollars 119m tax refund.
Mr Corry told a news conference that the steel side, which was hard-hit by
the US recession last year, should do better in the second half, given that
its operating rate during the second quarter had risen to the 'quite good'
level of 90 per cent and the June order rate had been the best this year.
He also said anti-dumping suits recently filed by US steelmakers against
foreign rivals should help improve American steel prices which remained
'very depressed'. Next month, the International Trade Commission, a US
government agency, gives preliminary findings in the anti-dumping cases.
On the energy side, margins in Marathon's refining business might be 'a bit
better' while upstream operations could benefit from firming natural gas
prices, especially if coupled with a cold winter.

OMNICOM Group, the US-based international advertising group, yesterday
reported a 3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 to
Dollars 56.8m - allowing for extraordinary items of Dollars 6.7m - against
Dollars 54.9m a year ago.
Barring extraordinary items, which involved new accounting principles and
retirement benefits, pre-tax profits were up by 16 per cent. Net income for
the six months increased by 20 per cent, to Dollars 35.1m from Dollars
29.1m. Fully diluted earnings per share increased 14 per cent to Dollars
1.17 from Dollars 1.03.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Time Warner in talks with
potential partners

<TEXT>
TIME Warner is once more rumoured to be advancing in its talks with
potential foreign partners as the US media and entertainment group continues
to try to whittle down its substantial debt burden.
A number of possible investors are being bandied about Wall Street including
Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman of Canada's Power Corp, Mr Albert Frere,
chairman of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, and Switzerland's Pargesa.
Although Time Warner has had some success in its quest for so-called
'strategic' partners, most notably its Time Warner Entertainment (TWE) joint
venture with Japan's Toshiba and C. Itoh, overall its progress has been
slow. Some potential investors have been deterred by Time Warner's policy of
maintaining management control of its investment vehicles. At TWE, for
example, Toshiba and C Itoh invested Dollars 1bn for a 12.5 per cent stake,
leaving Time Warner with control of the subsidiary.
In May, poor investor interest forced Time Warner to cut the size of a
private placement of long-term notes to Dollars 850m from Dollars 1bn.
Recent speculation has not helped its share price, which held steady at
Dollars 107 1/4 at mid-session yesterday. It slipped Dollars 1 1/8 the
previous day in a soaring stock market.

THE Hong Kong government yesterday sold its 10 per cent shareholding in Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL), the colony's monopoly aviation cargo
handler, to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) for HKDollars 106m.
The deal follows CNAC's purchase two weeks ago of a 5 per cent stake in
Cathay Pacific for HKDollars 1.7bn from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
China Travel Service bought another 5 per cent holding in Cathay from the
bank as well.
The move was seen yesterday as strengthening Cathay Pacific's role in Hong
Kong after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997.
The Swire group, Cathay's parent, owns 30 per cent of HACTL and CNAC is
closely related to China Aviation Administration Corporation, China's civil
aviation authority.
The acquisition was also seen as a vote of confidence by China in the
colony's new multi-billion dollar airport as HACTL only has a future if the
new airport is built. The company's ability to expand cargo handling
facilities at Kai Tek, the existing airport, is limited as Kai Tek is
expected to reach full capacity by 1994 or 1995.
The Provisional Airport Authority has called for expressions of interest
from companies wanting to operate mainstream cargo handling and dedicated
express cargo operations at Chek Lap Kok. It aims to issue one or more
licences and HACTL is expected to feature among the winners.
Last year HACTL handled 821,000 tonnes of air cargo, 7 per cent up on 1990
in spite of the Gulf War. HACTL estimates the long run growth in air cargo
at around 8 per cent a year.
In addition to Swire, Jardine Matheson owns 30 per cent of HACTL, Wharf
Holdings 15 per cent, and Hongkong Whampoa Docks - a Hutchison Whampoa
subsidiary - 15 per cent.

Chemical returns

<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Chemical, a leading Japanese chemical producer, reported a 61.5 per
cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y9.1bn (Dollars 72.8m) in the first half-year
to end-June, as the slowing of the Japanese economy undermined demand for
industrial chemicals.
Sales for the period fell 14 per cent to Y321.2bn, with sales of basic
chemicals down 18 per cent, of aluminium 26 per cent, and of speciality
chemicals 2 per cent lower.
Demand for basic chemicals such as plastics and monomers has weakened in the
Japanese car and domestic appliance industries, which have reduced output
this year because of a rapid increase in inventories. Sales of aluminium
products were weakened by the sharp fall in building starts during the first
half.
Domestic sales of specialty chemicals remained strong, but exports were
bruised by the appreciation of the yen and the international recession.
Sales of agricultural chemicals fell 4 per cent, with an increase in
domestic sales of feed ingredients and public hygiene chemicals outweighed
by a decrease in exports.
Sumitomo had aimed for a pre-tax profit of Y15bn, but the weakening of the
Japanese economy in recent months has forced most companies to revise their
estimates.
For the full year to end December, Sumitomo is forecasting sales of Y640bn,
down 8.7 per cent, and a pre-tax profit of Y14bn, down 43 per cent, though
even those forecasts may prove optimistic.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Indonesia's banks await foreign
investors - Prospects for an influx of cash into Jakarta's financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesian brokers have been on the starting-blocks anticipating a law
permitting foreign ownership of bank shares.
However, several months after details were agreed by government ministers,
the law remains unratified. The anticipated race for shares may now be off,
with many brokers advising clients to adopt a wait-and-see approach.
The decree will allow foreigners to buy up to 49 per cent of a bank's listed
shares. An influx of foreign capital would, government ministers believe,
bring stability to the banking sector and act as a catalyst for the Jakarta
stock market which has been handicapped by a dearth of liquidity.
Listed banks among Indonesia's top 10 private banks in terms of assets
include Bank Danamon, Bank International Indonesia, Bank Umum Nas-ional,
Bank Dagang National Indonesia, Bank Niaga, Bank Duta, Bank Bali and Lippo
Bank. Their combined assets at the end of last year totalled Rp26,100bn
(Dollars 13bn).
The unexplained delay in the decree has given investors a chance to look
closely at the sector and at a number of reports by leading brokers. A
report in May by Jardine Fleming Nusantara, the Indonesian subsidiary of the
Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming merchant bank, described the the Indonesian
banking system as 'in a period of turmoil (and) consolidation'.
The banking sector experienced explosive growth after the government passed
a sweeping deregulation package in 1988. Total bank credits rose from
Rp44,001bn in 1988 to Rp97,696bn in 1990. In the second quarter of 1990,
credit from private banks recorded a year-on-year growth of 120 per cent.
Competition between banks - there are some 170 of which 11 are listed - led
many to expand beyond their management capability and lend on the back of
poor credit analysis. Bank Indonesia, the central bank, estimates the
sector's bad and doubtful debts last year at 5.9 per cent of total loans, up
from 3.9 per cent in 1990.
Private bankers are more pessimistic and estimate the non-performing loans
at about 15 per cent of the sector's total portfolio. Donors say the
non-performing loans of the five state commercial banks, which account for
about half the sector's assets, range between 15 and 25 per cent of their
respective portfolios.
A recent report by Crosby Securities says: 'The financial health of the
leading banks is adequate.' But it warns that 'the profits reported by the
banks are flattered by inadequate charges for bad debts'.
Potential foreign investors will also be aware of the past record of some
banks when disclosing their balance sheets. In 1990 Bank Duta failed to
disclose foreign exchange losses of Dollars 419m a few months before going
public. Bank Indonesia has since taken steps to curb the sector's worst
excesses.
Banks have also been struggling to reach a timetable for higher capital
adequacy requirements, from 5 per cent of total assets last March to 8 per
cent by December next year. Bankers estimate the state banks alone will
require up to Dollars 2bn of new capital by the end of next year.
But the sector's current difficulties should be placed against a background
of continuing macro-economic growth. Gross domestic product rose 6.75 per
cent last year and banks will be key beneficiaries of a rise in per capita
income which the World Bank forecasts will almost double to Dollars 1,000 by
the turn of the century.
Continued economic growth should provide the surest means for banks to
improve profitability and reduce bad debt. Although this year has been one
of consolidation - credit growth is expected to be just 15 per cent - the
better managed banks are benefiting from an average 7 per cent spread
between deposit and lending rates.
Bankers believe many of the listed banks will soon announce rights issues as
a means of meeting the capital adequacy targets and improving liquidity. As
Mr Phillip Widjaja, vice-president of Bank Bali, said, the decree 'is good
news for banks, especially given the capital adequacy regulation. A lot of
banks are still undercapitalised'.
This may lead many non-listed banks, perhaps even some state banks, to
consider a flotation which would present investors with a confusion of
choice.
Brokers have given a preliminary 'avoid' recommendation to about half the
leading listed banks. In the past two months, however, the share prices of
these banks have risen on average 20 per cent, while the shares of Bank
International Indonesia, which many brokers have recommended as a 'buy',
have remained static.
The bull market in bank shares has been caused by domestic investors buying
in advance of the decree. Brokers say share prices may actually weaken when
the market is opened to foreigners.
'The market is likely to be surprised by the lack of foreign interest,'
explained one broker. The sector, however, will be difficult for country
fund managers to disregard. Banks account for about 10 per cent of the stock
market's capitalisation and a balanced Indonesia portfolio will require a
stake.

<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC), Switzerland's second largest bank, said
consolidated pre-tax profit before exceptional items and provisions fell 7.7
per cent in the first half to SFr1.24bn (Dollars 944m), mainly due to the
costs connected with integrating recent acquisitions.
SBC also signalled a weaker result and higher provisions in the full year
than it had hoped for.
'Although no end to the current phase of high interest rates is yet in
sight, the bank believes it may be possible to achieve a cash flow figure
close to the previous year's good result,' the company said.
In March, Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive, said the bank had ambitious
goals and the directors were confident they would generate 'good results'
during the year.
The group's personnel costs soared 18.3 per cent in the first half to
SFr1.3bn, with two thirds of the rise coming from the newly consolidated
companies, BSI and the Dominguez Barry group. Business and office overheads
jumped 27 per cent to SFr755m, in part because of exceptional costs in
connection with the integration of the O'Connor derivatives business.
Consolidated commission income jumped 30 per cent to SFr1.01bn with
brokerage and revenues from portfolio management and investment funds both
rising substantially.
A 5.9 per cent fall in income from financial operations and trading to
SFr635m came mainly from securities, while the 5.5 per cent rise in net
interest earnings to SFr1.6bn was due to the consolidation of Banca della
Svizzera Italiana (BSI) and higher interest bearing assets abroad.
Total consolidated assets at the end of June at SFr201bn were 2.9 per cent
lower than at the end of last year.
Customer lending was flat at SFr118bn.

Dumez

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE senior management of Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, one of France's largest
industrial companies, has been reshuffled with the replacement of Mr
Jean-Paul Parayre, as deputy chairman and director general, by Mr Jean-Louis
Brault, another director of the group.
Mr Parayre's departure has been interpreted as a victory for Mr Jerome
Monod, chairman, who has been trying to consolidate his hold over the group
ever since Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water utility company he headed, merged
with Dumez, the construction group led by Mr Parayre, two years ago.
Ironically it was Mr Parayre who had originally encouraged Dumez to opt for
the merger, against the advice of the family shareholders.
Mr Brault, his successor as deputy chairman, currently heads Degremont, a
water treatment company belonging to the Lyonnaise side of the group.
However Mr Brault, 53, spent part of his career in the construction industry
as a senior executive for Bouygues, the French company which is the world's
biggest building group.
During his time at Dumez Mr Parayre has played a pivotal part in the Channel
tunnel project. He will retain his position as chairman of Transmanche Link
(TML), the consortium of construction contractors working on the tunnel, and
will continue to lead their negotiations with the Eurotunnel group.
The management reshuffle comes shortly after Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez
disclosed a fall in net profits from FFr1.4bn in 1990 to FFr1.17bn (Dollars
234m) in 1991.
Mr Monod recently announced a divestment programme which will include
selling its 3.9 per cent stake in Havas, the French media group, and the
eventual disposal of United Westburne, its Canadian building materials
subsidiary.

CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third largest bank, saw consolidated pre-tax
profit, before provisions and write-downs, rise 8.4 per cent to SFr1.44bn
(Dollars 1.09bn) in the first half.
However, it reported that profits deteriorated in the second quarter and
warned that if the economic situation in Switzerland continued to worsen,
this year's provisions by the parent company might have to be larger than
last year's SFr993m.
The bank had previously forecast that provisions would be at about the same
level as last year.
Consolidated income from interest-related business rose only 3.4 per cent in
the first half to SFr1.2bn, reflect ing significantly weaker growth in
lendings and provisions taken to cover the risk of borrowers not meeting
interest payments.
Commission income soared 22.7 per cent to SFr837m, mainly because of better
receipts from commercial banking, current account, investment management and
securities administration activities. Commissions on stock exchange and new
issue business were down slightly.
Income from trading in securities, foreign exchange, precious metals and
interest rate instruments rose 10.8 per cent to SFr782m.
Total consolidated assets reached SFr163.7bn at the end of June, up 5.2 per
cent from the end of last year.
The parent company's gross profit rose only 5.4 per cent in the first half
to SFr1.07m.
The bank said that 'the persistently sluggish economy and tight interest
rates have exacerbated risks, particularly in Switzerland where small and
medium-sized businesses, as well as real estate companies in western
Switzerland, are being hit especially hard.'

<TEXT>
BMW, the German luxury car manufacturer, yesterday reported net profits up
10.5 per cent to DM421m (Dollars 284m) in the first half of the year.
Against a backdrop of difficult markets in Europe and elsewhere, turnover
climbed by 12 per cent to DM16.2bn and the number of cars sold rose by 15.4
per cent to 300,367.
In the first half, it produced 313,000 cars, 19 per cent more than in the
same period last year.
The company predicted the rate of growth would slow in the second half but
said it would probably manufacture and sell more cars and motorcycles over
1992 as a whole than it did last year, when car output totalled 553,000
units.
BMW attributed its strong performance to its new 3-Series model which, BMW
said, had enjoyed widespread success. This had helped BMW's total car sales
to increase by 30 per cent in the US, to 31,000 models, and to maintain its
sales in Japan at the same level as last year despite sharply deteriorating
conditions.
BMW said a lasting recovery in the world car market could hardly be expected
this year, especially in the light of the uncertain economic recovery in the
US and Japan.
Conditions in Europe - and especially Germany - would remain weak because of
high interest rates. The outlook for the German market was blighted by the
prospect of further taxes, levies and restrictions, the company complained.
It said it was doing its best to ensure profitability would be maintained
despite Germany's unattractiveness as a production location.
It aims to invest some DM500m in the first stage of a plant in South
Carolina which, the company said, would strengthen its international
competitiveness, secure jobs and reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in the
US dollar.
Mercedes-Benz, the luxury car subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest
industrial company, has signed letters of intent to set up joint venture
production facilities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
Mr Werner Niefer, chief executive, said he had arranged the sale of a large
number of Mercedes vehicles in all three countries.

advice

SHARES in Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, dropped 4 per cent
yesterday after the research subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest
bank, advised its clients to get rid of their shares in the Munich-based
insurance company.
The sell recommendation from DB Research caused the shares to drop by DM79
to DM1,872 yesterday, meaning Allianz's shares have fallen by more than 7
per cent since Tuesday when the company announced its results.
Allianz reported its first-ever loss on its mainstream underwriting
business, its figures blighted by losses in North America and eastern
Germany.
Following a presentation by Allianz to stockbrokers' analysts in Munich on
Wednesday, Mr Michael Drepper of DB Research concluded that Allianz's
earnings per share for last year were significantly overstated and so urged
the bank's clients to sell.
Such a sell recommendation is still unusual for the German equity market. It
prompted an immediate response from Allianz, which put out a statement
defending the way it calculated its earnings for last year.
DB Research told its clients that Allianz's earnings last year should more
properly have been DM26 per share, less than two thirds of the DM40.85
reported on Tuesday and a 40 per cent drop from the DM43.30 reported in
1990.
The analyst decided the DM576m (Dollars 388m) loss incurred by Deutsche
Versicherungs - the former east German state sector insurance monopoly
acquired by Allianz for DM711m - should have been booked 'above the line'
and not treated as an extraordinary item which does not have any effect on
earnings.
Allianz retaliated by saying the losses ought to be treated as part of the
cost of the acquisition. 'We took over a state monopoly where the
productivity was 35 per cent of the level in the west of Germany,' Mr
Diethart Breipohl, Allianz's finance director argued yesterday. 'We have to
incur costs (to rationalise the business) which none of our competitors in
the east have to bear. If this doesn't count as extraordinary, I don't know
what does.'
Yesterday's events are likely to lead to further tensions between Allianz
and Deutsche Bank, the two most powerful players in the German financial
services industry.

DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit in the second quarter fell
by nearly 30 per cent from a year earlier, dragging down first-half net
earnings by 37 per cent to Fl 210m (Dollars 127m).
The company said margins had come under pressure from lower selling prices
and continued worldwide overcapacity, as well as from a decline in demand
for chemicals in eastern Europe which was causing fiercer competition than
normal in western Europe and the Far East.
However, the second-quarter net profit of Fl 110m was slightly better than
the result achieved in the first quarter, when profit had tumbled by 43.8
per cent to Fl 100m.
In its first forecast for full-year results, DSM said 1992 profit would be
lower, but it gave no figures. The interim dividend was unchanged at Fl
2.65.
Unlike the first quarter, when lower profits were due chiefly to narrower
margins in hydrocarbons and polymers, the second-quarter downturn mainly
reflected a worsening of results in base chemicals, which were hit hardest
by the faltering eastern European demand.
In the first six months, the operating profit of the hydrocarbon and
polymers division fell to just Fl 1m from Fl 9m a year earlier. The base and
fine chemicals division saw operating results fall to Fl 81m from Fl 149m.
Turnover was down 3 per cent at Fl 4.9bn.

<TEXT>
MR RAUL GARDINI, the Italian industrialist, yesterday announced the
acquisition of four Italian mineral water brands, turning him into one of
the largest operators in the national market.
Garma, a holding company controlled by Mr Gardini, has paid an undisclosed
sum to an Italian businessman for Italfin, a drinks business with a combined
annual mineral water turnover equivalent to Dollars 200m.
This is Mr Gardini's second Italian mineral water acquisition within a
fortnight and lifts his market share to 20 per cent, where he rivals the
French food group BSN, owner of the Ferrarelle and Boario brands.
It is the latest reshuffle in the European mineral water industry after the
takeover of Perrier, the French group, by Nestle, the Swiss foods group.
The brands Mr Gardini bought yesterday - Rocaro, Pejo, Santa Rita and
Ciapazzi - hold 7 per cent of the Italian market. In mid-June, he paid an
estimated Dollars 300m for the food and drinks group Nuova GIA, which
controls the Levissima water brand, with a 13 per cent market share.
Mr Gardini declined to indicate whether or not he might be interested in the
several brands which Nestle has agreed to sell as a condition of getting
European Commission clearance for the takeover. He said he was studying the
situation.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Deficit of SFr116m at Swissair
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISSAIR, the Swiss national airline, has reported an operating loss after
depreciation of SFr116m (Dollars 88m) in the first half compared with a loss
of SFr97m in the same period last year.
However, the group forecast that it would make a net profit for the year,
helped again by aircraft and other asset sales, and the result would be
'broadly in line' with last year's SFr83m.
The airline, which is in the midst of a four-year programme to strip SFr300m
out of annual costs, said the first half results reflected sluggish demand,
overcapacity and drastic reductions in fares worldwide.
Total traffic volume was up only 8 per cent, significantly less than the
European airline average, but Swissair said its volume in the first half of
last year during the Gulf War fell less than that of its rivals.
Revenue was up 5 per cent to SFr2.5bn, but the overall load factor slipped
to 59.3 per cent and revenue per passenger declined, resulting in a
continuing loss. Last year, the airline's break-even point was 64 per cent.
Swissair said its overall costs rose 5 per cent in the first half, and
depreciation charges were up by SFr14m to SFr197m.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Striving to cap bid speculation - The
factors behind Lasmo's low share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST December, Lasmo was the toast of the City after pulling off its
audacious Pounds 1bn takeover of rival oil company Ultramar. Seven months
later it has watched its shares plummet, and is the subject of bid rumours
itself.
Lasmo's directors joke that they have years of experience of opening the
morning papers to read that companies are about to attempt to take them
over.
'People can say that any company bigger than we are might be interested in
buying us,' says Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive. 'Only there aren't so
many companies that are bigger than us any more.'
Nevertheless, Mr Greentree and his colleagues, who announced first-half
results well above analysts' forecasts on Wednesday, might be forgiven for
feeling disappointed by the persistence of the speculation, and a share
price which stands at about a 20 per cent discount to the most pessimistic
net asset valuations.
Even oil industry analysts admit that the pressure on the share price is a
classic example of City short-term thinking and distrust of companies that
do not make fast profits.
For in the longer term, there is much positive to be said of Lasmo. It is
investing in 20 oil and gas fields in five countries, all due onstream by
the end of 1994. These should add 40 per cent to the company's average
production of 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day  - a figure which has
itself increased by more than 100,000 b/d in the last year.
Despite the problems experienced with floating off Ultramar's US downstream
assets, the takeover achieved its objective of creating a strong exploration
and production company with considerable reserves concentrated in the UK
North Sea and Indonesia.
In the North Sea, Lasmo has a number of interesting developments, notably
the Markham field in the southern gas basin - the first project to export UK
gas to the European market.
Indonesia accounts for more than 40 per cent of reserves. And the company's
share of reserves in its biggest interest, the Sanga Sanga
production-sharing contract in Kalimantan, were recently increased by 34.1m
barrels to 454.7m barrels.
Gas from the field will be processed at the Bontang plant, currently being
developed into the biggest liquefied natural gas plant in the world, giving
Lasmo a significant foothold in the huge LNG market in the Pacific Rim.
Mr Greentree says pessimistic City forecasts overlook the importance of
these Indonesian assets.
'Indonesia is a huge earnings generator, but is one of the least understood
parts of our business.'
The forecast production increase, moreover, refers only to developments
under way, and takes no account of possible success with the drill bit. Only
last week, oil was discovered on acreage in which Lasmo has a 30 per cent
share in the Irish Sea, four miles off the coast of Southport, Merseyside.
As well as selling some parcels of non-core acreage, Lasmo is also trying to
arrange swaps.
The recent deal with BP, which left it with some attractive gas prospects
adjacent to its Markham and Caister fields, highlighted the merits of this
approach.
Exploration spending will have to fall, however, to only Pounds 136m this
year, and could be less than Pounds 100m next year.
This is mainly because Lasmo is at a particularly capital-intensive phase in
its cycle.
The 20 ongoing developments raised capital spending to Pounds 184m in the
first half of this year, compared with Pounds 129m in the same period in
1991.
It is this factor, together with the Pounds 291m loss incurred on the
disposal of Ultramar's downstream assets, that has caused gloom in the City.
Before new developments come onstream, Lasmo faces a period of high
spending, high debt, and probably unimpressive earnings.
This week's results looked encouraging at first glance, with Pounds 26m net
earnings outperforming all forecasts. But they were flattered by a holding
charge of Pounds 22m, representing capitalised interest costs from carrying
Ultramar's downstream businesses.
'In the long term, they look very good indeed, but in the short term all the
worries on the dividend and earnings are still there,' said Mr Rob Arnott,
oil analyst at Hoare Govett in London.
Attention is also focused on gearing which, with total debt at Pounds 914m,
stood at 80 per cent on June 30.
The company believes, however, that gearing can be kept under control
through its rationalisation programme.
It expects to raise about Dollars 170m (Pounds 89m) from the sale of
Ultramar's US upstream assets and the remaining 50 per cent of its interest
in Lasmo Canada, and hopes to make further disposals of non-strategic UK
assets worth up to Dollars 100m by the end of next year.
The real wild card in the pack is the price of crude oil. Mr Michael Pavia,
finance director, said a Pounds 1 per barrel rise in the sterling price,
whether through a change in exchange rates or a rise in the dollar price,
would add Dollars 40m to cashflow.
Without such an upturn in the crude price, however, the share price looks
set to remain low. If so, the bid speculation will continue.
Some analysts even suggest that the price may have been driven down so far
in the hope of a bid, which could revitalise the whole of the subdued oil
sector.
Larger companies, they say, will inevitably be looking at Lasmo, and valuing
the whole package over the long term in the way the City does not.
Mr Arnott says that now is the time a bid could emerge, with the share price
looking attractive and the interim results and balance sheet just published.
Mr David Basham, at Kleinwort Benson, disagrees, arguing that few oil
companies would be in a position to make a bid that could total Pounds 3bn.
They would have to wait until their own earnings start to pick up, which
would not be before 1993 or 1994.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harry Ramsden's ahead to Pounds 76,706
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Ramsden's, the USM-quoted fish and chip restaurant group, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 73,559 to Pounds 76,706 in the half year to
March 29.
Following the success of the Glasgow and Heathrow franchises, Mr John
Barnes, chairman, said the company was on track to open up to 15 restaurants
in the UK and the Republic of Ireland by 1995 and there were plans to open
franchised outlets in the Pacific Rim and the Middle East.
He said the highlight of the second half would be the first international
opening in Hong Kong, which forms the basis of the expansion in the Pacific
Rim.
Turnover of Pounds 728,288 (Pounds 714,631) originated from the Guiseley
restaurant only. Earnings per share rose to 0.9p (0.8p) and the interim
dividend is held at 1p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Novo calls for Pounds 9m as profits jump
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOVO GROUP yesterday announced a sharp rise in profits, an Pounds 8.8m
rights issue to help fund a Pounds 3.3m acquisition, and a capital
reorganisation.
For the 12 months to March 31 profits at the pre-tax level rose to Pounds
1.08m helped by the acquisition in April 1991 of Novo Communications for
Dollars 14m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.8m.
The figures compared with Pounds 158,000 and Pounds 9.45m for the preceding
18 months. Earnings were 10.1p (1.44p).
The group, formerly EMC, is a provider of inventory management, storage and
distribution services to the film and television industries.
The underwritten rights issue is of 29.38m new ordinary shares on a 16-for-3
basis at 30p per share. Some Pounds 3.3m of the Pounds 8.8m will be used to
acquire Walport International together with the 50 per cent of Walport
Telmar Scandinavia not already held by Walport International.
Walport is the world's largest supplier of rented visual entertainment to
the commercial shipping industry.
The capital restructure involves the conversion of the 1m 6 per cent
convertible preference shares into 3.33m new ordinaries; the conversion of
the 2.14m 10 per cent cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares
into 7.12m new ordinaries; the redemption of the 2.14m 10 per cent
cumulative redeemable preference shares at par; and repayment of the
outstanding loan notes, which were used in respect of the acquisition of
Dataguard, for Dollars 4.25m (Pounds 2.2m).
The directors said the 'geographical mix of the group's earnings and its
unwieldy loan structure' had combined to prevent it paying its preference
dividends. The ordinary payment is therefore omitted - a 1.6p total was paid
for 1991.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Second quarter setback behind 7% downturn
at Hepworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEPWORTH experienced steady trading in the first three months of this year,
but the second quarter saw a further decline in demand from its main UK
markets.
The building materials and home products company reported a 7 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.8m for the six months to June 30 on
turnover 3.6 per cent lower at Pounds 319.1m.
However, the group said trading in the important continental markets had
been reasonably good, with Saunier Duval, its gas boiler maker, performing
particularly well.
Building products benefited from buoyant demand for European clay pipes and
held profits at Pounds 11.9m on flat turnover, in spite of worsening trading
conditions in the UK.
Management was continuing to introduce new products and a reduction in the
division's UK workforce from 2,400 to 2,000 had already been announced,
costs of which would be taken in the second half.
The home products division, which experienced reduced UK demand for its gas
boilers and garage doors, saw profits fall from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 6.3m
on turnover of Pounds 49.8m (Pounds 52.6m).
Saunier Duval raised profits to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 10.5m) on turnover of
Pounds 90.9m (Pounds 75.6m). Demand for combination boilers remained buoyant
in its main French and Spanish markets and the outlook remained favourable.
The worst performance came from refractories where weak demand worldwide saw
profits fall from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 4.6m on turnover of Pounds 64.6m
(Pounds 78.5m).
Management responded by significantly reducing the cost base and further
rationalisation is being implemented. The group warned that these costs
would fall in the second half, and full-year profits would be much lower
than last time.
Reduced demand also affected the mineral and chemicals division, but a
reduction in costs made last year partly mitigated the impact of weaker
trading. Although turnover dropped from Pounds 51m to Pounds 38.5m after a
disposal, profits fell just Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 5.5m.
Gearing dropped from 33 per cent at the year-end to 25 per cent.
Capital expenditure had been curbed in the light of deteriorating market
conditions, although heavy investment was continuing at Saunier Duval.
Earnings per share were 11.3p (12.2p). The interim dividend is held at 5.5p.
COMMENT
Hepworth is clearly a class act in the bombed-out building products sector,
but that was not enough to prevent the shares being marked down in May after
it became clear there was going to be no immediate post-election boom in the
UK. These results are respectable, given the present trading conditions -
although cost-cutting might reduce full-year profits by Pounds 8m - and the
company's caution following destocking of its boilers by merchants. Overseas
business now accounts for more than 40 per cent of profits and sales, partly
because the UK is so flat. What is impressive is the way Hepworth keeps on
cutting costs and improving products, and not just waiting for the upturn.
The shares closed 4p higher at 310p putting them on a prospective multiple
of just under 16. Hepworth remains one of the best quality recovery plays.

<TEXT>
Life Sciences International, the scientific instruments company, continued
to buck the continuing recession in the US, its largest market, by reporting
a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 7.74m to Pounds 8.48m on sales of Pounds
50.7m, up from Pounds 39.5m.
Mr Christopher Bland, chairman, said: 'In the first six months of the year
we have experienced the toughest conditions since new management took over
five years ago.'
He reported a recent strengthening of demand in North American markets,
which account for about two thirds of group sales.
While European markets showed some signs of recovery, Mr Bland said the
Japanese market remained sluggish.
The issue of new shares to acquire Neslab, a New Hampshire temperature
control company, and a higher tax charge, affected fully diluted earnings
per share which edged up to 3.8p (3.7p).
The interim dividend was increased from 1.15p to 1.2p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant export markets help Dale Electric
surge 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBUST EXPORT markets helped Dale Electric International, the
Yorkshire-based power and lighting company, report a 50 per cent rise to
Pounds 1.9m in 1991-92 profits before tax and exceptional items, in spite of
a small drop in sales.
Mr Iain Dale, chief executive, said exports had jumped from 40 per cent to
55 per cent of turnover last year. Overall, sales fell from Pounds 56.6m to
Pounds 55.9m for the year to May 3.
Demand in the Pacific Rim continued to be strong, Mr Dale said, while the UK
remained depressed. 'Ten years ago we invested heavily in the export
market,' he said. 'That investment has helped us to sustain recovery in
these difficult times.'
He added, however, that Dale might struggle in the dollar denominated export
market if the currency remained weak.
Pre-tax profits were buoyed by lower interest charges of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
2.3m) and a Pounds 395,000 increase to Pounds 456,000 in the contribution
from associated companies. The restated 1.02p loss per share moved back into
the black with earnings of 10.15p. The final dividend is maintained at 3.1p,
for a same-again 5.1p total.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: CIA's 27% rise bucks trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA Group, the independent media-buying concern, bucked the sector trend in
the first half of 1992 with a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 1.87m.
Tight control of costs was given as a principal cause for the improvement.
Further, the USM-quoted group revealed that this time a higher proportion of
its profits were from trading - 56 per cent, against 46 per cent - and that
this growth was both organic and by acquisition.
Turnover rose to Pounds 116.3m (Pounds 79.3m). Of this, organic growth
accounted for Pounds 10m domestically and Pounds 14m internationally, with
new companies - Maedia Solutions and the 20/20 Media joint venture -
contributing an extra Pounds 13m.
The group put on Pounds 48m of new business and lost only Pounds 5m.
Although Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said that the the UK
performance had been 'pleasing', CIA International had been the star - its
turnover more than doubled.
However, Mr Peter Toynton, finance director, said that expansion on the
international side, of which 85 per cent is in Europe, was 'cautious', even
'boringly so'.
'We are a numbers business,' said Mr Ingram, 'and we have seen what happens
when others buy blind.'
The group increased its cash by about Pounds 1m to Pounds 8m, giving the
opportunity to selectively acquire 'good, well-run companies which are now
cheaper than they were a few years ago'.
Earnings per share expanded to 8.59p (6.82p).
The interim dividend is raised from 1.15p to 1.32p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Midland management shake-up set in train -
Pearse announces break-up of branch network into five regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN Pearse, Midland Bank's chief executive, yesterday sounded the death
knell for the group's complicated management structure.
He also performed the last rites over two of its trading names, Midland
Group, which since the mid-1980s has been used to describe the parent
company, and Midland Montagu, which embraced investment banking and some
corporate banking.
Under the ownership of Hongkong Bank, Midland is being simplified. However,
Mr Pearse said many of the changes had been planned long before the
takeover.
'When I joined the bank (in the spring of 1991), it was a nightmare', he
said. 'The management arrangements were too complicated.'
There will now be six business units.
Branch banking, under Mr Chris Wathen.
Corporate and institutional banking, run by Mr David Thornham.
Financial services, under Mr Kerry Alberti.
Forward Trust, the finance house, and Firstdirect, the telephone bank, under
Mr Graham Picken.
Treasury, run by Mr Guy Heald.
Merchant banking, run by Mr Christopher Sheridan.
These posts report directly to Mr Pearse. As a result, two senior Midland
jobs become redundant - the head of the UK bank and the head of Midland
Montagu. So Mr Gene Lockhart and Mr George Loudon, who filled these
respective roles, have left.
In the coming weeks, about 100 middle managers employed by Midland's head
office and centrally managed operations will also depart due to the
integration with Hongkong Bank.
Meanwhile, commercial banking on the Continent and support services - the
finance department, risk management, personnel and legal services - will
report to Mr Keith Whitson. The newly appointed deputy chief executive, who
was transferred from Hongkong Bank, will also report to Mr Pearse.
But probably the most important management change is the break-up of the
branch network into five regions, each with its own general manager.
Mr Pearse stressed that these were senior posts and that the general
managers would have direct contact with him - so in that sense, Mr Wathen is
primus inter pares in his relations with these managers, Mr Pearse said.
Mr Pearse is at pains to stress the seniority of these new posts for two
reasons. First he needs to reassure the incumbents, at least two of whom -
Mr Bob Wyatt, formerly deputy managing director of corporate banking, and Mr
David Baker, retail banking director - may feel that they have moved down a
notch in the hierarchy.
Second he is genuinely committed to devolving power to the regions. He
believes that in the 1980s the big banks' ability to control risk and meet
customers' needs was impaired by a centralisation of decision-making - and
that the huge loan losses they all face has been the price paid.
The regional general managers will devote considerable resources to
improving the service offered to corporate customers, aided by a parallel
process of unifying Midland's corporate lending operations.
About 300 Enterprise branches and branch sections, providing loans of up to
Pounds 75,000 to small companies, will disappear.
They will be integrated into the main branch network, thereby abolishing the
distinction between very small business loans and slightly bigger loans.
In addition, over the coming year, the regions will also assume
responsibility for banking relationships with all UK companies, except the
700 biggest ones.
These more medium-size relationships are currently managed by David
Thornham's corporate banking unit. He will, however, gradually take control
of Hongkong Bank's UK corporate banking operations. As a result of these
changes, some of Midland's specialist corporate lenders will be redeployed.
The aim, said Mr Pearse, was for the bank to increase market share in order
to achieve any serious growth in the business. This was necessary because Mr
Pearse is pessimistic about the outlook for growth in the UK banking market.
Mr Pearse also stressed that the regional managers were conscious that they
must not drop their lending standards in order to win new business.
However some companies and individuals may choose to bank with Midland
simply because they perceive it to have become more robust under Hongkong
Bank's ownership. Indeed, Mr Pearse said that the bank had indeed attracted
a significant number of new clients for this reason.
But the task of rebuilding Midland is only half done, he said. Only days
away from his 59th birthday, he does not know when he will retire - but he
will be around until 'the job is complete.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Weak basic chemicals market behind 17%
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries reported half-year pre-tax profits down 17 per
cent from Pounds 507m to Pounds 420m.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said the fall was mainly because of weak
market conditions in the basic chemicals and agrochemicals and seeds
markets. Earnings per share fell 14 per cent to 39.9p (46.6p). The interim
dividend is maintained at 21p.
The recession was lasting longer and was deeper than most people had
originally expected, he said. The faint signs of recovery in the early
spring had faded. He refused to make any predictions about the world
economy, except that it would remain uncertain and life would continue to be
tough.
The pharmaceuticals, specialties and materials businesses had improved
through self-help and determined control of costs, Sir Denys added. The
restructuring programme was progressing well and cost savings were running
at an annual rate of Pounds 250m.
Group turnover fell 4 per cent from Pounds 6.37bn to Pounds 6.15bn. Reduced
selling prices accounted for 1 percentage point, falling volumes 1
percentage point and disposals 3 percentage points. Favourable exchange
rates increased turnover by 1 percentage point. The sales decline occurred
mainly during the second quarter.
Half-year trading profits at the pharmaceuticals division rose only 3 per
cent from Pounds 233m to Pounds 241m on turnover of Pounds 771m (Pounds
729m). Growth from new products and disposal gains were offset by increasing
US generic competition against Tenormin, a beta-blocker for hypertension
which is ICI's best-selling drug and the world's fifth largest.
Operating profits at the agrochemicals and seeds operations fell 39 per cent
from Pounds 154m to Pounds 94m on turnover of Pounds 769m (Pounds 801m). The
company blamed wet weather and intensified price competition in the US, as
well as European farmers' concerns about the recently announced reforms of
the Common Agricultural Policy.
Trading profits for the specialities operations were Pounds 36m (Pounds 29m)
on turnover of Pounds 655m (Pounds 652). The paints businesses reported
profits of Pounds 55m (Pounds 57m) on sales of Pounds 817m (Pounds 789m).
Materials recorded profits of Pounds 14m (Pounds 8m) on revenues of Pounds
987m (Pounds 1.021bn), while explosives generated profits of Pounds 21m on
sales of Pounds 272m (Pounds 254m).
The improvements in the specialities and materials businesses were due
primarily to cost reduction programmes. However, Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief
operating officer, said profits in the businesses were still unsatisfactory.
The industrial chemicals division suffered from squeezed margins created by
a combination of recession and over-capacity. The chlor-alkali businesses
suffered from high energy costs and production is being kept at only 75 per
cent of capacity. The whole division is still looking for cost cutting
possibilities.
The group as a whole has reduced the number of employees by 5,000. Since
July 1990 the total reduction has been more than 19,000, of which 5,000 have
been transfered to other companies.
The group estimates profits for the first six months have benefited by more
than Pounds 100m from this programme.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Corporate theories reversed as demerger
trend gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS Textiles' demerger from Courtaulds in March 1990 was 'the best
thing we ever did,' says Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds
Textiles. In the following two years the shares of both parts of the
Courtaulds business outperformed the stock market.
The fashion to demerge reverses corporate theories about conglomeration and
diversification. Although not new - for instance Bowater split its US
paper-making side from its UK industrial business in 1984 - the urge to
demerge has been getting stronger.
There are two prime arguments for it. First, a company which was perhaps
subsumed in a big group could blossom once its management is freed of the
constraints of being part of a big group. Mr Taylor says that most companies
are too big to be managed effectively. The parts should be comprehensible to
its senior management, he argues.
Second is the argument that 'the whole is worth less than the sum of the
parts' - the opposite of the conglomerate theory. Unbundling, as Sir James
Goldsmith called it, can reveal hidden treasures in a company.
A trade buyer could be found which had a higher opinion of a subsidiary's
value. Or a flotation could be arranged. Once exposed to the outside world a
formerly neglected subsidiary's true worth might be seen by investors. The
stock market value of the two companies could be higher than they were
before separation.
That was the hope behind demerger moves at Racal, the electronics group.
When Racal floated its telecommunications business in 1988 it retained an 80
per cent stake. Racal was horrified to discover afterwards that its own
shares sometimes traded at less than the per share value of its stake in
Racal Telecom.
The solution was to give the rest of the Telecom shares to Racal
shareholders, renaming the company Vodafone at the same time. Extra value
was created for investors. Racal hopes to perform the same trick again with
its Chubb security business in the autumn.
Like Racal, and even ICI, BAT Industries was inspired to demerge some of its
businesses when it came under threat of a takeover bid. The assailant in
BAT's case was Sir James. In common with potential bidders for Racal and
ICI, he was fended off.
BAT, the tobacco and financial services giant, went on to give away shares
in Argos, its retail chain, and Wiggins Teape Appleton, its paper company to
shareholders.
Without knowing how a company's shares would have performed without
demerging, it is hard to say whether value is enhanced in the longer term.
The Courtaulds example is one of the simplest of demergers to track. It
involved handing out one free share in the textile company for every four
shares held in Courtaulds. A special dividend was also paid.
In BAT's case the parent company's shares had been boosted by the threatened
bid before the demergers and that bid premium disappeared afterwards. The
sharp rise in ICI's share price after the demerger plan was announced
suggests that its shareholders believe there will be a longer term benefit
to them of the company's split.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: History based on a defensive cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI was founded in 1926 as a defensive cartel with a mission to supply the
British Empire.
Its history since then has been inextricably linked with the decline of that
empire and shifting tides in global industrial competition.
ICI was created by a merger of Britain's four leading chemicals companies -
Brunner, Mond and Company, Nobel Industries, the United Alkali Company and
the British Dyestuffs Corporation.
Brunner, Mond and Company was founded by Ludwig Mond, who fled anti-semitic
persecution in Germany to create Britain's biggest alkali business. Nobel
Industries was the creation of the Swede Alfred Nobel, whose invention of
dynamite blasted a path for the Suez Canal. The other two companies were
very much junior partners, being given only part-time representation on the
ICI board.
ICI's founders had all been alarmed by the merger in 1925 of several German
chemical companies into IG Farben, the world's biggest cartel, which
threatened to compete directly with them for exports.
The newly formed British group quickly contacted IG Farben, and Dupont, the
US chemicals giant. Sir Harry McGowan, ICI's first and dominating president,
described the creation of the British cartel as 'only the first step in a
comprehensive scheme . . .to rationalise the chemical manufacture of the
world.' ICI initially invested heavily in a fertiliser plant at Billingham,
on Teesside, based on ammonia synthesis. But the Depression caused a
worldwide slump in agriculture and there was not enough demand to support
the huge plant at Billingham.
ICI and IG Farben established production quotas for nitrogen, the main
ingredient in fertiliser, and in 1935 they carved up the world market
between them - ICI supplying the British Empire, Spain, Portugal and the
Dutch East Indies, with IG taking the rest of Europe and South America.
The deal was not enough to save Billingham, which eventually closed, but it
illustrated perfectly the outlook of the founders of ICI, who always
preferred to avoid competition. McGowan wrote in 1941 that he did not accept
'the theory . . .that competition is essential to efficiency.'
In 1935 ICI research scientists made the company's most famous discovery -
the strong plastic polyethylene. They did so by defying a company ban on
pressurising ethylene, after previous experiments had led to explosions.
Work on developing the strong plastic was interrupted by the Second World
War.
Rearmament and the war led ICI into becoming a major supplier of chemicals
and munitions. The British government paid for the construction of new
plants, which ICI managed on a fee basis. The end of the war exposed ICI to
a much harsher economic climate. An anti-trust action brought by the US
government eventually ended hundreds of agreements on competition between
ICI and Du Pont. Although ICI opened a huge new chemicals plant at Wilton,
on Teesside, in 1952 most of its plant was obsolete and it suffered during
the fifties from the loss of captive markets in former British colonies.
Old-fashioned management attitudes and labour relations meant the group was
poorly placed to benefit from the opportunities thrown up by a growing and
'de-cartelised' world market.
The 1960s saw ICI investing heavily in new plant, both in the UK and
overseas. Improved labour relations also increased productivity, although it
still lagged behind international competitors in this respect. This heavy
investment strategy improved export earnings and efficiency, but it also ran
the risk of over-capacity.
The 1970s were to prove an erratic period for ICI's profits performance,
although the group benefited from cheap North Sea gas. It focused its
attention on the US, in spite of Britain having joined the Common Market is
1972.
ICI's modern identity is indelibly associated with Sir John Harvey-Jones,
who became chairman in 1982 after the group shocked the City by cutting its
dividend at the trough of the last recession. He moved rapidly to reduce the
group's dependence on bulk chemicals and polyethylene, concentrating on
higher-margin products such as drugs and speciality chemicals
Since Sir John's retirement in 1987 his successor, Sir Denys Henderson, has
continued the same strategy - although inevitably ICI has recently been
preoccupied by coping with the recession and resisting the attentions of
Lord Hanson.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BARNES, who will become chief executive of ICI Bio after the demerger,
joined ICI as a laboratory assistant in 1957 after graduating from Liverpool
University. His first job was in the new pharmaceutical research centre at
Alderley Park, Cheshire.
He interrupted his ICI career for a period of National Service in the Royal
Artillery, where he saw active service in the Malayan emergency. Mr Barnes
rejoined ICI Pharmaceuticals in the overseas sales department and in 1971
became the drugs division's youngest director at 34.
Mr Barnes, 56, left pharmaceuticals in 1983 to head ICI Paints, where he
initiated international expansions culminating in the purchase of Glidden
Paint in the US.
He joined the main board in 1986, with responsibility for drugs, explosives
and agrochemicals. Highly regarded by his colleagues, he is considered a
possible successor to Sir Denys Henderson as chairman.
Mr Barnes is a non-executive director of Thorn EMI.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Japan offers slice of inaction: Two telecoms stocks now open
to foreign ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan will from tomorrow offer foreign investors a rare opportunity: the
right to own the worst performing stock of recent years in the Nikkei index
of the country's 225 biggest listed companies.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the domestic telecommunications group,
came to the market five and a half years ago in a partial privatisation.
Foreigners were barred from direct shareholding and Japanese flocked to the
issue. Nearly 1.7m individual shareholders are now holding stock which soon
after its debut traded at Y3.18m (Pounds 13,000) apiece, but then fell to
stand yesterday at Y595,000, half the price at which the initial tranche was
floated.
Its fall has been longer and deeper than that of the market as measured by
the Nikkei, which after a further rally yesterday stood 60 per cent below
its December 1989 peak. But because of the high initial asking price, NTT
still trades on a premium price/earnings ratio of a prospective 70, about
double that for the market as a whole.
The importance of NTT lies in its sheer size. With annual revenues
equivalent to Pounds 26bn (it dwarfs all world telephone companies except
AT&amp;T.
Its market value is a still towering Y9,282bn and is thus a key component of
the Nikkei average. Anyone hoping to build a portfolio matching the Tokyo
market would need their quota of NTT.
Foreigners have long held shares in NTT - and in Kokusai Denshin Denwa
(KDD), the smaller international telecoms carrier, ownership restrictions on
which are also being lifted from August 1. They have merely held them in
unregistered form. Tomorrow's changes, which allow a maximum foreign holding
of 20 per cent in each, will have two main consequences for overseas
investors:
In registering their holdings they will be able to collect the annual
dividend. This had been no great loss anyway - Japan's payout ratio is low
and in the case of NTT, the Y5,000 per share annual distribution represents
a yield of around 0.8 per cent.
Some foreigners are said to have circumvented the restrictions by opening
nominee accounts with Japanese securities houses, which would hold the
shares under the brokerages' name and pass on the dividend with fees
deducted.
More importantly, the deregulation will allow holding of the shares by
institutional funds previously prevented by law - as in the US and some
European countries - from buying stock which they could not register.
Analysts still suspect, however, that many of those which wanted an exposure
to NTT would have found their way around the barrier.
There are few signs of pent-up buying enthusiasm from abroad. At Nomura
Securities, Japan's biggest stockbroker, an official says 'hopefully the NTT
share price will go up' but adds: 'I think there won't be much buying
demand.'
Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president, said that he had met some US investment
bank chairmen whom he thought regarded it as 'an interesting company for the
medium-term'. 'I get a feeling . . . that foreign investors have a big
interest in NTT stock.'
Any 'medium-term' view would have to take account of the uncertain outlook
for the Tokyo stock market as economic slowdown sets in, and also the
effects of increased competition on the companies' earnings prospects.
Mr Jason James, a strategist with the London stockbroker James Capel,
acknowledges that 'you can make a case for NTT - on four times cash flow it
is cheap relative to foreign phone companies'. (BT, by comparison, is priced
at a cash-flow multiple of around five). But Mr James detects 'no great deal
of enthusiasm about either NTT or KDD in terms of fundamentals'.
NTT is forecasting a 24.3 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y267bn
in the year to next March, accelerating from a 14.8 per cent slide last
year.
While the government continues to control many telephone charges - the Y10
three-minute local call is one of Japan's best bargains - so-called new
common carriers have been allowed to mop up business by discounting on its
most important inter-city long-distance routes.
Yesterday Mr Kojima announced that on at least some routes the price gap
with its competitor consortia, which the company has been steadily
narrowing, would be eliminated by October next year.
NTT has also been lobbying the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  -
so far to no avail - to allow a reform of its rate structure based more on
the cost of providing each service, including ancillaries such as directory
assistance which lose money.
KDD, after a flat 1991, expects a 3.7 per cent rise in profits this year to
Y27bn on revenues of Y259bn, in the face of slowing growth in the volume of
calls. It says that since the partial opening up of the country's telecoms
market in the late 1980s it has now adjusted to life with its two rivals,
competing on service rather than price.
Unlike its larger sibling, KDD has had a Tokyo listing for more than 30
years. Opening ownership of the two to foreigners is arguably an optimistic
quest to stem the slide in the market, and indeed was not set in train until
the downturn began, in 1990.
For the companies themselves, there will be two main effects. First, they
may seek to list their shares on foreign exchanges in the hope of broadening
recognition. Second, they may offer equity-linked bonds in the Euromarkets -
assuming there is any appetite.
But any significant upturn in the NTT share price would, notes Capel's Mr
James, meet 'a huge overhang of disgruntled individual shareholders who had
lost several thousand pounds each' and were looking to get out.
Moreover, foreign predators with Pounds 8bn or so to spend and an eye on
what a one-fifth slice of NTT might bring should have their ardour cooled by
three further facts.
Japan's muscular Ministry of Finance retains a two-thirds stake. By law, it
cannot let this holding fall below one third (in the current trading climate
the sale of a further tranche has anyway been indefinitely postponed). And,
again by law, foreigners are banned from its board.

FT  31 JUL 92 / BT chairman attacks watchdogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Iain Vallance, BT chairman, yesterday accused the regulators of
privatised industries of threatening the success of the privatisation
programme of the 1980s.
He coupled the attack, at his annual shareholders' meeting in Birmingham,
with a warning that BT would find it very difficult to accept the tighter
price-controlled regime put forward by Oftel, the industry regulator.
If Oftel and BT cannot agree on controls, the issue will be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Oftel has told BT to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each
year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with 6.25 points at
present. The company has also been told to ensure small retail customers
share in the price cuts.
Mr Vallance said the proposed new price regime was 'extremely tough by any
standard' and many of the detailed provisions would add to the negative
impact of the proposals on BT.
He called for a change in the regulatory regime which would leave
'management free without interference' and the need for a commercial price
structure based on cost.
Mr Vallance said: 'It is also unclear how the regulators themselves are to
be held accountable. The regulated industries have little right of appeal,
and, in practice, no effective recourse to judicial review.
'We firmly believe that there is an issue of governance concerning the
regulators which the government must tackle if the real successes of the
privatisation programme of the 1980s are not to be undermined.'
Mr Vallance complained that if BT failed to agree with Oftel, the only
course was to allow the matter to be referred to the MMC. 'This is by any
standards a major undertaking, involving huge demands on senior management
time.'
BT and Oftel have recently talked privately about the possibility of
referring the proposed new price regime to the MMC, which has the power to
impose a solution. However, as BT and Oftel have threatened to go to the MMC
several times in the past, the present dispute seems to point to the two
sides' tough negotiating stances rather than a total breakdown of talks.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Philips delays launch of DCC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, said yesterday it was postponing its
launch of digital compact cassette, its latest audio product, from September
until later in 1992, but that the equipment would be in the shops in
important markets 'well before Christmas'.
The company blamed the delay on minor problems during trial production of
the DCC players. The delay closes the gap between the launch of DCC and
Minidisc, a rival format being launched by Sony in November. Philips is
counting on the new product to boost its flagging fortunes.
The company said the European launch would be limited to four countries  -
Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands - instead of simultaneously in
all European countries. The company said the change reflected expected high
demand for DCC and Philips's desire to ensure a sufficient supply of
players.
The changes to Philips' DCC launch were announced after the close of bourse
trading in Amsterdam, where the company's shares ended the day down Fl 1 at
Fl 24.50.
The announcement is bound to raise speculation that DCC is in trouble.
This is the second time Philips has postoned the launch of DCC. Initially
consumers had expected an April launch.
Philips shares fell recently after the company warned that second-quarter
profits, due on August 6, would be lower because of sluggishness in the
consumer electronic industry.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having spent the late 1980s liberating itself from the vagaries of the
commodities markets, Harrisons &amp; Crosfield is now shackled firmly to the UK
industrial cycle. Even so, thank heavens for plantations; the lion's share
of yesterday's 12 per cent increase in pre-tax interim profits derived from
the price of palm oil. Small contributions came from chemicals and building
supplies as costs were cut, but this was also the story in 1990 and 1991. It
is doubtful whether much more can be squeezed from the mainstream businesses
without a sustained economic upturn.
With capital expenditure still running at Pounds 65m a year, the best that
can be said is that H &amp; C should be positioned to benefit from any cyclical
upturn. The group appears willing to hold the full year dividend even if it
is again uncovered. Forward sales of palm oil at least offer a source of
known income in the second half, although the company may not be so lucky
thereafter.
Yet even with an unexpectedly strong recovery there may be little scope both
to raise the dividend and rebuild cover. Without an improvement in UK
earnings, an increasing proportion of overseas profits will disappear into
the coffers of the Inland Revenue. The UK tax charge increased by a third
this time as additional ACT went unrelieved. At 135p the shares are on a
historic yield of 9.7 per cent, but those who took up the 1990 rights at
137p must be feeling disappointed.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland's figures are of less immediate interest to the stock market now it
is part of the Hongkong Bank group. But as the first of the interims from
the big four clearers, they shed some light on the sector as a whole. HSBC
investors also have a particular interest in Midland's long-term recovery
prospects; the group will need a steady flow of UK profits if dividends are
to be paid without incurring a large bill for unrelieved ACT. Yesterday's
results offer little encouragement on either score.
Bad debt provisions fell by 5 per cent on last year's second half, but the
drop was largely due to the personal sector. Things have not improved on the
corporate front and management is outspoken in its gloom about the economic
outlook. More worrying still is that operating income fell even faster - at
4 per cent - than the 2 per cent rate at which the bank managed to cut its
costs. Doubtless Midland suffered some loss of business during the recent
bid battle. Yet part of the income problem is generic - witness its
admission that the recession has produced a drop in such a basic service as
money transmission.
Midland's ambition of increasing its share of a stagnating market is natural
in the circumstances, but one wonders where it will lead. It is certainly
not about to embark on a foolhardy lending spree. It aims to win business by
offering improved service without sacrificing margin. In the end, though, it
is bound to come up against other institutions with similar objectives. The
banks have recently shown they can prise mortgage lending business away from
the building societies. Sooner or later they will be at each other's
throats. The battle may not be as gentlemanly as Midland now apparently
believes.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's second quarter growth figures from the US are less depressing
than they seem. Economic expansion may have slowed to an annualised rate of
1.4 per cent during the second quarter from 2.9 per cent in the first, but
that is history. More important for the future is the news on prices.
Inflation as measured by the GDP deflator fell to 1.6 per cent from 3.6 per
cent. That should help keep long-term interest rates under downward
pressure, at least once the forthcoming quarterly government refinancing is
out of the way.
The 8 per cent jump in new home sales during June also needs to be taken
with a pinch of salt. It is often erratic as an indicator, but it does
suggest lower long-term rates are again helping the housing market by making
mortgages cheaper. UK homeowners may turn green with envy at the thought of
30-year mortgages being available in the US at a fixed rate of less than 8
per cent. But that is the stuff on which recovery feeds.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: ICI does the splits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI's demerger plan is a splendid example of how a supposedly hidebound
management can be rendered nimble by a sense of threat. The two new
companies would not be obvious takeover candidates, since one would be on a
drug company p/e and the other would consist of cyclical commodities. At the
same time, the bulk of the group's cash would presumably go to the
commodities side, leaving the drug side to replace it by a rights issue. ICI
would thus achieve the rather neat trick of raising equity for the group as
a whole on a drug company multiple.
Or perhaps not quite. As a drug company, ICI suffers the not unfamiliar
problem of having a blockbusting product going off patent with not very much
in the pipeline to follow. The proposed drug company would also derive a
fifth of its profit from agrochemicals, only deserving a high multiple on
the doubtful premise that the GATT will never make much headway in curbing
agricultural subsidies.
All the same, the drug side might conceivably be worth 15 times this year's
earnings, or around 750p per share. The commodities business is more
problematic, since applying a multiple at any given point involves an
assumption about where that point is in the chemicals cycle. One very rough
measure might be as follows. The historic peak in trading profits from
commodities was Pounds 1bn in 1988. Assume the trough comes this year at
around Pounds 280m. Take the mid-point, assume a conservative dividend cover
of 3 times and a 5 per cent yield, and the result is some 450p per share.
That gives a total of 1200p - pretty much where the shares closed last
night.
The real question is how far demerger would affect the valuation
there-after. There is room for scepticism. The divisional barons would split
into two teams, lodged in the present head office under the present
chairman. For shareholders, the demerger plan offers a welcome diversity of
opportunity. How radical it proves in operational terms is a more open
question.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Cadbury presumptions on role of directors challenged
by IoD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your readers would be misled were they to assume from your report ('CBI
and IoD attack corporate governance reform plan', July 30) that this
institute's only reservation about the Cadbury report was its proposal to
'give non-executive directors a special function within boards'.
The IoD's prime concern is that the report focuses on the accountability of
directors and boards almost without reference to their main function.
Our definition of the objective of good corporate governance is to ensure
that companies survive and thrive, and that they conduct their affairs with
ethics and integrity.
The Cadbury report was strong on integrity, but it did not address the
challenge of surviving and thriving, nor the qualities that directors and
boards of directors need to discharge all their duties.
It is, therefore, the Cadbury Committee's concept of the role of directors,
boards of directors and the part played by shareholders and owners of
companies about which the institute has the strongest reservations and about
which we believe the report produces a distorted picture of corporate
governance.
The report sends out the general massage that there should be two groups on
the board of directors - the doers and the checkers. It is the presumption
that directors require assistance in how to run companies which the IoD
believes should be reversed.
Shareholders and auditors do have a role in relation to the conduct of a
company, but the running of a company - setting the strategic direction,
ensuring its implementation, supervising management and providing
information regarding its affairs to those entitled to it - is determined by
a unitary board in the boardroom and nowhere else.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Classical architectural tradition in a contemporary
situation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BURDETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As director of The Architecture Foundation I am writing to voice our
disagreement with Colin Amery's comments (Architecture, July 20) in the last
paragraph of his article.
In selecting the buildings and projects featured in the 'City Changes'
exhibition, the Architecture Foundation - whose trustees include two eminent
architectural historians, Mark Girouard and John Harris - was anxious to
choose buildings of quality. A broad range of projects with a variety of
architectural styles - 21 in all - was included. One of our trustees
consulted Mr Amery for suggestions and he brought to our attention an
accomplished example of modern classicism which is, in fact, featured in the
exhibition.
Many respected historians and practising architects believe that the
classical tradition, so endlessly rich and flexible, could be as relevant
today as it ever has been. But it needs an intelligent and creative
re-thinking to meet the contemporary situation. It seems to us that too much
of the Paternoster scheme, at its last showing, is weakly derivative and
lacks the quality that a site of such national importance merits. Richard
Burdett,

FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Power prices probe needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW COOK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was glad to read your report 'Regulator to probe power prices' (July
28).
In common with all major industrial users I hope his probing is more
vigorous than previously and has a longer term effect.
It is quite clear that the generators are once again manipulating the
market. I can indeed confirm your report of the amount of the increase,
there having been a rise in pool prices from 1.998p to 2.364p since
February. This is a rise of 20 per cent, and only six months after the
generators last had their knuckles wrapped by the regulator for exactly the
same malpractice. One is bound to question the effectiveness of the
regulator's control over them.
For industry to be facing any increase in power costs in these deeply
recessionary times is outrageous. Until the whole question of electricity
supply is investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission I believe
the situation will continue to be very unsatisfactory.

Guess the profession of Ian Cartwright who, having been the sole partner in
his Godalming practice since 1986, is appointing two more tomorrow and so
trebling the number of partners.
He calculates that if he trebles them up again on Sunday, and goes on
expanding at that same rate every 24 hours thereafter, he'd have to stop on
August 21. The reason is that he would then have in partnership the entire
population of the globe.
Wouldn't that be an interesting world to live in, he asks. But some readers,
at least, may doubt it.
As all of his partners must belong to his own profession, the whole damn lot
of us would have to be actuaries.

For all his knowledge about original sin, Bishop Michael Marshall has been

On applying to Washington for an export licence for the instrument, he was
told that since it had ivory keys, he must specify where the sin of killing
the elephant they came from had been committed.
As he didn't know, the licence was refused. And when his secretary

</HEADLINE>

When it comes to bitter corporate rivalries, it is hard to beat Sotheby's
and Christie's battle for dominance of the world's art market.
For the last 30 years Sotheby's has made all the running. But now Christie's
is fighting back and claims to have 49 per cent of the global market - its
highest share since the 1950s. This has provoked Sotheby's to apoplexy and
the claim that Christie's has inflated its figures by the inclusion of
private sales.
Sotheby's reckons it is still number one and is confident of stretching its
lead next season by selling off the art treasures of Germany's Thurn und
Taxis family. The trouble with such backbiting is that reputations as well
as margins are suffering.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sniffing out the individual winners and losers in the great ICI break-up is
difficult.
Ronnie Hempel, the group's chief operating officer, is already over 60 and
by the time he takes the helm of what's left of ICI, he will be less than a
year away from the normal retirement age of 62. ICI chairman Sir Denys
Henderson gets to be chairman of both bits of his empire, but since he
collects his bus pass in October, he is also not going to be around for
ever.
David Barnes is an obvious winner in the short term. He will be chief
executive of ICI Bio, the most exciting part, and since he is only 56 he has
a few years to get the feel of the helm of an independent company. However,
apart from him, it is far from clear who is going to emerge in glory.
The problem with ICI is that most of its senior management is getting on a
bit. David Friend, chief executive of the pharmaceutical side, and his
counterpart at speciality chemicals Rodney Brown are both 57, which is also
the average age of the main board executive directors. One man to watch,
however, is 45-year-old Rob Margetts, who has restructured ICI's Tioxide
business. He joins the ICI board next month and has already picked up his
first outside non-executive directorship on Andrew Teare's board at English
China Clays.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Observer: Harmony brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While blood is thicker than water, it's said, ale could be thicker than
either. Or so it may prove, at least, in the case of Yorkshire brewing
family the Theakstons, of the picturesque village of Masham, near Ripon.
Blood-ties did not prevent them from being riven in twain 10 years ago by a
boardroom battle, leaving cousins Paul and Michael Theakston on opposite
sides of the divide.
What caused the split was a Wars of the Roses bid for the family company by
Lancashire brewer Matthew Brown, which eventually succeeded. Then in 1987
the company, with its Old Peculier brand, was acquired by Scottish &amp;
Newcastle.
Despite the continuing bad blood, both cousins joined the new owner. But
Paul soon quit, declaring himself 'unable to function' as an S&amp;N executive.
Next month, he expects to begin production at the Black Sheep Brewery he has
set up over the past two years in Masham, a stone's throw from the old
family plant, and so compete with S&amp;N where Michael Theakston is now a
director.
Far from widening the rift, however, the move seems to be bringing the
cousins together as friendly rivals with the shared aim of making the
village the real ale capital of north England.
'I admire what Paul is doing, and think there's room for both of us here,'
says Michael. 'This is a great opportunity for us to try and establish
Masham as the home of cask-conditioned ale.'
Paul agrees, explaining that despite being a competing company, his brewery
will produce a different beer. 'The last thing I wish to do is to clone
Theakstons,' he adds. 'I simply didn't want to leave Masham, and brewing is
in the family blood.'
Nice to think it's now running mild instead of bitter.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Rigour key to team briefing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Team briefing has little effect on commitment' (July 27)
on research sponsored by the Department of Employment - covering 25
companies - suggested that team briefing and related initiatives were having
little positive effect on employee commitment and understanding.
In a comprehensive study covering 87 major companies - to be published next
week - we establish that it is the way team briefing practices are shaped
and implemented that determines their success. As Tom Lehrer said when
comparing life with a sewer, 'what you get out of it depends on what you put
into it'.
It is clear from our research that there are certain key disciplines and
parameters to be applied in devising and managing these critical internal
communication systems, which it would appear a majority of companies are not
using sufficiently rigorously. The answer ultimately lies in the management,
not the mechanism.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Conclusions confirmed about performance-related pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CANNELL and Dr STEPHEN WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Correspondence on performance-related pay sparked by your reporting
(Management, July 20) of work on incentive payments which we carried out for
the National Economic Development Office and Institute of Personnel
Management confirms two of our key conclusions.
First, it is increasingly important to separate bonus payments relating to
the achievement of agreed objectives from bonuses (much less likely now)
which relate to the buoyancy of particular markets. To do otherwise risks
sending entirely the wrong signals to employees.
Second, many managers assert that PRP works, but few can prove that it does
because hardly any organisations have effective monitoring arrangements. The
best employers test to see that pay systems are having the desired effect.
What we are seeing now is a growing questioning of PRP, in many cases
because systems were installed without sufficient consideration. Those who
are having problems should find out why their system does not work before
they abandon it. The pay system may be wrong but it could just be the
management system in which it sits. Too many expectations should not be
placed on to payment schemes.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The German past
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERICH Honecker, alive and apparently well enough to stand trial, is back
in Berlin. Much German diplomacy has gone into getting him there, but it is
fair to assume the German government is less than overjoyed by its success.
Had Mr Honecker languished quietly in Moscow, he would have saved his
countrymen a good deal of embarrassment.
But are they his countrymen? That is part of the difficulty. Mr Honecker is
accused of crimes committed when he was a senior official, and latterly
head, of a separate East German state. He now finds himself, much against
his will but by decision of the majority of east Germans, a citizen of the
Federal Republic, under a government still composed almost entirely of west
Germans. That government is preparing to prosecute him for breaking the law
of the state which he at the time led, and which no longer exists.
It will not be easy either legally or politically. Few Germans, east or
west, can have forgotten the warm reception Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave Mr
Honecker when the latter visited Bonn in 1987, and any that have will no
doubt have their memory refreshed by television archive footage. Yet to
leave Mr Honecker scot-free, after young border guards have been tried and
sentenced for shooting would-be escapers to the west (which they did with
his approval and authority, if not on his direct orders), is clearly
impossible. Perhaps the border guards should not have been prosecuted, but
that too would have been hard to explain to the families of those shot. In
Germany of all countries, the fact that the guards were acting under orders
could not be held to exonerate them, even if those orders came from the
authorities of a then generally recognised state.
Mr Honecker's fate is thus bound up with a much larger problem of
'overcoming the past' (vergangenheitsbewaltigung), which Germany shares with
its post-communist neighbours, but which takes on a special character in
Germany for two reasons. First, this is, so to speak, the second past that
Germany has had to overcome. All discussion of purging or punishing the
former communists and their collaborators inevitably reawakens the traumas
of de-Nazification.
Secondly, Germany differs from its eastern neighbours in that only part of
it lived under communism. The anti-communist revolution in East Germany was
rapidly overtaken and swallowed up by the process of reunification; and the
issue of past versus present is inevitably intertwined with that of east
versus west.
Where Nazi crimes against humanity are concerned, even the UK has found it
necessary to waive the statute of limitations in order to prosecute alleged
criminals now found to be residing on its territory. Happily the communist
regime in East Germany, inhuman as it was in many ways, did not engage in
genocidal activities. That being so, there is a strong case for disposing of
its legacy as quickly as possible. The priority, in Germany's own interest
and that of its European partners, must be to bind and heal the wound. No
doubt it is necessary that it first be cauterised, by a clear judicial
process to establish where responsibility lies - a process which must be
kept as far as possible separate from today's politics. Once that has been
done, the emphasis should shift to national reconciliation, in which
clemency will have its part to play.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Parts are greater than the whole: How ICI hopes to unlock
resources through a radical restructuring of its businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI's proposal to split itself into two will come as a seismic shock to the
world chemical industry. It is normal for chemical companies to shuffle
their assets around. For one of the world-scale players to carve itself up
in this way is without precedent.
But ICI is in the mood for radical solutions. Its immunity from takeover was
called into question last year by the appearance on its share register of
the predatory Lord Hanson. It has expensive if unspecified plans for taking
part in the restructuring of the chemicals and drug industries in the 1990s.
The plan announced yesterday addresses both these issues. It also brings to
its logical conclusion an argument which has bedevilled ICI for more than a
decade: how far the company should depend on traditional bulk chemicals such
as chlorine and plastics, and how far on more sophisticated products such as
drugs and pesticides. ICI's answer is nothing if not basic: let the two
sides seek their fortunes as independent companies.
The problem with bulk chemicals is that their profits swing wildly with the
economic cycle. In the peak year of 1988, ICI's bulk businesses made trading
profits of more than Pounds 1bn. Last year they made a third of that. This
year they will make less again.
Drugs and agrochemicals, by contrast, are classically immune from the cycle.
They are also highly cash-generative, which is useful when the bulk business
is in recession or is going through one of its characteristic phases of
heavy investment. In that sense, there is a good deal to be said for keeping
the two sides together. Why split them?
The succinct answer is given by Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating office of
ICI and future managing director of the bulk side. 'There's been a debate on
the board for as long as I've been on it over the right structure for the
group. But the really serious debate came at the end of 1990, when we came
to realise that against our expectations for economic growth in the 1990s,
we wouldn't have the resources to do everything we wanted, or the focus.'
The point about resources is crucial. After the group is split, the plan is
that ICI Bio - the drugs and pharmaceuticals side - should raise cash
through a rights issue. This is not necessarily because ICI Bio will need
the money: on the contrary, it may be needed more on the bulk side. But it
seems a fair guess that when ICI is split up, most of its cash will be
shunted into the bulk business. ICI Bio can then replace that cash from the
stock market more cheaply than ICI could itself, since as a drug company it
will enjoy a higher rating.
The need for cash is explained by Mr Hampel. 'As ICI is today, with its
strong balance sheet, it doesn't need new equity to stay alive. But as and
when the economy turns up, that would probably change. And if the two
companies are actively looking for opportunities, they will want it all the
more. On the other hand, if we were to go into a business depression, we
simply wouldn't want to invest.'
As to the opportunities in question, ICI is understandably coy. But in
general terms, says Mr Hampel, 'one of the features of today's world is that
large parts of the chemicals industry are prepared to consider restructuring
in radical terms. In titanium dioxide (a white pigment used in paints), for
instance, there are obviously some non-profitable businesses around, which
could get together. Our new structure might help there.
'Or again, people have frequently said to us that our pharmaceuticals
business is non-viable. We tell them that's rubbish, and we mean it. But
there will clearly be more opportunities now to get together.'
The capital structures of the two new businesses is a delicate matter. Mr
Colin Short, ICI's finance director, says 'the first step is a massive
internal restructuring of four or five hundred companies around the world,
each of which will need sorting out. Having got to that point, we'll make an
assessment of the capital structure of the businesses.'
ICI is naturally keen to avoid the suggestion that the bulk business is
being abandoned. 'If you go back to the mid-1980s,' Mr Hampel says, 'the
heavy end was throwing off cash. Even as late as 1989, it far exceeded the
rest of the business in cash flow terms. Obviously, ICI continues to have
within it cyclical businesses where cash goes up and down with the cycle.
But we're already addressing that with our restructuring programme.'
Nevertheless, it is plain that the bulk business - ICI's old heartland in
industrial chemistry - will be the poor relation. Last year, it made 31 per
cent of the group's trading profit on 70 per cent of its turnover. That was
largely the effect of the economic cycle. But precisely because the business
is so cyclical, it will command a lower price in the stock market.
It will take the market a little while to work out its sums on this. Early
indications, though, are that the bulk business could be worth about 30 per
cent of the total. On the basis of ICI's market value yesterday of Pounds
8.4bn - up 7 per cent on the announcement - that would put a rough value of
Pounds 2.5bn on the bulk business against almost Pounds 6bn for ICI Bio.
These are still formidable numbers. Mr Hampel says 'the bulk business will
drop from number five in the world chemicals industry to number seven. The
pharmaceuticals company will be number nine in the world. We're not talking
about orphans here.'
But there is another side to all this. Even if the threat from Lord Hanson
proved little more than bluff, the fact remains that the proposal to split
the business was first proposed only a few months after his appearance on
the scene. When ICI talks of the bleak outlook for the 1990s and the
opportunities this will create for restructuring, it must be conscious of
the risk that it could create an opportunity for restructuring by someone
else.
From a cynical viewpoint, splitting the business can be seen as tackling
this risk head-on. The attractive, high added-value part of the business is
put out of reach by giving it a higher stock market rating. The commodity
business is made still more unattractive by being exposed on its own.
Like BAT - under fire from Sir James Goldsmith - ICI has shown a surprising
turn of speed for a supposedly staid and bureaucratic management. Like BAT,
too, ICI has demonstrated that corporate gadflies can have their uses. It
will doubtless be sending a large cheque to Warburg, its financial advisers,
for coming up with the demerger plan. Perhaps it should send a small
donation to Lord Hanson as well.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Leading Article: While Bosnia is burning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS long been a painful mismatch between events in the former
Yugoslavia and the international response. But at no point has the gulf
between the conflict on the ground and the externally sponsored negotiations
to stop it seemed more shocking or embarrassing than now.
While the Serbs continue their campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the European Community peace conference in London sets
up a co-ordinating committee on constitutional change. While tens of
thousands of Moslems flee to neighbouring countries, the British government
proposes a new international conference on Yugoslavia - at the end of next
month.
That the west feels helpless in the face of the Yugoslav horrors should not
really be surprising. Months of arduous mediation efforts by Lord Carrington
on behalf of the EC have failed to bring the Bosnian factions any closer
together, as this week's desultory and futile negotiations in London have
made clear. There can be no assurance that a wider international conference
will have any greater success unless the combatants themselves want to stop
fighting.
But to admit the difficulties is not to excuse the impossibly confused and
half-hearted approach which western governments have displayed in recent
weeks. The EC has discredited its peace effort by failing to back it with
adequate resources, and through its clumsy attempt to hand over
implementation of a half-baked ceasefire agreement to the United Nations.
The UN's paymasters have hobbled its peacekeeping and humanitarian mission
by stinting on the number of troops they are prepared to sanction, either to
keep relief supplies moving from Sarajevo airport to other parts of Bosnia
or to demilitarise and police UN-protected areas of Croatia. Partly as a
result of such failures on the part of their member governments, the two
organisations have found themselves at loggerheads when they should be
working together constructively.
The newly proposed international conference offers an opportunity to begin
sorting out the mess. With representatives of the EC and UN at the same
table, they should be able to avoid the crossed wires of the past few weeks
and to devise a common strategy to deal with the growing refugee problem as
well as with actual and potential conflicts on the ground. And with the US
government and other interested parties involved, a wider conference should
carry greater weight than one sponsored by the EC alone.
To fulfil these requirements, however, and to win credibility, such a
conference will have to be carefully prepared. It will have to be given a
structure durable enough to lay the foundations of peace - or capable of
defining what action to take, including possible military action, in the
event of continuing war. That means it should have permanent and purposeful
leadership - Lord Carrington and Mr Cyrus Vance for co-chairmen, perhaps,
rather than the temporary occupants of the EC presidency - and be given the
resources and manpower to do the job.
Above all, though, if such a conference is worth convening at all, it is
worth convening rapidly. If it really has to be delayed until the end of
August, the intervening period must be used intensively to ensure that all
parties arrive prepared to take, and support, the necessary hard decisions.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Ethics and worse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN BUSINESS schools have long been preoccupied with business ethics.
Not so their counterparts in Britain. Despite the all-pervasive scandals of
the 1980s, there is a tendency in Europe to regard the study of business
ethics as faddish. Dixons, which is giving Pounds 1m to the London Business
School for a chair in business ethics, clearly thinks otherwise, and with
good reason.
Those who appeal to Adam Smith's description of naked self-interest as the
driving force behind wealth creation forget that Smith was also a moral
philosopher. It would never have occurred to him that the hidden hand of
market forces could operate outside a moral context. Nor would he have been
surprised at the way companies as diverse as Levi Strauss and The Body Shop
have turned social and moral concerns to competitive advantage.
Yet it is equally possible for firms to win competitive advantage through
corrupt practices, such as bribery. Failure to do so may even lead to loss
of competitive advantage. In other cases the moral landscape may be
transformed by scientific advances or changed public perceptions, leaving
managers in an invidious position. Short of closing down an industry that
employs millions across the world, how should the captains of the tobacco
industry respond to changed perceptions about the threat to health?
There seems little doubt that bad ethics can give business a bad name.
Retail investors have deserted the Japanese stock market because they feel,
not without justice, that they wandered inadvertently into a den of thieves.
Low standards of entrepreneurial behaviour in Australia in the 1980s did
unquantifiable damage to that country's standing in international markets.
The case for studying business ethics is that they are difficult and that
they matter. Since when have ethics been faddish?

FT  31 JUL 92 / Mr Portillo's chance to write the script
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the five junior ministers promoted to the cabinet on April 10, the one
who has made the most dramatic start is Mr Michael Portillo. We will come to
why in a moment, but first consider the also-rans.
The new employment secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, got her name in the
papers when she secured a compromise deal on the European Community's plans
to impose a maximum 48-hour working week. 'In a word, we've won,' she
proclaimed, exhibiting a trace of the tendency to exaggerate so
characteristic of her predecessor, Mr Michael Howard. She is becoming known
to a small but widening circle of British and European officials for her
fluent French and pleasant disposition. Yet she has not sought to advertise
herself.
This befits the current status of her department. In the 1980s it was the
scourge of the organised working class. Mrs Shephard will press ahead with
just one more union-bashing bill, as promised in the Conservative election
manifesto - but that apart, she says, the government's war against the trade
unions is over. Now the employment department is becoming the fiscally
hamstrung manager of Britain's training services - the head office that has
to keep the training and enterprise councils happy while the Treasury keeps
them poor.
Nothing dramatic there. Consider next the new Northern Ireland secretary,
Sir Patrick Mayhew. He is not expected to succeed in his job. No Northern
Ireland secretary ever is. Yet Sir Patrick seems to have made a breakthrough
by persuading unionists, nationalists and the Irish government to sit in the
same room with the British for talks on the future of the province. If he
eventually produces a solution, such as an agreement that enables Northern
Ireland to become self-governing, he would have pulled off a coup that all
his predecessors since Stormont was dissolved in 1972 could hardly dream of.
Then, in a fairy tale world, his reward might be promotion to home
secretary. If, indeed.
Yet Sir Patrick does not seek the limelight. In his position that would be
wrong. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, on the other hand, cannot help being a focus
of public attention. Anyone in charge of the health service must be. She has
the job because she has a sympathetic face, one that might convince a
doubting public that the Tories really believe in the NHS, even while London
hospitals with surplus beds are closed. Her recent white paper on healthy
living, which set targets for the reduction of named killer diseases, was
one means to this end. Mrs Bottomley is an over-conscientious minister who
has yet to learn that there is a level of detail below which the head of a
great department need not stoop. She has no great schemes to offer. She
seems content to occupy herself with consolidation. She will do well if she
makes the NHS reforms work and puts in place the new scheme for community
care. It is a fitting task for a quintessential public servant.
Mr John Patten is ambition made flesh. He spent a decade aching for a
cabinet post while others of his generation seemed to pass him by. Now that
he has arrived the new secretary for education has taken to setting off
firecrackers. One, of which I heartily approve, was the opening essay in
this week's white paper, which the minister himself wrote. It sets out the
principles of a rigorous approach to teaching in schools, with the emphasis
on demanding that teachers must have high expectations. Terrific.
The second Patten firecracker aims to end local authority control over
schools. A new funding agency, answerable to the secretary of state, will do
the job instead. Mr Patten will be lucky if he gets moved from education
before this dangerous new device blows up. Bits will constantly be added.
One day it will explode, damaging the careers of those associated with it.
Of the above four, Mr Patten is the only one with brains enough to match Mr
Portillo. Yet the latter is displaying that it is not a matter of being
clever, it is more that you have to be clever in a particular way. As chief
secretary to the Treasury, Mr Portillo is well-placed to influence the
strategic thrust of government spending, both next year and in the medium
term. His predecessors have had to harry and cajole spending ministers into
compromises. Mr Portillo's job is quite different. He will write the script
for the chancellor to approve.
It happened this way. After the election our new chief secretary opened the
envelopes containing the initial bids from ministers and found claims
totalling Pounds 14bn above the previously planned total spending of Pounds
244.5bn for 1993-94. He calculated that the average success rate of chief
secretaries in clawing back similar demands was 30 to 40 per cent, which
means that the overshoot next year would have been Pounds 8bn to Pounds 9bn.
This would be too much even in a good year. In a year in which the
Treasury's panic about the growth in government borrowing is tangible, it
could not be allowed. There are various accounts of who first thought of
last week's plan, which was to say at the beginning that Pounds 244.5bn
would be the limit of spending, but Mr Portillo is the one whose job is
changed.
It is he who will consult the spending ministers and report back to the
chancellor's new expenditure committee. This puts the chief secretary in a
pivotal position. He has the political sense to understand that he must be
seen as the servant of the new system, not the master of departments, or,
heaven forbid, as one who aspires to control the political balance of the
governments' policies. So next week polite letters will go out asking each
spending minister to say how plans (a) to, shall we say, (d) would affect
their departments. Plan (a) would inflict equal cuts on everyone; subsequent
options would vary as between departments. The chief secretary already knows
what must be spent and what is at the margin.
Treasury officials expect what they call the 'McEnroe response' - that is,
'you can't be serious'. Mr Portillo will then talk with each minister, after
which he will prepare menus of options for the chancellor's committee,
always faithfully recording the departmental position on each proposed
reduction or increase. His own views will be in there, but they will not be
identifiable. There will be room for appeal and the committee might change
the mix of any Portillo menu. Yet the one that the chancellor sends to the
full cabinet for ratification will be based on the chief secretary's initial
work.
This new public spending mechanism is more rational, and more collective,
than the old. It recognises that increases in one line must be matched by
decreases in another. Make no mistake. The primary means by which the
proposed new reasonable expression of the government's political will is to
be realised is the writing hand of Mr Michael Portillo. Then the chancellor
may exercise his greater power. But that is another story.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Sylvie Guillem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYLVIE Guillem, the Parisian ballerina who has been a permanent guest artist
at Covent Garden for three years now, is surely the most famous and
controversial female ballet dancer today. The main reason for her fame is
that her legs go up high, but it also helps that her feet are strikingly
arched, that her hair is a singular shade of henna, and that her facial
personality is both gamine and mignonne.
Several of those who object to her complain that she has technique but no
feeling. The reverse is nearer the truth. As an actress, Guillem is adult,
assured, involved and serious. True, she is never moving - but that is
because her physical training will not let her be. On Wednesday she returned
to the role of Nikiya, the temple dancer who is the heroine of La Bayadere.
She is always eyecatching. She addresses each character with perfect
attention, and she demonstrates Nikiya's emotions - love, jealousy, rage,
scorn, grief - with intelligence.
But her feeling never grips us, because her Parisian training has
painstakingly removed any true centre from her style. It was curious on
Wednesday to watch her beside Deborah Bull, who played her rival, Gamzati.
Bull, a rather two-dimensional actress, sneers and hams her way through
Gamzati. She likes to underline her points by flashing her eyes, grinning,
lifting her chin haughtily; and also lets her mouth drop open. Her dancing
is exact but heavy; she is best in roles that have no kind of lightness.
Nonetheless, Bull has a certain force. Her gestures are supported from the
torso. Guillem, by contrast, is so sophisticated that she makes everyone
else onstage look provincial. But she has no force, and no tone. Whether
miming or dancing, her movement is, in the wrong sense of the word,
weightless. This is also why, as Natalia Petrovna in A Month in the Country,
she cannot convey passion; and this is why as Cinderella she had no
vulnerability.
She was strongly partnered on Wednesday by Zoltan Solymosi, the Hungarian
dancer who is completing his first season with the Royal. Now here is
someone who really is not much of an actor. When he has to sit loyally by
his fiancee Gamzati while his true love, Nikiya, is dancing ardently before
them, he seemed merely to have switched his mind off. Still, he is a real
dancer, with tone, weight, force in plentiful supply; and (unlike so many
rising Royal men) he never turns the force into strain. His dancing is big,
handsome, obvious and easy to enjoy.
In the 1960s the Royal learnt much from having Rudolf Nureyev as a permanent
guest artist. Do the powers that be at Covent Garden think that today's
Royal can profit similarly from Sylvie Guillem? I hope not. The more closely
you analyse her style, the less truly classical it is. And, after three
years, nobody seems to have learnt anything from her - not even her many
incidental virtues (authority, definition, chic). She keeps to herself, they
keep to themselves, everybody consents to put on a show when the curtain
rises, but nobody learns from the experience. Strange.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Lady Be Good - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Open Air Theatre at London's Regent's Park, as I have written before, is
one of the great pleasures of the English summer. Lady Be Good carries
pleasure to perfection. Ian Talbot's production scores in every department:
acting, singing, dancing, costumes and staging. It is also very amusing.
Lady is not quite such a good musical as Guys and Dolls. It is a little too
flapperish and one-dimensional for that, but with its featherweight touch it
plays in the same division. Like the best of P G Wodehouse, it captures a
world of innocence. Some of the characters indeed could almost come out of
Wodehouse, such as Gavin Muir's Bertie Bassett, the obviously very well
brought-up and thoroughly amiable young man with a tendency to take to the
bottle and see pink spots.
The girls belong to the world of Wooster as well: bright young things and
occasionally predatory, like Jane Maud's wonderfully dressed Josephine
Vanderwater. Ms Maud wears one of the best pair of shoes, usually concealed
by her skirt, I have seen: black down one side, purple down the other. Such
splendid details abound. There is an embrace between lovers where the
lipstick comes off not smudged all over the man's mouth and cheeks, but
precisely on his lips as if it had been the perfect kiss.
The dialogue is very funny. Even the corniest of jokes come off because the
period has been so well caught. 'I'm shaking like a fender on a Ford,' says
Bernard Cribbins as Watty Watkins, the slightly shady lawyer. And again: 'He
was trying to start the cuckoo clock with birdseed.' Cribbins gets away with
a pun on the Spanish noces and the notches on the Mexican's gun. Simon Green
as Dick Trevor, the impoverished lover, manages to say the line 'I'm so gosh
darn blue' with real feeling.
Cribbins is involved in a couple of scenes of purest comedy: one where he
attempts to describe a bull fight he has never seen, another where he
persuades Bertie Bassett to have a non-existent drink from a non-existent
bottle, a non-existent glass and a sometimes existent waiter.
If one dwells on the comic side, it is because it is such a marvellous and
sustained complement to the music, which after all is by George and Ira
Gershwin in their youth. The title song in Lady remains as irresistible as
ever - almost impossible to get out of your head. There is also 'Just
Another Rhumba' with that clever way of rhyming by pronouncing the 'b' in
dumber, and which was not part of the original show. Add 'Fascinating
Rhythm' which, according to a programme note by Benny Green, was heard by
Gershwin pere as 'Fashion on the River'. You will not make that mistake in
Regent's Park.
Not least, there is 'I'd Rather Charleston': ('I'm not disappointed, I'm
just double-jointed.') The singing and dancing are captivating throughout.
They rely on the old but effective technique of starting with a twosome,
then bringing in the ensemble.
If there has to be a top prize, it must go to Joanna Riding, who sings,
acts, dances and looks good non-stop. But do not forget the others,
including Alister Cameron as an immensely tall Jeevesian flunkey, and the
designs by Paul Farnsworth. You really ought to see Lady Be Good: you know
that you should.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Strange Fish - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE six years of its existence DV8 has produced vivid and
thought-provoking work that has explored the idea of 'physical theatre'.
DV8's creations have charted areas of social and sexual politics - from the
bleak homosexual despair of Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men to the pursuit of
dreams and desires in if only. In everything, there has been the matching of
technical daring with emotional bravado: if it is not perched on the edge of
the perilous, DV8 seems to say, then it is not worth doing. And if it does
not challenge its theme - and its audience's preconceptions - then it is not
worthy of DV8's idealism.
There has resulted a body of work that stands at the forefront of British
dance and, surely, of British theatre, by reason of the dazzling use of the
ensemble's gifts - the pieces are usually a collective creation - and by the
zeal of Lloyd Newson, DV8's director, to push further and further into that
most dangerous territory, the human psyche.
Now DV8 has brought its latest creation, Strange Fish, to Riverside Studios.
The title is owed to the Buddhist saying that we should be as ignorant of
what we are going to catch as a fisherman of what is at the end of his line.
The argument concerns the nature of our quest for someone to love (though
DV8 does not believe in tame gazelles or gentle doves) and something or
someone to believe in. The staging is - and in this lies an acute
fascination - exactly of our time in gauging the forms through which this
quest may be understood, and the terms in which disillusion will manifest
itself.
We see a boarded stage in front of a wooden facade (excellent design by
Peter J Davison) which has windows, doors, a ladder, and small apertures
which will enable the cast to find hand and foot holds for the more
acrobatic moments of the action. As the action begins, drifting mist reveals
a cross from which hangs the Christ-figure of the singer Melanie Pappenheim.
Through the gloom a crowd of naked bodies climb across the stage and into
the facade of the building. The tiny, elf-like figure of Diana Payne-Myers,
a fascinating performer despite her sixty-something years, lights candles at
the foot of the cross. Wendy Houston, that thrillingly intense dancer,
whirls and falls, holding a wine-glass which she constantly fails to seize
with her other hand. A door opens to reveal Diana Payne-Myers worshipping a
crucifix in front of a gushing wash-basin. The stage brightens to bring on
other members of the cast - Jordi Cortes Molina, Nigel Charnock, Dale
Tanner, Lauren Potter, Kate Champion - who mime, mingle, exchange physical
babble, flirt, pick up and drop each other (in every sense) as a tango rings
out.
I have detailed this opening section since it contains images which will
recur throughout the 90 minutes of the piece. They are in no way shocking -
though Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells may not be too happy - but they are
provocative in the very best terms of DV8's creative imagination. The
performance process is to confront each member of the cast - and each of us
 -with the failure of belief, of love, with the corruption and extinction of
hope and desire. Strange Fish is pessimistic - in an interview Lloyd Newson
quoted Francis Bacon's comment that he 'believed in nothing but was
eternally optimistic' - yet it takes a compassionate view of its crises and
of the human condition.
It is riven with moments of wild humour, and galvanised both by stunning
theatrical coups and stunning performance from its cast.
Speech is minimally used, notably by Nigel Charnock as the gabbling unwanted
guest, desperately trying to be loved - 'People are my hobby. I'm a people
person' - and insinuating himself between pairs of lovers. A duet for Lauren
Potter and Jordi Cortes Molina is a transcendental study in movement curving
and oiling itself through bodies. Houston sticks two feathers on Charnock's
shoulders, leads him to a window, and urges him to fly - and
heart-stoppingly he plunges down. (Freudians will recognise the sexual
connotation). Intercourse between Houston and Tanner degenerates into
frantic masturbation by the man as a torrent of stones suddenly pours on to
the stage, and Houston starts to flail and writhe among them. The images
resonate throughout the action, and we make connections, and know the
despair that lies at the heart of the work.
The closing section is fiercely daring. Charnock has roped himself to the
Cross. Rejected by the other members of the cast, Houston has torn up part
of the stage floor, to reveal subterranean waters. She teases Charnock. He
flees from her through trapdoors, but she at last releases him from the
cross, and they plunge into the water. Melanie Pappenheim appears,
supporting Dale Tanner as if holding a Christ from a Deposition. Houston
emerges from the water, and wanders over the empty stage. She takes a glass
of wine, climbs up the cross where Pappenheim again hangs, pours wine on
her, kisses her, and after a desperate search for Charnock, balances herself
upon the last wine-glasses. The light dies, and we can take no comfort from
what we have seen.
In the matter of performance, the evening is unflawed. The playing of the
ensemble - the brilliant conflict and complementing of personalities; the
shared sense of risk and trust; the acuteness of timing and physical
response - is matched by an emotional awareness that is dazzlingly
communicative. One may argue with the work's premises - its denial of faith,
of the enduring power of human relationships - but there can be no argument
about the astonishing force of its realisation and performance. To Lloyd
Newson and his cast, admiration and gratitude. The fine score and soundtrack
are, respectively, by Jocelyn Pook and Adrian Jackson. Admirable lighting is
by Steve Whitson. Not to be missed.
Strange Fish continues at Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, until August 8.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Wrestling with hidden wit and skill
 -Nicholas Woodsworth finds evidence to dispel some common myths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEKSANDR KARELIN is a sensitive man. He does not look sensitive. He looks
just like you might imagine a Russian heavy-weight Greco-Roman wrestler
would.
He is 6ft 5in tall, weighs 286lb, and has extremely long arms, a massive
jaw, a lowering forehead and a close-cropped, bullet-shaped skull. But I
know he is sensitive because he told me so, and he is not a man I would
argue with.
Karelin likes walking in Russian forests. He adores classical music. He not
only reads poetry, he writes it. He has had offers to go to Hollywood. He
makes the fact that he has not lost a wrestling match in more than 90
competitions since 1987 seem almost incidental.
But there was nothing incidental about his Olympic gold medal victory on
Wednesday evening over Sweden's Tomas Johansson. Only 1 minute 33 seconds
into the five-minute bout, and leading 2-0, Karelin brought the match to an
end with a conclusive four-point fall.
Greco-Roman wrestling, it seems, is a sport that attracts sensitive men. In
the last few days I have watched great exhibitions of emotion on the
wrestling mat, displays more highly charged than one might expect from men
who spend their days grappling with each other in sweaty gymnasiums.
Teary sentiment from the winners is surprising enough, but it is the losers
I find most touching. I have watched Cubans with years of ideological
training to stiffen them collapse on the mat in despair. I have seen South
Koreans as hard as nails led away howling their anguish. This is a sport
that can make even the toughest men cry.
Wrestlers may not look sensitive and intelligent, but their sport is a sport
of wits. Wrestling is not an event that draws great crowds or massive TV
coverage because - unlike ball games or athletics - the wit and skills
involved are hidden. It is also a sport of hideously complex rules and
prohibitions.
Brute strength is not the essence of the game. What counts is technical
ability, timing, agility, fast reflexes and endurance. After the first three
minutes of a five-minute bout, reserves of pure muscle power dry up and
technique becomes all.
Adepts of the game say amateur wrestling - which has nothing of the fakery
and crude spectacle of professional wrestling - is something like a game of
chess. The aim is to analyse your opponent's style and then adapt your style
so as to exploit his weaknesses. To win, a game plan is essential and there
is very little time to develop it. Naturally, these mental processes are
invisible to spectators. What we see is clutching, straining, groping,
grimacing and a great deal of sweat.
Wrestling holds the distinction of being the oldest sport in the world. But
in spite of its name, Greco-Roman wrestling - it differs from Olympic
freestyle wrestling in that no holds are allowed below the waist - bears
little resemblance to wrestling as practised in the Games of ancient Greece.
Then the wrestlers fought oiled, sand-powdered and naked. A match could last
days, and was accompanied by music to keep spectator interest up. It was
also, according to authorities on ancient sports, an event of homo-erotic
associations for the participants and voyeuristic pleasure for the
spectators.
On Wednesday night the pleasure belonged to the supporters of the former
Soviet Union's Unified Team. Not only did Karelin win the 130kg event, the
heaviest of weight categories, but co-team member Oleg Koutcherenko, a
Ukrainian, won gold in the 48kg event, the lightest. To even things up in
the middle, Mnatsakan Iskandarian, an Armenian, took gold in the 74kg event.
In Barcelona, former Soviet wrestlers have kept their traditional hold on
the game. But it might not stay that way for long. Throughout the former
eastern empire the withdrawal of state funding will seriously affect the
future of most sports. Aleksandr Karelin says that now the Soviet-style
school of wrestling has broken up, the synthesis of regional wrestling
styles that made the Soviet Union great is no longer possible.
The US, where college wrestling is popular, will be strong contenders in the
future. So will Bulgaria, Japan, Korea and Poland.
There is no blubbing in the Unified Team's wrestlers' changing rooms these
days, but there may well be tears before bedtime four years hence at the
Olympics in Atlanta.

By Friday each week a sizeable chunk of the employed population feels
tempted to tell the boss to take a running jump - self-employment seems like

A handful of individuals, however, will join those forced out of their jobs
by the recession and set up in business on their own.
The success or failure of those businesses - only 40 per cent of start-ups
are still around after five years - will depend in part on the temperaments
of their proprietors.
According to Annabel Broome, a psychologist who has been carrying out
research for BT, the budding entrepreneur needs to scrutinise his or her
motivation very closely.
'You have to take a good look at yourself and ask yourself what you really
want. If you can get these questions right you lessen the likelihood of
failure and disillusionment,' she says.
Broome's research has led her to identify four main business types:
The solo flyer: This type does not like having a boss or anyone else's hand
on the tiller - sets a business course and steers it in a determined way.
Resisting outside influences requires minimising risks. Interest in a
particular subject may have sparked the decision to go it alone. Goal may be
a quiet sense of achievement rather than glorious success.
The family-oriented type: May have a long family tradition behind his or her
enterprise, or may come from an ethnic group which places great importance
on family cohesion. Family may be the most important resource, providing
finance, labour and advice. Motivation will come from wanting to improve
family wealth and perhaps carve a niche in the local community.
The stalker is always calculating a few moves ahead, like a chess player.
When the time is right the stalker might risk a pawn or two. Stalkers are
thinkers and planners. Motivated by the thought of success, there is nothing
flamboyant about their approach. Quiet confidence is born of
professionalism.
Tycoons want to get rich and be famous. They are bursting with energy,
confidence and ideas. If risks they take do not produce cash they will
generate publicity. Tycoons love working with others so long as they realise
who is boss. They are hard drivers and do not mind treading on a few toes.
Why, one may wonder, is BT so interested in employing the services of a
psychologist to help them establish the characteristics of these business
types? The answer, of course, is so they can target sales of their telecom
gadgets.
It will come as no surprise to find, for example, that the Solo Flyer would
be well advised, according to BT, to purchase answering machines, pagers,
mobile telephones, call diversion, faxes 'and other devices which give you
maximum independence but keep you in touch'.
The Tycoon, on the other hand, could quite legitimately splash out on the
latest technology such as a video-phone or colour fax because 'creating an
impression will be the key to your business aims'.
And the timing of the publication of its research is particularly
appropriate. BT announced on Wednesday a sharp increase in its voluntary
redundancy programme this year - today is the Friday 19,000 of BT's own
staff walk out of the door never to return to their old jobs.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Management: A made-to-measure disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortunately, crises seldom happen. That means a company which has a disaster
plan will generally have no way of knowing how well it works.
Now, however, thanks to software wizardry, it is possible for management to
prepare for a real corporate crisis or public disaster by using a disaster
simulator that can be plugged into an ordinary Pounds 1,000 desktop
computer.
The software, called CriSys, designed and developed by St Albans-based
Psychometric Research &amp; Development (PRD), generates a different customised
imaginary disaster each time it is run - complete with still video pictures,
'live' news broadcasts, hostile press questions and telephone reports from
local company representatives.
For example, in one simulation for the chemical industry a train loaded with
vinyl chloride catches fire and then explodes in a railway tunnel killing
and injuring a number of passengers and leading to the evacuation of 13,000
residents.
The task for any corporate crisis management team is to handle the
aftermath, rather than the disaster itself (which is usually man-aged by the
emergency services), including, for example, deciding when to issue
statements or to hold a press conference.
Frequently, managements fail to recognise a developing crisis, and are slow
to react. Significantly, most studies also show that it is the management of
the aftermath, rather than the disaster itself, that determines the shape in
which a company emerges from a crisis. For example, it is essential to
ensure that, in spite of a disaster, the supply of products to customers is
maintained.
CriSys was initially developed for, and in conjunction with, European Vinyls
Corporation, Europe's largest bulk vinyls producer, where it has been
successfully used to train senior personnel in corporate crisis management.
The system is meant to provide 'hands-on' crisis management experience.
One lesson to emerge from EVC's training sessions was that more secretarial
services were needed. They had also forgotten to arrange sandwiches at
meal-times.
Another painful lesson learned by one of EVC's crisis management teams was
not to call a press conference until the company is able to answer questions
adequately.
What makes CriSys different from paper-based crisis management exercises is
that because every disaster is different, it is re-usable, and the special
effects incorporated into the software, such as simulated TV news coverage
and telexes, make it 'real.'
One EVC team even got angry about 'editorial inaccuracies' in the reports of
an incident, said John Davies, acquisitions and corporate project manager
for EVC.
The software will accept input from the crisis management team, for example
a press release, and incorporate the contents in subsequent news coverage.
Its developers plan to extend the software to other industries. Potential
users include those involved in the production or transportation of
hazardous goods, transport organisations, utilities such as electricity and
gas supply companies, event organisers and the emergency services.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Management: Prepared for the worst - Planning for a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens when a briefcase containing company secrets goes missing, a
blackmailer laces the company's top-selling food product with poison, or
toxic factory waste escapes threatening an environmental disaster?
For most companies a crisis like this will never happen. But when disaster
strikes, the consequences can be so dire, that managers are starting to lay
contingency plans, just in case.
Crisis Planning has only recently emerged as a management issue, in response
to the headline-grabbing disasters in the past decade. Among those judged to
have been well handled were the lacing of Johnson and Johnson's Tylenol
capsules with cyanide in the US, and the British Midland air disaster at
Kegworth in Leicestershire.
In contrast, the Bhopal toxic gas disaster involving a Union Carbide plant
in India, and the King's Cross underground fire are often cited as examples
of poor crisis planning and management.
Few businesses are immune from crisis, but research suggests even fewer have
a strategy for dealing with disasters. A recent survey conducted by
Alexander Stenhouse, the insurance brokers and risk management experts,
found that only one in four UK companies had a strategy for dealing with a
product-tampering crisis and only one in three had developed a plan for
minimising the risk resulting from an environmental crisis.
There is an understandable reluctance to confront an issue which may never
happen. However, there is evidence that the worst time to learn how to
manage a crisis is during a crisis itself.
For this reason a number of consultants have begun to sell crisis management
services. One such, dubbed Total Crisis Management (TCM), is offered by a
group of four firms comprising Alexander Stenhouse, the London law firm,
Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warren, Ogilvy Adams &amp; Rinehart, the public relations
consultants, and Touche Ross, the management consultants.
The four firms promise a full crisis planning and management service, which
begins with an internal risk review and includes a 24-hour crisis telephone
hot line.
The TCM group says a simple problem can become a crisis if the company is
unprepared.
Although the TCM partners acknowledge a crisis cannot always be avoided,
they insist the best way to survive is to plan ahead. But they also caution
against rigid responses. 'Simply having a crisis manual may be worse than
useless,' the experts say. 'No-one will have read it. The crisis you are
handling won't be in it and you won't have time to wade through it when
instant decisions are needed.'
So how can you prepare for a crisis? The first step is to bring together the
expertise - internally or from outside - to define possible crises and to
explore the risks. Then planning, communications and training packages can
be put in place as 'insurance' for the future. There are three main stages:
Crisis preparation: Undertake an audit of the relevant risks, including
environmental dangers, legal and security threats, and political or other
external pressures. Then review risk control policies and prepare a crisis
manual as a basis for training and simulation exercises. It should describe
the authority, the aim and the staffing of a crisis management team. It
should contain relevant telephone numbers of experts, and make clear who is
supposed to be doing what.
Crisis handling: The team must be assembled, and the situation assessed
coolly and professionally. Communication is the most important item.
Companies must be ready to give and to receive information from a wide
variety of sources.
A recent study by Alexander &amp; Associates, management consultants, shows that
most companies communicate poorly with their regulatory bodies, concentrate
on the shareholder at the expense of the customer, and have feeble systems
for internal communication. Companies should ensure all the media's
questions are answered and should liaise with investigatory bodies to
protect and minimise exposure to criminal or civil liabilities.
Crisis after-care: When the dust settles, do not relax and lose the
initiative. There will be many lessons to learn and opportunities to take
after a crisis. The review should begin as soon as the crisis is over. Staff
should be reassured that the point of the review is not to find culprits,
but to improve the working of the plan.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Total returns in the commercial property sector fell in June, following
several months of apparent stabilisation, according to the Investment
Property Databank, a research group.
Yields continued outwards, placing pressure on capital values, which fell by
0.8 per cent, their largest monthly fall this year. Rental values dropped by
the same amount.
IPD said the fall in returns by about half a point to -0.1 per cent, points,
in part, 'to a lack of confidence in the market'.
In spite of the dip in returns, performance for the second quarter showed
some improvement over the previous quarter. Rental value rose from -2.3 per
cent to -2.0 per cent, capital growth remained static at -1.7 per cent,
while total return improved slightly to 0.4 per cent.
Taken year-on-year, all three measures turned for the worst. Capital values
and total returns, which had been steadily improving, recorded -6.1 per cent
and 1.7 per cent respectively for the year, compared with -5.7 per cent and
2.0 per cent for the year to May.
The biggest change of fortune was suffered by industrial property. The
greatest rental value decline yet recorded by the IPD Index combined with
the highest yield to produce the largest fall in capital values for 18
months. The retail sector was the only part of the market to show a positive
return in June.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Sea-change on the Danube - Vienna's
city centre proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Donau-City could be Austria's answer to Canary Wharf. The 3.85m sq ft
project on the sparsely populated east bank of the Danube is destined to
become Vienna's second city centre. The scheme will cost AS15bn (Pounds
750,000m), making it one of the most ambitious in Viennese history.
The project is to be developed by WED (the Vienna development company for
the Danube area), a consortium owned by eight of Vienna's leading banks, two
insurance companies and Nomura Securities, the Japanese broker. The group
was formed last year to exploit the land which became available when the
city abandoned plans to hold a World Expo on the site in 1995.
The project is supported by the city authorities, which have a small stake
in the project. The authorities are anxious to bring business back to the
long-neglected banks of the Danube and to rebalance the development of the
city. 'Both halves of the city to the left and to the right of the Danube
must be developed equally and simultaneously,' said Mr Hannes Swoboda, city
counsellor for urban planning.
The ambitious scheme testifies to Vienna's belief that it is reclaiming its
historically important role in the heart of Europe. 'If Vienna accepts the
challenge, Donau-City could become the symbol of Austria's new regional and
international role,' says WED.
The developers play down comparisons with La Defense in France or Canary
Wharf in London, stressing that Donau-City will be a well-balanced mix of
commercial and residential space. Indeed the developers dislike comparisons
with any other schemes, claiming, somewhat improbably, that Donau-City is
developed around 'radically new urban concepts'.
'It will not be a sleepy, satellite town but a lively mixture of offices and
business,' WED declares. It will not be a city that buries its inhabitants
under concrete and traffic but a city that lets its inhabitants breathe.
The promise of 'inspirational' architecture arouses some scepticism among
local critics. And the artists' impressions of slab-like blocks, sometimes
elevated on stilts, is vaguely reminiscent of post-war architecture in the
UK.
But the scheme, which is set beside a park close to the United Nations
complex, will have a pleasant setting and is only a seven minute journey by
underground from the city centre. WED's heavy infrastructure costs - in
particular arising from the need to rebuild a motorway nearby - will force
it to charge some of the most expensive rents in Vienna.
Phase 1 - work on the motorway - is due to start towards the end of the
year. The buildings in the first phase will be completed at the end of 1996
but construction could be delayed - or even postponed - if the developers
fail to attract tenants before building starts. Persauding tenants to move
to these buildings could be difficult, since the buildings' location is
relatively isolated.
The uncertainty surrounding the viability of Donau-City underlines the
nervousness of a property market that is going through a period of upheaval.
Demand has increased in the past couple of years as international groups
such as IBM and Hewlett Packard, both computer companies, have chosen Vienna
for their east European regional headquarters.
A feasibility study by Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, and Nomura
Research, found that in terms of establishing regional headquarters for
eastern Europe, Vienna was ranked second behind Berlin. The city is highly
rated for its political and economic stability and for its quality of life
and environmental factors.
WED also believes that Vienna could emerge as a centre for environmental and
energy planning, to address serious problems in the former eastern bloc. The
city is a popular choice for international bodies; it is home to several
United Nations organisations, the International Atomic Energy Authority and
Opec.
But concern is mounting among investors that with the rising tide of
construction activity in Vienna - fuelled by rapid increases in rents over
the past five years, relaxation of restrictive landlord and tenant laws, and
the political changes in eastern Europe - there will be an oversupply of
office space in a city that traditionally has been ignored by developers.
More than 20 new schemes are under construction or in the pipeline. If these
are completed vacancy rates could increase from 1-3 per cent at present to 8
per cent within five years, says Jones Lang Wootton. Many developments,
though, may fall by the wayside. 'Scare stories of oversupply are
unrealistic because a lot of projects will not be built,' says Mr Martin
Lenikus of Lenikus Consulting, a local agent.
Nonetheless, some critics still believe that the construction of Donau-City
would result in a glut of space. For that reason, critics say the scheme may
yet be grounded.
But Mr Michael Hodges, a partner of Jones Lang Wootton which has carried out
work on the project's viability, is cautiously positive. 'While the scheme
will undoubtedly prove a further test to the resilience of the office
market, it will nevertheless provide Vienna with a new and important
milestone as an office centre,' he says.

plant in southern Ireland.
Galvin will now also assume the chairmanship of the division, replacing
Gerry Dempsey, who will, however, continue in his role as special adviser on
group strategic affairs to the group chairman, Donald Brennan.
Brian Patterson has been appointed to a new position of chief operating
officer at Waterford Crystal. He was previously deputy chief executive,
responsible for personnel.
The two, who had formerly worked in Guinness Ireland together, are credited
by analysts as having won back the initiative for management at Waterford
Crystal against tough union opposition. They will be pushing through the new

Patterson, who sits on the Waterford board, will be nominated to the group

FT  31 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Solicitor's cheque defence is arguable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLIFFORD CHANCE v SILVER Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Neill and Sir
Christopher Slade): July 22 1992
THE ENDORSEE of a cheque who acquires it in good faith for value by
conditional delivery becomes the 'holder in due course' on satisfaction of
the condition, with a right to claim against the drawer for subsequent
dishonour. But on a claim for summary judgment the drawer is entitled to
defend if there is sufficient evidence for him to argue that the endorsee
relinquished his rights under the cheque in return for payment of a smaller
sum.
THE COURT of Appeal so held when allowing in part an appeal by Mr Geoffrey
Silver from Mr Justice Garland's decision ordering summary judgment on a
claim against him by the plaintiffs, Clifford Chance.
LORD JUSTICE Neill said that in December 1990 a series of property
transactions were contemplated, relating to freehold property in Lambeth.
The transactions included: (a) sale of the property by Chartwell Land
Investments Ltd, previously called Woolworth Properties Ltd, to Mr Don
Abili; (b) lease of the property by Mr Abili to Woolworths plc; (c)
subsequent sale of the property by Mr Abili to Camberside Ltd, a company
controlled by Mr Abili, and a further sale by Camberside to Courtyard
Leisure plc.
Clifford Chance acted as solicitors for Chartwell, Frederick Hass &amp; Stone
for Mr Abili, and Mr Silver for Camberside.
The deposit payable under the first agreement (the sale by Chartwell to Mr
Abili) was Pounds 100,000. Under the second agreement (the sale by Mr Abili
to Camberside), the deposit was originally Pounds 170,000 but was increased
to Pounds 185,000.
On December 12 1990, Mr Silver sent Frederick Hass two cheques for Pounds
100,000 and Pounds 70,000, representing the deposit originally agreed under
the second agreement.
On December 13, Frederick Hass replied, confirming that Mr Silver had given
them permission to deliver the Pounds 100,000 cheque to Clifford Chance 'on
the basis that they will hold the cheque strictly to our order'.
On receipt of the Pounds 100,000, Frederick Hass endorsed it sans recours
and sent it with an accompanying letter requesting Clifford Chance to hold
the deposit cheque 'strictly to our order, returnable on demand until we are
able to authorise you to effect an exchange'.
Early in January 1991, the contracts for the sale by Mr Abili to Camberside
were exchanged. On January 10, the contracts for the sale by Chartwell to Mr
Abili were exchanged. The Pounds 100,000 deposit under the first agreement
then became due.
On January 11, Clifford Chance presented the indorsed cheque for payment. On
January 16 the cheque was dishonoured by Mr Silver's bank.
Following the dishonour discussions took place between Clifford Chance and
Frederick Hass, and between Frederick Hass and Mr Silver.
As a result of the discussions between Frederick Hass and Mr Silver, a
Pounds 50,000 banker's draft was sent by Mr Silver to Frederick Hass.
Clifford Chance, as endorsees of the cheque, claimed Pounds 100,000 against
Mr Silver. Before Mr Justice Garland, Mr Silver raised four defences. The
judge rejected them and gave judgment for Clifford Chance.
On the present appeal Mr Goldblatt for Mr Silver put forward fresh
arguments, including a submission that Clifford Chance were never 'holders
in due course' of the cheque.
By section 29 (1) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, a 'holder in due
course' was a holder who had taken a bill, complete and regular on its face,
under the conditions '(a) that he became the holder of it before it was
overdue and without notice that it had been previously dishonoured . . .
(b)that he took the bill in good faith and for value, and . . . had no
notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it'.
Section 31 of the Act provided that a bill was negotiated 'when it is
transferred . . . in such a manner as to constitute the transferee the
holder of the bill'; and that a bill payable to order was negotiated 'by the
indorsement of the holder completed by delivery'.
Mr Goldblatt submitted: (1) that the cheque was indorsed and delivered to
Clifford Chance by a transfer of possession on December 13, and was
negotiated to them on that date; (2) that on December 13 Clifford Chance
were aware that Frederick Hass's title was defective, in that they held the
cheque to Mr Silver's account, not their own - their title was merely
conditional; (3) that being aware of the defect at time of negotiation,
Clifford Chance were incapable of becoming holders in due course unless as a
result of subsequent negotiation; (4) that even if transfer of possession
and delivery did not take place until January 10, Clifford Chance could not
satisfy section 29 (1)(b) because they never gave value for the cheque
themselves.
The submissions were not accepted.
Section 21 of the 1882 Act provided that delivery of a bill of exchange '(2)
(b) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and
not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.
It was clear that delivery of a cheque could be shown to be conditional.
The delivery on December 13 was conditional and the contract between
endorser and endorsee was incomplete.
On January 10 the contracts for sale of the property were exchanged, and the
conditions stipulated in the letter from Mr Silver and the letter from
Frederick Hass were fulfilled.
It was on that date that the cheque was negotiated to Clifford Chance.
They then became holders in due course.
Except where a bill was overdue, a bona fide holder for value without notice
of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated the bill to him was
a holder in due course.
Consideration was given for the cheque when contracts were exchanged on
January 10.
Mr Goldblatt argued also that after the cheque was dishonoured Mr Abili,
acting as Clifford Chance's agent, agreed with Mr Silver that in
consideration of a Pounds 75,000 payment by Mr Silver (of which the earlier
Pounds 50,000 payment was to form part), Clifford Chance would release him
from any liability under the cheque.
The argument was based on Mr Silver's affidavit that Mr Abili had told him
Chartwell and Woolworth would forgo their rights under the cheque if he
could pay Pounds 75,000. Mr Silver said it was clear to him that the offer
was intended to bind Clifford Chance.
The judge dismissed a similar argument. He rightly said it was inconceivable
that Clifford Chance would appoint a purchaser who was already in difficulty
as their agent to strike a bargain waiving rights under the cheque.
Mr Goldblatt also argued that even if Clifford Chance became holders in due
course of the cheque, Frederick Hass were authorised by them after the
cheque was dishonoured to negotiate on their behalf with Mr Silver; and as a
result of those negotiations, Mr Silver sent Frederick Hass the Pounds
50,000 banker's draft which was paid and accepted in part payment of the
cheque.
In support of that argument counsel drew attention to a number of documents,
including Clifford Chance attendance notes and a Frederick Hass letter.
It was submitted that those documents indicated that following the
dishonour, Clifford Chance authorised Frederick Hass to discuss the position
with Mr Silver on their behalf to see whether the deposit could be raised
before they enforced their rights under the cheque.
Clifford Chance argued that other documents which showed they never
relinquished any of their rights under the cheque.
On this part of the case Mr Silver had an arguable defence.
The appeal was allowed in part by giving unconditional leave to defend as to
Pounds 50,000 and interest.
Sir Christopher Slade gave a concurring judgment.
For Mr Silver: Simon Goldblatt QC and Robert Jay (Fuglers)
For Clifford Chance: John McGhee (Clifford Chance)

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Larry Pillard, a senior executive at Cargill Corn Milling, has jumped ship
to a major competitor, Tate &amp; Lyle's US starch and sweetener subsidiary
Staley, as the new president and chief executive officer.
He replaces Murray McEwen, a Tate &amp; Lyle director who moved down from
Toronto on a temporary basis after the previous Staley boss Doug Lapins
resigned in April because he found he was 'not enjoying the job', according
to Tate &amp; Lyle.
In common with its two other big competitors, ADM and Cargill, Staley is
suffering from a cyclical downturn in its principal product, high fructose
corn syrup (HFCS); excess capacity combined with weakening demand for soft
drinks has placed the two main HFCS buyers Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in a
particularly strong position to effect a tight squeeze on prices.
Pillard, 45, who has been in corn milling all his business life, joined
Cargill in his late teens on the night shift in the laboratories. He has
worked his way up to senior vice president, technology/engineering
operations of Cargill Corn Milling based in Minneapolis. While he joins at a
'challenging time', according to the company, analysts say that Staley's
position is a mark of wider troubles in the industry rather than any
management-induced problems.

The Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest provider of housing finance,
has been slower than some of its rivals to move into Europe. However, it may
be starting to catch up.
In May its members approved a change in its rules to enable it to lend money
in the European Community and invest in a finance or insurance company. Now
it has strengthened its European team by appointing Mike Ellis (left) as
general manager, treasury and European operations. He joins Ian Lumsden, the
Halifax's assistant general manager for European operations, who has been
monitoring developments on the Continent for some time.
Ellis, a former local government official, joined the Halifax five years ago
as treasurer. In June 1989, he became group treasurer and he has now been
promoted to general manager, treasury and European operations. He is the
youngest of the Halifax's general managers and will continue to report to
Gren Folwell, the Halifax's finance director, on treasury issues. However,
he will report directly to Jim Birrell, the group chief executive, on
European matters.

MOST commercial property lenders expect no improvement and even a decline in
the market over the next year, according to a survey of 58 banks and other
financial institutions.
It showed that lenders have revised their forecasts as the expected recovery
has failed to materialise. This month, only 48 per cent expected an
improvement in the market over the next 12 months, down from 55 per cent in
January and 70 per cent in July last year.
The report by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and Chartered
Surveyor Weekly magazine suggests that the next six months may be critical
for struggling property companies.
Sixty-nine per cent of those polled expect the upward trend in receiverships
to continue over the next six months.
Average bad-debt provisions have risen from almost 3 per cent of the total
property loan book in January to 7.5 per cent. Over the next six months, 69
per cent of lenders expect a further increase in bad-debt provisions.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Slide in company starts continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of companies being formed is continuing to fall, according to a
survey that is likely to heighten worries about the effect of the recession.
According to Jordans, a business information group, 56,022 companies were
created in the first half of this year, a drop of 3.1 per cent from the
57,788 starts in the same period last year. Although the year-on-year fall
is lower than the rates recorded early in the recession, the figure
indicates how the weak economy has reduced opportunities for budding
entrepreneurs.
According to Jordans, the number of company starts has declined particularly
in northern and eastern England, with the west Midlands and Scotland less
affected.
Besides the poor business outlook, the reduced enthusiasm of banks to back
fledgling businesses is seen as a further factor behind the fall in company
starts.
Jordans' figures for company formations are based on registrations at
Companies House and cover the UK excluding Northern Ireland. This year's
figures follow a year-on-year fall of 9.1 per cent last year, and one of 7.1
per cent the previous year. Last year, 110,108 companies were formed, down
from a peak of 130,478 in 1989.
In the first half of this year compared with the same period last year,
there was a 28 per cent fall in the number of companies established in
northern England.
In eastern England, the east Midlands and north-west England the falls were
25 per cent, 24 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.
Scotland and the west Midlands each saw a drop of just 7 per cent, while
outer London suffered a decline of 12 per cent.
The figures for the south-west, south-east, Yorkshire and Humberside region,
and southern England were 18 per cent, 17 per cent, 16 per cent and 14 per
cent.
Inner London and Wales saw rises of 12 per cent and 8 per cent in the number
of registered companies. That, though, reflects large numbers of 'shelf'
companies registered at accountants and agents in London and Cardiff, not
new economic activity in those areas.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Switchgear joint venture goes ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOINT venture between Gooding, the privately owned Welsh electronics
group, and Sanken Electric, the Japanese manufacturer of switchgear and
transformers, is to go ahead after being delayed for two years.
Gooding Sanken, in which the Welsh company has a 51 per cent stake, is to
build the Pounds 2.5m second phase of a development at Abercynon in the
Cynon Valley north of Cardiff, one of south Wales's unemployment blackspots.
The plant will employ up to 500 workers when fully operational and
production will begin next February. The intention is to replace imports
from the Far East. Gooding Sanken already has a plant further up the valley
in Aberdare employing 220 people making switchgear and transformers for the
European market.
Mr Alf Gooding, chairman of Gooding group, which employs 1,400 people in
electronics factories around Cardiff, said the project 'had been delayed
because of the impact of the recession' but added: 'Further delay and a
failure to invest now would jeopardise the company's ability to satisfy the
prospective increase in demand a year or so hence.'
The Welsh Office and Welsh Development Agency have given financial
assistance.

FT  31 JUL 92 / BCCI liquidators to contact creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International will
circulate a letter to creditors in the next two weeks on behalf of the
Luxembourg court giving recommendations for dividing the bank's assets.
Mr Brian Smouha, of accountants Touche Ross, and Mr Georges Baden and Mr
Julien Roden, who were appointed joint liquidators to BCCI SA by the
Luxembourg court, are expected to continue pressing for their liquidation
package, which offers creditors up to Dollars 1.7bn.
They will write to about 50,000 creditors and place newspaper advertisements
laying out the arguments.
The letter was requested in an order issued by the court last week, when it
postponed a decision on whether to approve the deal until October 7, to hear
creditors' views.
Some creditors have attempted to challenge the deal, calling for larger
contributions from the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders in
the bank, or for litigation to recover more assets.
The liquidators say the government of Abu Dhabi will not contribute any more
money, and that litigation would delay any dividend to creditors for many
years.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Taxman set to drive a hard bargain: The Inland Revenue's
proposals for company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue says some 1.2m drivers would benefit under its proposals
to restructure company car taxation - but the 700,000 losers would face
higher tax demands running to thousands of pounds a year in some cases.
The Revenue emphasised yesterday that the proposals were only the start of a
3 1/2 -month consultative process.
It can expect to be inundated, for the issue is important for manufacturers,
which make nearly a third of sales to business users, and for the
government, which receives Pounds 1.4bn annually in income tax from the
company car benefit scale charges, as well as for the nearly 2m company car
users.
The proposals aim to make fairer what is essentially a crude banding system,
unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced 16 years ago. But they
are also intended to take account of criticisms, including some by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, that the combined price and engine
capacity thresholds of the company car taxation system distort the market,
obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax break specials' causing market
bunching and potentially disadvantaging specialist manufacturers such as
Jaguar.
There are about 1,200 car models available in the UK, but the present scale
system divides them into only five categories, using both price and engine
size. That means, to use the Revenue's own example, that the driver of a
sub-Pounds 9,000 Ford Fiesta diesel pays the same as the driver of a Pounds
19,000 BMW 520i if their business mileages are similar.
The Revenue says its proposals to base the tax charge mainly on price is
fairer and more easily understood than the present system.
The Revenue has resisted pressure to abandon banding altogether, in favour
of basing the scale charge on a percentage of the list price of the car. The
Revenue wished to avoid the need for individual tax calculations and PAYE
recodings each time a car is changed.
The Revenue is proposing 12 price bands, each higher band covering a
successively wider range of car prices. The perceived advantage of such a
structure is that it would be sensitive in the Pounds 10,000-Pounds 19,500
region, where company cars are concentrated.
Business car buyers will have to wait until the final scheme is set out in
next year's Budget for the exact detail. But to generate the same revenue
yield as the present system, the document indicates a scale representing two
ninths of a car's value for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a
year; one third for low-mileage (below 2,500 miles) users and only one ninth
for those covering more than 18,000 business miles a year. The document
proposes no changes to the business mileage bands.
The effects of the change are likely to be uneven. The Revenue says more
than half of the 750,000 company car drivers in the existing 1.4-2-litre
engine band would gain modestly, most with a tax charge reduced by about 10
per cent, and about 70,000 drivers of most basic cars by up to 25 per cent.
But even the Revenue acknowledges that better-equipped saloons in the Pounds
12,500-Pounds 16,000 range would attract increases of more than 10 per cent,
affecting an estimated 360,000 drivers. The typical middle-ranking
executive, driving a high-specification car of just under 2 litres and just
under the present Pounds 19,250 threshold, would be among those worst
affected, facing a typical increase in tax of about 40 per cent.
Cars currently costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be
split into two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band
would have the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average; those costing more
than Pounds 24,500 - involving about 20,000 cars - would be modest losers.
For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at
the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge
reduced by more than 30 per cent, a benefit to companies such as Jaguar.
Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise, by 35 per cent for cars
costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000.
Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said the
system 'will inevitably hit senior executives driving the most expensive
cars'. He suggested that, since many of these drivers were user-choosers,
'the logical result will be a general downsizing of company cars'.
The scheme also aims to minimise incentives to drive thirsty cars. And while
there are no specific provisions to encourage economical diesel cars, they
will be encouraged indirectly by the proposals.
Diesel cars need larger engines than petrol equivalents in order to have
acceptable power and are therefore often put into a higher band under the
present scale structure. A price-only band would end such discrimination, as
well as tending in general to favour cheaper - and generally more
fuel-efficient - cars.
There is a strong administrative argument for the Revenue's proposals:
whereas the whole business car sector usually waits on tenterhooks each
Budget to see what changes in scale charges are announced, a multi-band
price system would be broadly self-correcting and require no Budgetary
attention. Cars would simply drift up through the price bands, depending on
inflation.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Tories accused of 'betraying' jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR launched a fresh attack on the government's record on jobs yesterday
when it claimed that the Tories had failed to deliver 10,000 promised places
on their Employment Action programme.
The onslaught was a first shot in the opposition's promised summer offensive
on the economy. It came when three members of the shadow economic team
charged the government with a 'callous betrayal' of the unemployed.
Labour said in a statement released by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor,
that Mr Michael Howard, when employment secretary, had committed the
government to finding work experience places for 60,000 people and to having
30,000 people on schemes at any time.
Yet in May, two months after a target deadline had been passed, some 10,000
places had remained unfilled. 'In many constituencies there are as many as
10,000 people unemployed, with sometimes as few as 30 places on Employment
Action available,' the statement said. It was also signed by Mr Frank
Dobson, shadow employment secretary, and Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief
secretary to the Treasury.

FT  31 JUL 92 / BA strike set for Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of air travellers face possible disruption to flights after
British Airways cabin crews set next Tuesday as the date for the first of a
series of one-day strikes.
'We will definitely close down domestic, European and Concorde services
unless BA agrees to further talks over the new pay and conditions,' said the
TGWU general union, which represents 2,600 of the airline's 2,900 cabin
crew.
BA has conceded that, if the strike attracts strong support after midnight
on Monday, short-haul services will be disrupted. It is thought unlikely
that Concorde will be affected.
The union said it was expecting all members to support the strike call, but
officials admitted privately that it was impossible to predict how many
members actually would strike.
BA said it was planning a normal schedule on Tuesday. The company said the
ballot for the action had produced only a 121 majority in favour of action,
in a turnout of about 70 per cent. An earlier ballot, which produced a
bigger majority, was ruled unlawful.
'We are hopeful that short-haul crews will report for work on Tuesday and
that we will operate all our domestic and European services without
inconvenience to passengers,' BA said.
The company said it had no plans for talks with the unions. BA said it had
reached agreement on a new pay and conditions deal with pilots and ground
service staff, adding that the cabin crew union negotiators had supported
the deal.
BA's proposals mean pay cuts of up to Pounds 2,000 a year for about 500 crew
working in Birmingham and Manchester. There are about 3,000 short-haul crew
nationwide.
Next year, crews will receive pay rises only if inflation is above 4 per
cent. The union says the new contracts BA has issued strip employees of
important negotiating and disciplinary rights.
During the last one-day strike by cabin crew in August 1989, 350 out of 600
rostered staff stayed away from work.

FT  31 JUL 92 / US space station kept alive by House
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US House of Representatives has voted to keep alive the Dollars 40bn
American space station project, despite criticism both of its cost and of
its scientific utility.
Although opponents of the costly project had hoped their cause would profit
from a new eagerness to tackle extravagant government spending, the House
voted 237:181 (almost exactly the same margin as a year ago) against
cancelling the station.
'In difficult economic times, the Congress stood up and did what's right for
the future,' said Mr Daniel Goldin, administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), who has led ferocious lobbying
to preserve the space station.
But Congressman David Obey charged that many in Congress had been swayed by
Nasa contracts in their districts. 'Nasa has successfully salted enough
contracts all around the country. That's how they think they can continue to
save this programme,' he said.
Nasa says the space station already provides more than 75,000 jobs in 37
states. Of the 24 states which have received more than Dollars 1m in such
contracts, House delegations from all but five voted on Wednesday night in
favour of continuing the station's funding.
Even so, the House voted only Dollars 1.7bn for the space station in the
1993 fiscal year - Dollars 500m less than the Bush administration had
requested. A Senate committee yesterday voted Dollars 2.1bn for the project,
which would probably fall behind its aim for launch in 1995 if it received
only the Dollars 1.7bn agreed by the House.
'The story is: 'Look up, America. Don't look around',' Congressman Bob
Traxler, another leading opponent, intoned with irony. 'Forget what you see
in your cities, the rural areas. Forget the poverty, the privation. See that
glimmer up in the sky? It's got eight people up there. Isn't that
wonderful?'

West European companies are worried that, in an attempt to earn hard

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy expanded in the second quarter of this year by less than half
the revised rate of the first, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
Gross domestic product rose at a real annual rate of 1.4 per cent, somewhat
worse than expected and down from the revised 2.9 per cent increase of the
first three months.
This potentially negative news for President George Bush's re-election
effort was partly mitigated by other data published yesterday, showing a
surge in new house sales in June and a reduction in unemployment claims
during the middle week of this month.
Also, the Senate finance committee agreed on Wednesday night a Dollars
21.8bn (Pounds 11.4bn) tax bill containing some elements of the president's
economic recovery plan, among them the creation of 25 urban enterprise
zones, a 15 per cent tax allowance on new investment undertaken over the
next year and a Dollars 2,500 tax credit for new home buyers.
However, the proposed bill made no reference to a general capital gains tax
reduction that had been favoured by Mr Bush.
Campaigning in Texas yesterday, Mr Bush said that the economy was 'not
growing fast enough'. Yet again he ascribed the blame to 'dillying and
dallying' in Congress, but he made no direct reference to the Senate
committee's bill. The bipartisan opinion on Capitol Hill is that he would
probably accept it.
The principal depressant in the preliminary GDP figures was consumer
spending, down 0.3 per cent in the second quarter after a healthy rise of
5.1 per cent in the first. Business inventories rose by 20.7 per cent in
April-June, compared with a 3.7 per cent advance in the first three months.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Canada-US beer war gets green tinge -
Environmental issues creeping into an old dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TIT-FOR-TAT row over US exports of beer to Canada has underlined the
extent to which environmental issues are finding their way into
international trade disputes.
Washington last Friday imposed a 50 per cent ad valorem tax (proportionate
to price) on beer from Ontario in retaliation for what it said was a
discriminatory 'environmental tax' levied by the Canadian province on all
alcoholic drinks in non-refillable containers.
The tax, as it applies to aluminium cans, was doubled last April to 10 cents
per can, boosting the retail price of American beer sold in Ontario's Liquor
Control Board stores from USDollars 19.83 to USDollars 24.35 per case,
according to the US trade repres-entative.
The US is also upset over a handling fee imposed on imported beer, which
unlike domestic brands, is distributed through liquor outlets owned by the
provincial government.
In response to the US action against Ontario, Canada has slapped new customs
duties on Heileman and Stroh, the two US companies which first brought the
complaints. Other brewers are not affected by this tariff.
The US Aluminum Association and Can Manufacturers Institute claim that it
was 'no coincidence' that the environmental tax was announced five days
after the US and Canada reached a tentative agreement to resolve other
issues in the long-running beer war.
The US groups have no doubt that the tax was purely a protectionist weapon
wielded against American beer. Why else, they say, would Ontario tax only
non-refillable alcohol containers, leaving softdrink cans untouched by the
levy? About 85 per cent of Canada's beer is sold in refillable bottles; most
American beer is shipped in aluminium cans.
'This was the ultimate roadblock, erected to ensure that there was no way to
resolve this dispute,' says Mr Barry Meyer, vice-president of the Aluminum
Association.
Ontario counters that the 'green tax' also applies to wine and spirits
bottles (which are also classified as non-refillable). According to an
official in the provincial ministry of consumer and commercial relations,
softdrinks are exempt because they are not distributed through
government-run outlets, and because softdrink manufacturers already
participate in a 'blue box' recycling programme. 'Softdrinks are a more
difficult sector to deal with in a similar way,' said the official.
Ontario insists that US brewers are welcome to ship their product without
paying the tax if they use 'environmentally friendly' bottles. At least one
New York brewer, Genesee, is planning to do just that.
Much of the argument hinges on which is the most environmentally virtuous:
cans or bottles. The Canadians opt for the latter because they can be
re-used an average of 15-18 times. Ontario maintains that refillable
containers are environmentally more desirable than recyclable ones, such as
aluminium cans.
But the Americans find bottles too expensive to ship, and favour cans as
'the most recycled packaging material in the world'. They note that 88 per
cent of Ontario's aluminum beer cans are already recycled - one of the
highest rates in the world.
The Aluminum Association adds that recycling cans and washing, transporting
and refilling bottles consume about the same amount of energy at high
recycling rates. But recycling saves 95 per cent of the energy required to
make aluminium from virgin materials.
Then there is the bottle caps controversy. The Americans say that because
glass is bulkier than aluminum and few caps are recycled, refillable bottles
actually produce more solid waste than cans. If all cans were replaced by
bottles in Ontario, thousands more tonnes of solid waste would have to be
land-filled.
With the North American Free Trade Agreement near completion, the US is
hoping to contain the damage by limiting the beer sanctions to Ontario. The
two leading Canadian brewers, Molson and John Labatt, have built up large
stockpiles in the US in anticipation of the new duty, and hope to keep on
shipping across the border from plants in Montreal and Vancouver. But US
trade officials warn that they will monitor beer imports from other Canadian
provinces. If imports surge beyond historical trade levels, the 50 per cent
duty will be extended to the offending province.
The Canadians have most to lose in the long run. Their beer holds about 1
per cent of the US market, equal to about 10 per cent of Canadian beer
output. Molson is the second biggest supplier of imported beers in the US.
US brewers have a 3 per cent share of the Canadian market, but that is less
than 1 per cent of their sales.
Since 1988, two panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt)
have ruled that Canada's provinces discriminate against imported beer. But
Ms Marilyn Churley, Ontario's minister of consumer and commercial relations,
is accusing the US of acting like 'an international trade outlaw' by turning
down a Canadian proposal to bring the dispute to another Gatt panel for
binding arbitration.
The Canadians say the Gatt council refused a US request to retaliate against
Canada; they do not mention that it was Canada which blocked the council's
action. After winning two panel decisions, the US obviously has had enough
of Gatt.
Under US trade laws, the trade representative was required to impose some
sort of sanctions last Friday. A Gatt with the authority to sanctify
environmentally related duties and distinguish which environmental rules are
truly trade barriers may have been better equipped to make a ruling which
both sides would have respected.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Agreement near on Nafta dispute mechanisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators working on a North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) are near an agreement on setting up dispute-settlement
procedures, governed by a Commission and permanent secretariat, and
empowered to authorise sanctions within 30 days of a finding, Nancy Dunne
reports from Washington.
Under a partial Nafta text draft obtained by the Financial Times, disputes
between the countries may be brought to Gatt or a forum under the US-Canada
Free Trade Agreement. Once the complaint process begins under one forum, it
cannot switch to others. The forum worries US citizen and environmental
groups; they fear US food and safety standards can be deemed trade barriers
if taken to Gatt. Despite pledges that US standards, federal and state, will
be safe from attack on trade grounds in Nafta, they are unconvinced.
The Commission is given authority to implement Nafta, set up committees,
working and expert groups, and supervise committees. It has strict deadlines
by which to operate, most stringent concerning perishable commodities. The
Commission's main members will be the three governments' trade ministers,
meeting at least once a year to review the commission's work.
The three governments will choose 30 panellists, serving three-year terms,
to rule on disputes, and expert in law, international trade, and dispute
resolution, chosen for objectivity, reliability and sound judgment.
Complaints can go to a five-member arbitration panel, which may seek
information and technical advice, but with no requirement to do so. This
will annoy environmentalists wanting a stronger voice in such matters and
more open proceedings than allowed for in Gatt.
'The unacceptable secrecy and lack of a role for non-governmental groups is
maintained, but the text places some initial burden of proof on the
challenging party,' said Ms Lori Wallach, trade programme director at Public
Citizen. 'This could have been an improvement over Gatt. Unfortunately, it
is meaningless; any party may take any dispute to Gatt instead of using
Nafta dispute resolution.'

TURKEY's Export Import Bank yesterday agreed credits worth Dollars 275m
(Pounds 144m) with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, when other countries' credit
agencies are unwilling to extend export cover, while the former Soviet
Union's debt picture remains unclear, John Murray Brown reports from Ankara.
The credits form part of a Dollars 1bn financial package promised by Mr
Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, in April, and underline Turkey's
aim to win business in these republics.
The deal provides Turkish exporters with 100 per cent trade insurance cover,
Dollars 200m for Kazakhstan and the rest for Kyrgyzstan. A list of export
items has still to be agreed. The accord follows a Dollars 1.7bn power plant
deal in Kazakhstan earlier this month.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japan, US end SII talks with cartels
pledge
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japan ended talks on structural impediments to trade yesterday
with an argument over how much the average Japanese home should cost, and a
promise by Tokyo to study the business habits of Japan's biggest trading
houses.
After the two-day meeting, US negotiators, under orders from Washington,
were determined to portray the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII)
agreement as successful in treating the underlying causes of Japan's
consistently large trade surplus, likely to top Dollars 100bn (Pounds
52.3bn) this year.
Praising the SII agreement, signed in 1990, was partly an attempt by US
negotiators to defend the Bush administration's Japan policy, under attack
in Congress for having been too soft if only because Japan's trade surplus
has risen over the past two years.
But Tokyo made several new pledges, including introduction of training for
anti-monopoly officers in the detection of bid-rigging, common in the
building industry. Tokyo will study the 'trade associations' routinely
established by Japanese industry, sometimes used as a front for cartels.
Japan will 'encourage transparency' in private procurement, 'consider'
improved rights for shareholders, and reduce import processing times. But
Tokyo did not promise, as the US asked, to include a target price for the
average Japanese home, raised by the US as part of its campaign for changes
in land use.
The most awkward discussions concerned differing corporate cultures.
Washington sees Japanese corporate families, keiretsu, as exclusionary;
Tokyo argues these groups' cross-shareholdings are conducive to long-term
stability and profitability.
Mr Olin Wethington, assistant US treasury secretary, said keiretsu were
'among the most complicated subject areas in this exercise', and Japan must
act to improve disclosure of cross-shareholdings, allow proxy voting and
outside directors, and improve access to corporate records.
Japanese negotiators were disappointed the US had not done more to cut its
budget deficit and there has been a general lack of new SII-related
policies. US negotiators insisted President Bush was committed to cutting
the deficit and said the US Congress had been the biggest problem.
Apart from the deficit, the US pledged in principle to promote private
saving, improve US worker training, and encourage US companies to cultivate
a longer-term business perspective. In assessing results of the review, Mr
Tadao Chino, vice-minister of international affairs at Japan's Finance
Ministry, compared SII to a lemon: 'When you squeeze it first, the juice
comes out quickly. It's harder the second or third try.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Hostels may prove deadly flashpoint: Next week's ANC-led
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE many potential flash points in the week of industrial action that
gets under way in South Africa on Monday, none is more volatile than the
single-men's hostels scattered around the industrial heartland of the
Witwatersrand.
Present are all the ingredients for violence - ethnic and political
tensions, living conditions that are often wretched, and competition for
jobs in an economy now in the third year of a recession. The hostel dwellers
 -or 'inmates' as they are often called - are mainly, though not entirely,
Zulu and supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party.
Last week Chief Buthelezi angrily condemned the African National Congress
(ANC) call for a two-day general strike starting on Monday and called on his
followers to assert their 'right to work'.
Confrontation thus seems inevitable, and it is likely to involve around 25
'problem' hostels in the region around Johannesburg which have been linked
to more than 260 attacks over the past two years, claiming 1,200 lives and
causing injuries to 3,700 people.
The massacre last month of 42 people in the township of Boipatong thrust the
hostel issue to the forefront of national concerns, for the attackers were
said to come from the nearby Kwamadala hostel. Boipatong, however, was
merely the latest in a gruesome series of attacks which have left hostels
such as Madala in Alexandra township and Nancefield and Jabulani in Soweto
as bywords for violence.
It prompted renewed calls, however, for measures that seemed long overdue -
fence the hostels, monitor access points and confiscate weapons, increase
police patrols in the area, and begin a longer-term programme to phase out
hostels and replace them with family accommodation.
'Fine in principle, but try putting it into practice,' complains a senior
government official whose job is to resolve the problem.
Although the government adopted a hostel upgrading strategy in October last
year, and voted R294.6m (Pounds 55.6m) in the 1992/93 budget to finance it,
it has been the object of criticism for not having shown greater resolution.
Most hostels are in the public sector, run by black local authorities or
provincial administrations, but there are also private hostels, mostly in
the mining industry.
Professor Dan Smit of the University of Natal, Durban, who has done research
into the hostel system, calculates that there are at least 380,000 public
and private hostel beds in South Africa which are used by more than 1m
migrant workers during the course of a year. The average hostel probably
houses about 2,000.
The conventional image of hostels has them as squalid and over-crowded seats
of crime, dominated by Zulu-speaking Inkatha supporters, mostly unemployed,
who are invariably the aggressors in situations of township conflict.
While there are hostels which conform to this stereotype, many more do not.
As pressure to deal with the hostel problem has escalated, so it has become
clearer that any quick-fix solution, premised on the belief that all hostels
are 'bad', is inappropriate and unfeasible.
The government's strategy of either upgrading or converting hostels into
family units first requires consensus between interested parties -
principally, the residents, civic associations, neighbouring township
dwellers and the local authorities who own most hostels. While progress has
been made in some areas, it has been difficult to get parties around the
table where there has been violence. Mr Johan du Plessis, director of
urbanisation at the Transvaal Provincial Administration comments: 'Trying to
reach consensus in the Witwatersrand is virtually impossible.'
The authorities face an unenviable task. On the one hand, there is
recognition of the urgent need for change to be seen to be taking place on
the ground. On the other, this change can only commence when there is
consensus, at individual hostel level, about the way forward. In more
troubled areas this is a distant dream.
Further complicating matters is that despite being an artificial, primitive
and inadequate form of accommodation, many residents wish to preserve
hostels, which are a preferable alternative to squatter camps. While housing
would obviously be desirable, apartheid and unrest have so disrupted the
housing delivery process in townships that there is no effective housing
market and the state simply does not have the funds to meet the housing
backlog itself.
Hostels have their origin in the migrant labour system, whereby working men
living in outlying rural regions or neighbouring countries came to the
cities to seek work on the mines or in industry. The apartheid system
regarded these men as 'temporary sojourners' in urban areas. As such, they
left their families in the 'homelands' and moved into hostel accommodation,
designed for single men.
Research conducted by Lauren Segal of Wits University indicates that before
violence came to the Transvaal townships in July 1990, hostel-dwellers and
township residents co-existed reasonably. Hostel dwellers had always been
'social enclaves', perpetuating the more traditional value and authority
systems found in rural areas but it was only with political mobilisation
during the late-1980s that a wedge started to be driven between them and
township residents.
Union and youth movements called for work stayaways and boycotts without
consulting hostel dwellers who fiercely resisted them. Ms Segal quotes one
resident: 'No one will stop us from going to work. We come to Johannesburg
to work, not for anything else.' Hostel dwellers with their more traditional
values were also deeply alienated by what they regarded as the lawless young
comrades found at the helm of youth movements.
Even so, it was only when serious township violence started in mid-1990 that
relations deteriorated dramatically with ethnicity becoming an important
factor. Hostel dwellers, perceiving a common threat, based on their
identification as Zulus, banded together for support. In many cases they
drove non-Zulus out of the hostels and turned to Inkatha for support.

FT  31 JUL 92 / South Korea to boost investment overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea will introduce new rules on September 1 to encourage corporate
investment abroad.
The total of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2bn) in direct overseas investment made by
South Korea amounts to only 1.2 per cent of GNP, against 13.2 per cent for
Japan, although it has grown by an annual average of 40 per cent since 1985.
The government believes that increased foreign investment will improve the
acquisition of technology as well as reduce the vulnerability of Korean
companies to protectionism.
Korean companies will be permitted to raise overseas all the capital
necessary to finance foreign investments, including mergers and
acquisitions, instead of being required to obtain some funds domestically.
This should reduce corporate financing costs, because interest rates in
South Korea are higher than those in most of its main trade partners.
The financial restrictions have hampered mergers and acquisitions abroad,
which amounted to only Dollars 110m last year.
The government will only review applications for foreign investments
exceeding Dollars 10m, up from the current limit of Dollars 2m. Investment
in countries with which South Korea has no diplomatic relations will be
treated the same as other nations.
This is to encourage activity in China and Vietnam.

<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S main opposition party has been weakened by a bitter power struggle
which could boost the electoral chances of President Daniel arap Moi.
The rift in the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) is so severe
that yesterday Mr Maside Muliro, the interim vice-chairman, alleged 'the two
camps have armed themselves to the teeth to do battle with each other'.
Privately, many senior Ford officials say the split, ostensibly over
internal party elections, is irreparable and a formal division is possible.
Behind the issue of the party's elections lie tribal divisions and a power
struggle between Mr Kenneth Matiba, a presidential aspirant who is a Kikuyu,
and Mr Oginga Odinga, another presidential aspirant who is interim chairman
of Ford and a Luo.
Party officials say the bickering between the two factions has played into
Mr Moi's hands to the extent that Ford's early popularity has waned and Mr
Moi could win a snap election.
Mr Moi has the right to call the country's first multi-party elections in
more than two decades any time before the end of parliament's five-year term
next March. Political observers in Nairobi believe an election in September
or October is possible.
Crisis talks appeared to be under way yesterday to resolve the rift, which
emerged publicly on Tuesday when five Ford executive committee members
called for the postponement of the party's internal elections, which are due
to begin tomorrow. They said Ford was ill prepared to conduct free and fair
internal elections.
Mr Odinga and his faction said the elections should go ahead.
Mr Matiba believes that as a hero of the pro-democracy movement, he deserves
the presidency. Mr Odinga's group say that the country is not ready for
another Kikuyu president (former President Jomo Kenyatta was a Kikuyu) and
that Mr Matiba is not well enough since suffering a stroke as a result of
his long detention by Mr Moi.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Political role undermines police force: The feared servants
of the state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African Police force has had a bad week.
It started with a British academic delivering a devastating indictment of
its handling of the Boipatong massacre last month. This was followed by
allegations from a prominent pathologist that the lower ranks of the police
were totally out of control and responsible for 90 per cent of deaths in
custody.
A judicial investigation into the killing of 18 people last year in Mooi
River in Natal then heard details of another grievously deficient police
investigation. To cap it all, renewed allegations of police torture surfaced
in Cape Town and there were two further deaths in police custody.
Seldom can a country's police force have had a more important role to play,
and seldom can its competence to perform this role have been more in
dispute. Yet it is this force that will have to carry the burden of
maintaining order in the week of unprecedented industrial disruption that
lies ahead.
The government has already given notice that it will not allow
demonstrations planned for next week to lead to violence. Earlier this week
it announced it was deploying an extra 5,000 troops in 14 Transvaal
townships, ostensibly to facilitate the repair of infrastructure and
services. Few observers believe, however, that the timing of the deployment
is unrelated to the general strike called by the African National Congress
for next week. The poor image of the police is not something new. Years of
enthusiastic implementation of apartheid laws did terrible damage to their
image in the black community.
Two years ago, though, it appeared a new era had dawned when, in January
1990, President F W de Klerk signalled a fundamental shift in policing
policy. 'We will not use you any longer as instruments to attain political
goals,' he said. 'This is the responsibility of politicians. We will have to
stop asking you to fight in the front trenches in the political battle. Let
the politicians look after the politics.'
The interim may have seen the police relieved of the burden of enforcing
apartheid laws, but they have still played an important role in enforcing
state authority, often between warring political factions. About a third of
the force are engaged in combating violence and unrest.
The death toll in these township clashes is high - more than 13,000 dead
since 1984. An under-reported fact, however, is the high number of police
fatalities. Last year 137 police were killed during execution of their duty
and this year that figure is already more than 120.
Radical elements of black political organisations make no effort to disguise
their hatred of the police. A poster often seen at rallies in recent weeks
has proclaimed 'Kill a cop a day'. These police victims are more likely to
be black than white. About 55 per cent of the 110,000-strong force are
non-white and the most vulnerable of all are the black police living in
townships.
The upper echelons, however, remain overwhelmingly white. The 1992 police
year book reveals an all-white general staff of 53, the vast majority of
whom are Afrikaners. It is difficult to believe these men have the will to
effect fundamental reform.
There have been efforts to change with the times. At the police training
college in Pretoria, where all basic training is done, instructors say they
put increasing emphasis on rendering service. They acknowledge that,
previously, they had allowed a 'them and us' attitude to creep into their
policing. Now the emphasis is on partnership. The police want to be seen not
as a force, but as a service, says commanding officer, Brigadier Lollo van
Vuuren.
As the events of past week show, however, there is a yawning gap between
good intentions in basic training and the grim-faced policeman which many
South Africans have grown to fear.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UN's 'humble servant' not a man to be pushed around: Boutros
Boutros Ghali's independent thinking in troubled times upsets critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEAR THE Security Council chamber at United Nations headquarters an exhibit
designed to inform tourists includes this description of the office of
secretary general: 'The most impossible, frustrating, daunting, challenging,
clearly unique job on earth.'
Like his five predecessors in the top UN post, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali
would surely agree that the adjectives are no exaggeration.
Barely seven months in office and reeling under a mounting load of problems,
not to mention criticism of his independent style of running the
organisation, he may wonder why he ever wanted to give up Egypt's
single-issue Middle East diplomacy for this.
In an extraordinary period in history, the former Egyptian deputy prime
minister has to supervise UN operations at flashpoints around the world and
try to avert other crises. Yet members continue to impose new tasks on an
over-extended organisation already showing signs of stress, and his job is
not helped by their refusal to provide finance for his extensive battery of
activities.
Cambodia, where the biggest ever UN operation is under way, is expected to
cost more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) and after only a few months is
recording a Dollars 465m shortfall. The peace-keeping effort in former
Yugoslavia is Dollars 83m in arrears and governments owe more than Dollars
910m in regular budget assessments. More than half of this is US debts.
A report yesterday said the UN was owed nearly Dollars 1.75bn in regular and
peace-keeping dues and might have to cease operations at the end of the year
without an immediate inflow of cash.
The sea of red ink has not deterred states from engaging the UN in ever more
ventures and the Security Council is now in virtual permanent session,
breaking all records this year for number of meetings held.
The secretary general can hardly be blamed if his patience is running out.
In testy mood last week he took sharp issue with the Security Council for
approving a potentially hazardous new mission for UN troops in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, requested by the EC-sponsored peace conference on
Yugoslavia chaired by Lord Carrington, claiming he had not been properly
consulted.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, in his capacity as current EC
president, made an unscheduled stop in New York on his way to the
Philippines to mollify the furious secretary general. In the end, the
disagreement was papered over and an enlarged Yugoslav peace conference, in
which the UN will play an important role, was the direct result.
Significantly, Mr Boutros Ghali stuck to his guns. He is his own man, not to
be pushed around and, he believes, entitled to express his objections
vigorously if he considers a programme for UN action to be ill conceived.
Officials have tried to minimise the affair, but many acknowledge it may be
symptomatic of basic differences between Mr Boutros Ghali and the membership
over the relative priority to be given to developing and developed
countries' problems. It may also have served as an excuse for some members
to vent pent-up grievances against a man who, not so long ago, had
proclaimed himself the council's 'humble servant' but has lately
demonstrated his independence of thought and attitude.
The row over Bosnia-Hercegovina may to some extent have grown out of his
experience at the Organisation of African Unity in Nigeria last month, where
he was repeatedly questioned about the UN's alleged 'marginalising' of
Africa under his leadership. The criticism stung. Back in New York, Mr
Boutros Ghali lectured council members for their preoccupation with what
Africans regarded as a 'war of the rich' in Europe.
Its victims appeared well fed, he observed, when compared to the harrowing
scenes on television of starving women and children fighting over a spoonful
of rice in shattered Somalia, whose sufferings he believes the UN has done
far too little to relieve. Under his goading, the Security Council this week
agreed on further measures.
But Mr Boutros Ghali's sharp comment have, in turn, upset leading western
countries, who feel such distinctions should not be made by an organisation
with a universal peace-keeping and humanitarian vocation.
A sophisticated, westernised Christian Arab, born in a palace, a millionaire
married to a millionaire, Mr Boutros Ghali has spent a long career in
international politics and diplomacy, and it shows. Ambassadors in New York
resent his going over their heads with his ready access to their leaders,
whom he does not hesitate to call with a problem to discuss. But such
intimacy could be advantageous for the UN.
In his dealings with foreign diplomats and journalists in Cairo, Mr Boutros
Ghali was considered a charmer. The UN has observed a less appealing side,
of a man who can be abrupt and dismissive of diplomats and staff alike and
who, some say, is over-confident in his own judgments.
But few fair-minded observers in New York doubt that as he develops in the
post the organisation will be well served.

<TEXT>
TALKS between China and Britain to break the deadlock over the financing for
Hong Kong's new airport ended yesterday with no agreed date for a
resumption, Reuters reports from Hong Kong.
'I'm sure that in due course we will resolve these problems, the airport
will be built,' the leader of the British negotiating team, Mr Anthony
Galsworthy, said after the meeting, the third this month. The talks were the

More than 40,000 Turkish municipal workers in five cities went on strike
yesterday after an unresolved five-month pay dispute, a union official said,
Reuter reports from Ankara. The municipalities jointly offered a 57.3 per
cent annual pay rise from March this year, against union demands of 116 per
cent. Both figures include various fringe benefits. Turkey's annual
inflation rate fell to a 12-month low of 65.8 per cent in June.

FRENCH unemployment, the main black spot in an otherwise healthy economy,
continued to rise last month, to a seasonally adjusted 2.92m, the Labour
Ministry said, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
The number out of work rose by 0.4 per cent between May and June, or by 8.9
per cent over the year, giving an unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent of the
active population.
There is a glimmer of hope that long-term unemployment might be on the
retreat. The number out of work for more than 12 months fell by 0.4 per cent
from May to June, to 934,600.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Stalingrad falls to onward march of capitalism: Leyla
Boulton accompanies western experts advising on privatisation as they enter
Stalin's hero city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER Stalingrad, site of the heroic Soviet victory over Nazi Germany,
has been chosen as the focus for a new attempt to build 'capitalism in one
city'.
It kicked off when a team of well-heeled executives from the
Washington-based International Finance Corporation (IFC) flew in by private
jet on Wednesday to sign a deal to advise on the privatisation of small
businesses in what is now called Volgograd.
Four months after turning the town of Nizhny-Novgorod into a showcase for
successful privatisation, the World Bank's private investment arm is
pursuing what its chief executive, Sir William Ryrie, calls a trend-setting
exercise, but this time on a more ambitious scale. The aim is to auction
some 600 shops, 350 restaurants and 270 service outlets in Volgograd and the
surrounding region.
The IFC is not touching the area's ailing industrial giants for now, since
eastern European experience shows that this sort of activity is much slower
to produce positive results.
On the surface, life in the 'hero city' has already changed considerably in
the past 18 months.
Underlining the demise of communist rule since the abortive coup last
August, Mr Ivan Shabunin, the regional governor, has taken over the best
office in the local government building from the ex-Communist party boss,
who is himself reported to have joined a private company by the name of
'Tsaritsa'. Mr Albert Orlov, the previous administration chief who closed
down private tomato hothouses, has also gone into business.
One of the first regions to promote private farming, Volgograd now has more
than 3,000 new farmers and cheap credit is still available to help
newcomers, thanks to generous state subsidies, according to Ms Lyudmilla
Tatokhina, chairman of the local agricultural bank.
But apart from that, the little privatisation that has taken place so far
has been messy and unpopular and Volgograd will need all the help it can get
from its IFC advisers.
'First they have to explain what privatisation is,' said Ms Elena Bocharova,
a 56-year-old accountant. 'I understand privatisation if my apartment
becomes mine, but the rest I don't have a clue about.'
The employees at Nevesta (Bride), a dressmaker's shop which was sold for
Rbs10m at Volgograd's first auction of small state businesses, have been
kept in the dark about the new owners' plans for two months.
'We've got magic hands but we can't earn money to pay ourselves because our
customers think that privatisation means we've stopped making dresses,'
complained a depressed employee.
IFC officials suggested the uncertainty at Nevesta was the sort of problem
they could help avoid in future - by switching to a system of selling
physical assets without liabilities rather than privatising going concerns.
But this approach risks attracting popular anger because workers are laid
off before a sale goes ahead, leaving it up to the new owner to decide
whether to rehire them.
Another big problem, admits Mr Yuri Chekhov, the city's mayor, is
'nomenclatura privatisation' whereby privileged officials acquire or sell
state property by crooked means. He has already fired one of his own
deputies for such practices.
'Any good idea we get from the west turns into a deformed monster in
Russia,' said Ms Julia Sablina, a young journalist who is trying to set up
her own business. 'So it will be good if the foreigners can control how
privatisation is conducted here.'
Anti-western graffiti proclaiming Russia to be 'the 51st state of the USA'
suggest that not all Volgograders share her enthusiasm.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the Russian privatisation minister, said yesterday that
vouchers entitling all citizens to acquire an unspecified amount of
privatised property free of charge would soon be ready for distribution.
The IFC published a manual on privatisation for local officials.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Russia cracks the whip over rouble zone: Moscow tells
republics of former Soviet Union they must decide soon whether to stay in or
get out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA is getting tough with the other former republics of the Soviet Union.
It is telling them they must make a choice - stay in or get out of the
rouble zone.
Nearly all the central banks of the former Soviet republics continue to use
the rouble which the Russian central bank prints, but they do not submit to
any effective discipline over rouble denominated credits, thus creating a
serious source of monetary instability.
The central bank of Ukraine, for instance, issued credits of some Rbs500bn
last month to relieve the debt burden of the country's corporations. The
effect of such transactions is to debauch the Russian currency. The Ukraine
and the Baltic republics have even taken to printing their own bank notes,
faced with the inability of the Russian mint to produce enough roubles to
cope with hyper-inflation throughout the former Soviet Union.
Russia has been reluctant to tighten discipline because an end to the credit
extended to other republics means they will not be able to pay the bills
they owe to Russian enterprises, and could result in political instability
spilling over to Russia or affecting the Russians in those republics. But it
must save its own currency, so, this month and next it will put pressure on
them to choose. If they opt out, then they must negotiate conditions for
establishing a separate currency. If they decide to stay in, they must obey
the dictates of the Russian central bank.
A survey of the republics reveal that the majority will fall into line with
Russia. This is especially so in the case of Belarus, which signed an
agreement with Russia earlier this month hailed on both sides as heralding a
new era of co-operation and explicitly providing for submission of the
Belarus central bank to Russia's.
It is also broadly the case in central Asia, where none of the five
republics - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan or Uzbekistan -
is planning its own currency in the near future. Mr Bisenchaly Tadjiyakov,
deputy governor of the Kazakh bank, says that 'if we are forced to leave, we
will be the last to do so'. Mr Nazar Shaparov, president of the Turkmen
state bank, says: 'We plan to stay in for some time.'
None of this means forever, nor that they are happy. When Mr Alexander
Shokhin, Russia's deputy premier, toured central Asia last week to discuss
the rouble zone, he found that his hosts expected their meagre supply of
roubles to increase by next month at the latest. Mr Shikmatulla Yunusov, the
central bank chairman in Uzbekistan, says coupons will be introduced to make
up for the rouble deficiency, which has meant no pay for many Uzbeks for
some months.
'Our people are patient,' he says, hopefully. They will have to be. Mr
Georgy Khizha, another Russian deputy premier, said recently the Russian
central bank could not possibly make good the rouble deficit by August.
Of the three Caucasian states, only Azerbaijan says it will introduce its
own currency, the manat, supposedly from August 15, under a decree signed
last week by President Abulfaz Elchibey (though it is unclear how far it
will be a coupon, how far a genuinely separate currency). However, Aermenia
has no plans for a new currency yet, says Mr Ashot Salmazaryan, head of the
Finance Ministry's monetary department, and would only bring one in if the
cash shortage grew critical.
More surprisingly, Georgia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of
Independent is will also not rushing to introduce its own currency. Mr
Nuzgar Shegeladze, vice-president of the state bank, said a commission had
been set up to study the issue, but he noted that the IMF and the World Bank
had both advised against.
For the three Baltic states, however, independence includes the currency,
too. Estonia already has the kroon, the first real separate currency, having
negotiated an exit from the rouble zone with the Russians last month. Latvia
last week introduced the rublis, which presently trades against the dollar
at a rate a little lower than the Russian rouble. Only Lithuania is
uncertain. Its former prime minister, Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, said that the
lit would be introduced from August 1, but his government fell last week.
Moldova, racked with military concerns and with government turbulence until
the recent partial ceasefire, has not carried out a decision made last
January to introduce the lei as a national currency (the lei is also the
name of the Romanian currency) and is not expected to do so soon.
This leaves Ukraine. Officially, the hryvnia is to be introduced in August
or September, a strategy confirmed by President Leonid Kravchuk in Paris
last month. Mr Alexander Yemelyanov, the chief economic adviser, says the
quicker Ukraine gets out of the rouble zone the better since the price
liberalisation strategy followed by the Russian government is inappropriate
for a state which does not export oil and therefore does not benefit from
putting prices up to world market levels.
There are doubts, however, that the new currency can be introduced in time -
while the coupon, which has replaced the rouble in many retail transactions,
is now trading significantly below the Russian rouble, giving ordinary
citizens a bad experience of their 'own currency'.
Meanwhile the roubles status in foreign exchange terms is fraught with
problems. At present, enterprises can buy foreign currency at the central
bank's currency exchange which gathers twice a week, and where the main
restriction is the limited offering of hard currency.
Citizens can, in principle, go to any bank and buy up to Dollars 500 at the
market rate if they want to travel abroad, while some private stores are
beginning to sell goods either for dollars or for roubles at the
corresponding market rate.
But the Russian currency has a long way to go before it becomes convertible
in the sense that people trust it sufficiently to hold it for any period of
time or to conclude significant contracts in roubles.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Honecker homecoming may reopen old wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday washed his hands of Mr Erich Honecker and
suggested others do the same. The political work was done, he said. The
former communist leader of East Germany had been delivered into the arms of
the law. Politicians had no further cause to be involved.
Not so much a warning, more a sigh of relief after months of uncertainty,
the chancellor's sparse comments were matched by restrained reactions from
all parties. The most expressive response, reflecting popular concerns only
belatedly taken up by politicians, came from Mr Wolfgang Botsch, a senior
member of the Christian Social Union.
'The charge that the little people hang while the big ones go free is
disproved,' he said.
Such accusations surfaced during the trial of four former East German border
guards who had implemented Mr Honecker's alleged shoot-to-kill policy
against East Germans fleeing west.
The trial could last two years or longer. Some commentators suggested the
court case could help clear the air and ease the suspicions and
superstitions still clouding relations between the people of eastern and
western Germany, others felt it could make matters worse.
Airing crimes and antagonisms which most people would rather forget - if
yesterday's popular reactions are any guide - could reopen old wounds and
slow the already sluggish process of healing and unification.
The possibility of Mr Honecker implicating others, westerners as well as
easterners, in the alleged misdeeds of himself and his administration was
widely discounted in Bonn yesterday. But the risk remains that his testimony
could embroil the government in controversy.
Among the general public, the most common preoccupation among the young on
both sides of the country yesterday was the potential cost of a protracted
trial. In sum: Mr Honecker should have been left in Moscow with his
memories.
However, some older groups, particularly in the east, suggested the trial
would demonstrate where the real guilt lay and relieve them of lingering
feelings of guilt by association. A recent poll in the east showed 50 per
cent wanted him brought back for trial, compared with 40 per cent in the
west.
Demands for revenge were rare. Even though Mr Honecker faces a maximum term
of 15 years' jail on the manslaughter charges alone, a taste of his own
medicine was considered a more fitting punishment for the 79-year-old,
already deprived of the companionship of his wife, Margot, who flew into
exile in Chile yesterday. 'They should put him in one of those little flats
he gave us and give him the pension we had,' said one elderly woman in
Chemnitz.

<TEXT>
CONCERN is growing in the Philippines that failure to meet money supply
targets could cut off access to much-needed International Monetary Fund
stand-by facilities.
The IMF, which last February resumed a stand-by credit facility to Manila,
wants the government to keep to its money supply targets, exceeded since
May. Failure to do this will halt Philippine drawdowns on the last tranche
of the stand-by facility, and could freeze transactions under the Dollars
4.8bn debt restructuring package signed with the commercial bank creditors
on Friday in London.
Also, official credit, particularly from Japan, the country's main donor, is
now linked to Manila's adherence to the IMF programme.
However, Mr Ramon del Rosario, the finance secretary, and Mr Jose Cuisia,
governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, yesterday expressed
confidence that the IMF ceilings would be met through the increase in
Treasury-bill floats starting this weekend.
Mr Cuisia acknowledged that currency in circulation had surged since May,
thanks to rises in foreign-exchange remittances and in foreign investments
in the local stock market. Government spending also rose during May, pushing
the budget deficit above another IMF ceiling.

</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S new government has warned that a freeze on new building in Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories will also curb economic growth in
the short term and delay a fall in unemployment, currently running at a
record 11.5 per cent, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The Labour-led coalition which took power this month is committed to
shifting resources from the territories to Israel 'proper' and increasing
infrastructural investment in an attempt to generate high growth sufficient
to cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union.
A freeze on 6,000 settlement housing units, and restrictions on construction
within Israel, are a first step towards implementing this policy. This week,
the government has also taken steps to rescind government incentives from
industrial plants in Jewish settlements.
The actions are expected to help secure Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees
Israel wants to finance immigration absorption. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister, and Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, have both
warned that a short-term effect will be to limit growth.
Mr Shochat told parliament's finance committee that gross national product
in 1993 was unlikely to grow significantly. 'The fruits in employment and
investment will be seen in 1994-95,' he said.
The Vatican and Israel yesterday pledged to work towards diplomatic ties in
an historic first step that could end decades of chilly relations between
the Roman Catholic Church and the Jewish state, Reuter reports from Vatican
City.
The Vatican said it did not expect negative reaction to the move from
Palestinians and other Arabs because Middle East peace talks had made it
easier to take the step. The Vatican has set up a high-level permanent
commission with Israel aimed at establishing diplomatic ties with the Jewish
state, which was born in 1948.

THE African National Congress (ANC) yesterday warned that South African
security force members who assault people in their custody face prosecution
under 'a future democratic government'.
The warning follows a pathologist's accusation at the weekend that police
had killed scores of detainees in recent years. Since the claim, a further
two men in police custody have died, one in a police station.
The police came in for further criticism this week when the Goldstone
commission of inquiry into political violence said the force had failed
effectively to prosecute perpetrators of violence on black commuter trains.
The commission said it had been unable to say who had been responsible for
the killings, adding that 'victims were members of various black ethnic
groups'.
The police, meanwhile, launched a 'peace offensive' yesterday to restore
their authority in black townships around Johannesburg.
Mr Hernus Kriel, the law and order minister, said 5,000 police and troops
would take part in the 'stabilisation' operation in 16 townships.
Some of these are sliding into anarchy. Between July 1991 and April this
year, 138 people have been killed and 261 injured.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy visiting South Africa, yesterday held talks
with Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, and later toured Boipatong, the
township where 42 residents were massacred last month.
Mr Vance returns to New York tomorrow.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has outlawed the establishment of an elite list of
top brands of scent which could restrict competition in the distribution of
luxury perfumes.
But at the same time Brussels has underlined its basic approval of the way
in which high-prestige, image-driven perfumes are sold in the EC through
selected distributors.
The Commission yesterday redefined the system operated by Parfums Givenchy,
the French luxury scent company.
Its investigation found that Givenchy was preventing its distributors from
stocking competing brands which were not on a list drawn up by the
manufacturer.
The practice could have restricted the prestige market to an elite dozen or
so brands, but Givenchy and its competitors will now have to delete such
clauses from their distribution contracts.
Under a deal with the Commission, Givenchy cannot prevent new distributors
from joining the network except on quality grounds, such as their location
or the cleanliness of the store.
The Commission has also outlawed contract clauses which set unreasonably
high sales requirements, and restrict the sale of perfumes between
authorised retailers.
EC competition rules allow luxury perfume to be sold through selected
distributors.

ARMENIAN fighters in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh have
recaptured several villages and killed about 100 Azerbaijani troops,
Armenian reports said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow.
The Armenian side suffered six dead and 16 wounded over the last two days
while recapturing five villages in the Mardakert district of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the reports said.
In addition, three people were killed and two wounded in Azerbaijani
shelling of two Armenian villages before dawn yesterday, the reports said.
The Azerbaijani losses in the fighting are said to have consisted of no less
than 100 troops.
There was no comment from the Azerbaijani side.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan unilaterally freed 19 Armenian hostages who were flown
yesterday from the capital of Baku to Tbilisi in Georgia. Russian television
said Azerbaijan was hoping for a reciprocal Armenian gesture.
Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been fighting for four years for control
over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Christian Armenian region within the
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan.
Reuter adds from Rome: A new round of peace talks to seek an end to fighting
in Nagorno-Karabakh will start in Rome tomorrow, the Italian foreign
ministry said.
The statement by Italy, which is chairing the 11-nation talks, said the
latest round would run from July 31 to August 4.
A third round of Rome talks, which was meant to pave the way for a
fully-fledged peace conference under the auspices of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe in Minsk, ended in stalemate early this
month.
'The Italian presidency expects that the round. . . will lay the concrete
bases for a real end to hostilities in the region and to remove the
obstacles which have until now prevented the calling of the Minsk peace
conference,' the statement said.
Russian peace-keeping forces yesterday began deploying in Trans Dnestr. The
secessionist region of eastern Moldova, with a Slavic majority, has been
seeking independence from Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, AP
reports.
The peace-keepers flew in under an accord signed by presidents Boris Yeltsin
of Russia and Mircea Snegur of Moldova last week in an effort to end the
fighting which has killed more than 600 people since March.
Last week's peace accord grants Trans Dnestr a special status within
Moldova.

FT  30 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery aided by company results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market, inspired by the newfound strength of Wall Street,
followed other European bourses yesterday to register one of the best daily
rises since the dramatic session which followed the re-election of Britain's
Conservative government in April this year.
In the City of London, telephone wires were on full alert as traders asked
one another if yesterday's rise of 49.8, taking the FT-SE Index well above
the 2,400 mark once again and making a recovery of 3.2 per cent since Monday
night, meant that the bear market in UK stocks was finally over.
Good, or at least satisfactory, trading results from a number of well-known
UK companies supported hopes that the painfully drawn-out recession in UK
industry may be at last reaching its close. Technical factors were also
favourable, with a leading UK investment bank buying both the stock index
future and the underlying blue chips. Stock index futures traders were
cheered by the first two-day uptick since May 8 in the Footsie September
future contract, which ended at a good premium.
The overnight gain of nearly 52 points on the Dow Industrial Average in New
York set the stage for a strong opening in London. The Footsie was ahead
23.9 within minutes to challenge the 2,400 level which, after a brief pause
for consolidation of the early gains, was convincingly broken at
mid-morning.
The upward pace was encouraged by trading figures from BAT Industries and BT
(formerly British Telecom). Improvement at its Eagle Star insurance
subsidiary helped BAT, as well as the rest of the insurance sector, while BT
gained ground after reporting better results than expected.
London's optimism, supported by gains across the range of European stock
markets, was soon further increased by Wall Street opening its new session
with a gain of 37 points on the Dow.
By the close of business, the FT-SE Index was 49.8 up at 2,423.2, a shade
below the best of the session. Seaq trading volume improved significantly to
566.1m shares. Tuesday's Seaq total of 446m shares reflected retail, or
customer, business in equities worth only Pounds 817m, still an unexciting
figure for the London market.
The day's trend was obscured by the activity in stock index futures, as well
as by at least two large trading programmes in the equity market itself.
BZW, which took on substantial blocks of both Footsie and non-Footsie stocks
on Monday in payment for Wellcome shares, was believed to be busy in stock
index futures, and may have sold stock into the equity market as well.
However, a large buy programme moved across the trading screens just after
3pm.
Traders on the London stock market will be watching closely this morning
when ICI discloses its interim trading results. Strategists have long argued
that company results will provide the first reliable signs of economic
recovery in the UK, but have not expected to see these appear before the end
of next month. Some warned yesterday that the market's current rally was
driven to some extent by oversold positions.

FT  30 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market pleased with BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECOVERY in Eagle Star's insurance business helped to lift the shares of
parent BAT Industries by 22 to 756p yesterday. Turnover was strong at 6.5m
shares.
Second quarter losses at Eagle Star were cut to Pounds 47m from Pounds 175m
as the first quarter's improvement in the level of provisions required for
repossessions in the housing market was maintained. Nevertheless, chairman
Sir Patrick Sheehy said: 'Continuing uncertainty over the UK economy is a
cause for concern.'
After raising the interim dividend to 14.6p from 13.4p, Sir Patrick
commented that 'this is consistent with our commitment to sustained dividend
growth significantly in excess of the rate of inflation, and is a rate of
increase that I expect to at least be maintained'.
Growth in exports was the 'most exciting' aspect of tobacco performance.
Cigarette exports increased by 20 per cent and now account for a fifth of
group cigarette sales.
Tate &amp; Lyle hit
Profits downgrades hit Tate &amp; Lyle, as the market showed increasing concern
about overcapacity in production of the corn syrup sweetener used in soft
drinks such as cola. Staley, T &amp; L's US subsidiary, could be severely
affected by this problem, according to analysts.
The shares weakened 11 to 293p on turnover of 2.8m after Hoare Govett
lowered its profits forecast for the year to September to Pounds 210m from
Pounds 235m, followed by cuts from several other brokers. Mr Carl Short,
food analyst at Nomura, said that acting on a worst case assumption he is
trimming the 1991/92 forecast to Pounds 207.5m from Pounds 232m. Last year's
profits figure was Pounds 234.6m.
Properties weak
While the equity market shone for a second day, the maligned property sector
took another knock as BZW reduced its net asset values (nav) for nearly all
the leading stocks, arguing that property values will decline further this
year and fall again in 1993.
While the reduction is based on the dimming signs of economic recovery, BZW
also believes that a sharp fall in tenant enquiries since mid-May points to
'the dismal prospect of declining rents well into 1993'. As a result, the
house's forecast of an average 8 per cent nav decline for this year is
changed to 10 per cent, and the 5 per cent rise for 1993 has been altered to
a 6 per cent fall.
All of the leading property stocks suffered on the BZW downgrades. British
Land dipped 6 to 168p, Land Securities 3 to 373p and MEPC 10 to 243p.
Hammerson was further undermined as talk in the market suggested that the
group may soon be in breach of its covenants. The shares tumbled 19 to 239p.
Holiday blow
News that Airtours was considering dropping holidays to Euro Disney from its
brochure came as a further blow to the Paris theme park, already reeling
from poor attendance figures, forecasts of interim losses and the need to
reduce its prices for winter.
Airtours blamed its decision on lack of demand, although more cynical
observers pointed out that Euro Disney is about to start negotiations over
its new price structure with British tour operators and sugg-ested spoiling
tactics by the UK tour group. Euro Disney declined 20 to 940p.
Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said he remains a seller of Euro Disney even at
this level, arguing that high costs and low margins will probably mean the
company making losses for the next two years.
Meanwhile, other holiday groups continued to bask in the general sentiment
that bookings have picked up. Airtours climbed 22 to 253p, Eurocamp 8 to
324p and Owners Abroad 3 1/2 to 80p.
First quarter figures, well down on those of the comparable period last year
but significantly higher than expected by market analysts, saw BT
aggressively bought and finally 13 higher at 346p. Turnover in the 'old'
shares reached 15m, well above usual levels. This was also boosted by a
single deal of 5.8m shares traded at 346 1/2 p as part of a programme trade,
and another single trade of 3.2m shares. The partly-paid stock was also well
supported, closing 12 ahead at 244p on turnover of 8.8m.
The transatlantic battle in BP shares flared up again as one of the big US
brokerages, believed to be PaineWebber, was said to have moved in as a heavy
buyer. Many UK broking concerns have been keen sellers of BP amid worries
that the group may cut the quarterly dividend by up to 50 per cent when it
announces figures a week from today.
The US buyers had the upper hand for much of the session, driving BP to a
closing level of 216 1/2 p for a net gain of 8 1/2 p, a significant
outperformance among the Footsie stocks.
Turnover was a hefty 19m shares, a figure boosted by a series of large
trades, including a block of 4.2m at 214 3/4 p, as part of a programme
trade, and a line of 2.2m traded at 216p.
Lasmo shares, among the market's most volatile counters in recent weeks,
blew hot and cold after the group revealed half-time figures. Worries over
the interim dividend had brought heavy downside pressure recently.
However, the interim payout was maintained and profits were better than
expected, sufficient reasons to bolster the share price, which initially
raced up to 140p, before slipping back to 131 1/2 and closed a penny up at
134p. Turnover was a heavy 7.5m shares.
Some of the company's severest critics said it had put on a brave face in
maintaining the dividend but had hit the balance sheet at the expense of the
profit and loss account.
'These figures may look very good superficially, but that does not change
the underlying weak fundamentals of the company,' said one oil analyst.
Bank shares performed well, and were led up by Lloyds, which kicks off the
interim results season tomorrow. The shares rose 10 to 419p on 4.4m traded.
NatWest was also heavily supported, closing 8 better at 330p on 6.5m. The
recent buy note from one of the London market's most influential securities
houses lifted HSBC 8 more to 338p on very heavy turnover of 11m.
Lloyds Abbey Life delivered one of the poorest performances in the Footsie
list, the shares sliding 10, or 2.8 per cent, to 345p after disappointing
interim figures and, more importantly according to the market, poor new
business figures.
Wall Street buying helped Glaxo, the shares racing ahead 19 to 730p.

FT  30 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYERS returned to the stock index futures as both technical and market
factors combined to cause a surge in a busy session, writes Christopher
Price.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened weakly, at 2,399, as traders were
lulled into believing that Tuesday's bounce in the market was a technical
one and that yesterday promised a corresponding downturn. But the strong
equities market was quickly underpinned by a big order from BZW, which
became the signal for other buyers to take advantage of what had been a
sellers' market.
September began to race ahead, tranforming a 10-point fair value discount to
a similar premium within half-an-hour. Many of the small independent traders
were said to be caught short by the buying binge, as were some larger
houses.
The contract continued to be squeezed up into the afternoon session and a
strong Wall Street helped sentiment. September closed at 2,445, up 58 from
its previous finish and around a 10-point premium to its fair value of
around 12.
In traded options, turnover was a brisk 28,240 contracts, a third up from
Tuesday's total. British Airways led the stock options on 1,243 contracts
dealt, with the October 300 series featuring.

Wall Street
SHARP rally in US equities continued yesterday after their summer torpor as
the drop in long-term bond yields at home and stronger overseas markets
boosted sentiment, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The bond yields showed a further fall early in the session, but finished
little changed on the day. This did not discourage the stock market,
however, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 45.12 higher at 3,379.19
for a two-day surge of 97 points.
New York SE turnover reached a heavy 276m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
moved ahead 4.71 to 422.23, breaching its previous record high of 420.77 set
on January 15, while the Nasdaq composite added 5.86 at 577.49.
The month is threatening to give investors whiplash. The Dow entered July on
a strong note by climbing 35.58 to 3,354.10 on July 1, but by July 22 the
index had retreated to 3,277.61 and it held at depressed levels before the
latest buying frenzy started to drive prices forward.
This week's rally has been fed by tumbling long-term interest rates, which
has triggered a flow of funds into equities. In addition, the drop in
interest rates should stimulate activity in the housing market in the coming
months.
Eastman Kodak climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 43 5/8 after a delayed
opening. The photographic equipment manufacturer posted better than expected
second quarter earnings of Dollars 1.11 a share after Tuesday's close.
Car issues were actively traded for a second day following Chrysler's
unexpectedly strong second quarter earnings. Chrysler headed towards a
52-week high in morning trading but ended the day Dollars  1/4 down at
Dollars 21 1/2 after adding Dollars 1 5/8 on Tuesday. The company posted net
income of Dollars 178m for the quarter against a loss of Dollars 212m a year
earlier.
Results were less rosy at Ford, which unveiled second quarter net earnings
of Dollars 502.4m, or 93 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 323.5m, or
68 cents, a year ago. The earnings were below expectations of about 99 cents
a share, but analysts noted that a higher than expected tax charge cut into
Ford's profits. Its shares slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 .
Bristol-Myers Squibb climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 69 on news that the
big pharmaceuticals company plans to sell its Drackett household products
business, which makes Drano and Windex. In addition, an analyst at Brown
Brothers reinstated a 'buy' rating on the stock.
Wang Laboratories fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 1 7/8 on the American Stock
Exchange following press reports that the embattled computer company might
violate some debt covenants when it reports its results for the fourth
quarter ended June 30.
Canada
TORONTO was inclined to move higher in response to gains on most other world
markets, but the rise was limited by weakness in the gold and transportation
sectors.
The TSE 300 index put on 13.1 to 3,424.6 as rises led declines by 275 to
244. Volume came to 31.2m shares.
PWA fell for the second day, losing CDollars 1.87 to CDollars 2.08, after
touching CDollars 1.55, in volume of 2.8m shares on nervousness about its
merger talks with Air Canada, off 18 cents at CDollars 4.95.

FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: A theory to tackle short-termism -
Investors should manage their acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American institutional investors should buy bigger stakes in fewer
corporations and play major roles in the management of their acquisitions.
So goes the new thinking on tackling the root causes of 'short-termism'  -
the American business practice often cited as a key to declining US
competitiveness. The latest exponent is Mr Michael Porter, a professor at
Harvard Business School, who directed a study of US investment.*
Mr Porter argues that investment behaviour of pension funds, mutual funds
and insurance companies - which in 1990 held 60 per cent of total US equity
 -produces a destructive emphasis on quarterly and annual returns. To
minimise risk and maximise profit, institutions shift funds from one company
to another, looking for the quick kill. They hold stocks on average for less
than two years.
This behaviour pressures corporate managers to produce measurable short-term
returns. When budgeting projects for investment, too many overlook 'soft
asset' investments, such as employee training and R &amp; D, whose benefits
accrue slowly over time but are sorely needed to ensure a company's
long-term competitive position.
The process is self-defeating. Mr Porter says institutional investors 'are
trapped in a system that undermines the long-term earning power of the
American companies on which they must ultimately depend for the bulk of
their portfolio investments'.
The first step towards change is to make large investors active and informed
owners: with board seats and access to 'inside' information, they would hold
a stake in a company's future prosperity.
At the same time, corporate managers must be encouraged to plan for the long
term: one suggested reform ties incentive pay to improving a company's
competitive position. Only then would the goals of owners and managers be
aligned.
Sounds good, but many practitioners doubt that either the government or
investors will swallow such a strong palliative. Fund managers cherish the
ability to 'get out the door fast in a messy situation', says Mr John
Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. Active involvement in
corporate governance is 'difficult, complicated and expensive'.
At Boston's Fidelity Investments, America's largest mutual fund house which
juggles Dollars 65bn of stock, the group's Dollars 19.75bn Fidelity Magellan
fund's latest portfolio turnover rate was 132 per cent, ahead of the
national average which, now at 93 per cent, has risen steadily over the
decade. If it started buying larger stakes in fewer companies (and then had
to monitor them) the company says it would be less safe and less liquid.
Labour groups are worried that asking pension funds to make riskier
investments - Mr Porter thinks they should be allowed to own up to 20 per
cent of a company, against 10 per cent the law currently permits - could
undermine the security of the pension fund members. 'Prudent investment
policy requires diversified investment,' says Mr Howard Samuel, president of
the Industrial Union Department at the AFL-CIO, the US trade union
co-ordinating body.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fears of intervention remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR recovered ground against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday
as fears of central bank intervention continued to keep the US currency off
its lows, writes James Blitz.
On a quiet day of trading, with almost no corporate activity, the dollar
rose a pfennig from its previous close to DM1.4840. Fears that the Federal
Reserve might intervene in the market to keep the dollar from falling below
DM1.45 continued to push the dollar higher. The currency was also boosted by
rallies in the US bond and equity markets.
Rumours about US and German policy towards the dollar continued to affect
the market. A suggestion circulated during the afternoon that Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, was planning a statement that Germany
did not want to see the dollar lower. Although the statement never
materialised, it did help the dollar break resistance at DM1.4750. In New
York the US unit eased back from the London close to end at DM1.4815.
The dollar's rise against European currencies meant that the yen had a
better day's trading against the D-Mark. The Japanese currency had fallen
back in recent days, following the Bank of Japan's decision to cut its
discount rate by  1/2 percentage point. Dealers also said the market is
starting to turn its attention to the possibility of BoJ intervention
directly in D-Mark/yen trading, which could limit D-Mark strength in coming
days.
The yen closed at Y86.22 against the D-Mark, up from a previous Y86.53.
Against the dollar, the yen was softer at Y128.00 compared with Y127.50
previously, but in New York firmed to Y127.81.
Sterling finished slightly firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.8450, after a
previous close of DM2.8430. However, the pound's divergence from the
strongest currency in the EMS grid, the Portuguese escudo, led to
suggestions that the Bank of Portugal had intervened in the market, buying
sterling, to keep the two currencies within their permitted divergence of
6.18 percentage points.
That intervention could not be confirmed yesterday. But one head of foreign
exchange at an investment bank said the UK authorities could become
concerned by the widening differential between the pound and the Spanish
peseta. Yesterday the differential was at 5.93 percentage points.
The Italian lira rallied against the D-Mark yesterday morning after the
Italian parliament approved by an ample majority the government's measures
to cut the budget deficit. The resignation of the foreign trade minister 28
days into the Italian government's life had a negative effect on the
currency in the afternoon, but the lira closed at L755.4 to the D-Mark, up
from L756.2.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Period rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERIOD rates in the sterling cash market ended firmer yesterday, due to
end-of-month pressures on the market and sterling's indifferent performance
on foreign exchanges.
At the month's end, commercial banks and discount houses need to show
liquidity in their books in order to comply with the requirements of the
Bank of England and the credit-rating agencies. Few bills were therefore
offered to the market yesterday, and the short rates remained firm. By the
day's end, one-week money was offered at 10 1/8 per cent from a previous
close of 10 per cent, while the one -month stayed unchanged at 10 3/16 per
cent offered.
Rates from 3-months out to one-year also firmed, with nothing to take
dealers' minds off anxieties that the Bundesbank might lift the Lombard rate
from its current 9 3/4 per cent when its council next meets. All these rates
ended at 10 3/8 per cent from a previous close of 10 5/16 per cent.
Sterling futures were bearish in the morning as sterling hovered nervously
around DM2.8430. Dealers were particularly concerned that the gap in the
European Monetary System's grid between sterling and its nearest competitor,
the Italian lira, has now widened to 2.70 per cent. The September short
sterling contract dropped 6 basis points to a low of 89.64, but rallied in
the afternoon to close unchanged at 89.70.
December short sterling also dropped 4 basis points to a low of 89.85 in the
morning, but performed more bullishly than the September contract in the
afternoon after an American investment bank put in a large order for the
contract at 89.87. The contract closed 5 basis points up on the day at
89.94.
The Bank of England's operations in the discount market reflected the
paucity of bills on offer. The Bank operated at the established rates of 9
7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase
agreement (repo), repayable on August 18 and 19.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 50m in the repo, revised the
shortage to Pounds 1.15bn, and purchased Pounds 15m in Band 1, Pounds 72m in
Band 2 and Pounds 102m in the repo. The forecast was then revised to Pounds
1.2bn. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 354m in Band 1, Pounds
69m in Band 2 and Pounds 50m in the repo. The Bank provided late assistance
of Pounds 335m.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Swaps markets losses total
0.115% of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE credit quality of coun-terparties in swap transactions remains high,
according to the International Swap Dealers Association, which published a
study yesterday showing that cumulative losses among a large proportion of
dealers in the swaps market totalled just Dollars 358m, 0.115 per cent of
the notional principal amount of outstanding contracts.
The survey, carried out by Arthur Anderson, was conducted among ISDA
members, who account for about 70 per cent of the Dollars 4,300bn swaps
market. 'More than 90 per cent of the swap transactions in the port folios
surveyed were with investment grade counterparties. This confirms the
traditional high credit quality of swap counterparties,' said Mr Akira
Watanabe of Mitsubishi Bank, vice-chairman of ISDA.
UK local authorities were the source of almost 50 per cent of the Dollars
358m of net losses. Other categories of counterparties representing net
losses were companies (26 per cent), non-dealer financial institutions (17
per cent), and US savings and loans institutions (6 per cent).
The report may help the association's fight in the US against attempts to
move over-the-counter swaps and options business on to regulated exchanges,
and bolster ISDA's argument against calls for greater regulatory control of
over-the-counter derivatives business.
Some bank regulators have expressed concern that over-the-counter
derivatives business is increasing the level of risk undertaken by banks.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Long bond surrenders earlier advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE benchmark 30-year US government bond yesterday morning briefly hit a
high for the year before giving up all of its gains in afternoon trading as
profit-taking and an unimpressive five-year note auction took their toll on
prices.
In late trading, the long bond eased  1/32 to 106 5/8 , yielding 7.435 per
cent after soaring to 107 23/32 in morning trading on top of its one-point
gain on Tuesday.
Movement was less dramatic at the short end of the yield curve, where the
two-year note was quoted  1/32 higher to yield 4.25 per cent after adding
about  1/8 at mid-day.
The long end of the yield curve led the market through most of the day,
reflecting the long bond's renewed popularity with investors after several
weeks of lagging shorter-dated maturities.
The morning excitement was generated by Tuesday's consumer confidence
report, which fell to 61.0 in July from 72.6 the previous months. Although
most analysts had expected a modest decline in the index, the
larger-than-expected drop prompted renewed speculation that interest rates
might fall even further.
However, a disappointing auction of Dollars 10.51bn in five-year notes
depressed prices. Although the average yield was in line with expectations
at 5.56 per cent, there was some surprise that 45 per cent was allocated at
the 5.57 per cent stop rate.
Enthusiasm was dampened by forecasts of a drop in initial US jobless claims
of about 11,000 for the week ended July 18.
The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market. Fed Funds
were quoted at 3 1/16 per cent in late trading.
THE Italian government bond futures contract tumbled late in the afternoon
following news that Mr Vicenzo Scotti, the Italian foreign minister, had
resigned.
The Italian bond market, which had witnessed a relatively quiet day until
the resignation announcement, was likely to remain in a volatile state,
dealers warned. The futures contract traded in a range of 92.60-92.85, but
fell back to 92.15 on the news.
THE UK government bond market is continuing to focus on funding concerns as
speculation mounts over when the Bank of England will announce its next
auction of stock.
Dealers believe the Bank will make an announcement by Friday week, targeting
either the far end or the medium area of the gilt market.
The money supply figures released yesterday showed a significant pick-up in
overseas buying of gilts in June, leading to speculation that the Bank could
choose a 10-year auction stock as this maturity is more likely to appeal to
foreign investors. Net sales to overseas investors jumped from Pounds 378m
in May to Pounds 726m in June. Net sales to domestic investors fell from
Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 936m.
The futures market ended little changed with the Liffe contract, which
opened at 98.02, trading at 98.03 by late afternoon. In the cash market,
long-dated gilt prices drifted lower with the 9 per cent gilt due 2008
falling from 100 3/4 to 100 19/32 .
FRENCH government bonds saw a sharp sell-off on fears about the referendum
on the Maastricht treaty. Most of the losses were recouped by late
afternoon, and the Matif futures contract ended at 105.48 after opening at
105.40.
The futures contract had fallen as low as 105.18, but dealers described the
sell-off as rather exaggerated.
GERMAN government bonds opened on a weak note and moved in a narrow range
with the Liffe bund futures contract trading between 87.22 and 87.40. The
futures contract ended at 87.37, slightly up on Tuesday's close.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied early yesterday, but the gains were wiped
out by profit-taking later on. This left the cash and futures markets
slightly lower on the day.
The market opened on a firm note, helped by the strength of the US Treasury
bond market overnight. The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield of 4.87
per cent, moving to 4.865 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 4.905 per
cent.
In the futures market, the September contract climbed from its opening of
105.15 to a high of 105.23, but later fell back to close at 105.06 on
reasonably high volume.
Short-term interest rates continued to slip, with the rate on three-month
certificates of deposit nudging down from 4.03 per cent to 4.00 per cent.

<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second largest US steel manufacturer, yesterday
reported increased second-quarter net losses and warned it expected to
remain in the red in the third quarter.
The company reported net losses of Dollars 64m, or 92 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 29m, or 46 cents a share, in the same period of last
year, on net sales of Dollars 1.0bn, down from Dollars 1.1bn. The results,
which included a Dollars 25m litigation contingency charge, were in line
with a previous warning by the company.
Bethlehem said it expected a moderate improvement in steel demand for the
balance of 1992. An expected improvement in the economy, higher levels of
steel demand and remedies against unfair steel imports should provide
opportunities for improved results later this year and in 1993, it added.

COMPAQ Computer, the US computer manufacturer in the throes of a strategy
change, is selling its 20 per cent equity stake in Conner Peripherals back

Compaq will book a pre-tax gain of about Dollars 80m on the transaction and

Compaq made a Dollars 6m investment in Conner when the computer peripherals
group was founded in 1986 and made an additional Dollars 6m investment later
that year. Conner will buy Compaq's 11.6m shares for Dollars 20 3/4 each.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief executive, said he expected the
company's strong strategic relationship with Conner to continue.

Cement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIAM Cement, the Thai conglomerate and largest cement producer in the
country, yesterday announced a fall in consolidated net profits to Bt2.62bn
(Dollars 103.3m) in the first half of 1992 from Bt2.81bn a year earlier,
although sales rose marginally to Bt26.02bn from Bt25.80bn.
The company blamed the fall in profits on heavy investment spending on new
projects, including several embryonic petrochemicals plants. Consolidated
earnings per share fell to Bt22.08 from Bt23.64.
By contrast the unconsolidated results - comprising the core business of
cement and construction materials - showed a marked improvement. In the
second quarter, net profits rose to Bt1.53bn from Bt1.04bn, giving first
half profits of Bt2.54bn against Bt2.02bn and earnings per share of Bt21.21
against Bt16.85.
Cement output in Thailand is expected to exceed demand from 1993, but Siam
Cement's margins are improving as the company expands its own production
facilities to supply the Thai cement market from abroad.
Although the construction sector's growth is likely to slow in the next few
months, long-term demand for cement should be supported by the start of
several big infrastructure projects in Bangkok, including multi-billion
dollar elevated road and rail systems.
Thai cement producers have also benefited from relatively low energy prices
and the falling cost of borrowing.
Siam Cement shares rose Bt10 to Bt520 on the Thai stock market yesterday.
Siam Cement yesterday announced a joint venture with Furukawa Battery of
Japan to produce car and motorcycle batteries in Thailand for the domestic
market and also for export to Japan, Europe and Australia.
CHAROEN Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the Bangkok listed agri-industrial and
aquaculture company of the multinational CP group, yesterday announced a
modest rise in second-quarter net profits to Bt293.08m (Dollars 11.56m) from
Bt283.23m on barely changed revenue of Bt2.7bn, writes Victor Mallet.
First-half net profits amounted to Bt596.6m, in line with expectations,
compared with Bt486.4m in the same period last year.
Half-year earnings per share rose to Bt4.97 from Bt4.05.
CPF has long been viewed with caution by foreign stockbrokers because of the
complex links between the CP group's public and private companies, but it
has disclosed tentative plans to simplify its entire structure by making CPF
the core agri-industrial company and buying out minority shareholders of
Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products and Charoen Pokphand Northeastern, CPF's
two listed subsidiaries.
'We just don't want to confuse our investors,' said Mr Prasertsak
Ongwattanakul, who acts as a spokesman for the CP group.
In the past three years CPF's sales of prawn feed and prawns have grown from
nothing to reach two thirds of the company's consolidated turnover.
The business is vulnerable to price fluctuations and pollution, but margins
are high.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Du Pont lifts underlying profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company, managed a 3 per cent rise in the
level of its underlying second-quarter net profits.
Although the company's Dollars 440m net income for the quarter was 19.9 per
cent down year-on-year, the profits were actually 3 per cent higher when
extraordinary items were subtracted from the quarterly figures this year and
last.
The 1992 second quarter included a previously announced Dollars 134m
one-time charge for additional costs related to the recall of its Benlate DF
fungicide.
Earnings per share were 65 cents for the quarter, against 81 cents a year
ago. For the first six months of 1992 earnings per share were Dollars 1.36
against Dollars 1.69 in the same period last year.
Revenues in the second quarter were Dollars 9.8bn, an increase of 4 per cent
after adjustments to reflect a new coal venture accounted for under the
equity method.
Combined sales for chemicals, fibres, polymers and diversified businesses
were 3 per cent above last year. Volume was 6 per cent improved, but prices
were down by an average of 3 per cent.
Combined earnings for these businesses were 37 per cent higher, excluding
non-recurring charges.
Earnings from the Conoco energy business were down by 65 per cent, the only
division to suffer an underlying slump. Du Pont attributed this to lower
worldwide refined product margins, an absence of benefits from the kind of
crude oil forward sales achieved in 1991 and lower natural gas prices.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said a number of Du Pont's businesses were
achieving 'solid sales and earnings growth in spite of an uneven economic
recovery'.
He said the group continued to benefit from improvements in operating costs
and productivity. The resulting gains more than offset the downturn in the
petroleum sector.
Wall Street seemed to agree and reacted favourably to the Du Pont results,
marking the share price Dollars 2 3/4 higher to Dollars 52 3/8 .
Mr William Young, a chemicals industry analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette in New York, said he was impressed by the results: 'I think they
are doing quite well. Volumes are up considerably year-to-year. Their cost
cutting is having a major impact and if you look at the big four chemical
companies in the US, Du Pont is the only one to have an underlying profits
increase.'

XEROX, the document processing group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent
increase in second-quarter net income, helped by increasing shipments of new
products and cost controls.
However, Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, noted that 'the weak economic
environment in Japan and some European countries affected our overall
performance'.
Xerox reported net income of Dollars 139m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, compared
with Dollars 126m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 2
per cent to Dollars 4.5bn.
The document processing business saw a 9 per cent gain in income, to Dollars
133m, on operating revenues up 3 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn. Excluding
currency factors, revenues were up 4 per cent.
Mr Allaire said equipment sales were up 6 per cent in the quarter, driven by
new products. Gross margins and expense ratios had improved.
The company's insurance and financial services operations earned Dollars
49m, up from Dollars 43m, with interest and headquarters expenses cutting
the total to Dollars 6m, up from Dollars 4m.
For the six months Xerox reported net income of Dollars 267m, or Dollars
2.35 a share, against Dollars 242m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, on revenues
which rose from Dollars 8.7bn to Dollars 8.8bn.

insurer's net profits for the first half to Dollars 10m - sharply improved
on the Dollars 111m loss seen a year ago. The second-quarter profit was
scored after realised gains on investments of Dollars 6m. Investment gains
in the first half also totalled Dollars 6m.
USF&amp;G said net profits from its property-casualty business reached Dollars
52m in the second quarter, against a loss of Dollars 44m a year earlier.
This was attributed to improved loss experience and a better mix of business
 -following decisions to pull out of certain markets and states.
The result came despite larger-than-expected catastrophe losses, including
the recent hailstorms and tornadoes in Kansas and Oklahoma. These have
plagued the entire US property-casualty insurance sector.
USF&amp;G's life insurance business made a small Dollars 1m loss after tax in
the quarter, compared with a profit of Dollars 11m in 1991.
The company blamed the result on lower sales, related 'to the depressed
nature of the single premium deferred annuity market'.

<TEXT>
PARIBAS, one of France's leading banks, is to restructure its domestic
branch network involving 10 branch closures and the loss of 123 jobs.
The move reflects the general trend in the big French banks to rationalise
their networks. The aim is to improve profitability in an intensely
competitive market, where margins have been under pressure for several
years.
The rationalisation comes at a time when industrial relations in the French
financial sector are becoming strained. There have been disputes at banks
and insurance groups as trade unions try to resist cost-cutting programmes.
The Paribas job losses, the first in the company's history, have provoked
union criticism.
The rationalisation of the branch network forms part of the strategy
developed by Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, to refocus Paribas on its core
interests in international investment banking. Paribas plans to close 10
branches in Paris and the provinces and to rationalise six other provincial
branches. This will involve reducing the workforce in the branch network
from 740 to 607.
Paribas employs 3,400 people in France and 9,000 world-wide.

<TEXT>
PASTEUR Merieux Serums et Vaccins, the world's biggest supplier of vaccines
and the vaccine unit of Merck of the US, another leading producer, have
agreed to set up a jointly owned European subsidiary.
This is the latest in a series of international alliances in the vaccines
industry, as national companies join forces to pool technology to create
multiple vaccines, capable of immunising against several diseases at once.
No single national group owns enough antigens - proteins which stimulate the
production of antibodies - to make a good all-in-one inoculation.
The pair will concentrate on developing multiple vaccines for the European
market, 'to obtain, with a simplified vaccination timetable, better immune
cover against a bigger number of illnesses,' they said.
They have signed a letter of intent for an equally owned subsidiary to
promote their vaccines and other human health products and seek other
alliances across Europe.
If accepted by the European Commission's anti-trust authorities, the new
company should be in place by the end of the year, said a joint statement.
Institut Merieux, the vaccine group's parent, was one of the first in the
current round of alliances, with its takeover three years ago of Connaught,
the Canadian vaccine group, which turned it into the world's biggest
supplier.
At the turn of this year, the French group's vaccines unit signed a letter
of intent with Merck to co-operate on developing and marketing combined
childhood vaccines in the US.
Institut Merieux, majority owned by Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned
chemicals group, is the world's leading human and animal biology group,
while Merck is the leader in human and veterinary pharmaceuticals.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Toyota signals end of a dynasty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA Motor yesterday signalled the end of Japan's most successful
corporate dynasty when it appointed a president from within the founding
Toyoda ( family, but said the next incumbent would probably come from the
group at large.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, aged 63, inherits the job from his elder brother
Shoichiro, 67, who becomes chairman. Mr Eiji Toyoda, their 79-year-old
uncle, is relinquishing that post to become honorary chairman.
Tatsuro, a New York University MBA graduate who in 1984 spearheaded the
launch of Toyota's landmark US joint production venture with General Motors,
is expected to bring a more international flavour to the job. He said
yesterday that such a background had helped him win the post.
He added, however, that the speed of technological change dictated that his
presidency of the country's biggest car maker would not be nearly as long as
Shoichiro's 10 years. When asked whether the company's next president would
come from outside the family, he said: 'It is likely.'
The complacent nature of family managements in some large companies is
coming under increasing criticism as a domestic economic slowdown has put
earnings growth into reverse. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, pointing out that the
Toyodas were not represented in any other senior management levels below the
presidency, held out the prospect of a more collegiate style.
Saying that 'management should not depend on a single leader', he announced
the appointment as vice-chairman of Mr Masami Iwasaki, who along with Mr
Tatsuro Toyoda had been vice-president. Five other directors were made
vice-presidents in their place.
Industry analysts, while cautioning that any changes in strategy were likely
to be modest, said Toyota had to find ways to get to grips with the fall-off
in domestic demand. Mr Koji Endo, of S G Warburg Securities, described
Tatsuro as 'a top-rated executive, even if he is a Toyoda anyway' and one of
the most internationally minded at the company.
However, Toyota has recently become markedly more bullish than its rivals on
car sales in Japan in the rest of calendar 1992. It is predicting that the
worst is over and, after a 4 per cent first-half fall, demand for Toyota
models in the July to December period should be flat.
Some industry watchers attribute the confidence to pending model launches,
and others to aggressive pricing which will cost it earnings previously
taken for granted. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda said the company was sticking to that
forecast although 'recovery was a little lagging behind'.

<TEXT>
A Dollars 2.5bn offer for the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) industrial and
property assets in Spain has been withdrawn by Mr Javier de la Rosa, KIO's
former Spanish partner, with both sides yesterday blaming each other for the
collapse of the proposed deal.
Mr de la Rosa made his offer in a faxed letter to the Kuwaiti finance
minister on July 15 and asked for an indication of interest within the
following 10 days.
A spokesman for the Catalan financier said yesterday the offer had been
withdrawn on Monday, 12 days after the fax had been sent.
Individuals close to the KIO last night confirmed that the offer had been
received.
'A fax was received on July 15 containing a highly conditional offer from an
unnamed group of Spanish companies and financial institutions to purchase
Grupo Torras,' they said. Grupo Torras is the KIO holding company in Spain.
'This fax was received from Mr Javier de la Rosa who identified himself as a
minor investor in such a group.
'Due to the conditional nature of the contents of the fax and the need to
finalise the offer, an adviser to the KIO contacted Mr de La Rosa requesting
a confirmatory copy and discussed tentative arrangements for a meeting to be
held earlier this week to clarify the seriousness of the offer. The
confirmatory copy was not received and prior to any meetings a fax was
received on July 27 from Mr de la Rosa withdrawing the offer.'
Mr de la Rosa's spokesman said it had become clear during the 10-day period
that the KIO was continuing negotiations started by Mr de la Rosa before
leaving Grupo Torras in June, to sell off a large part of Ercros, the Torras
chemicals business, to Freeport MacMaRon of the US.
Thus the offer could not stand after the 10-day grace period as without the
Ercros businesses, the KIO assets in Spain would have been fundamentally
altered, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
BRIDGESTONE, Japan's leading tyre maker, blamed a 21.4 per cent fall in
first-half pre-tax profits to Y28.9bn (Dollars 231.2m) on weak demand from
the domestic car and construction indus-tries.
Sales for the six months to the end of June fell 2 per cent to Y342.9bn,
while sales within Japan slipped 1 per cent to Y252.3bn, with demand for
passenger car tyres steady but that for trucks and buses declining.
The company is confident of an upturn in the Japanese economy in the second
half, and sales for the year are expected to be Y740bn, up from Y736.5bn,
and pre-tax profits are forecast at Y70bn, down 8.7 per cent.
Bridgestone said improvement in the fortunes of Firestone, the US tyre maker
acquired four years ago, and an expected recovery in the international
economy would lead to net consolidated profits of Y25bn, compared with
Y7.4bn in 1991.
However, consolidated sales are forecast to rise only slightly to Y1,770bn,
from Y1,763bn, and the improvement will come from the reconstruction of
Firestone, which has been a considerable burden for the Japanese company.

<TEXT>
PHILLIPS Petroleum of the US is to sell its half share in a plastics joint
venture in Japan to Toray Industries, the fibres group which has been its
local partner in the six-year-old operation.
The venture, Phillips Petroleum Toray, operates a 7,500 tonne-a-year plant
making polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) resin, an engineering plastic used in
the automotive and electronics industries.
No value was disclosed on the deal, but the unit has paid-in capital of Y6bn
(Dollars 47m) and represents 30 per cent of Phillips' business in Japan,
where it also has activities in liquefied natural gas, specialty chemicals
and other plastics.
Phillips said it was quitting the venture as part of a reorganisation
initiated in the US this year. Included in the disposal is Phillips'
Japanese operations in PPS compound, where the plastic is combined with
fibre glass or other materials.
Toray said the move to full control was aimed at improving efficiency by
integrating management amid what it described as excessive competition.
The two will retain marketing links which according to Toray would establish
a global supply system for the plastic, and will continue their mutual
supply arrangements and technology exchanges.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Link-up and deals to solve a pressing
problem - Andrew Bolger looks at the latest moves at Verson which has seen
its share price collapse to 4 1/2 p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERSON International Group, the loss-making Midlands-based machinery maker,
has announced a large acquisition and disposal - both in the US  - and the
strengthening of its links with C Itoh, the Japanese trading house.
Mr Tim Kelleher, Verson's chairman and chief executive, said this
complicated series of deals was aimed at significantly strengthening the
finances of the group, which has seen its share price collapse from 47p
since the outbreak of the Gulf war in August 1990.
The shares yesterday closed 1p lower at 4 1/2 p .
Verson also reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.3m for the year to January
31, compared with a deficit of Pounds 390,000 last time. Turnover rose from
Pounds 82.6m to Pounds 90.1m.
Losses per share increased to 8.66p against 0.04p. It has passed its
dividend, having paid a total of 1p last time.
The group has agreed to buy Niagara, a US manufacturer of metal-forming
equipment, for Dollars 23.5m (Pounds 12.1m), of which Dollars 14m is payable
in cash on completion.
Niagara, which employs more than 340 people in Buffalo, New York, last year
incurred a pre-tax loss of Dollars 1.3m on turnover of Dollars 29.7m.
Verson is also selling Taylor-Winfield - an Ohio-based metal-working
equipment manufacturer it bought in 1990 - back to its original vendors, Mr
John Anderson and some of his family, for Dollars 7.8m.
Finally, the UK group is creating a joint venture with Enprotech, a wholly
owned subsidiary of C Itoh, to distribute and sell spare parts for Verson
and Niagara metal presses in North and Central America.
By changing an existing licence agreement with Enprotech, Verson will
receive a further lump-sum royalty payment of Dollars 7.5m.
In addition, Enprotech has been issued with a warrant to subscribe for up to
Pounds 7.17m new shares in Verson at 10p each, which would represent 5 per
cent of the UK group's current share capital.
Mr Kelleher, a Texan entrepreneur with an interest in West Midlands
engineers, brought Verson to the market at the start of 1988.
His strategy was to buy up depressed businesses, reorganise them into
profitable units, and then use the group's international marketing arm to
sell their products overseas.
The group enjoyed a number of years of uninterrupted growth in turnover,
with increasing export sales.
This came to an abrupt halt with the onset of the world recession,
exacerbated by the Gulf crisis.
Mr Kelleher said: 'For six months, there really was panic. Order intake just
went off the cliff - even in China, one of our best markets, which is
normally insulated from everything.'
Order intake dropped by 55 per cent after the Gulf crisis broke, with UK
business being particularly affected. This led to significant under-use of
UK manufacturing capacity. The group's operating losses of Pounds 3.64m last
year were increased by interest charges of Pounds 4.6m and an exceptional
Pounds 4m to cover write-offs, redundancies and restructuring costs.
Mr Kelleher said he had reduced internal costs by Pounds 8m since November
1990. This had included 450 redundancies in the UK, plant closures and
increased use of sub-contractors.
In December, Verson announced it had agreed in principle to sell British
Federal, one of its metal joining subsidiaries, to its management, backed by
a venture fund. Mr Kelleher said the financial backers subsequently tried to
negotiate a lower price, so discussions were terminated.
However, the UK group has agreed to sell back Taylor-Winfield to Mr Anderson
and certain members of his family. Mr Kelleher said the hoped-for benefits
of the acquisition had never been realised and Mr Anderson had expressed a
strong desire to leave Verson and re-acquire the business.
But why is Verson making another big acquisition in the US, given that it
has had to unravel its last deal there so speedily? Mr Kelleher said Niagara
is a very different company from Taylor-Winfield: 'The family owners are
elderly and will leave the business, so we can bring in our own management.
The business is crying out for change and middle management wants to see it
effected. It is also a business we know and understand completely.'
There is also an important link between the acquisition of Niagara and the
joint venture with Enprotech, which is a leading refurbisher of metal press
equipment in North America. Spare parts supplied by the joint venture will
be made at Niagara's plant, which Mr Kelleher estimates is currently only
utilising about 30 per cent of its capacity.
After these deals are completed Verson will still be geared at over 300 per
cent. However, Mr Kelleher said he was confident he would continue to get
full support from Lloyds Bank. On the basis of Niagara's asset base, Verson
will also gain access to facilities from Marine Midland, the US subsidiary
of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
Mr Kelleher said all the reshaped group's businesses would be
cash-generative, assuming that orders continued to improve. He was confident
that as a result of these proposals, Verson would be better placed to
exploit an upturn in its markets.
However, he acknowledges that, despite the strengthening of the balance
sheet resulting from these deals, Verson's borrowing is still too high in
relation to its banking facilities - particularly in view of the
intermittent nature of cashflow from some of the group's big contracts.
The planned sale of surplus properties and changes in its US pensions
operations should reduce the group's gearing and support its working capital
requirements. But should the group's performance deviate materially from
that anticipated, the board warns that it would be necessary to seek
additional working capital.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Rodime reduces loss to Dollars 644,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RODIME, the one-time pioneer of 3 1/2 -inch hard disk drives, reduced its
pre-tax losses from Dollars 1.49m to Dollars 644,000 (Pounds 337,000) in the
six months to March 31 and announced that trading in its shares, suspended
in August at 4p, would be resumed today.
Once a disk drive manufacturer which never achieved critical mass and was
spread over three continents, the company has metamorphosed into an
intellectual property company, deriving its revenues from the licensing of
its patents. This stems from late 1990 when IBM paid Rodime an out-of-court
settlement of about Dollars 13m.
Mr Malcolm McIver, non-executive chairman, said that Rodime's aim was to
restore shareholder value. It had:
to dispose of its assets successfully. It has still to receive Dollars 4.4m,
mainly from the sale of the factory in Boca Raton, Florida, from an expected
Dollars 16.9m;
to achieve new licensing agreements. At 15, it has so far come to terms with
less than half of all the companies which have infringed its patents; to
renegotiate certain obligations of its subsidiaries which it had guaranteed;
to maintain the support of its bankers. Rodime's total liabilities stood at
Dollars 30m at June 1992, against Dollars 63m in October 1990.
Mr Peter Bailey, managing director and one of only five full-time employees,
said that in the year to September 1991 revenues from patent licensing
totalled Dollars 30m. He added that Rodime was perhaps a year away from the
granting of patents for its digital servo, which could extend the life of
the company in its current form beyond 2004, when the disk drive patents
expire.
Mr Bailey said Rodime could also consult on other companies' intellectual
property, or could buy technologies and their patents rights on a percentage
or joint venture basis.
In May Rodime had net negative worth of Dollars 27m (Pounds 15.2m at that
time) and to qualify for the relisting, the company had to secure an
unqualified opinion on the working capital adequacy review from Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the auditor.
Operating profit was Dollars 1.99m (loss Dollars 373,000). Losses per share
were 0.4 cents (1 cent).

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Non-core businesses behind 5% fall at
Lloyds Abbey Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 5 per
cent fall in profits before tax, from Pounds 149.5m to Pounds 142m, in the
first half of the year. Several group businesses were severely affected by
the depressed housing market.
Earnings per share declined from 15.9p to 13.9p, and the interim dividend is
maintained at 6.3p.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, pointed out that results were weakest in the
non-insurance areas of the business, making an increase in the final
dividend unlikely.
The share price fell, against the market trend, from 355p to 345p, after
340p.
Mr Alan Richards, analyst at James Capel, pointed to particularly
disappointing results from the German subsidiary, where sales of Pounds 6.4m
compared with Pounds 15m previously.
He was also disappointed by the results of Abbey Life, the direct sales
force-led life company, where regular premium sales dropped 5 per cent, and
single premiums rose by 9 per cent.
Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds
4m (Pounds 15.6m) after increased bad debt charges of Pounds 55m (Pounds
46.3m). It was particularly affected by first and second mortgages.
Commission and fee income at the Black Horse Agencies chain of estate agents
fell from Pounds 36.7m to Pounds 33m.
However, the core business of selling insurance products to Lloyds Bank
customers maintained growth.
Black Horse Financial Services, which sells life and pension products,
increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m (Pounds 38.7m) and Lloyds Bank
Insurance Services, which sells general insurance, increased its
contribution to Pounds 28m (Pounds 25.6m).
In March the group disposed of its Irish insurance subsidiary for its book
value of Pounds 20.6m.
Sir Simon said yesterday: 'Selling life assurance and general insurance
products to customers of Lloyds Bank remains very much at the heart of our
strategy and again we have achieved an increase in sales in both areas. The
development of our bank related life business and that of Abbey Life,
together with effective cost control in all of our businesses, are still our
top priorities.'

FT  30 JUL 92 / Lord Stevens goes as Invesco grows in US: Adverse publicity
added to calls for a change in management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The phased departure of Lord Stevens of Ludgate from the helm of UK-based
fund manager Invesco MIM has been some time in the making, according to
executives and directors of the company.
His departure was undoubtedly hastened by adverse publicity which undermined
the company's ability to attract new clients, both for its retail products
and its wholesale fund management division.
His close association with the late Mr Robert Maxwell, a well-publicised
fine by regulators for sloppy administration of Personal Equity Plans and
the disastrous investments of an Invesco MIM investment trust, Drayton
Consolidated, also harmed the company's image.
But individuals familiar with the firm say that ultimately, Invesco's
shifting business mix meant that Lord Stevens' management style and focus
were no longer appropriate.
'What underlies all this is a change in management style which is overdue,'
said one senior Invesco executive. Lord Stevens' hands-on approach meant he
was involved in the day-to-day decisions of the company while the focus of
its operations was increasingly overseas.
Executives and directors of Invesco MIM said they put pressure on Lord
Stevens, who is 56, to retire. However, a financier close to Lord Stevens
said he himself initiated discussions about reducing the burden of his
responsibilities at the group almost six months ago. The proposal is said to
have been recorded in minutes of an Invesco MIM board meeting.
At the time, the group had been advised that its US operations were worth
around Dollars 430m (Pounds 238m), more than the value put on the group as a
whole by its stock market price. In January, and with the greatest secrecy,
Invesco MIM began work on floating off the US business as a separate
company. It employed the US investment bank Salomon Brothers as its adviser.
Detailed work on the demerger was carried out, but a couple of months ago,
the deal was dropped for two reasons:
the market value of US fund management groups had fallen; a thorny tax
problem had arisen, which meant that the US business was probably worth less
as an independent company than had been hoped.
If the demerger had gone ahead, Lord Stevens would have been at the helm of
a much smaller group and the question of whether he was overburdened with
responsibilities would have been less pressing.
However, the issue of the group's management structure re-emerged once it
became clear that the international business would remain intact.
Shareholders had been concerned about Lord Stevens' role as a chairman of
companies in which Invesco MIM had direct or indirect interests.
In 1991 he earned Pounds 339,000 as chairman of United Newspapers, owner of
the Daily Express, and was also chairman of Alexander Proudfoot, the
management consultant, and the poor-performing Drayton Consolidated
investment trust.
'We have been conscious of the fact that we have been criticised for holding
interests in companies in which Lord Stevens has an interest,' said Mr
Michael Perman, company secretary. However, he said Invesco MIM began to
dispose of much of those interests some months ago.
At a board meeting on Monday, it was decided that Lord Stevens' executive
duties should be taken by Mr Charles Brady, who was appointed chief
executive with immediate effect. Lord Stevens would retire as chairman at
the next annual general meeting in the spring of 1993.
Lord Stevens remained chairman of Alexander Proudfoot, and also of United
Newspapers whose shares rose yesterday, probably on the assumption that he
will have more time to devote to it. But Invesco MIM's share price also
closed 9p higher at 75p.
At Invesco, the US business has in effect taken control of the whole company
with the appointment to the top executive post of Mr Brady, who built up the
North America operations.
At the same time, Mr Nicholas Johnson, in charge of the European and Pacific
operations, has given up his title of joint deputy chairman.
Invesco MIM's US operations are highly profitable - and have also had
unusual success in penetrating the almost impenetrable Japanese pension fund
management market. The latest accounts show the US operations now dwarf
those in European and the Pacific.
On the domestic front, the company has been hindered by a lacklustre
investment performance for its pension funds under management and has had
difficulty attracting new clients, according to pension fund consultants and
industry analysts.
'There hasn't been much growth in its client base,' said Mr Philip Gibbs,
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Lord Stevens' 30-year City career - most of it highly successful  - has been
spent at companies now part of Invesco MIM. So his departure is something of
a rite of passage for him - and for the company.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Lasmo beats forecasts and maintains interim dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the UK independent oil company, yesterday confounded its critics by
maintaining its interim dividend and showing a substantial increase in
profits in its first results since the Pounds 1.1bn takeover of rival oil
company Ultramar last December.
Pre-tax profits in the first six months of 1992 increased more than
five-fold to Pounds 72m, compared with Pounds 13m in the same period in 1991
 -although the company effectively doubled in size with the integration of
Ultramar.
Profit after tax was Pounds 26m - above analysts' forecasts of between a
Pounds 10m profit and a Pounds 10m loss. However, profits were flattered by
Lasmo's decision to capitalise Pounds 22m of interest charges relating to
the Ultramar downstream assets which were recently floated. Without similar
factors in the second half, analysts said, the outlook for full-year
earnings - and the dividend  - remained pessimistic. The shares yesterday
gained 1p to 134p.
Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive, said the results showed the company's
potential now that Ultramar's downstream assets had been disposed of and the
upstream assets integrated into Lasmo. He said pessimistic City earnings
forecasts overlooked the strong contribution from Lasmo's Indonesian
interests, inherited from Ultramar.
Average production reached 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an
increase of more than 100,000 b/d. Turnover more than doubled to Pounds
297m, in spite of the fall in the average sterling oil price from Pounds
10.63 a barrel to Pounds 10.33. Earnings per share rose to 3p, compared with
a 1.4p per share loss.
The interim dividend was held at 2.3p, although Mr Greentree warned that
while Lasmo's long-term policy was to maintain dividends in real terms,
future payouts would depend on operating results, and, particularly, on the
sterling oil price.
Net debt fell to Pounds 914m after the disposal of the downstream assets
which generated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 530m), taking gearing to 80 per cent.
Further disposals, including Ultramar's US upstream assets, shipping fleet,
and the second half of Lasmo's holding in Lasmo Canada, together with
non-core assets in the North Sea, are expected to generate around Dollars
350m over the next 18 months.

FT  30 JUL 92 / BT falls 28% as turnover declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications' first quarter pre-tax profit fell by 27.8 per
cent after bigger than expected redundancy costs and a loss from the sale of
its controlling stake in Mitel, the Canadian telephone equipment maker.
For the three months to June 30 BT's pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 825m to
Pounds 596m on sales of Pounds 3.27bn, down from Pounds 3.34bn. It was the
first quarter-on-quarter decline in turnover since the company was
privatised in 1984.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 135m relates to the loss made on the
disposal of its interests in Mitel, International Aeradio, its aviation
services subsidiary, and Sharelink, the Birmingham-based stockbroking group.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 920m to Pounds 799m. They were further
depressed by redundancy charges of Pounds 56m due to the early retirement of
29,000 people - 9,000 more than expected - under BT's voluntary redundancy
scheme.
A further Pounds 11m attributable to the restructuring of management has
been set against the provision established in 1990 for this purpose. The
shares yesterday rose 13p to close at 346p as the efforts to control costs
were better than expected.
News of the redundancies overshadowed BT's disappointing trading
performance.
The number of inland calls fell by 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Revenue
from international calls rose by 5 per cent, on a 12-month moving average
basis, but this was due more to international calls being routed through
London than an increase in people making calls from the UK.
Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, said: 'The decline in turnover reflects the
continued pressures of the economy, regulation and competition.'
The Office of Telecommunications, the industry regulator, has told BT to cut
the price of a basket of its basic services each year by inflation minus 7.5
percentage points by next August, compared with 6.25 points previously.
BT yesterday said: 'We are cutting costs, but there comes a time when you
cannot squeeze anything else out.'
Strong cash flow in the first quarter, free of dividend or tax payments,
reduced net debt by Pounds 715m to Pounds 1.79bn, representing gearing of 17
per cent. Earnings per share fell from 9p to 5.6p.

FT  30 JUL 92 / BT steps up redundancy plans: 33,000 jobs to go this year
First quarter profits fall 27.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF British industry's largest redundancy programmes was stepped up
sharply yesterday when BT said it would shed more than 33,000 jobs this
year. About 19,000 staff will leave on Friday.
A further 15,000 jobs a year may be shed over the next three to four years
as BT continues to slim down its organisation through targeted voluntary
schemes. The news came as BT announced a 27.8 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits for the first quarter to June 30.
The company's total workforce could be reduced from 210,200 at the start of
this financial year to 120,000 by 1996.
Expected job losses this year are well above figures originally announced by
BT. It had been expected that 24,000 jobs would be shed - 20,000 through
voluntary redundancies and 4,000 through natural wastage. These figures have
now been increased by 9,000 as BT was inundated with applications to leave.
About 20,000 employees are being refused the generous redundancy package
because of oversubscription.
Unions have complained that many members were misled into thinking they
would be able to take voluntary redundancy, only to be turned down. BT said
yesterday it had 'had the opportunity to rethink budgets' and would now be
able to offer more voluntary redundancies.
The package, Release 92, provides for payments as high as Pounds 100,000
plus pension entitlement, although the average sum is likely to be about
Pounds 30,000. At least three months' guaranteed work through an employment
agency, plus Pounds 1,000 in training vouchers, are also being offered.
The 19,000 staff leaving on Friday will qualify for a bonus payment of 25
per cent of salary.
The main BT union, the National Communications Union, described the package
as 'one of the best in the UK'. It warned BT 'not to underestimate the depth
of resentment felt by those who were assured by management that they would
be released and who were later refused'.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents BT operators, said the
scale of the redundancy programme had artificially deflated profits.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Honecker flown home to face trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT, QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNDIGNIFIED tug-of-war over Mr Erich Honecker, the former East German
communist leader, ended last night when he was flown from Moscow to Berlin
to face trial for the alleged manslaughter of defectors shot while trying to
escape to the west.
Months of negotiations between Germany, Russia and Chile - in whose Moscow
embassy he took refuge to avoid extradition - came to a head when he was
taken from the embassy to a military aircraft at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The 79-year-old hardliner, who led East Germany for 18 years until 1989,
landed at Berlin's heavily guarded Tegel airport and was immediately driven
to Moabit prison.
Two doctors examined Mr Honecker in prison and ruled he was well enough to
withstand jail, a justice official said. After a more thorough examination,
the Berlin district court must decide whether he will remain in jail. He
will appear before a judge today.
The official said Mr Honecker's trial was expected to start 'some time this
year'.
Mr Honecker faces charges of manslaughter in connection with the deaths of
49 East Germans shot while trying to escape to the west between 1961 and
1989.
One question to be answered is whether Mr Honecker is fit to stand trial,
having had an operation for kidney cancer in 1990.
The other doubt concerns the legal basis of charges against him. An 800-page
indictment has been drawn up by the Berlin justice department, accusing Mr
Honecker and five fellow leaders of the communist government of complicity
in the killing of defectors at the Berlin Wall and the border with West
Germany. The problem is to make the charges stick in terms of the law of
East Germany which was prevailing at the time.
The Berlin authorities have levelled the charges on three fronts: that Mr
Honecker and his colleagues, including Mr Erich Mielke, the former head of
the Ministry of State Security (Stasi), exceeded their powers under East
German law; that they broke international laws, in particular the UN
convention on civil rights; and that they infringed basic human rights.
Mr Honecker argues that he cannot be found guilty on that basis, because he
was empowered under East German law to issue administrative orders,
including the order to shoot to kill.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By the middle of this decade Lasmo could have entered a golden age.
Development expenditure is peaking; if the disposal programme proceeds
according to plan, gearing should soon start to drop from its present 80 per
cent. Debt should be further reduced within a couple of years as the heavy
oil and gas investments in Indonesia and the North Sea pay off. That could
suggest the shares are undervalued after their fall of more than 60 per cent
during the past year. The snag is that there are still some short-term
hurdles to overcome before long-term promise is fulfilled.
Lasmo has managed to maintain its interim dividend, but it was helped by its
decision to capitalise the Pounds 22m interest costs of carrying Ultramar's
downstream businesses which are now sold. The company would argue that the
move was a logical reflection of the fact that the downstream assets were
never relevant to its main business, but indirectly it still helped relieve
pressure on distributable reserves. More open assistance came from the
release to distributable reserves of Pounds 373m from its merger reserve.
That more than offset the extraordinary loss of Pounds 291m on the
downstream assets disposal.
One interpretation of these balance sheet manoeuvres is that they show the
company's determination to maintain its dividend. But they also underline
the tightness of the distributable reserve position. The company should be
placed to maintain its final payment. Barring a rebound in the sterling
price of oil, next year's prospects are less certain. By then there will be
less scope for capitalising interest on development activities. Lasmo may be
trading close to the lower end of the range of net asset estimates, but the
shares are not for the nervous.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the market braced for a dour results season, the cash-generative
capacity of BAT Industries and its aggressive dividend policy were always
likely to win friends. Yesterday's figures confirmed that damage limitation
in UK insurance is now feeding through into higher earnings, while tobacco
continues to generate cash in the old way. Moreover, as losses at Eagle Star
are staunched, BAT starts to look a less hopelessly tax-inefficient
investment vehicle. ACT is again being utilised and the effective tax rate
is down to 42 per cent, from 57 per cent last year.
Yet the outlook for Eagle Star remains unclear. Provisions against domestic
mortgage indemnity business show no sign of declining from the current rate
of Pounds 25m a quarter. While the company has tightened underwriting
criteria and promised to get tough with the building societies over the
terms of new business, losses on policies already written are linked to the
rate of repossessions, over which it has no control. Increased marketing
spend on US tobacco suggests competitive pressures are building, while the
weakness of the dollar could depress second-half US earnings on translation.
But while there are still risks, BAT has promised at least to maintain the 9
per cent rise in the interim dividend for the full year. On this basis alone
the stock may have further to go, even after outperforming the market by 20
per cent so far this year. Assuming it can carry on delivering dividend
growth above inflation beyond the current year, the prospective yield of 6.6
per cent looks undemanding.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The headline drop of 38 per cent in BT's first-quarter earnings per share is
not quite as alarming as it looks. First, there is a large one-off
exceptional charge on disposals. Second, the full-year charge to the profit
and loss account for redundancies will be around Pounds 450m this year
compared with just Pounds 30m last. The actual cash cost will be nearer
Pounds 600m. But shedding more than 33,000 jobs on an average salary of
close to Pounds 20,000 will save nearly Pounds 600m a year as well. In the
context of a company making Pounds 3bn before tax that is fairly material.
Thereafter, BT will be engaged in a slightly unnerving process of reducing
employment each year in an attempt to match the downward pressure on prices
imposed by the regulator. If inflation stays low, the promised regulatory
formula of RPI minus 7.5 per cent should ensure this is a losing battle. But
the company expects to keep cutting jobs for another three or four years. By
then, with luck, competition in the domestic market will have increased to
the point where regulation can be less demanding.
For the investor, the central point is what all that means for the dividend.
The headline earnings figure this year could show a fall of as much as 10
per cent. Adjusting for exceptionals and redundancy costs, however, the
underlying figure could show a slight rise. This might be taken to justify a
corresponding rise in the dividend. BT's historic yield premium to the
market average is 10 per cent. It has been higher in the recent past but, as
the market is doubtless starting to reflect, the lack of clarity over its
dividend outlook is scarcely any greater than for the corporate sector as a
whole.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE's rise of more than 3 per cent in the past two days is in welcome
contrast to the recent mood of desperation. But it would be premature to
assume a lasting change in sentiment. There is a natural inclination for
London to follow Wall Street's sharp rebound while it lasts. Germany's June
inflation figures were better than expected, which may go some way towards
allaying fears of a rise in the Lombard rate after the summer holidays.
Neither of these developments holds any promise of a sudden change for the
better in the UK economy.
The striking aspect of Wall Street's recovery is that companies such as
Chrysler are starting to produce the kind of earnings recovery for which US
investors had been nervously hoping. There is less chance of a pleasant
surprise on earnings in the UK, notwithstanding the odd bright spot such as
BAT. If there were, house repossessions would be falling faster and the
latest CBI survey would not have made such depressing reading. Meanwhile,
the rise in equities has not generated much end-investor demand. That smacks
more of a market trying to establish a floor than one poised for real
recovery.

FT  30 JUL 92 / CBI and IoD attack corporate governance reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS TO improve the way companies are run were yesterday opposed by two
of UK industry's main federations.
The Confederation of British Industry said it supported in principle a code
of best practice on corporate governance, but rejected plans for its
enforcement.
The Institute of Directors, meanwhile, opposed moves to give non-executive
directors a special function within boards.
The proposals, contained in a recent report by a committee chaired by Sir
Adrian Cadbury, were aimed at strengthening the role of non-executive
directors and improving the quality of financial accounts. The committee has
been criticised by institutional shareholders for failing to include
sufficient enforcement mechanisms in its proposals.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, speaking at a press conference yesterday,
said shareholders were best placed to enforce a voluntary code on corporate
governance and needed no help from auditors, the Stock Exchange or
non-executive directors.
Although a CBI official served on the Cadbury committee - officially known
as the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance  - he did
not necessarily represent all confederation members' views, Sir Michael
said. In particular, members objected to a suggestion that non-executive
directors had an obligation to police the activities of executive directors.
'Members believe that the concept of the UK unitary board rests on all
directors working as a team, with equal legal duties and obligations. That
will not happen if some board members are cast in the role of policemen,'
Sir Michael said.
Among other things, the report recommends that non-executive directors be
allowed to seek outside professional advice at company expense, where
appropriate, and that they alone should constitute audit committees.
CBI members are also concerned about an enforcement provision - a proposed
Stock Exchange listing requirement for all companies to disclose the extent
to which they comply with the code of best practice.
The Cadbury committee, set up by the Stock Exchange, the Financial Reporting
Council and the accountancy profession, suggested that each company's
auditors be responsible for certifying the extent of compliance. While
companies would not be de-listed for failing to comply, their non-compliance
would be more visible to shareholders.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Lloyd's too dependent on US business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID NECKAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While insiders and outsiders wrangle at Lloyd's, the fundamental
business problem of that market continues to be ignored.
It is the excessive dependence on American business which underlies so much
of its present financial woes.
The deadly cocktail of capricious courts mixed with liability risks has
produced such problems as asbestosis, environmental pollution and now
possibly smoking-related claims.
These are burning like an underground coal fire, destroying the foundations
of the market.
Who is now prepared to join a market that contains such latent and
unquantifiable hazards? And what is being stored up for the future in
today's underwriting?
Lloyd's needs to cut off its current exposure to old American risks
(possibly by leaving the American Trust Fund to 'run off' its existing
exposure) and to require all future policies to have an absolute aggregate
limit and to be subject only to UK law and jurisdiction.
This might decimate Lloyd's income (not such a problem if its capacity is
shrinking anyway) but it will surely increase its profits ten-fold to
compensate.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Recession, but not all doom and gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On present evidence, the third quarter of 1992 will be the ninth one of
falling production since output reached its peak in the second quarter of
1990. This makes it the longest - but not so far the deepest  - recession
since the second world war.
There are no up-to-date estimates for the most comprehensive measure, GDP.
In its absence there is more than one way of making the comparison with last
time round. The simplest is to update the official index of manufacturing
production by the survey-based CBI estimate. This suggests a drop of 10 per
cent between the 1990 high point and the third quarter of 1992. For
comparison it fell by 17 1/2 per cent between the earlier 1979 peak and the
1981 low point.
Contrary to popular belief, construction output has not been more severely
hit than last time. The difference is that, at the corresponding stage of
the last recession, it was poised for recovery, while today it is bathed in
gloom.
There is still no hard evidence that the recession has touched bottom - only
that activity is weakening at a slower rate. The least bad indicator of
final demand is probably retail sales, where volume in the second quarter
was slightly up on a year before. Motor trade sales volumes are still well
down on a year ago. Investment intentions reported to the CBI are also well
down.
Where the present and previous recessions clearly differ is that the present
one has made much further inroads into inflation than that of the early
1980s. The July CBI survey shows unit cost increases were the lowest since
the survey began in 1958. The CBI survey also finds that more firms have cut
prices than increased them for the fifth quarter in a row.
No one is suggesting that stable prices are a guarantee of growth either in
the short or the long term. But they provide a much better background for an
enduring recovery when that does come, and it will be folly to throw away
the prospect in return for fool's gold.
In the words of CBI staff economist Mr Sudhir Junankar, writing in the
previous month's CBI Economic Situation Report: 'With productivity set to
increase strongly, the competitive position of UK manufacturing is likely to
improve significantly.'
Even the CBI survey is not all gloom. A clear majority of firms expects to
increase their expenditure on product and process innovation. A majority
also expect to spend more on training and retraining - even more than did a
year ago.
A great deal of evidence that the economy's supply-side potential did
increase as a result of the competitive shake-up of the 1980s is given in
the new summer Treasury bulletin. But because this was a quietly argued
article, which stuck to the evidence and neither proclaimed a miracle nor
prophesied doom, it did not gain the attention it deserved.
An optimistic long-term interpretation is also supported by a paper by Peter
Spencer of Kleinwort Benson, who makes a good case that, in contrast to the
last recession, 'the surge in investment seen during the Lawson years has
allowed manufacturers to cut costs without cutting capacity'. My mere
citation of this paper will enrage the doomsters, especially those working
for rival firms.
The snag is that manufacturing and construction together account for only
about 30 per cent of GDP. An illustration of the distance we have to go in
eradicating inflationary psychology from the whole economy, and the
difficulty of so doing, is the fact that only now is action being taken
against the 25-year commercial property leases which provide for upward-only
rent reviews every five years.
The chief executive of Littlewoods, Sir Desmond Pitcher, has written to the
UK's biggest retailers to suggest joint action against this iniquitous
practice; and a meeting will take place in the autumn to plan the campaign.
Do you think these belated efforts to stand up to this bullying
manifestation of the inflationary mentality would survive if the government
gave in to the siren voices demanding that it should throw in the towel - a
better metaphor than abandoning the ERM strait-jacket  - and slash interest
rates or abandon all control over public spending, irrespective of what
happens to sterling or prices? If it did this, all the pain of the recession
 -as on so many previous occasions  - would have been for nothing, and some
future administration would have to start again from square one. The CBI has
kept its nerve better than many Tory MPs and newspapers, confining its
policy demands to some mildly useful palliatives, as well as reiterating
some hardy annual grouses.
I see no evidence that the government is sacrificing the real economy on the
altar of a literally zero rate of inflation. If you look, not at ministerial
speeches, but at the public expenditure projections made available last week
and reported in my column on July 27 ('Public Spending: A New Try'), you
would see that medium-term spending plans now assume an average annual rate
of increase of 2 1/4 per cent on the GDP deflator - about the widest of
available price indices. This is about the highest rate compatible with the
Greenspan definition of stable prices - when inflation does not enter as a
serious factor into business calculations.
If we are to get that low in an average year, prices overall may have to
fall in an occasional recession year - and certainly in particular sectors -
without a rush to the money printing press because of cries of 'deflation'.
There is no genuine deflation while the UK national income in money terms is
still rising by 4 to 5 per cent a year.
A look around the world should be sufficient to dispel the belief that the
British recession is a peculiar, insular disease caught from membership of
the ERM. The Japanese economy is this year teetering on the brink between
zero growth and an output drop. But the Japanese authorities are not
constrained by any international agreements in running their monetary
policy. In the US, interest rates are the lowest for a generation, yet still
the recovery is obstinately reluctant to take off.
If there is a distinction around the world between the more and the less
recession-prone countries, it is not to do with exchange rate arrangements.
It is rather the distinction between those - mostly the English-speaking
countries plus Japan - that experienced a massive credit boom in the late
1980s and which are now suffering from a debt overhang, and those that did
not.
The distinction is visible even within the UK. The recession is at its worst
in the south-east, where the credit boom went furthest and where the
financial talking classes are to be found.
The gloomiest prognoses are to be found in this part of the country. When
the green shoots of recovery are eventually seen, they are likely to come
from areas well to the north and west of London, which should surely be
welcome to those who have been lecturing us on regional imbalance for
several decades.

Ugh] - the indefatigable Hurd strikes again. Hardly had Britain's
globe-trotting foreign secretary hit Kuala Lumpur after taking in a
Philippines conference, than he bade the UK high commissioner there to
organise a jungle walk.
Off trooped the party, Hurd doing a David Attenborough in the van, our man
in Malaysia to the rear. The foreign secretary came back exuding enjoyment,
and the high commissioner with a leech up his trousers.

No one should feel too sorry for BT chairman Iain Vallance if the
questioning turns a bit rough at today's annual meeting. Fate has undeniably
been kind to him. He is only 49 and if he plays his cards right, and is
still running Britain's biggest company a decade from now, he should have
collected a knighthood if not a peerage.
Things could have been different. When Vallance joined the old Post Office
it was as an assistant postal controller. By contrast, one of his keenest
rivals, Bill Cockburn, had started on the telecom side and joined a good
five years before Vallance.
Indeed, Cockburn, who is two months older than Vallance, was personal
assistant to the PO chairman before Vallance held the job. Over the next few
years they followed one another in similar financial jobs but some time
during the 1970s Vallance moved ahead and after British Telecom split from
the PO in 1981, he has never looked back.
By contrast Cockburn has only just been promised the chief executive's seat
at the PO. Not only is he getting paid a quarter of what Vallance gets, but
he is going to have to deal with an unknown new chairman besides undergoing
a break-up orientated review of his organisation.
And they say the private sector is insecure.

Memo to ambitious public relations types: First, when you've no good news to
push, lie low - the bearer of bad tidings is apt to get shot. Second, and
more important, be sure to back a boss who is a winner.
Anyone doubting the wisdom of said advice need only look at a couple of
developments yesterday.
James Poole, who has done well beefing up Barclays Bank's PR department,
will soon be out of a job. He was close to chairman Sir John Quinton, who
retires at the end of a troublesome year for Barclays, and Poole's face
doesn't suit the post-Quinton planners. Instead of renewing his contract,
Barclays is replacing him with a career banker.
Meanwhile 38-year-old Howell James, one of the few outsiders on the BBC's
management board, is off to be the official mouthpiece of his old mentor,
Cable and Wireless chairman and former cabinet minister Lord Young.
James, who made his PR mark during TV-am's turbulent launch, is hoping to
work the same sort of magic on Young's private-sector image as he previously
did on the public-sector equivalent. It should be an easier task, always
provided that Young doesn't lose his job.
Even so, it's a strange move. Running the PR machine of a utility should be
nowhere near as exciting as nursing the BBC's image in the run-up to the
renewal of its charter. Could it be that Howell has decided C&amp;W is a safer
job?

Will he jump off the bench, or wait to be pushed? So goes the question being
asked in lay quarters about the hapless Mr Justice McKinnon, criticised by
the Court of Appeal for his role in the Blue Arrow fraud trial 'disaster'.
But the query betrays total misapprehension about how these things work.
After all, if judges resigned every time they were taken to task by their
loftier brethren, the High Court bench would have more space than bottoms.
Implicit in an appeal system is the recognition that judges aren't
infallible, and so can err without being incompetent, malevolent or out of
their wigs.
But it just happens that there are some judges who never get promoted to the
Court of Appeal or the House of Lords, a reflection perhaps of their stature
in the eyes of the Lord Chancellor.
So probably the worst prospect ahead of Pounds 87,620-a-year McKinnon is
eking out his working life - which as he's only 53, could last another 19
years - on High Court bench and crown court circuit.

'Keep taking the iodine tablets' is the Swiss government's advance
prescription for potential victims of disasters at Switzerland's five
nuclear power stations.
With a precautionary zeal befitting a country where all home-builders must
provide fall-out shelters for every resident, the 1.5m citizens living
within 20km of the plants are to be given rations of potassium iodide as a
safeguard against any outburst of radioactivity.
The chemical's protective value against thyroid cancers was shown by tests
after Chernobyl where, of 18m people treated with it, only three developed
an over-functioning thyroid gland.
The distribution has been meticulously planned, with zones of differing
urgency reflecting reflecting nearness to the plants. Since it is calculated
that beyond 20km away there will be at least 12 hours to take protective
action, supplies for residents at greater distances will be held in stores.
The cost is put at about Pounds 2m initially, plus annual charges - based on
five years shelf-life for the tablets - of Pounds 230,000. And naturally,
given Swiss logic, the bill will go largely to the potential
disaster-causers, the power stations.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN's large electricity users have reason to feel aggrieved. Industrial
profits are depressed and companies are trying to cut costs. Yet Nuclear
Electric, the state-owned generating company that electricity consumers are
required to subsidise to the tune of Pounds 1.2bn a year, has turned in
profits up 48 per cent on those of last year.
The nuclear levy, designed to compensate for the higher cost of generating
power from non-fossil fuels, is scheduled to remain until 1998. But these
profits, the users' lobby argues, demonstrate that the levy should be
abolished.
Yet a subsidy of this magnitude is essential if Nuclear Electric is to
remain profitable in the short term. Abolishing the levy would have turned a
profit of Pounds 482m into a loss of Pounds 783m.
Some form of subsidy will remain necessary at least until the government's
planned review of the industry is completed in 1994. Government may then
decide that the benefits of preserving a nuclear power industry, providing a
relatively safe and clean power source while encouraging fuel diversity,
justifies longer-term support.
Nuclear Electric has until 1994 to show either that it can operate without
subsidy or to set out the price of longer-term support. The case for Nuclear
Electric will be far stronger if it can credibly demonstrate before then
that it can produce electricity efficiently, as well as safely. Recent
indications from the electricity regulator, Offer, that it is to examine the
nuclear levy are welcome, if only for the contribution it will make to a
clearer understanding of the industry's finances in the run-up to the
nuclear review.
When it conducts that review, the government should also consider whether it
would be fairer to meet any subsidy from general taxation rather than from a
levy, which has the undesirable side-effect of impairing the competitiveness
of many British companies.

FT  30 JUL 92 / A fortress under siege: Structural barriers facing foreign
companies in the Japanese market are lifting, but slowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every second Friday of the month, the top officials of the 29 biggest
companies in the Mitsubishi industrial grouping drive in their limousines to
a Mitsubishi-owned block in central Tokyo for a meeting of the Friday Club.
'It's a bit like a social club,' says Mr Minoru Makihara, the president of
Mitsubishi Corporation, one of Japan's biggest trading companies and one of
the regular participants. 'We talk about things in general or maybe listen
to a guest speaker.'
But for many American and European executives and trade officials, the
Friday Club is more than a social gathering. It is a symbol of all they
claim is unfair about Japanese business.
These critics say Japanese companies freely exploit open markets in the US
and Europe, while hiding at home behind veils of restrictive practices. They
contend collusive threads tie companies with bankers, customers, suppliers
and the government, and these threads hamper foreign companies. The ties are
particularly strong inside Mitsubishi and other keiretsu - the industrial
groupings which account for about 20 per cent of Japan's output.
Japanese businessmen reply that competition and not collusion has made life
tough for foreigners. They say that if Japanese business practices are
different from those in the west, they are not necessarily unfair. It may
mean they are superior.
The debate about Japan's economic structure is becoming more intense because
of a huge rise in the country's trade surplus. After shrinking in the late
1980s, the surplus soared 50 per cent last year to Dollars 78bn and stands
at a record Dollars 49bn in the first half this year.
The arguments concern far more than the nitty-gritty of trade disputes.
Japan is the first non-western nation with which the US and Europe have had
to share world economic leadership. While many commercial institutions have
been borrowed from the west, the way they operate is often different. Above
all, Japan has developed close co-operative relationships between government
and business - without having stifled the forces of competition. The
combination has served Japan well in its economic expansion, but has created
an economy which is particularly difficult for newcomers, including
foreigners, to enter.
Western trade officials concede Tokyo has done much to dismantle the formal
protection with which it surrounded its industries in the early postwar
years. With the exception of agriculture, few activities are now off-limits
to foreigners. But foreign access to the Japanese economy is still hampered
by the habits of mind, such as Japan-first attitudes, which grew up behind
the barriers.
These persist even in government. Although Miti, the powerful ministry of
trade and industry, has redirected its efforts from promoting exports to
boosting imports, in other agencies there is still a bias in favour of
domestic companies. It is particularly strong in high technology industries,
where Japanese groups feel vulnerable to western rivals.
For example, the public procurement of computers has been used to support
local manufacturers. According to industry data, foreign companies had a 41
per cent share of the computers sold to the Japanese private sector by
mid-1991, but only 10 per cent of the sales to the public sector. During
President George Bush's visit to Tokyo earlier this year, Japan promised the
US it would revise procurement rules. But it can take years for such pledges
to have an effect. The 1986 US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement set a target of
20 per cent for the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market. Six
years on, the figure is still only about 15 per cent.
The protectionist past has also left a deep impression on private industry.
From the early days of Japan's industrialisation in the 19th century, the
government encouraged favoured corporations, giving them low-cost loans and
other privileges. Smaller companies clustered around the giants. As Japan
staggered through post-war reconstruction and the sweeping economic changes
generated during the years of rapid growth, companies learnt the advantages
of long-term relationships. The result is the close links which characterise
Japanese commerce.
Foreign claims that keiretsu discriminate against foreigners are supported
by a study by the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank. Comparing
keiretsu buying patterns with those of non-keiretsu Japanese companies, Mr
Robert Lawrence, a leading US economist, found that keiretsu were less
likely to buy foreign goods.
Similarly, the OECD has found Japanese companies are less willing than
western groups to trade with foreign companies in the same industry.
According to an OECD report on Japan, intra-industry trade accounts for just
33 per cent of Japanese foreign trade, compared with 60 per cent for the US.
The legacy of protectionism also colours consumers' attitudes. Although
central Tokyo is increasingly cosmopolitan, in large areas of Japan there is
a deep-rooted belief in the virtues of buying Japanese. In a survey last
year, Jetro, the government's trade promotion agency, found one third of
Japanese would buy Japanese-made goods in preference to imports.
Moreover, even if these prejudices and the other effects of past
protectionism fade away, leading Japanese companies will still enjoy
long-lasting advantages - for example, ownership of the best land and of
distribution networks - acquired during the years of protection.
Newcomers cannot rely on the law to break anti-competitive arrangements,
largely because Japan lacks a strong tradition of equality before the law.
Disputes tend to be settled by negotiation, which favours the strong and
well-connected party over the weak.
Nevertheless, in spite of the legacy of protectionism, competition
flourishes in Japan. Japanese businessmen are right to assert their domestic
markets are among the world's most competitive, particularly in industries
in which Japan is strong - including motors, electronics, steel and machine
tools.
The genius of the Japanese authorities has been to influence market forces
without killing them. Few markets were ever completely closed to outsiders.
Even 20 years ago newcomers could enter an important industry such as cars -
as Chrysler Motor of the US did through investing in Mitsubishi Motors.
The result of competition is that today, while the US has only three
indigenous car makers, Japan has nine. It also has 10 large electronics
groups and no less than 115 companies producing machine tools.
Competition has made these industries formidable international competitors.
Their biggest achievements came from inter-company rivalry. For example, the
motor industry's low-cost manufacturing techniques - known as lean
production  - were pioneered in the 1950s by Toyota as a way of reducing
costs to undercut competitors.
The challenge facing foreign companies is to find a way through the maze of
collusion and competition. Those that do often find barriers which once
blocked them now operate in their favour, repelling other newcomers. But
many underestimate the time required. Mr William Best, managing director of
the Tokyo office of AT Kearney, the US management consultancy, says: 'There
are only 20-25 western companies with sales of more than Dollars 1bn in
Japan. They are mostly doing extremely well here. But many other companies
are going nowhere.'
There is no single route to success. Partnerships with Japanese groups have
paid off for many companies - especially in industries with close links
among Japanese companies. For example, while some US motor parts makers have
publicly berated Japanese manufacturers for failing to buy their products,
Robert Bosch, the German engineering company, has quietly developed links
inside keiretsu groupings. It is a shareholder in Nippon Denso, a component
maker and a Toyota affiliate, and in Japan Electronic Control Systems, a
company tied to Nissan, and has a joint venture with Mitsubishi Electrical,
a member of the Mitsubishi keiretsu.
Other companies, particularly in consumer markets, have tried partnerships
with Japanese companies only to abandon them later in favour of
independence. BMW, the German car maker, greatly increased sales after
choosing this course and building its own sales network. But even BMW and
other successful 'independents' say it is essential to imitate the Japanese
in establishing close long-term relationships with local suppliers and
customers.
Foreign companies have sometimes called on their governments to demand
market-opening measures. These efforts have secured the abolition of many
formal trade barriers, ranging from bans on foreign investment in strategic
industries to discriminatory duties on foreign alcohol. But attempts by
foreign governments to ease informal restrictions have usually proved
frustrating, as in the 1986 semiconductor agreement. Progress in increasing
foreigners' market share has been so slow that the issue has once more
developed into a trade dispute.
Structural change is glacial because there is little domestic pressure for
greater economic openness. Japanese consumers, who might benefit from lower
prices if more foreign companies were active in Japan, generally do not
complain. For their part, Japanese companies are often loath to abandon
long-term domestic links. A European machine tool maker says: 'In the US you
can get business by bidding 10 per cent less than a local supplier. In
Japan, 20 per cent is sometimes not enough.'
But this is not to say foreign companies' efforts are doomed. Japan's
imports nearly doubled in 1986-91. Foreign businessmen in Tokyo believe they
could double again over the next decade.
The Japanese government last month adopted a five-year economic plan which
emphasises improving the consumers' lot - including giving them more choice
by promoting imports.
Japanese politicians, too, are aware that export-led, import-blocking
expansion is a thing of the past. As Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a senior member of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, says: 'In many ways we have enjoyed very
good economic conditions in the past. But it is impossible to continue
behaving in the same way in the future.' However, he adds: 'Japanese people
have not really got out of their old ways of living and thinking. Change
will require a great deal of effort.'

Rudi Mueller, UBS executive vice president Europe and chairman and chief
executive of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has wasted no time in hiring the services
of outgoing British Steel chairman Sir Robert Scholey (above) who retired
after yesterday's agm - at the age of 70 after 47 years in the industry.
Sir Robert's appointment as a group adviser comes from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
in London but he will also be working with the parent bank, Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich. He joins Sir George Blunden, former deputy governor
of the Bank of England, who is also an adviser.
'The attraction for us is in his contacts across Continental Europe - in
industry, government and the European Commission' says Mueller, suggesting
that his role in 'one of the most sensitive industries in the world' has
given him a particularly unusual accumulation of experience.
Meanwhile Mueller dismisses any suggestion that the arrival of 'Black Bob' -
notorious for his tough rationalisations, notably this year the closure of
the Ravenscraig steel plant - might unsettle UBS staff. 'I do the Black Bob
duty here' says the UBS P &amp; D boss.

Brian Kent, who has combined the role of chairman and chief executive of
Staveley Industries for the past four years, has appointed Roy Hitchens from
BOC to take over as chief executive from October.
Kent, who says he was never totally happy combining the two roles, will be
61 years old in September, and intends to remain full-time for just another
twelve months, and thereafter function as a non-executive chairman.
Currently managing directer of the UK gases division of BOC, Hitchens, 51,
has also been involved for 13 years in BOC's international health care
division. Kent says that the 'mental map' Hitchens has formed - which also
includes experience in process and mechanical services contracting at
Matthew Hall and process engineering at GEC - prepares him well for
Staveley's three lines of business: minerals, measurement, and mechanical
and electrical services.
While Staveley reported its first fall (by 13 per cent) in pre-tax profits
for nine years during the financial year ending March 31 1992, Kent says the
balance sheet is very strong, giving Hitchens six months to get to know the
business before deciding on what Staveley's next strategic move is to be.

The death of Sir Patrick Meaney this month ended one of the best-known
partnerships at the top of British business. Hence Rank Organisation is not
going to be hurried into finding a long-term replacement for Sir Patrick,
who had been chairman since 1983.
Rank announced yesterday that Sir Leslie Fletcher (above), who has been a
non-executive director since 1984, has been appointed chairman. However,
since Rank's non-executive directors normally retire on reaching the age of
70, and Sir Leslie is less than three months away from his 70th birthday,
the assumption is that he will only be doing the job temporarily,
Sir Leslie, a chartered accountant who went into merchant banking with
Helbert Wagg &amp; Co, is a well known industrialist. He was chairman of Glynwed
International between 1971 and 1986, and is currently chairman of Westland
and deputy chairman of RMC Group.
Rank's chief executive Michael Gifford, who along with Sir Patrick, is
credited with revitalising a group which had lost its way in the early
1980's, dismissed suggestions yesterday that he might accept the
chairmanship.
He said that it was not appropriate to combine the jobs of chairman and
chief executive and he thought it was very difficult to bring in a new chief
executive if the chairman had been doing the job before. Gifford said that
Sir Leslie had 'been around and done it all'.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Technology: Eloquent idea stresses that learning is a verb -
A mighty mouse is pushing back the walls of the language laboratory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The months and years of struggling to learn a foreign language using books
and tapes may be numbered. A plan to develop Europe's first low-cost
digitalised language learning laboratory has recently won EC backing, with
the specific aim of making language learning easier, interactive, and more
affordable.
The European project, named Eloquent, will design and produce software for a
computer workstation which can operate as a stand-alone unit or within a
network.
'The traditional language learning experience is highly inefficient,' says
Prof Stephen Hagen, Eloquent's project director. 'We intend to create a
system that gives flexible and open learning, freeing both student and tutor
from their conventional roles.'
Traditional language teaching methods and materials often fail to address
the very different learning requirements of individual students.
Recent research by the National Council for Education Technology found that,
on average, students only absorb 10 per cent of what they read; 50 per cent
of what they hear and see; 70 per cent of what they say themselves; and 90
per cent of what they do themselves.
'The NCET study is further evidence that the student has to be actively
participating and using all his or her senses to learn effectively. The
multi-media option of Eloquent offers this solution,' says Prof Hagen.
The Eloquent workstation is based on Acorn A5000 and A540 computers. The
language programme is written onto high-density CD-ROM (compact-disc read
only memory ) and optical read-write discs are used to record the student's
responses, either spoken or written.
A record of the student's progress is recorded on disk. If a number of
workstations are connected in a network, a tutor can access any of the units
while the students are working, interacting and giving guidance.
A French lesson, for example, might provide the student with a colour video
of a busy Paris street. The film scene would hide several 'hot spots'. With
the click of a computer mouse, the student can select parts of the program
to explore.
Thus, a click over the baker's shop in the video will provide the student
with a more detailed view of the inside of a baker's shop, either in moving
or still pictures. The student may then be asked to identify certain items,
make a purchase or hold a conversation. These are recorded and filed, either
for a tutor to check later, or for the student to return to. A double click
on the mouse would return the student to the street scene.
Other developments being planned for Eloquent include using foreign language
satellite broadcasts which the workstation could receive via telephone or
cable. The broadcasts could then be sampled, allowing the student to select
his or her own programme.
It is the cost of the Eloquent system, however, which has most excited the
language learning establishment. The basic cost of an Acorn workstation,
disc and other software, will be less than Pounds 2,000. However, it is
estimated that about 65 per cent of UK schools and colleges already use
Acorn computers, so upgrading these existing computers will greatly reduce
costs.
Eloquent's initial budget of Pounds 1m will be half-met by the EC, with the
remainder coming from the consortium partners: City Technology Colleges,
Acorn Computers and Crystal Presentations from the UK, Dida-El (Italy), Link
(Germany), Multi-Media Systems Institute (Greece) and Learnout and Hauspie
(Belgium).

FT  30 JUL 92 / Technology: CD-I ushers in new era of training - Paul Taylor
outlines the advantages and prospects of multimedia packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
In the UK it is hardly possible to pass a poster site without noticing
Philips touting its new CD-I (Compact Disc-Interactive) technology. By
plugging a CD-I player into an ordinary television set, customers gain
access to a world of multimedia programmes which can entertain, teach and
train.
Using five inch diameter optical discs to store sound, video images, text
and graphics, CD-I technology promises to reshape corporate training
methods, providing savings and improving effectiveness.
CD-I is a new form of the interactive video (IV) technology which has become
popular for company training programmes. IV training packages or
'courseware' need a separate desktop computer, but CD-I's digital discs can
be played back on an inexpensive, compact and portable CD-I player and a TV
set.
Trainees can control the pace of lessons, make choices by mouse pointer, and
get feedback.
Interactive video software is a proven training medium. Advocates claim its
advantages include higher levels of learning success, more flexible
learning, and a sharp reduction in training time.
Bigger savings are claimed for the CD-I technology of Philips, Sony and
Matsushita. Player prices start at about Pounds 600 in the UK and are
expected to fall.
Peter Copeland, founder and chairman of Sussex-based Futuremedia, a
multimedia software pioneer, says CD-I discs may cut training costs.
Software suppliers like Futuremedia are racing to deliver the first CD-I
training packages. Copeland's 10-year-old company, with 60 employees and a
turnover of more than Pounds 5m, built its business producing, publishing,
and distributing interactive video discs and conventional computer-based
training (CBT) titles.
With 46 interactive discs, including 11 CD-I titles, in production,
Futuremedia claims a pivotal position in the multimedia training software
industry. Titles include a three-disc programme with Thames Valley TEC and
the National Retail Training Consortium.
Lloyds Bank, British Gas, the Post Office, Glaxo, IBM and Ford saw
interactive video as a way to cut training costs and improve effectiveness.
The first Ford interactive video programme, to pass training in statistical
process control (SPC) to shopfloor level, has involved more than 400,000
people so far.
Interactive video courseware will remain the backbone of Futuremedia's
business for the present. The company has more than 100 IV titles in its
catalogue of which it has produced about 20 per cent. Copeland hopes however
that CD-I software sales will help attain a target of Pounds 7.5m in sales
this year and Pounds 100m by the end of the decade.
The UK market for multimedia training is estimated at about Pounds 250m,
from a total professional training market, including hardware, of about
Pounds 20bn.
Having proved the concept of interactive computer-based training with
optical videodisc, and with CD-I about to burst on the market, Copeland
believes that multimedia will swiftly replace traditional corporate training
methods and 'industrial-age classroom training.'

FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Dream Team fantasy worth every
dollar - Peter Berlin peers beyond the hype to see what makes America's
basketball players the toast of the Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR the matches in the men's Olympic basketball tournament have followed
a simple formula. A team with one man who plays in the National Basketball
Association - the top US professional league  - will beat a team with no NBA
players. A team with two NBA players will beat a team with one. And a team
with 11 NBA players pulverises everyone.
The German team offers a perfect example of the power of the NBA. It has one
NBA player: Detlef Schrempf. Last year Schrempf was voted the league's best
'sixth man'. In a sport in which teams have five men on the court, this is a
dubious honour. Schrempf would no doubt prefer a more prominent role but on
a strong team, such as his Indiana Pacers, the sixth man is important.
Schrempf cannot walk on air like Michael Jordan, sink impossible shots like
Larry Bird or conjure passes like Magic Johnson. He does not dominate under
the basket like Patrick Ewing. But he is versatile. He jumps, shoots, passes
and rebounds better than the average NBA player and a lot better than any of
his German team-mates.
After two games, Schrempf leads his team in practically every statistical
category. He has played nearly every minute. He has scored 35 per cent of
their points. Schrempf is responsible for nearly half his team's defensive
rebounds and half their steals.
Against Spain, Germany trailed early on. Schrempf sparked their recovery.
Against unfancied, unknown Angola, Germany were behind by seven points at
half-time. Schrempf led the fight back, though in the dying minutes Angola
steadied themselves.
Predictably the smaller, quicker Angolans made Germany look ponderous and
unimaginative. But the Angolans were also making the Germans look stupid.
The agile, brave Jean Coceicao attacked the basket at every opportunity.
When the Germans fell back to block his routes, Manuel Sousa and Anibal
Moreira used the space and time to score with three-point shots.
German defenders began to shout at each other. But Schrempf stayed cool. He
sank his shots while team-mates missed and rallied the defence. As Angola's
last-second surge ended in a collision of bodies, Schrempf stood alone
beneath the basket coolly clasping the ball and a one-point win in his
hands.
On Monday, Croatia took on America's Dream Team.
'I never saw that kind of defence before,' said a Croat when the US won
103-70. The only Croats who looked comfortable against the Americans were
Drazen Petrovic, even though he tried to do too much himself, and the 7ft
1in, 18-stone Stojko Vrankovic, in his limited role of the beast under the
basket.
The quality in depth of the US Olympic team is unprecedented. As a team it
is capable of a level of play unseen even in the NBA. There are many critics
who would rather it remained unseen. In part, this is because the US team
has carried the once-amateur Olympics to new commercial extremes.
One of the US Olympic Committee's sponsors, Reebok, has designed an
especially garish track suit for Americans to wear at medal ceremonies. 'And
I will be watching to make sure there is compliance,' said John Krimsky, the
committee's deputy secretary-general.
'He can watch as much as he likes,' countered Jordan, who has a contract
with Nike, 'but there is no way in the world I would wear a suit made by
Reebok.'
'You are not dealing with a sports team, but seven or eight rock stars,'
said Dick Pound, the International Olympic Committee member responsible for
the Olympics' more aggressive commercial approach and certainly not a critic
of the Dream Team. 'We may have to give some thought as to whether we go the
rock star route or have a rock star quota.'
Olympics administrators are not the only ones to view the Dream Team's
appearance in Barcelona as an experiment. As one US journalist said: 'The
test of whether this has been worth it for the players will come next spring
after they have been playing for 18 months non-stop.'
Even Olympic team-mates feel ambivalent. Mike Barrowman, the US swimmer,
said: 'This is the Olympics, not the NBA. I love these guys. I want them to
kill everybody. But this is our chance to come through for our country. We
only get that chance every four years. They get it every day.'
According to Dick Pound: 'Americans get excited if they win anything. It
doesn't matter if the Dream Team take on a girls' high school team, they
enjoy it. NBC's ratings seem to grow with the Dream Team's margin of
victory. It is certainly disturbing that the people of the world's only
superpower enjoy seeing their boys beat up small, weak nations, but it is
hardly the team's fault.'
After beating Croatia, Jordan said: 'There is not a single team in the
tournament that can beat us.' While the Croatians may secretly hope to
ambush the US in the final, they know that Jordan is right. Even so, they
want the Dream Team in Barcelona.
After Tuesday's game Petar Skansi, Croatia's coach, said: 'We have players
with the talent to play against the NBA players. But to do that they must
play in the NBA. Kukoc can't play better in Europe. He is the very best
player here. Not there.'
The fans want the Dream Team in Spain, too. They roared when Croatia staged
small rallies. But when the Americans replied by producing their most
breath-taking play, the response was tellingly different. The roar was
replaced by gasps and by the shutter-snap of 1,000 cameras.
The Dream Team's games are unlikely to produce the wrenching tension of
Germany's win over Angola or Spain's 101-100 victory against Brazil.
But when the US players do things the spectators never imagined humans could
do; when Jordan walks on air; when Magic makes the ball disappear behind his
back and materialise in a team-mate's hands, and when Charles Barkley, the
pantomime villain, slam-dunks and swings on the rim against the backdrop of
a Milky Way of twinkling flashbulbs - why, then, the Dream Team provides the
fantasy that sport should offer.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Prosecution threat to water companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCIPLINARY action is being considered against 28 of the 39 water companies
in England and Wales over breaches in drinking-water standards, the Drinking
Water Inspectorate said yesterday.
At least three companies may face prosecution for instances 'where it is
very probable that water was supplied that was unfit for human consumption',
said Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, presenting the inspectorate's annual
report. But he declined to name the companies while investigations
continued.
The 28 companies that may face disciplinary action include the 10
water-services companies.
Nine companies on the inspectorate's list have breached the standards for
permissible levels of bacteria in waterworks and five for levels of faecal
bacteria. The others are included for bacteria in reservoirs or for
supplying inadequate data.
However, Mr Healey said drinking water 'is of a very high quality'. 'We are
talking about fractions away from perfection.' Even where water failed to
pass the inspectorate's standards, which incorporates both UK and EC
directives, the inspectorate's advisers had concluded that there was no risk
to public health, he added.
The comments are likely to fuel the debate about whether the UK's water
standards are too high and too expensive.
Mr Michael Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies, said: 'We have
been screaming for the past few years that customers are paying billions in
higher water bills for measures not necessary for their health.'
Water companies have pledged to spend Pounds 28bn during the 1990s to meet
EC standards. Of that, Pounds 1.8bn will be spent by 1995 to meet
drinking-water standards.
The inspectorate's annual report - the second since it was created in 1990 -
showed an apparent deterioration in water quality because of an increase in
pesticide levels. A total of 98.7 per cent of tests passed the national
legal standards, compared with 99 per cent the year before.
However, the 'statistically significant' drop might be due to increased
testing for pesticides, the inspectorate said. Excluding pesticides, the
'pass rate' had risen from 99.2 per cent to 99.3 per cent.
Drinking Water 1991. HMSO. Pounds 25.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Eventing, killer heat and rock-hard
ground test British grit - Keith Wheatley describes the complex equations
that determine physical survival and success in Olympic equestrianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW sports demand the individual bravery and team discipline of three-day
event riding. Over a cross-country course that can kill horses and riders, a
competitor must weigh the needs of his horse, his own life and limbs - and
the points on the team board.
Britain's Richard Walker was shaken when he came off the cross-country
course at El Montanya yesterday. His horse Jacanda had refused and thrown
him head first over the 5ft 13th fence. 'I changed his stride to find the
right spot and when I pressed the accelerator the revs weren't there,' said
Walker, 41.
'I'm very frustrated. Jacanda didn't make a mistake. The problem was between
the hat and the saddle.' The pressure on Walker had been enormous. Britain
had entered the second phase of the three-day event in first place after a
totally unexpected success in the dressage section.
Walker's role as lead of the four British riders was to ride a conservative
clear round, building a platform for team-mates to take a few chances, cut
times and increase the team's lead.
Mary Thomson, this year's Badminton winner and the team's rookie, had
expected to be given this sometimes frustrating spot.
'You tend to forfeit any chance of the individual gold medal if you ride
first, since you must just stay out of trouble and go for a clear round, not
really watching the clock,' she said.
She was among the first to console the unhappy Walker as he unsaddled among
the olive trees that shade the assembly area. Given the topography, it is
scarcely surprising that the course has far more rise and fall than is usual
at international events. 'The climbs are quite severe and at the top the
horse doesn't expect to have to put maximum efffort into a jump,' said
Walker.
Although he fell at the 16th, it was at Hell Hole, the tiered 13th, a
terrace culminating in a water splash, that Walker's problems began. Jacanda
stumbled into the pond and Walker fell sideways from the saddle, balanced
for a second between disaster and recovery.
Although experts rate the fences tough, it is the combination of factors
that made El Montanya a Waterloo for eventers. The ground was rock-hard,
while heat and humidity made it impossible to push horses to the limit. As
Walker said: 'I have to look to the future with this horse as well as try to
win at the Olympics.' The course vet fought to save the Russian horse Dakoz
after it collapsed with heat exhaustion.
After Walker's mishap, the British team met for an urgent re-think of
strategy. It was decided that Dixon and Thompson, riding third and fourth
respectively, would take the 'chicken routes' at the more daunting fences,
losing time but increasing the chances of a clear round.
Britain's main rivals were not so constrained. Current world champion Blyth
Tait of New Zealand scored a blistering clear round on Messiah, heading the
leader board on 13 minutes 22 seconds, the day's fastest.
Yet Walker's bad luck did have some bonuses for his team. The 16th fence
made them wary. Most opted for the long route after Walker, although few had
before. Sweden's Erik Duvander was thrown heavily at the same spot and
thereafter most competitors treated it with care.
It was at the same spot, rounding the pond, that Karen Dixon suffered her
bad luck. As Get Smart leaned into the turn the much-loved horse threw a
hind shoe. Nevertheless, Dixon was able to complete a clear round that even
with time penalties kept her in the top six.
Final British rider Ian Stark on Murphy Himself rode the same disciplined
pattern, in the baking heat of afternoon.
Overall, it was a superb effort that left Britain in second place on 248
points, eight behind NZ with Australia third (273). Mary Thomson's
first-rate ride put her in third place individually, with today's
show-jumping still to come.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Boardman races to superbike gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BARCELONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRIS BOARDMAN rode his winged superbike to an Olympic gold medal in the
4,000-metre pursuit final in Barcelona last night.
Boardman struck first gold not only for Britain and himself but also for
Lotus, the Norwich-based sports car company, which developed his monocoque
bicycle with small ground effect wings, where the handles would be on a
normal racing bicycle.
As he stood on the victor's podium in the warm-up area in the middle of the
banked track, the Lotus engineers pressed against nearby railings
photographing the man who had ridden a revolutionary machine to fame.
Boardman, who said afterwards he lacked confidence all week, attacked Jens
Lehmann, his German opponent, from the start. On the first lap of the
250-metre oval, he was a third of a second ahead. By the fourth lap he had
pushed that lead to one second - a sizeable advantage in a race in which one
circuit takes 16 seconds. Another 750 metres and it was 2 seconds, and the
German must have known the race was lost.
The crowd sensed victory was in the Briton's grasp and they roared Boardman
on. With one lap to go the hound caught the hare and Boardman raised his
fist to begin his victory lap early.
In the semi-finals an hour before he had enjoyed an easier passage than his
German opponent. Lehmann was taken to the line by New Zealander Gary
Anderson, winning by 4/10ths of a second in 4 mins 27.23 seconds.
Boardman, in contrast, only rode 4 mins 29.332 seconds, five seconds outside
the world record he had set the night before. Boardman built a 3.5 second
lead over Mark Kingsland of Australia, easing off to win by 2.9 seconds.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Foreign investment in gilts rises to Pounds 726m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS investors increas-ed their purchases of UK government bonds last
month, allaying fears that lack of foreign demand might create difficulties
for the government in meeting its funding requirements.
According to the Bank of England's final money supply data, overseas
investors bought Pounds 726m of gilts in June compared with Pounds 378m in
May, reversing a downward trend since April. Overseas buying of gilts has
never been as high as expected since the election and seemed to have been
discouraged after the rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danes.
The Bank's figures also showed that net official gilt sales in June were
Pounds 2.6bn, bringing to Pounds 10.3bn the total for net sales in the year
to the end of June.
The news came as the Confederation of British Industry urged the government
not to set such strict limits on public-sector borrowing that measures to
stimulate recovery were ruled out.
The CBI's national council agreed that a rise in borrowing to finance higher
investment or measures to boost the recovery were desirable.
'Whatever happens in Germany, it does not mean that the UK government has no
room for manoeuvre,' said Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI.
'The constraints on monetary policy point to fiscal policy as the main route
through which government can influence the economy.'
The council agreed on four measures the government could take: Maintain
public-sector investment programmes - such as road and rail investment  -
within the constraints imposed on public spending last year.
Meet the economies required to stay within the targets by restraining
public-sector pay.
Take action to build confidence and bring forward spending. Such measures
could include a stimulus to the housing market and a replacement for the
business expansion scheme.
Increase government support for UK exporters.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Norton Rose leads on legal advice for takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTON Rose, the City solicitors, was the leading legal adviser to companies
and financial advisers involved in takeovers during the first half of this
year.
The firm heads the takeover advice table for the first time, as a result of
its part in 10 bids with a combined value of Pounds 4.5bn. The table,
produced by Acquisitions Monthly, places Clifford Chance second, with seven
deals, worth Pounds 3.9bn, and Herbert Smith third, with five deals, worth
Pounds 1.2bn.
The two firms finishing above Norton Rose in last year's full-year rankings
 -Slaughter and May, which finished first with 24 deals, worth Pounds 5.5bn,
and Freshfields, which came second with 21 deals, worth Pounds 4.2bn - came
seventh and fifth respectively in the first half of this year.
The magazine comments that Freshfields is interesting, as it finished top in
1990 and in the first half of last year. The magazine says the first half of
this year has been 'a less than fruitful period in a very competitive
sector'.
The first-half figures are dominated by the Pounds 3.7bn bid by Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corporation for Midland Bank. Norton Rose acted for HSBC,
and Clifford Chance for Midland.
Norton Rose also owes its position at the top of the table to its part in
four of the seven largest deals in the first half of this year. They include
the Pounds 613m Redland-Steetley deal.
Excluding the Midland deal, the top 10 firms acted on deals totalling Pounds
4.2bn, some Pounds 700m less than in the first half of last year.
The number of deals also fell from 66 in the first half of last year to 53
in the first half of this year.
The magazine points out, however, that over the past two years the trend has
been for takeover activity to pick up in the latter half of the year.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Lotus gears up to peddle innovative
design concept - John Griffiths analyses commercial prospects for the
hi-tech cycle that has fulfilled British Olympic hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOTUS Engineering, the consultancy design and engineering arm of General
Motors' British sports-car subsidiary, is looking for a partner to produce
and distribute a roadgoing form of the 'supercycle' with which Chris
Boardman of the UK has won an Olympic gold medal.
It wants versions of the LotusSport pursuit cycle used by Boardman, known as
the Windcheetah, on world markets by early next year. It would offer a more
traditional riding position but would incorporate the basic concept of a
one-piece moulded monocoque frame.
Failure to do so may risk losing the benefit of the unprecedented publicity
for the machine. 'We could lose the market to makers of replicas which might
look the same but lack its integrity and performance,' Lotus said yesterday.
Lotus plans to build a very limited number of machines over the next few
months at its Group Lotus headquarters in Hethel, Norfolk, which has
extensive facilities created originally for sports car production. The
machines will be built for top competition cyclists and will cost at least
Pounds 5,000 each.
Lotus might go on to build up to 1,000 somewhat less expensive units a year
 -forgoing carbon fibre at Pounds 330 a kilogramme and titanium at Pounds
150 a kilogramme - within its existing facilities.
It is mainly interested in finding a partner to which it can either license
the manufacture of a much higher volume of cheaper machines, a subcontractor
capable of building them - or taking part in a joint venture that might lead
to purpose-built facilities being created at Hethel.
Lotus Engineering does not expect initial derivatives of the 'supercycle' to
be sufficiently cheap to challenge manufacturers such as Raleigh in the
conventional cycle market.
The cycle is seen as presenting a potential challenge both to conventional
racing and quasi-racing cycles and to the fad for 'mountain' bikes.
Lotus lays claim to having done substantial development work on the cycle,
and has invested some Pounds 125,000 in it. But it acquired the rights to
the machine from its creator, Norwich-based engineer Mr Michael Burrows, who
had spent several years trying to interest cycle manufacturers in his
concept.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Japanese praise British companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies underrate the standing in which they are held by Japanese
business customers, according to a survey from Touche Ross, the accountancy
firm, released yesterday.
The survey of 100 British and Japanese companies showed that all felt
relations had remained stable or improved over the past five years. Japanese
companies said UK suppliers had improved their communication skills, quality
and attention to customers.
The British companies believed improved relations resulted as more Japanese
companies traded in the UK.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Board selection methods attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY non-executive directors are appointed was strongly criticised
yesterday in a survey published by the Stock Exchange and ProNed, an
organisation that promotes their role in British companies, Andrew Jack
writes.
Only 14 per cent of 491 chairman, chief executives, directors, institutional
investors and audit partners believed that the way non-executives were
chosen was satisfactory, while most felt that non-executives were not
effective in their jobs.
Few companies examined had a nomination committee, a written job profile or
a detailed search procedure to help select non-executives. The chairman
generally had dominant influence over their selection.
The majority called for a code of best practice to help formalise
appointments procedures, while more than half of the institutions and
auditors want a more formal selection process that could be explained to
shareholders.
Mr Colin St Johnston, managing director of ProNed, called selection
processes for non-executives 'slapdash' and called for 'a much more
rigorous, independent and objective process of appointment to ensure they
are used effectively'.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Tories to press ahead on Maastricht ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT intends to press ahead before the end of the year with
ratifying the Maastricht treaty. This in the light of the planned Danish
statement in the autumn on the crisis prompted by its referendum which
rejected the treaty.
The foreign office is keen that the UK should take the initiative on the
Maastricht bill during its presidency of the European Commission, and is
confident that the proposed statement, which is expected about the time of
the Tory conference in October, will enable progress to be made.
Before the Commons rose earlier this month, some ministers were paving the
way for a possible delay in the Maastricht bill to next year, but the
foreign office believes the UK must proceed with ratification during its
presidency if its position is not to be undermined.
While all plans are on a contingency basis until the French referendum on
September 20, ministers have begun discussions about how to handle Tory
rebels. One option being considered is to separate the different strands of
unease about Europe among Tory MPs on issues such as the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, and frontiers.
The idea would be to break up 'Euro-scepticism' as such, and to focus on
difficulties MPs may have with individual aspects of the UK's links with the
rest of the EC.
Apart from hardline Euro-sceptics, Tories who have expressed concern about
those issues may be offered meetings with senior ministers most closely
involved, including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
That move to allay concerns would run alongside a tough parliamentary regime
for the bill itself. A guillotine or timetable motion looks unlikely, since
it would focus opposition among other parties, but votes to curtail
individual debates on proposed amendments to the bill will still be needed.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Government rejects Canary Wharf purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has rejected the proposal from Canary Wharf's administrators
that it should buy a building at the east London development to be used by
civil servants, according to a financier with a close knowledge of the
project.
The Canary Wharf administrators, who have been running the project since it
ran into financial difficulties in the spring, had been pinning their hopes
for a rescue of the project on this sale proposal.
They are nonetheless encouraged by a decision taken on Tuesday by the
government to involve itself in a set of complex negotiations that may allow
the building of the proposed extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line
into the east of the capital.
The decision is understood to have been taken at a meeting on Tuesday of a
special cabinet sub-committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, the
Lord privy seal.
The government is continuing its negotiations with the administrators on
renting space for between 2,000 and 5,000 officials at Canary Wharf. It is
insisting that rent should be at the market price, including a rent-free
period for the first five years.
The Treasury also remains adamant that the Jubilee Line will be built only
if it receives a cast-iron assurance that the Pounds 170m private-sector
contribution to the project - at today's prices  - will be made.
The government has also told the administrators that it would be interested
to receive a detailed proposal from them proving that if the government
takes space at Canary Wharf, the private-sector contribution to the Jubilee
Line would be made.
That is the nearest the Government has come to admitting that its decision
on whether to move to Canary Wharf could be influenced by whether the
private-sector contribution to the Jubilee Line project is made.
Canary Wharf's best chance of staying out of liquidation requires selling it
to a new owner, likely to be a consortium of investors. Potential investors
 -which include the UK conglomerate Hanson, the original developer of Canary
Wharf Mr Paul Reichmann and the US media tycoon Mr Larry Tisch - have made
clear that they will make a formal bid only if the government guarantees to
take space at Canary Wharf and if the Jubilee Line is built.
So those bidders must now present a complex proposal to the government,
showing how they can guarantee that the Pounds 170m is paid for the Jubilee
Line if the officials move to Canary Wharf.
There is an effective deadline of mid September.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Smith calls for summer offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH called on the shadow cabinet yesterday to dedicate the summer
recess to exploiting the growing unease among Conservative backbench MPs
over the gloomy economic outlook.
Chairing the first meeting of his new frontbench team, the Labour leader
urged colleagues to use every opportunity to call the government to account
for 'sitting on their hands' as unemployment rises.
The strategy is clearly intended to play on Tory fears. This week several
MPs warned that Mr Norman Lamont's chancellorship might be vulnerable if
there was no sign of an upturn by the autumn.
Mr Smith also attacked the failure of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to
use Britain's presidency of the European Community to seek co-ordinated
action on jobs and interest rates with its EC partners.
Mr Smith's attack stopped short, however, of pressing for a revaluation of
the D-Mark in the EC's exchange rate mechanism - a move which he had hinted
during the Labour leadership election might win his backing.
Instead, the opposition leader stressed the need to tackle unemployment and
the fear of unemployment, which he said was sapping confidence and
undermining investment.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Imbert connects crime with poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Imbert, Metro-politain Police commissioner, yesterday linked an
increase in crime to poverty and social deprivation. Presenting his last
annual report before he retires, Sir Peter said: 'The notion that there is a
link between crime and social deprivation is a compelling one . . . there is
a need to offer hope to those most disadvantaged if we are to see any
reduction in crime levels.'
Sir Peter said that crime in London had increased 11 per cent last year,
largely because the capital was seen as the natural mecca for criminals and
most of the country's wealth was concentrated there.
His report paints a stark picture of crime in the capital that last year
included 75 per cent of the country's drugs market and 75 per cent of
frauds. In addition, London, with a seventh of the country's population,
last year suffered more than 50 per cent of all armed robberies, and 20 per
cent of all murders and rapes.
Sir Peter's report discloses that a total of 945,000 crimes were committed,
a rise of 11 per cent, and 113,000 people were arrested, 3 per cent down on
the previous year.
The 41,000 casualties on London's roads left 369 dead, 7,000 seriously
injured and 34,000 slightly hurt. In addition, 184,000 people and vehicles
were searched resulting in 25,000 arrests.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Print union may test its strength: Casual labour brings the
threat of action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST IVES, the second-biggest commercial printer in Britain, is drifting into
a dispute with the GPMU, the print union, which may prove an important test
of union power in the general printing industry.
The issue at St Ives is the use of casual labour. The union objects to the
fact that, to cover for peaks in work flow, St Ives is employing a growing
number of temporary workers in the unskilled finishing area, where magazines
and books are bound and packed.
The dozens of temporary workers hired from employment agencies earn Pounds 3
an hour, compared with the hourly rate for full-time workers of Pounds 5.85.
The dispute is typical at this point in the business cycle. Business remains
too uncertain to increase permanent staffing but surges of work require
extra labour. The pattern will be familiar to managers and union officials
in many other industries.
But, for the printing industry, it may have an additional significance. The
breaking of union power in the national newspaper industry in the 1980s did
not, on the surface, spread to the general printing industry.
Some analysts, however, believe that a combination of labour law reforms,
technological change and recession has 'hollowed out' union power in general
printing, too, over the past few years.
It is true that industrial disputes have been rare in the 1990s, and print
managers have generally got what they wanted on flexibility and on changing
working practices, especially in machine rooms.
Union derecognition has been rare, though. Print workers remain among the
best organised and best paid in the country - at St Ives, the average
shopfloor worker earns Pounds 25,000, according to the company. The
perishability of their product, at least in sectors such as magazines, still
gives the unions industrial clout. Moreover, the merger of two leading print
unions to form the GPMU may also help in resisting the hostile trends.
To date, print managers have not tested the hypothesis that union power has
crumbled. BPCC, Britain's biggest printer, did provoke a rash of disputes
earlier this year as it attempted to reduce overcapacity.
Yet the union claims to have emerged unscathed and, on the crucial issue of
casualisation, it says that BPCC agreed to pay temporary workers the same as
full-time workers.
St Ives, one of the most union-friendly companies in the industry, is run by
Mr Bob Gavron, an urbane Labour supporter, and is not cut out to be the News
International of the general printing industry.
The company said yesterday: 'We don't want to pick a fight with the union,
but we need temporary labour because of the nature of the work flow and we
don't want to pay more than the market rate for it.' The company adds that
it has gone to great lengths to keep its 3,000 full-time staff through the
recession, even when there has not been enough work for many of them.
Mr Tony Dubbins, leader of GPMU, is not impressed. He believes that St Ives
has taken a decision to 'casualise' the finishing area and that, if it
succeeds, the rest of the industry will follow.
Hence the 1,000 GPMU members who work in the seven St Ives web-offset plants
 -printing magazines such as The Economist, Company and New Woman - will
next week start to ballot on industrial action. Initially they will be
balloted on taking action short of a strike - an overtime ban. If that does
not bite, St Ives may face the most serious printing strike for years.
Will well paid print workers go on strike in a recession and risk losing
their jobs? It is not something St Ives wants to test. But it may be doing
so in a few weeks' time.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The BCCI Indictments: Global trail of bribery - Richard
Donkin traces worldwide fraud and corruption alleged in yesterday's charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BCCI was involved in a vast web of corruption across the Third World,
according to US indictments yesterday.
Court documents listed 12 countries, three organisations and numerous
officials as beneficiaries of the fraud which spirited away some Dollars 5bn
from BCCI coffers, including money from depositors.
The documents outlined a number of deceptions perpetrated on the World Bank
and the IMF. In one of these schemes BCCI officials enlisted the help of
Pakistani government officials in 1979 to hoodwink the IMF into believing
Pakistani national reserves were higher than they were.
A secret BCCI loan to the government enabled it to avoid credit restrictions
and a devaluation of the rupee. In another Pakistan-based scheme BCCI
violated Pakistani central bank controls to earn preferential banking rates.
The main fraud indictment said that from BCCI's inception, the group had
been undercapitalised and had granted large and numerous loans to favoured
associates of the defendants. The documents named Sheikh Kamal Adham and Mr
Sayed Jawhary, Mr Adham's accountant, as the beneficiaries of some of these
uncollectable loans.
The alleged schemes are said to have included frauds on the regulators of
Washington-based Financial General Bankshares, the National Bank of Georgia,
the Independence Bank of Encino, and Banco Mercantil in Colombia.
Members of the criminal enterprise at BCCI, said prosecutors, made
systematic efforts to intimidate and influence the press with pay-offs. They
spent depositors' money on charities to garner public praise and increase
the political power of BCCI. They hired politicians and officials to court
influence in countries where they wanted to set up operations.
At the same time assets, it is alleged, were being bought with depositors'
funds and maintained separately from the BCCI group. They are said to have
been bought in the names of Mr Adham, Mr Jawhary, Dr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi
businessman, Mr Faisal Saud Al Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman, and Mr
Mohammed M. Hammoud, a Lebanese businessman who, the indictment said,
'reportedly died' in 1990.
'When the major BCCI group banks were closed in July 1991,' the indictment
said, 'these nominees were in a position to assert title to the assets
purchased with depositors' funds. Assets purchased by the BCCI group in this
manner included US banks, real estate, and a major oil company in Pakistan.'
Two BCCI-controlled Cayman entities, ICIC Overseas and ICIC Holdings, were
allegedly used to maintain the sham. ICIC Overseas was used to create false
records concealing BCCI group liabilities and presenting false assets; ICIC
Holdings to hide stolen money.
According to the US documents, the fiddling of BCCI's loan books appears to
have run the whole gamut of fraud. Records listing some loan agreements were
prepared for auditors but the picture was distorted and disguised. Deposits
were not always recorded and others were incorrectly recorded.
During the period covered by the indictment, September 1 1977 to August 18
1991 - intriguingly, after the date that the Bank of England moved to close
down BCCI - it is alleged that members of BCCI enabled nations such as
Pakistan, Senegal, Zambia and Nigeria to evade fiscal restraints placed upon
them by the World Bank and the IMF.
Against this background, BCCI officials, specifically the founder, Mr Agha
Hasan Abedi, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, his right-hand man, were plotting to
deliver cash and other benefits to various finance ministers, heads of
state, central banks and senior executives of international and regional
organisations, all with the aim of increasing deposits - the life-blood of
the fraud.
While the indictment did not name names, it matched the catalogue of
corrupted officials to the Congo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal,
Tunisia and the Ivory Coast, Argentina and Peru.
The indictments against Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his
Washington law firm partner, outlined how they ran First American Bank. The
documents list when Mr Abedi or Mr Naqvi at BCCI were involved in the
appointment executives at the Washington bank and the selection of board
members.
Among the bribes Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were charged with taking from
BCCI were Dollars 10m of share profits, sham loans, and Dollars 16m of money
denominated as legal fees.
Mr Clifford and Mr Altman are also being sued in a civil suit by the
Manhattan district attorney for the return of more than Dollars 40m in
alleged bribes and illicit profits which they are alleged to have obtained.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Granada executive tipped to lead ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW QUINN, chief executive of Granada Television, has emerged as
favourite for the top job in ITV, running the Pounds 500m-a-year network.
The ITV companies have turned to Mr Quinn after Mr David Arculus, group
managing director of Emap, the publishing and exhibitions company, turned
the job down in spite of the offer of a package worth Pounds 400,000 a year.
Mr Quinn was one of the first to be considered for the job of chief
executive of the newly centralised ITV network. He turned it down, partly
because of serious managerial difficulties at Granada Television earlier
this year when Mr David Plowright, chairman of the company's television
operations, was forced to resign.
Having failed to get an acceptable outsider, ITV executives have now
returned to one of their own.
More than 70 people have been considered to run ITV when the new franchises
begin in January. Mr Quinn, who has worked at Granada Television for 27
years, originally in personnel, chaired an ITV committee that drew up the
rules for a new ITV network.
The rules are being considered by the Office of Fair Trading. It was not
clear last night whether Mr Quinn was prepared to take the chief executive's
job.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Fine art salerooms report fallin sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S and Christie's, the world's two largest fine art auctioneers,
yesterday announced their sales figures for the 1991-92 season, which is
just ending. They reveal a further decline in turnover, but clear signs that
the recession in the art market is bottoming out.
Sotheby's reported sales of Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 640m), a fall, in dollar
terms, of 15 per cent over the previous season. Christie's sales totalled
Pounds 609m (Dollars 1.082bn), 8 per cent down on 1990-91.
A year ago, both salerooms were recording reductions in turnover of almost
60 per cent compared with 1989-90.
As the market has contracted, rivalry between the two companies has
intensified. Sotheby's, based in New York, is reluctant to break down
regional turnovers and variations during the season.
Christie's, based in London, is keen to publicise that since last January
its sales, at Pounds 336m, show a 6 per cent rise on the same period in
1991. Sotheby's has confirmed that it, too, has done better this year, with
sales 5.8 per cent ahead of 1991.
Christie's also maintains that its share of the market is rising to its
highest level since the mid 1950s. It claims 49 per cent, up from 48 per
cent in 1990-91.
It has, however, included private treaty sales in this figure, in particular
the net price of Pounds 10m it secured by selling Holbein's portrait of a
'Lady with a Squirrel' to the National Gallery in London. Without private
treaty sales, Sotheby's probably still holds about 52 per cent of the
auction market.
The feature of the season has been the decline in the importance of
Impressionist and Modern art and the resurgence of Old Master paintings as
the key market, closely followed by furniture and jewels.
Phillips, the third in size of the London auction houses, has reported sales
of Pounds 85.3m for the season, a fall of 3 per cent on the year.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Phone code changes to be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES to telephone codes planned for Easter 1994 are to be delayed for a
year, the Office of Telecommunications announced yesterday.
Mr Bill Wigglesworth, acting director-general of Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator, also said that the period of parallel running
 -in which both old and new numbers would operate together  - would be
extended from three months to seven months.
Oftel decided to postpone the national code change (NCC) and extend the
period of parallel running after pressure from telecommunications users and
equipment manufacturers to allow them more time to prepare for the planned
changes.
The NCC will introduce a 10-digit numbering scheme throughout the UK to meet
the growing shortage of telephone numbers arising as new services are
introduced. There are 25m to 30m telephone customers in the UK and the
demand for numbers is growing at a rate of about 5 per cent a year, Oftel
said.
Under the proposed scheme, a single digit '1' would be added to all codes of
the form 0XX or 0XXX after the initial '0'. For example, London 071 would
become 0171. However, mobile services, freephones and premium rate services
would not be affected.
Five cities - Nottingham, Bristol, Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield  - which
are facing a more urgent number shortage, would be given new seven-digit
local numbers, Oftel said.
However, since the code changes were initially approved last September by
Sir Bryan Carsberg, then director-general of Oftel, there has been strong
criticism from the Telecommunications Managers Association over the costs of
introducing the changes.
The association believes those costs would be more than Pounds 3bn. Oftel
counters that the figure would be closer to Pounds 500m.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin American Debt Crisis: 'For us Mexicans, the crisis is
over' - Angel Gurria / The Key International Personalities / Ten years ago
next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world
financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story
for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled.
And they pose the question: Is there life after debt?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE debt issue was not the cause of the crisis, it was the end result. It
was only a manifestation of a long period of overspending and overvaluation
of the currency,' says Mr Angel Gurria, under-secretary for international
financial affairs at Mexico's Ministry of Finance, writes Stephen Fidler.
Mr Gurria was a leading negotiator for Mexico from the beginning of the
crisis.
'Everybody thought that oil prices would continue to rise and we counted on
a conventional wisdom which didn't materialise. We had a commodity that was
scarce and highly valued, and it looked as if it was going to stay that way
for ever. We had a public deficit equivalent to around 16-17 per cent of GDP
and a current account deficit financed with public debt.
'All this left no doubt as to what the next administration should do. . .
The agenda was very clear.'
When reserves dwindled, as a result of falling oil prices and capital
flight, Mexico made a key decision in August 1982 to approach the debt issue
as a political one, involving the governments of the rich countries, whose
banking systems would be threatened, rather than as a purely financial
problem, Mr Gurria says.
Now, he declares: 'For us, the debt problem is over. The foreign debt of
Mexico is now equivalent to 31 per cent of GDP, and it was as high as 76 per
cent. The public foreign debt is 24 per cent of GDP, and was 60 per cent.
With domestic debt at 13 per cent of GDP, all our public debt is equivalent
to 38 per cent of GDP.'

<TEXT>
ALL the ingredients of a systemic crisis were present when the international
debt crisis broke out in August 1982.
The combined foreign debt of the three largest Latin American countries
alone came to nearly Dollars 230bn and the portion of this debt owed to
commercial banks stood at Dollars 150bn.
Comparing this figure to the capital of the international banks that had the
greatest exposures in Latin America, we can see that their financial
structures were in no way capable of withstanding unilateral and chaotic
suspension of payments by the three leading Latin American debtors.
It was calculated that, in 1982, the claims on Mexico alone accounted for 44
per cent of the capital of the nine largest US banks. In August 1982, the
debtor countries were faced with an acute liquidity crisis. The maturity
structure of their external bank debt had become much shorter, at a time
when the economic climate was marked by recession, high interest rates and
falling commodity prices.
A great deal was at stake for all the parties concerned.
For the banks with the largest exposures, their very survival was in
question. The fact that these banks played a key role in the international
financial system meant that the system itself was ultimately in jeopardy.
You can imagine what the consequences of a failure of the financial system
would have been.
The stakes were equally high for the debtor countries, even though the risks
they incurred were less obvious to some. A unilateral breach of contractual
commitments would have led to a loss of credibility. This would have cut
them off from sources of international finance for a very long time, in view
of the importance of external capital for these countries' long-term
economic development.
It was clear to me that it would have been a major mistake for them just to
stand by and let the crisis develop without taking any action.
The strategy drawn up in August 1982 was simple; it has been developed and
further refined with the passing years. It was based on the idea that there
are two parties to each debt problem - the debtor and the creditor - and
that both parties should be part of the solution.
As the problem mainly seemed to be one of liquidity, and not solvency, the
solution was to:
1 - Ask debtor countries to adjust their economic policy so as to eliminate
the sources of the deficit that led to the debt in the first place. This
called for strong macro-economic stabilisation measures, involving fiscal
and monetary policy, and structural adjustment policies aimed at making
their production system more flexible by freeing prices, opening markets to
international trade and privatising industries.
2 - Ask creditors to give these tighter economic policies and adjustment
programmes time to work.
This assumed that the banks and public sector creditors would agree to
reschedule principal repayments, and even supply new money, so that the
debtors could meet their interest payments, which must never be interrupted.
This strategy had at its hub the International Monetary Fund, which was to
play a crucial role in reaching agreements with debtor countries on
adjustment programmes, backed by IMF resources, and in arranging and
catalysing the finance needed for the transition period, whether it came
from creditor states, banks or development institutions.
One of the fundamental rules applied to the approach chosen was that each
problem and each country had its own individual characteristics. Therefore,
it was not a matter of finding a universal and uniform solution, but of
addressing the problems on a case-by-case basis.
Most of the ideas I have just spelled out seem self-evident today. At the
time, though, they were hotly contested in some circles, particularly among
academics. It was said that the problem was so intractable that it called
for universal solution of debt relief or forgiveness, but nobody would say
just who should come up with the financing needed. Furthermore, it was
predicted that a 'cartel' of defaulters would be created and the programmes
negotiated by the IMF were seen as too harsh.
For once, events actually moved in a constructive and favourable direction.
The success in the handling of the crisis was due to four main elements: a
good concept (diagnosis and treatment), strong leadership, speed in
execution, and intensive co-operation among different players.
Mr de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, was managing director of
the International Monetary Fund in 1978-86.

ON August 20 1982, Jesus Silva Herzog set in motion an international crisis
of grand proportions.
The Mexican finance minister announced to an audience of bankers, gathered
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that repayment of principal on bank
loans was to be halted for three months. Debt payment problems quickly
spread to Brazil, Argentina and several other countries. Ten years later,
none of the loans has been repaid.
The crisis posed a threat to the stability of the industrialised world,
where large banks faced collapse. For Latin Americans, the sudden break in
the flow of foreign finance began a decade of economic austerity, social
problems and political battles over the direction of economic policy.
Although borrowers resisted pressure to club together or to default, their
relationship with the industrialised world was sorely tested. Within
creditor countries, calls for costly grand solutions to the debt problem,
reducing the burden on borrowers, were countered by resistance to taxpayer
bail-outs of banks.
The financial implications of the crisis were appalling. Debtor countries -
which had borrowed heavily to finance rapid economic growth amid a frenzy of
competition among banks to lend - faced default on a huge scale, with the
prospect of being cut off from external funding for years.
For governments and banks in the industrialised world, the situation was
horrifying. The capital of the largest US banks was exceeded by their loans
to the largest borrowers.
More immediately alarming was the extent to which foreign branches of Latin
American banks had used the short-term money market as a source of funds. As
banks balked at renewing credit lines to them, central banks struggled daily
to keep the world's payments system going.
It was in an atmosphere of hysteria that the leading financial officials and
bankers met in Toronto in September 1982 for the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank. What was to be done?
Remarkably, the strategy devised to handle the crisis in its earliest days
proved a durable one, still employed although with modifications.
It was hatched by Mr Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
the US central bank, and Gordon (now Lord) Richardson, governor of the Bank
of England, along with Mr Jacques de Larosiere, managing director of the
IMF, and Mr Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of the Swiss National Bank and the
Bank for International Settlements. Mexico's approach - telling banks that
it would defer principal payments while continuing to pay interest - also
contributed.
The essence was to buy time: stretch out the problem so that debtors could
introduce economic changes necessary to restore creditworthiness, and allow
creditors to build up their capital sufficiently to absorb the shocks.
It was essential for banks that debtors paid interest. If they did not,
losses would quickly become intolerable. So, controversially, debtors would
receive new loans to enable them to pay interest. At the same time they
would reschedule principal repayments on debt of longer than a year's
maturity, and embark on economic policies agreed with the IMF.
Close collaboration between the main parties was required, and each
financing package needed months of tense negotiation.
As the long-term nature of the problem became clear, maturities were
lengthened and amounts of deferred debt increased under 'multi-year
rescheduling agreements'. The initiative launched by Mr James Baker, as US
Treasury secretary in 1985, recognised the need for debtor countries to
grow, and led to greater emphasis on structural adjustment of economies.
It also forced banks to accept lower interest rates and stretch maturities
further.
Banks' desire to reduce their problem by trading out of it led to a series
of innovations which culminated in the initiative launched by Mr Nicholas
Brady, Mr Baker's successor, in 1989.
The underlying principle was that, if banks treated debt as below face
value, by trading loans at a discount, debtors should benefit. Under the
Brady Plan deals - the latest of which, for Brazil, was agreed this month -
banks voluntarily exchange loans for bonds with either lower face value or
lower interest rates, thus reducing the cash burden on debtors.
In retrospect, the strategy took a natural course, resulting in gradual
diminution of the problem and eventually in the restoration of countries to
creditworthiness. But few participants would claim it was all predictable.
Each new step brought confrontation and required a phased acceptance of
reality by both debtors and creditors. Banks had reluctantly to accept the
necessity for, in turn, new lending to delinquent debtors, rescheduling over
long periods, lending at below-market rates, large loss provisions (after
nearly five years) and finally debt relief.
But with Latin America now growing and borrowing again, and banks' capital
shored up under new requirements, it may justly be said that the strategy
worked.

<TEXT>
MANY an international bank director must have grimly muttered 'never again'
when Mexico declared itself unable to meet its international debt
obligations. Ten years later, as those self-same bankers ponder the losses
they have notched up on property loans, they must be wondering whether they
can ever exercise the right degree of self-control in lending.
Perhaps one lesson from the past 10 years is that banks are condemned to
lose money. Market pressures to lend are such, and creditworthy borrowers so
few, that bankers will never learn to cope with risk. In that sense, the
developing country debt crisis was only a manifestation of a deep natural
flaw in the banking industry.
The philosophy underlying the boom in syndicated lending to developing
countries in the late 1970s rested on two principles that now appear highly
dubious.
The first was the claim, expounded by Mr Walter Wriston, head of then mighty
Citibank, that sovereign borrowers can never go bust. The second was the
belief that an ever-increasing volume of loans could be syndicated
indefinitely to an ever-widening community of banks. By the time Mexico
finally ceased paying 10 years ago, big US money centre banks were hawking
Mexican credits to domestic banks in Thailand.
At a time when US inflation was well into two digits, real interest rates
were negative and commodity prices were rising, the argument that countries
could never default seemed seductively convincing. Mr Wriston used to claim
that governments could come and go, but countries - the real debtors - would
always survive. They had assets which could be seized if necessary.
Only a few officials, such as Mr Henry Wallich, the late Federal Reserve
Board governor, voiced doubts. He memorably described the notion of
sovereign immunity from default as being as elusive as the smile on the
vanishing face of the Cheshire cat.
Of course, no one really ever expected the borrower countries actually to
repay debts. The idea was simply that they should always be seen as
creditworthy enough to ensure they could borrow more when old loans became
due.
Yet the sense of well-being proved illusory. When the crisis struck, it was
fashionably interpreted as a problem of liquidity. The debtor countries were
still capable of repaying their debts over the longer term, but for the time
being they simply required more cash than the market was capable of
providing.
The underlying assumption was that as soon as confidence returned, the
market would restore the flow of credit. Even after the first trouble struck
there was no real challenge to the central assumption that the banking
system could generate an infinite amount of credit.
The process whereby new lenders bought out old ones had come to be seen as
perfectly acceptable. The rush of lending to developing countries had been
encouraged by industrial country governments in the early 1970s as a means
of shoring up the world economy after the initial oil shock. Nonetheless, as
syndicated lending developed, it acquired some of the characteristics of the
chain letter. At some point capacity was almost bound to be exhausted.
Once the crisis struck, the natural inclination of the banks was to turn
away from sovereign lending to domestic business. They thought they could
understand the risks, there would be no problem with transfer payments, and
they could more easily take security. The problem was that the banks
themselves had become less creditworthy than many of their best customers.
Top corporations were able to borrow in the commercial paper market at rates
lower than the banks charged each other for deposits.
Where banks continued to lend domestically they were thrown back on lesser
credit risks, which may help explain the headlong rush into leveraged buyout
lending in the US. Where they wanted a continued relationship with
better-quality borrowers they were thrown back on to techniques such as note
issuance facilities which were borrowed from the securities market.
Such facilities allowed borrowers to raise long-term funds by the continuous
issuance of short-term securities. The paper was placed with investors by
the same leading banks which had once dominated the syndicated loan market.
The attraction for the arrangers was the generation of fee income through a
service which did not necessarily use up space on the balance sheet.
The attraction for investors, which often included smaller banks, was that
they were under no obligation to repurchase the securities every three or
six months as they fell due. Their portfolio thus became more liquid.
It all looked like another wonderful wheeze, but the catch was that the
managing banks also had to promise to provide back-up credit to ensure that
the borrower could always redeem the short-term securities even if his
financial position unexpectedly deteriorated. Suddenly the world's largest
banks were piling up multi-billion dollar contingency obligations which were
not carried in their balance sheets and against which they had no formal
obligation to provide capital.
Worry about these hidden obligations was an important driving force behind
the establishment in the mid-1980s of the so-called Basle ratios for bank
capital. The ratios, however, will doubtless also be seen as a lasting
legacy from the debt crisis. Agreed under the aegis of the Bank for
International Settlements, they are meant to ensure banks have enough
capital not just in relation to total assets but also to reflect the type of
risk they are running on and off the balance sheet.
One hope was that this would encourage banks to price business more directly
in relation to risk. To judge by the way in which even the most reputable of
international banks, such as Barclays and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation, have burned their fingers on property lending, the stricter
Basle ratios have failed to persuade the industry to take this point on
board.
The debt crisis itself is on the wane, but the central bankers may not yet
have had their last word.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Japan may act over monopolies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government will promise to be more vigilant in policing
anti-monopoly laws and to reform the convoluted distribution system. The
promise is contained in a review of the Structural Impediments Initiative
(SII) agreement, expected to be released by Japan and the US today.
However, the two countries held further negotiations last night on what
should be done about the keiretsu, the Japanese corporate groups which, the
US argues, tend to exclude outside suppliers. Japan argues that the groups
are not exclusive, but are conducive to stable business contacts and
long-term profitability.
The US was also not satisfied with progress in reforming Japanese land use
laws or the balance between savings and investment. As these arguments
suggest, the SII is intended to deal with 'structural' issues that
Washington believes are behind Japan's persistently large current account
surplus.
A senior US Administration official said yesterday consumer demand had to be
encouraged in Japan, in the long and short term.
During the two-day talks Washington maintained that slowing domestic
economic growth had increased the country's trade surplus and urged Tokyo to
adopt policies to stimulate the economy as quickly as possible.
Japanese officials berated the US for having kept virtually none of the
promises it made two years ago, when the two countries finalised the SII
agreement.
They complained about the burdensome US budget deficit and US corporate
culture, which they said was too focused on the next quarter and lacked
long-term planning.

THE MAIN Brazilian stock market in Sao Paulo plummeted to close down 9.3 per
cent on the day yesterday, after an opposition senator said he could prove
evidence presented to a congressional inquiry into alleged presidential
corruption was fabricated.
Mr Eduardo Suplicy of the Workers' party had told Congress earlier in the
day that the fabrication was the work of Mr Claudio Vieira, a former senior
aide to President Fernando Collor. The accusation thickened the clouds over
the president's political future.
Mr Vieira told the inquiry on Monday that suspect payments into the bank
accounts of the president and his wife were the remains of a Dollars 5m
(Pounds 2.6m) loan Mr Vieira had raised in Uruguay in 1989, through which
gold had been bought to help fund the presidential electoral campaign that
year.
Bank documents before the inquiry last week suggested that the deposits,
running to Dollars 1m-plus, had been made by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr
Collor's friend and former campaign treasurer, who is under investigation
for alleged running of a bribes scheme.
Mr Suplicy claimed yesterday that Mr Vieira's evidence had been 'cooked up'
in recent meetings with Mr Farias and that the Uruguay loan documents were
typed last week in the office of Mr Alcides do Diniz Santos, a Sao Paulo
businessman. The senator said that Ms Sandra Fernandes de Oliveira,
secretary to Mr Diniz, was prepared to testify that she was at the meetings
and had typed the documents.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Iraqis step up attacks on Shias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQI troops have surrounded Shia strongholds in the south of the country
and are intensifying attacks on the rebel positions, it emerged yesterday.
Diplomats at the United Nations said they expected the Security Council to
act on the escalation of fighting in the south within days. 'It's a matter
of extreme concern,' said one diplomat yesterday.
Britain and the US have begun discussing how to respond to the offensive
against the Shias, which has been waged intermittently by the Iraqi army
since the end of the Gulf war and with particular severity since March.
Baghdad has intensified the conflict in the last few days by deploying
ground attack aircraft against the Shias for the first time since the Gulf
war.
Four or five divisions - about 50,000 men  - are believed to be stationed
around the perimeter of the marshlands used by Shia militia as sanctuary
from tank attack.
Until last week, attacks on the Shia had been confined to artillery
bombardments and incursions by patrols. The use of Russian-built SU-25
'Frogfoot' ground attack fighters represents a significant escalation in
President Saddam Hussein's suppression of the Shias and violates the terms
of UN resolution 688, which calls on Iraq to end its repression of the Kurds
and Shias.
Their use also threatens to revive the brinkmanship between Iraq and the UN,
which led last week to renewed threats of military action in response to
Baghdad's refusal to allow UN weapons inspectors into a ministry building.
Iraq has probably had some success in rebuilding its early warning radar
networks, a development which could complicate any small scale air attack by
UN-backed forces because radar installations would have to be disabled
first.
In addition Iraq still has 300 combat aircraft, of which about 150 are
flying, compared with 750-800 before the invasion of Kuwait two years ago.
Other Iraqi forces seem to have been reconstituted to about 40 per cent of
their levels two years ago. It has almost 2,000 tanks and a similar number
of artillery pieces with 350,000 men under arms.
More than half of the army's 28-30 divisions are dug in along the Kurdistan
border and are in continual skirmishes with Kurdish forces.
About one third are in southern Iraq attempting to exert control over the
Iranian-backed Shia forces.
The remaining 4-5 divisions, mostly the so-called elite Republican Guards,
are stationed around Baghdad accompanied by the newly reconstituted
Presidential Guard.
The US, meanwhile, is sending a battery of Patriot air defence missiles to
Bahrain this week as part of an effort to protect Gulf states from any Iraqi
missile attack. Earlier this week it send a Patriot battery and missiles to
Kuwait.
A team of UN weapons inspectors said yesterday they had found no
weapons-related materials after several hours of searching Iraq's
Agriculture Ministry - from which a previous UN team had been barred. But Mr
Achim Biermann, who led the UN team, said: 'There is room for deep concern
that some major material may have been taken out.'
A previous UN team suspected that documents related to Iraq's chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programme were being hidden in the building.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the special commission investigating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, left Baghdad for New York yesterday and said: 'We have
not cleared out what remains in Iraq.' He said the commission planned a full
range of further inspections over the next month.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Tokyo anxious as market falls to a fresh low

THE Japanese government watched nervously yesterday as the Tokyo stock
market average neared the 15,000 level, once viewed in Japan as the lower
limit for a stock price fall that began two and half years ago.
Finance ministry officials said there was 'nothing' it could do to prop up
stock prices. The 'market must decide' whether the Nikkei average is to
continue its fall. Yesterday, the Nikkei lost 330.69 to close at 15,095.99,
the lowest level since April 1986.
Early today, initial trading moved the index up slightly by some 150 points.
The continuing lack of confidence prompted Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, to call on ministries to speed preparations for a supplementary
budget due next month.
However, the Finance Ministry, responsible for the budget, said this would
be difficult. The extent of the budget is still unclear, though estimates
have ranged from Y5,000bn (Pounds 20bn) to Y8,000bn (Pounds 32.5bn). Most of
the money will be used for infrastructure projects.
The ministry also rejected a suggestion by Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime
minister, that government organisations purchase land to bolster a still
weakening property market.
The government's main concern is the stock market, which failed to draw
encouragement from a cut in official interest rates on Monday or a
convincing performance by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Upper House
elections on Sunday.
Brokers said many feared the Nikkei average would drop sharply once the
15,000 level was passed, but financial institutions appeared to enter the
market yesterday to try to keep it above that mark.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Denmark's MPs may decide on Maastricht pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S parliament may take responsibility for approving any new deal on
the Maastricht treaty rather than putting the matter to another referendum.
It suffered a humiliating defeat when Danish voters rejected the pact -
which it had supported strongly - in a referendum early last month.
However, several leading politicians said yesterday after a meeting of the
Folketing's powerful Market Affairs Committee that when Denmark's future
relationship with the European Community had been worked out, MPs might
settle for approval by a qualified majority vote in the Folketing.
Denmark is likely to seek a deal which enables it to opt out of those parts
of the Maastricht treaty to which the electorate is thought to be most
strongly opposed, while participating in other parts to which the electorate
is thought to be less averse.
For example, Denmark will not agree to participate in any form of European
defence policy and will not commit itself to economic and monetary union
(Emu) or to the treaty's clauses on police and legal co-operation. But there
is no objection to the sections on environment policy or the so-called
social dimension.
The Danes' negotiating position with their partners is quite strong, as the
treaty cannot be implemented without the signatures of all 12 member states.
The exact shape of the agreement they are seeking is still very much a
matter for speculation and discussions in the country are only in the early
stages. The other 11 EC member states will begin to react only when they
have seen what the Danes propose.
However, two things can be ruled out. First, there will be no new referendum
on an unchanged treaty text. Second, Denmark will not demand a completely
new Maastricht treaty. An official of the prime minister's office denied
yesterday a news agency report that the country would seek a new basis for
the treaty.
Since the referendum, the two-party conservative-liberal minority government
headed by Mr Poul Schluter has closely involved all eight parties
represented in the Folketing - including the two 'No-to-Maastricht' parties,
the right-wing populist Progress Party and the left-wing Socialist People's
Party - in the discussions on what Denmark's next step should be.
A more precise idea of what Denmark wants will emerge when a white paper
setting out the options is published in the autumn, after the French
referendum on September 20.
Significantly, The opposition Social Democratic Party (pro-Maastricht) and
the Socialist People's Party (anti-Maastricht) do not rule out
parliamentary, as opposed to popular, approval. Constitutionally, this would
be in order. A treaty devolving sovereignty to an international organisation
must be approved either by a five-sixths majority in the Folketing or by a
referendum.
As the kind of deal which Denmark will probably seek is unlikely to involve
new devolution of sovereignty, even a majority of less than five-sixths
would be sufficient.
A RECORD 76 per cent of French voters believe they are badly governed, a
level of discontent that could affect the September referendum on European
union, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The BVA-Paris Match poll did not ask about voting intentions in the
September 20 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, but Mr Pierre Giacometti,
BVA political director, said the Socialist government's deep unpopularity
could trigger a protest vote.
Asked whether they were satisfied or discontented with the way France was
governed, 30 per cent said they were very discontented and 46 per cent
rather discontented.  Seventeen per cent said they were rather satisfied and
only one per cent said they were very satisfied.
The number of people with a good opinion of President Francois Mitterrand
fell by three points to 35 per cent and Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy's
rating fell by seven points to 41 per cent.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Setback for Bush on two fronts: California and right-wing
pundit send warnings to White House

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's struggling re-election campaign was hit by more bad
news from the west and from the right yesterday.
A Field Poll in the state of California found Governor Bill Clinton of
Arkansas, the Democratic nominee, leading Mr Bush by 62 per cent to 28 per
cent. In the survey's 45-year history, this is the largest margin at this
late stage of a presidential race. In previous hypothetical match-ups, Mr
Bush usually held a comfortable edge over Mr Clinton, though both trailed Mr
Ross Perot before he pulled out.
Republican candidates have carried California in five of the last six
presidential elections. The rest of the west, where Mr Clinton has been
campaigning hard in the past few days, has been less solid. It now looks
even more fragile if another state poll, in Washington, is any guide. It
found Mr Clinton ahead by 56 to 32 per cent.
The discontent from the right, already patent, came yesterday in the shape
of a newspaper column by George Will, probably the country's best known
conservative pundit, whose fulminations against Mr Bush have been growing
ever more thunderous.
Calling Mr Bush 'a figure of genuine pathos' and his administration 'tired
and arrogant', Mr Will in effect called on the president to give up the
re-election ghost.
'For Republicans,' he wrote, 'the grim paradox is that the reason he should
not run is the reason he will. He should not, because he has no reason to,
other than an ambition eerily disconnected from any agenda. But he will run
because he regards a public purpose as ornamental, as a mere filigree on a
quest for office.'
If Mr Bush pulled out, Mr Will went on from his Washington pulpit, 'two
things would happen. The intellectual claustrophobia of this city and the
Republican party will be instantly dissipated. And the Clinton-Gore
bandwagon would be eclipsed until after the Republican convention ends on
August 20.'
Mr Will did not say who should succeed Mr Bush as Republican candidate. Nor
did Mr Al D'Amato, the Republican senator from New York, who also said
earlier this week that the president might well not run again. Mr D'Amato,
it was thought, was merely trying to put a little distance between himself
and the president so as to help his own re-election campaign.
It has been very fashionable on the right to say that the real problem with
the Republican ticket is not the vice-president, Mr Dan Quayle, whose future
has been the subject of speculation, but the president himself. Some have
been arguing that it would be better for the conservative movement for Mr
Clinton to make a mess of things as president rather than to have four more
years of drift under Mr Bush.
The Bush campaign has been trying to shore up the conservative base. Mr Jack
Kemp, the housing secretary, will now probably get a speaking slot in
Houston, as may Mr Pat Buchanan, the early primary challenger.
The former president, Mr Ronald Reagan, is to kick off the convention with
an opening night keynote address on foreign policy.

<TEXT>
A US federal judge last night ordered the Bush administration to end its
policy of sending Haitian boat people back home, Jurek Martin writes from
Washington.
The order came after a federal appeals court, the second highest level in
the judicial system, ruled illegal a presidential order telling the Coast
Guard to return Haitians intercepted at sea and warning would-be refugees
asylum requests would only be processed at the US embassy in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti's capital.
'The plain language of the Immigration and Nationality Act clearly states
that the US may not return aliens to their persecutors no matter where in
the world those actions are taken,' the court said.
Mr Bush's directive was justified on the grounds that US facilities at its
Guantanamo naval base in Cuba were being swamped by a tide of Haitian
refugees.

At least 4,400 of the 40,000 right-wing extremists in Germany are prone to

attacks, it said in answer to a query in parliament.
Skinheads make up 4,200 of the 4,400 violent right-wingers identified by

FT  30 JUL 92 / Bundesbank monetary policy condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundesbank was yesterday accused of pursuing a misguided and
self-defeating tight monetary policy, which threatens to undermine the
entire restructuring process in eastern Germany.
In the most coherent and outspoken attack so far on the latest Bundesbank
move to raise interest rates, the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic
Research (DIW) accused the central bank of misunderstanding the
extraordinary causes of the current expansion in M3 money supply. It warned
that far from curbing the growth of money supply, the latest increase in the
discount rate - from 8.0 to 8.75 per cent - would actually increase it.
The critique was written by Dr Heiner Flassbeck, head of the institute's
main economics department, and specifically sanctioned as a policy statement
of the institute. Yesterday he described the Bundesbank policy as both
astonishing and 'absurd'.
Although the discount rate rise in itself might not be significant, its
effect as an indication of the central bank's determination to tighten
monetary policy yet further was very important, the institute says. In west
Germany, 'the tendency towards recession which already exists will be
aggravated further in the light of the dwindling hopes of interest rate
cuts', it says.
In the east of the country, struggling with massive structural adjustment in
the wake of unification, the move was likely to slow down essential
investments and greatly exacerbate the looming economic crisis.
The DIW cites two principal causes for the growth in M3, the broad measure
of money supply, at the current rate of 9 per cent a year - well outside the
3.5-5.5 per cent Bundesbank target zone.
One reason is rapid growth in bank credits to enterprises and individuals,
and the second is a switch into high-interest bearing term deposits. Neither
justified a further interest rate rise at the July 16 Bundesbank meeting, it
says.
The main reason for the expansion of bank credits is the investment need in
east Germany, where restructuring is not a factor contributing to overall
inflation, it argues. Prices will rise in the east, along with wages, until
they reach western levels, and then stabilise.
Given the relatively slow growth of western investment in the east, apart
from public sector investments in infrastructure, it is possible to argue
that the present 11 per cent growth rate in bank credit is actually too
slow.
The rapid growth in term deposits is actually caused by the Bundesbank's
high interest rate policy pushing up short-term rates, at the expense of
longer-term money instruments. The latest increase could well simply
aggravate that trend, it says.
The essence of the DIW argument is that the current rapid growth in money
supply which perturbs the Bundesbank is a result of the unique circumstances
of unification, and restrictive monetary policy is thus giving all the wrong
signals.
'The Bundesbank will become a slave to its own money-supply concept, when it
can no longer differentiate which part of money supply leads to inflation,
and which to the opposite,' it concludes.
Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger yesterday ruled out any cut in
German interest rates in the immediate future, according to a report in
today's Guardian. Asked if the Bundesbank had room to cut rates, he replied:
'Not for the moment. No, I don't see it,' the newspaper reported.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Nations pledge more money to help refugees from Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT repres-entatives attending the special 60-nation Geneva
conference on the refugee crisis in the former Yugoslavia have pledged more
than Dollars 152m (Pounds 79.5m) to help the stricken populations of the
region.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, United Nations high commissioner for refugees, who had
launched the appeal for funds, said it had been a good day for the displaced
and distressed people of the former Yugoslavia.
She warned the conference that 'if we do not act immediately and forcefully
on both political and humanitarian fronts, we may find ourselves stranded
with an open-ended relief programme and a massive permanent refugee problem
in the heart of Europe.'
She said there was an urgent need to prepare for winter, when more than
500,000 people were likely to need shelter. In the coming weeks innovative
ideas were required, as well as involvement and support of both agencies and
governments.
The conference agreed to establish a follow-up committee to study
comprehensive solutions to the refugee crisis. More than 2.2m people have
been displaced since the Yugoslav crisis began, and a further 850,000 are
trapped in besieged areas.
Most participants at the conference said they were prepared to keep open
their borders to refugees and displaced persons, though no finite numbers
were mentioned, Mrs Ogata said.
But Baroness Chalker, British overseas aid minister, said Britain was
willing to take only special categories, such as orphans, wounded children
and people in extreme need.
Mrs Ogata said one of the most important elements of a solution agreed by
the conference was that refugees should ultimately return to their land of
origin and homes. But there was continuing disagreement between most
participants and a small group of countries led by Germany about Bonn's
proposal that refugee quotas should be fixed country by country to ensure a
more equitable distribution of the burden.
Britain and France were in the forefront of those opposing such a system, as
were the US and the high commissioner herself.
While all these countries were against a precise refugee distribution
system, the US said Bosnians were now eligible to apply for 'temporary
protected status', and France said it was ready to issue temporary entry to
victims of the fighting in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
Lady Chalker opposed any new temporary refugee classification, stressing
that it could form a precedent for individuals fleeing other conflicts
throughout the world and lead to an unmanageable flow of such people.
There was wide agreement, however, on giving priority to encouraging people
to stay as close as possible to their home territories. 'If displaced
persons can be helped to remain in safe areas, or relief zones, near to
their places of origin, their eventual return home, resettlement and family
reunification will be made that much easier,' Lady Chalker said.
That view was supported by a large number of participants. But Mrs Ogata and
some other delegates warned that carving out enclaves in Bosnia, as distinct
from already secure areas in Slovenia and Croatia, could lead to creation of
ethnically homogeneous areas - the very result they were trying to avoid.
All participants strongly criticised so-called 'ethnic cleansing' practised
by Bosnian Serbs. In a trenchant condemnation, Mrs Ogata said 'ethnic
cleansing' lay at the very heart of the conflict in Bosnia. 'Displacement
seems to be the goal, not just the result of the war, with the motive
clearly being ethnic relocation.'

FT  30 JUL 92 / Lenders warn on home repossessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT came under further pressure on the economy yesterday as
mortgage lenders warned that they were unable to stem the flood of borrowers
at risk of having their homes repossessed.
In spite of pre-election assurances from Mr John Major, the prime minister,
that the repossessions problem was under control, new figures showed that
the number of home-owners in serious arrears with mortgage payments rose
sharply in the first half of the year.
As Labour seized on the findings as fresh evidence of government inaction,
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said it
was hard to see what could be done to help the housing market recover while
the recession continued.
Although the number of homes actually repossessed by lenders fell slightly
in the first half of the year, the CML said that 305,140 mortgage accounts -
more than 3 per cent of all mortgages  - were more than six months in
arrears. This compared with 275,350 at the end of last year.
During the first half of the year, 35,750 properties were repossessed by
lenders. Although this was 8 per cent down on the second half of last year,
it was higher than expected and suggests that the number of homes
repossessed this year may be close to last year's total of 75,540.
Mr Boleat said that, although it was good news that the repossessions
figures were down, the growing level of arrears suggested the position was
deteriorating and was beyond the control of mortgage lenders. He denied the
government was complacent and said that, without measures agreed between the
government and lenders last December to help borrowers in serious arrears,
repossessions would have passed 100,000 in the first half.
Meanwhile, figures for court orders to repossess properties issued by the
Lord Chancellor's Department yesterday confirmed that in the half year there
were 68,883 court orders for repossession, up from 65,892 in the
corresponding period last year.
Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich and a former opposition housing
spokesman, said that the figures for long-term arrears suggested there might
be at least a further 150,000 repossessions over the next two years.
His warning was echoed by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury
spokesman, who demanded measures, including a Pounds 100m subsidy, to
encourage mortgage rescue schemes.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Bank regulators bribed by BCCI, US suit alleges: Former
defence secretary Clifford charged
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE most sweeping charges to date against former executives, shareholders
and associates of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
were brought yesterday by the US authorities in a carefully co-ordinated
operation.
The charges accused those involved of being part of a 'sophisticated and
corrupt criminal enterprise' which bribed and cheated its way across the
world to gain power and money.
Among those charged in New York and Washington with fraud, bribery,
conspiracy, larceny and racketeering was Mr Clark Clifford, the 85-year-old
former US defence secretary who was once a leading Democrat. Charges were
also brought against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's ailing founder, Mr Swaleh
Naqvi, former chief executive of BCCI, and Mr Ghaith Pharaon, the Saudi
Arabian financier.
The indictments also allege that 'huge bribes' were paid by BCCI to bank
regulators and senior central bank officials in Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco,
Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Congo, Zambia, Argentina and Peru. These
payments were allegedly made to ensure favourable treatment for BCCI and to
cover up deceitful banking practices in which BCCI was engaged.
Mr Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan's forceful district attorney, said the
bribes led to frauds being perpetrated on the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the Nigerian National Supply Company and the African
Development Bank.
Mr Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his law partner who was also charged, were
briefly placed under arrest in New York yesterday and indicted for criminal
conduct, including receiving bribes, conspiracy and a scheme to commit
fraud.
The charges against them stem from their roles in the allegedly illegal
acquisition by a BCCI holding company of First American Bankshares,
Washington's biggest bank. Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were respectively
chairman and president of First American. Mr Clifford and Mr Altman entered
pleas of not guilty and said in a joint statement: 'We totally and
categorically deny all charges. They are the result of mean-spirited
suspicion and unfounded speculation.'
In a related development, it was disclosed that Sheikh Kamal Adham, the
61-year-old former head of Saudi intelligence, flew from his home in Cairo
to New York on Monday to sign a plea bargain agreement that allowed him to
avoid more serious indictments while admitting to a misdemeanour. Sheikh
Kamal admitted in court that he was part of a group which secretly and
illegally gained control of First American's New York operations.
He pleaded guilty to violating New York banking law, agreed to pay a Dollars
105m (Pounds 54.9m) fine and promised to co-operate with US prosecutors.
The charges, filed exactly a year after the first indictments in the US,
come as the Serious Fraud Office in London has been investigating the UK
aspects of the BCCI fraud. The British government this week received a
confidential report which is expected to criticise the role of the
regulatory authorities, led by the Bank of England.
Mr Morgenthau said the indictment 'spells out that this massive fraud was
not just a criminal fraud scheme, as we charged last year, but a
sophisticated and corrupt criminal enterprise, organised from the top down
to do just this - accumulate money and gain the power and prestige that the
money provided'.
In Washington, Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were indicted on charges of
conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board and of concealing material
facts relating to BCCI. The Fed also said it had begun civil proceedings to
determine whether the two should be barred permanently from engaging in the
banking business.
In addition to charges of grand larceny and bribery Mr Abedi, BCCI's former
chairman, and Mr Naqvi, were also charged with racketeering along with Mr
Pharaon and Mr Faisal Saud Al Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman who is alleged
to have been a frontman for BCCI.
Mr Morgenthau said the four were 'members of a corrupt enterprise, the BCC
group, that set up and conducted BCCI as a criminal conspiracy'.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Government seeks early signal of tour group failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to seek early warning of tour operator collapses by asking
insurers if they are refusing to trade with particular holiday companies.
The move follows the disclosure that General Accident stopped taking
policies from Land Travel, the failed coach tour operator, some two days
before the Bath-based company went into liquidation last Friday.
The collapse left about 50,000 people who had booked holidays with the
company with no prospect of recovering their money.
General Accident, the Perth-based insurer, said yesterday that it withdrew
Land Travel's authority to issue policies at 5pm on July 22 after the
company stopped a 'fairly substantial' cheque due on that day. It was still
owed 'a substantial amount of money' by Land Travel, the insurer said.
The government also undertook yesterday to look again at the detail of
proposals to improve protection for holidaymakers.
A European Community directive that makes bonding compulsory for tour
operators is due to be implemented on January 1.
Defending the government's attitude to last week's collapse, Baroness Denton
of Wakefield, a junior trade and industry minister, held out no hope of
compensation for those affected but said her department would 'continue to
monitor the situation carefully'.
In a letter to Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, she
acknowledged there was always 'a difficult balance' to strike in deciding
whether or not to investigate a company's financial affairs.
'There is the risk that knowledge of an investigation by my department could
undermine confidence and exacerbate a company's problems,' she said.
Baroness Denton admitted the DTI had not been aware that one of the
principals of Land Travel had previously been a director of a travel company
which had gone bankrupt.
Her comments were seized on by Mr Griffiths, who claimed that the
government's monitoring of companies in trouble was 'almost non-existent'.
'The government's hands-off approach has left the field wide open for the
Arthur Daleys of the travel world,' he said.
'My concern is that if another Land Travel goes bust next week, a number of
people will end up in exactly the same position.'

FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York's overnight gain
lifts the Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S overnight gain lifted most bourses yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw foreign institutions return to the market as the view began to
take hold that the Bundesbank might not have to increase the Lombard rate.
Some analysts believe that the better-than-expected inflation figures
released last week may lead to a gradual easing in monetary policy by late
summer.
At midsession the FAZ index was up 2.09 at 643.05, extending into a gain of
17.51 in the DAX index to 1,628.15 by the close. Turnover rose to DM5.9bn
from DM4.5bn.
Disappointing half-year results from Commerzbank, the first of the big three
banks to report, saw its shares shed DM1.20 to DM238. Dresdner Bank, which
is due to report on August 4, put on DM2.80 to DM327.50 and Deutsche Bank
was DM4 firmer at DM647.50. Bayerische Hypobank, which reported good figures
on Tuesday, gained another DM9.50 to DM382.50.
PARIS ignored an early decline in the bond market and the CAC 40 index rose
32.63 or 1.8 per cent to 1,801.63 in turnover of FFr2.5bn.
Blue chips led the advance as Michelin added FFr4.50 to FFr215, Total put on
FFr3.20 to FFr233.20 and Elf rose FFr7.50 to FFr348. Underperformers also
joined in, with Schneider adding FFr34 or 5.8 per cent to FFr617 and Lafarge
up FFr13.80 to FFr319.
Euro Disney dropped FFr2.55 or 2.7 per cent to FFr90.65 after Airtours, the
UK package holiday operator, said it might end its Euro Disney programme
because of poor bookings and policy changes by the theme park. Some analysts
played down the announcement, which they viewed as an attempt by Airtours to
put pressure on Euro Disney during the current 1993 price negotiations. The
stock was also hit by rumours, later denied, that Euro Disney would have to
raise its VAT rate to 15 per cent, the new European Community minimum, from
its current 5.5 per cent.
BSN also bucked the firmer trend, losing FFr2 to FFr1,017 while Moulinex
fell FFr7.70 or 5.8 per cent to FFr126.30, a new 1992 low.
MILAN continued its technical upswing but came back slightly by the end of
the session. However, news in the afternoon that the government had won a
confidence vote in the lower house on its plans to cut the state deficit by
L30 trillion in 1992 lifted Italian shares traded in London. The Comit index
rose 1.13 to 401.14 in turnover estimated at L110bn after L62.2bn.
AMSTERDAM was stronger on technical trading and a firmer Wall Street. The
CBS Tendency index closed up 2.5 at 117.5.
Blue chip stocks improved with Royal Dutch up Fl 2 at Fl 144.80, Unilever
rising Fl 4.90 to Fl 183 and Elsevier reversing Tuesday's losses with a gain
of Fl 3.10 to Fl 106.60.
Fokker's shares were suspended briefly prior to its announcement that it is
to issue 13.2m new shares to be placed in a new holding company to be
controlled by Deutsche Aerospace. Fokker's shares closed up 30 cents at Fl
26.20.
Chemical groups Akzo and DSM enjoyed another good performance ahead of the
latter's half year results today. Akzo advanced Fl 4 to Fl 142 and DSM saw
its shares gain Fl 1 to Fl 100.40.
STOCKHOLM advanced for the third consecutive session as the Affarsvarlden
General index rose 9.4 to 864.1 in turnover of SKr285m after SKr161m. Astra
A shares rose SKr12 to SKr549 on news of good US sales for its anti-ulcer
medicine, Losec.
ZURICH was buoyed by lower domestic interest rates. The SMI index advanced
35.3 or 2 per cent to 1,812.7. The banking sector remained strong as Union
Bank reported satisfactory half-year earnings. Its bearers gained SFr14 to
SFr712.
MADRID rose in active trading helped by some pleasing corporate results. The
general index put on 4.58 to 215.93. Endesa gained Pta125 or 4 per cent to
Pta3,225 after announcing a 17 per cent rise in first half earnings.
VIENNA's ATX index rebounded 17.43 or 2.25 per cent to 790.95.
Austrian Airlines fell Sch20 to Sch1,710, a year low, on reports that it may
have to cut its dividend this year.
ISTANBUL advanced as more banks lowered their deposit interest rates. The
75-share index closed up 34.38 at 4,200.38 in turnover of TL244bn.

FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls on
selling of speculative stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average resumed its fall to set a six-year low as selling of
speculative stocks by dealers depressed the market, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 330.69 to 15,095.95, the lowest level since April
8, 1986. The index moved up in the morning in response to Tuesday's sharp
rally on Wall Street, registering a high for the day of 15,605.98.
Subsequent selling by investment trusts and dealers pushed share prices
down, and the Nikkei dropped to a session's low of 15,024.59 in the
afternoon.
Volume picked up to 250m shares from 166m but trading by institutional
investors was minimal. Declines overwhelmed advances by 851 to 116, with 119
issues unchanged. The Topix index declined 19.48 to a low for the year of
1,170.93, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.45 to 928.17.
Traders said although Monday's discount rate cut had lowered yields in the
bond and money markets, liquidity failed to improve in the stock market.
Short-term rates were led lower by the yield on three-month certificates of
deposit, which fell below 4 per cent for the first time since June 1987.
Mrs Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse, said a
sustainable liquidity-driven bull market could not be prompted by cuts in
the official discount rate: 'Investors are convinced that stocks cannot
offer capital gains.'
Active support from the Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - lifted the Nikkei
from its intraday low. Analysts believe that if it falls below 15,000,
hidden gains on stocks held by leading life assurers would be eroded. Ms
Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the deterioration
of assets at large institutional investors would disturb financial
authorities.
Dealers liquidated positions in speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk
Products, again the day's most active issue, dropped Y61 to Y831, and
Okamoto Industries, the condom maker, fell Y110 to Y1,020.
Clarion, a speculative favourite, plunged Y100 to Y431. Traders said
investors who had bought the issue on margin in March, when the stock
attained a high for the year of Y1,360, were unloading their holdings ahead
of the margin settlement.
Construction issues were weak on worries about loan guarantees extended to
affiliates and other small contractors. Sato Kogyo plummeted Y73 to Y580,
while Obayashi shed Y23 to Y482. Daikyo, the condominium developer, lost Y46
to Y499 on worries about its financial stability.
The fall in short-term rates raised hopes of higher profit margins at banks.
Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y10 to Y1,630 and Fuji Bank put on Y20 to
Y1,280.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 440.29 to 17,136.39 in volume of 25m
shares, as selling by margin buyers pushed share prices down.
Roundup
THE REGION'S markets were mixed yesterday as the renewed weakness in Tokyo
weighed on sentiment.
HONG KONG finished higher on late bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index
appreciated 74.66 to 5,857.29 in turnover of HKDollars 2.7bn.
HSBC Holdings led the actives list and advanced HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53,
followed by Hutchison Whampoa, up 30 cents at HKDollars 16.30. Hang Seng
Bank rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53.50.
TAIWAN remained weak, although there was some activity in the paper sector
on forecasts of better earnings. The weighted index slipped 11.78 to
3,947.32 in TDollars 21.47bn turnover.
Yuen Foong Yu, the leading paper maker, added TDollars 2.10 at TDollars
32.50 after reporting first-half pre-tax profits of TDollars 500m, and
Taiwan Paper gained 80 cents to TDollars 28.90.
MANILA gained ground on some positive news in the oil sector. The composite
index rose 7.64 to 1,485.31 in combined turnover of 243m pesos. Philippine
National Bank firmed 5 pesos to 302.50 pesos and PLDT put on 20 pesos to
1,070 pesos.
AUSTRALIA came off earlier highs after Tokyo's fall, the All Ordinaries
index ending a net 6.9 up at 1,612.3. Turnover was a low ADollars 352m.
Sentiment was helped by the release of second-quarter inflation data showing
a fall in the consumer price index.
Advance Bank moved forward 40 cents to ADollars 5.60 after releasing better
than expected earnings for 1991/92.
NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by a fall in Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40
index lost 2.94 to 1,528.48, having earlier risen to 1,541.68. Turnover came
to NZDollars 25.6m.
Fletcher shed 9 cents to NZDollars 3.17 on news that its Australian division
will lose ADollars 44.6m on the sale of property in Melbourne.
BANGKOK advanced as Thai Airways put on Bt4 to Bt57.50. The SET index rose
4.01 to 736.58 in turnover of Bt4.9bn.
SEOUL's composite index fell 5.61 to 508.84 in turnover of Won99bn.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 17.06, or 1.2 per cent, to
1,429.59. Sembawang Shipyard gained 40 cents to SDollars 7.05 after
revealing good half-year results on Tuesday.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded after a four-day fall and the composite index closed
4.94 better at 590.71.
BOMBAY reversed a two-day rally and the BSE index receded 75.32, or 2.6 per
cent, to 2,755.25.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US butter for Russia under
credit programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Agriculture has announced its first sale of butter to
Russia under its three-year credit guarantee programme.
The Dollars 55.35m sale of government-owned salted butter covered 34,600
tonnes, costing Dollars 1,567.50 a tonne, freight inclusive to Baltic Sea
ports. Deliveries are scheduled for August through November.
Russia has opted for butter costing more than the unallocated portion of
total Dollars 300m made available for agricultural imports from the US
earlier this month.
The sale comes at a time when reports about the flow of grain to Russia are
confused. But it is believed that imports have been rising, partly as a
result of peasants holding back supplies in the hope of an increase in
prices.
On July 2, the USDA announced an acceleration in the Russian credit
programme, making Dollars 300m in guarantees - double what had been expected
 -immediately available.
The commodity breakdown for the allocation was as follows: Dollars 96m for
wheat; Dollars 55m for feed grains; Dollars 64m for protein meals; Dollars
12.1m for tallow; Dollars 6.3m for vegetable oil and Dollars 41.6m
unallocated.
On July 6, private exporters announced sales of 405,000 tonnes of maize and
115,000 tonnes of soyabean meal to Russia for delivery this year. On the
following day came news of a 659,000 tonne wheat sale.
The Dollars 300m allocation reflected the strong pressure on USDA to make
credit available for sales of processed commodities and high value sales,
like butter.
Earlier this month, the Department donated 4,000 tonnes of butteroil to
Kazakhstan. It was sold to the private sector, with the proceeds to be
targeted for the neediest in the republic.
The donation was made in co-operation with Mercy Corps International, which
was to use local currency generated by the butteroil sale to distribute
wheat flour previously donated by the US.
The Department also donated 100 tonnes of non-fat dry milk to the republic
of Georgia, bringing to nearly Dollars 200m the total value of humanitarian
US food aid to the former republics.
Export credit guarantees worth Dollars 55m were made available for commodity
sales to the Ukraine on July 2.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kola nickel clean-up plans
revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 640M project to renovate one of the world's biggest polluters, the
Pechenga nickel smelter on the Kola peninsula, which was aborted in March
because of Russia's financial problems, has been resurrected.
Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group that is acting as technical manager
of the proposed project, has reinstated its tender - Dollars 600m for
smelter renovation and Dollars 40m for infrastructure work - and set a new
end-October deadline for acceptance.
Pechenga spews out about 284,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year. Some of
it falls on the nearby town of Nickel, near the Finnish border, but the
prevailing winds take two- thirds of it across Finland and Norway where the
acid rain caused has done severe damage to forests.
If the project goes ahead, it would cut sulphur dioxide emissions to only
15,800 tonnes and enable Russia to meet the undertaking (first given by the
government of the Soviet Union) to cut emissions from in the Finnish border
area by half.
Equally important, from Russia's point of view, the project would provide
the Norilsk nickel group, one of the country's most reliable and successful
exporters, with a new smelter. Western observers suggest that the present
Pechenga smelter, originally established in the 1930s and renovated in the
1940s, has only a few years of life left in it.
Pechenga produces about 100,000 tonnes a year of nickel in matte (an
intermediate material), which is sent to Montshegorsk for refining. At first
the pollution abatement scheme was to have cost more than Dollars 1bn and
included Montshegorsk but this proved to be economically impossible because
of transport problems.
The Finnish and Norwegian governments have promised environmental grants of
up to Dollars 100m towards the project and they, together with Sweden, have
said they would provide loans for the rest of the required investment. If
Russia remains short of foreign currency, Outokumpu would be willing to take
up to Dollars 100m of metal a year and would help repay the banks.
The Norilsk group, which owns the Pechenga smelter and is the world's
biggest nickel producer, is still hoping to win exemption from the Russian
government from the requirement for most of its foreign earnings to be
handed over and converted into roubles.
Outokumpu let its tender lapse in March but has now reinstated it following
a recent decree by Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, which also set an
October target for agreement on the Pechenga project.
The Russian government has set up a special finance group to meet Nordic
government representatives to thrash out financial details. The Nordic
working group includes representatives from the export guarantee
institutions of Finland, Norway and Sweden and the Nordic Investment Bank.
Export credit would be tied to deliveries from each country.
If the project goes ahead, Finland will provide about half the equipment
including about 20 per cent from Outokumpu alone (a flash smelter based on
Outokumpu technology and a sulphuric acid plant); 25 per cent from Norway
(Elkem is responsible for the slag cleaning plant); and 10 per cent from
Sweden.
Outokumpu says that, if its tender is accepted by October, final agreement
should be reached in mid-1993. There is a very tight three-year construction
schedule. When the scheme was first mooted the new smelter was to have
started up in 1995.
Outokumpu has spent between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m so far on the project
but if negotiations finally collapse the Finnish government will repay half
the cost.

Australian sales were resumed on July 28 and the market indicator moved up
just 3 cents to 548 cents a kg., compared with the close at the end of June.
Views about probable movements varied as usual, but there were quite a
number of traders expecting some sort of increase, perhaps larger than
actually occurred. Japan appears to have shown limited interest, with Europe
relatively active. Subsequently prices have been firm or barely steady,
according to category. With four million bales in the Australian stockpile,
disposal rates at present are very low.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: European aluminium hit by weak
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN ALUMINIUM smelters are suffering severely from changing exchange
rate patterns, particularly a weakening US dollar, because the metal is
internationally priced in dollars, says the Anthony Bird consultancy group
in its latest review.
It suggests that Spain is worst off, with primary aluminium production costs
now at 80 cents a lb compared with Venezuela, the lowest-cost country, at 42
cents.
Germany, 67 cents, Norway and the UK, 63 cents each, also have production
costs well above present market prices, says Bird. Only France, where
Pechiney's new Dunkirk smelter using nuclear electricity recently came into
production, is reasonably well-placed with costs of 52 cents.
This places France ahead of the US, 56 cents, and even Brazil, 55 cents.
Canada, 43 cents, and Australia, 45 cents, are the other low-cost producers.
Bird suggests that aluminium demand, after going into reverse this year,
will surge ahead by 6.5 per cent in 1993 before settling at a 3 to 4 per
cent annual growth until 1995.
There will be no recovery in aluminium prices this year and only a slow
improvement in 1993, it adds. But in the medium term prices must improve
because they need to be about 75 cents a lb to justify new smelters being
built.

PAKISTAN AND Algeria are to buy Dollars 150m worth of Malaysian palm oil
under the Malaysian government's recently inaugurated long term export
credit financing programme.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the Malaysian Primary Industries Minister, said contracts
giving Pakistan a Dollars 100m credit facility and Algeria one of Dollars
50m would be signed early next month.
Malaysia's export credit financing programme for palm oil extends a total of
Dollars 500m to six countries - China, India, Egypt, the Commonwealth of
Independent States, Pakistan and Algeria.
Mr Lim said credits would be granted for up to two years as part of the
government's strategy to secure big, long term palm oil contracts. 'The
contracts will ensure a ready market for the commodity in the years to
come,' he added.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining as an environmental
pariah - Matthew Kaminski on mounting pressure on the industry in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINING industry is an environmental pariah that both industrialised and
developing nations must strictly regulate.
This is the conclusion of a comprehensive study of the global environmental
impact of mineral extraction. The report, Mining the Earth, is published by
the Worldwatch Institute, a respected Washington think-tank.
The report describes a broad pattern of ecological damage. Each year, it
says, miners strip 28bn tonnes of material, more than is removed by the
planet's rivers, and generate 2.7bn tonnes of waste, much of it hazardous.
Smelting pumps 6m tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, a major
cause of acid rain.
'Few would dream that mines and smelters take up to a tenth of all the
energy used each year or that the waste left by mining measures in billions
of tons - dwarfing the world's total accumulation of more familiar kinds of
waste, such as municipal garbage,' says Mr John Young, the report's author.
Yet he notes that many countries promote virgin mining - which they see as
key to development - with hefty subsidies. In the US, for example, tax
breaks provided the mining industry with a Dollars 5bn subsidy during the
1980s.
The US mining industry dismisses the report's proposals to tighten
environmental standards, tax mineral extraction to pay for waste clean-up
and eliminate tax breaks. The American Mining Congress, the industry's main
trade association, claims that US miners pioneered responsible practices -
spending Dollars 14bn over the past 20 years to help the environment - and
religiously adhere to already tough government regulations.
'To say that the mining industry is 'ravaging' the earth is both a gross
distortion of the truth and an insult to the dedicated work of miners
everywhere who respect the land, its treasures and beauty,' says Mr John
Knebel, the AMC's president.
Even so, the lobby's bigger concern is a threatened congressional bill. The
House of Representatives version, sponsored by Democrat Mr Nick Rahall, was
the first hard rock mineral mining reform bill ever reported to the House
floor from committee.
The bill aims to change completely a century-old system under which anyone
can explore US federal lands and rights to plots for as little as Dollars
2.50 an acre after discovery of a valuable mineral deposits.
One provision would impose a rental fee for using the land and set stricter
regulations for repairing the area after mining is finished. The bill would
also place an 8 per cent royalty on gold, silver, platinum and other
hard-rock minerals extracted from federal lands. Environmentalists hope
these standards will make mineral prices reflect the ecological costs of
mining.
The industry pleads that current policy promotes new ventures on millions of
acres of unexplored federal land. It warns that the fee and royalty
provisions could dig deep into US mine profits and devastate communities,
mostly in western states, that depend heavily on mining.
But supporters counter that the present policy is a throw-back to the old
west - the current law was passed in 1872 - when the government aggressively
promoted settlement. Since minerals are no longer scarce (and the west is
settled), Mr Young says the administration has no excuse for ignoring the
ecological hazards posed to US land by mining ventures.
However, the study finds that severe harm has been done to developing
countries, which it says have been left ravaged and indebted by mining
development strategies. Many Third World countries became highly dependent
on mineral exports during the 1960s, but as prices fell in the past two
decades the pressure on producers to repay development debts has become too
great.
Zambia, which relies on copper for 86 per cent of its export revenue, is
held up as an example. When copper prices skidded in the early 1980s, the
country's economy went into a tail-spin: in 1989, the country's debt was 1.4
times its gross national product.
'The rich nations bear a special responsibility to help clean up the messes
created to satisfy their needs, and to ensure that new damage is kept to a
minimum,' says Mr Young. 'More attention - and funding - needs to be devoted
to diversifying the economies of mineral producing nations.'

<TEXT>
GOLD see-sawed in a volatile and extended fixing session, climbing to
Dollars 359 a troy ounce and then tumbling to fix at a 12-day low of Dollars
356.20 in what appeared to be a move by US investment funds to extricate
themselves from an overheated market. The price closed in London at Dollars
356.85 an ounce, down Dollars 1.60 on the day. Dealers said the recent
strength of the gold market had been futures-driven on the back of US fund
buying, with the spot price lagging and weighed down by producer sales. At
the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices extended Tuesday's chart-inspired
technical fall to close at Dollars 1,313.50 a tonne, down Dollars 14 on the
day. A rally in London's COCOA futures market ran out of steam, apparently
without having attracted producer delling. The September price touched
Pounds 617 a tonne before slipping back to close at Pounds 612 a tonne, up
Pounds 13 on the day. Dealers thought a sharp fall in SUGAR futures might
have been sparked by talk of a sugar freight enquiry from Cuba to Morocco
which was interpreted by some as suggesting that sugar was beginning to
emerge from the Latin American country. The fall gathered momentum with
heavy stop-loss selling.

WORLD TEA output in the first six months of 1992 fell by 17 per cent to 386m
kg compared with 465.2m kg in the corresponding period last year, the United
Planters' Association of Southern India said, reports Reuter from Coonoor.
The association said the fall in Sri Lanka was the greatest at 34.6m kg,
followed by India, 23.4m kg, and Kenya, 12.5m kg. Malawi, Zimbabwe,
Mauritius and Uganda reported marginal crop reductions.
But Bangladesh and Tanzania reported output gains of 500,000 kg and 200,000
kg respectively.
Sri Lanka's output fell to 68.5m kg in the first six months of 1992 from
103.1m in the same period of 1991. Kenya harvested 91.2m kg, compared with
103.7m kg.
The association said India's tea production was down to 174m kg in the
January to June period from 197.4m a year earlier.
The bulk of the Indian crop fall, up to 17.5m kg, was in the southern
region, which had suffered a drought. First half production in the southern
region June was 76.3m kg against 93.8m in the previous year.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lords urge more cuts in EC
fishing fleets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHASING out of industrial fishing within the European Community and
further reductions in community fleets are among the proposals in a critical
House of Lords report, published yesterday, on the EC's common fisheries
policy.
The Lords inquiry was prompted by the mid-term review of the CFP being
undertaken by the European Commission with a view to drawing up proposals
for reforms for the consideration of the council of ministers later this
year.
While criticising the policy's failure to ensure that fish stocks are
sufficient to support the fishing industry, the House of Lords Select
Committee on the European Communities concludes that the community fleet is
still too large and should be reduced further by decommissioning.
Structural funds should be made available to coastal communities to help
provide training and alternative employment for those who lose their jobs as
a result of fleet reductions, it says. To ensure value for money for
taxpayers' expenditure on decommissioning grants the report suggests that a
tendering system could be employed.
The committee's concern about industrial fishing (catching non-human
consumption species for animal feed production) is based on the threat it
poses of undermining the food chain for larger fish and the unacceptably
high by-catch of human consumption species. This type of fishing should be
phased out in EC waters over the next ten years, the report says.
The Lords committee also deplored the large-scale discarding of unwanted
species from human consumption catches. This practice, which wastes huge
quantities of fish, should be banned, the report says, with the fish that
otherwise would have been discarded being used for industrial purposes.
Whatever reforms are agreed by the EC fisheries ministers they should seek
to simplify the present complex regulations, the committee argues, pointing
out that the CFP can never work unless it is simple and enforceable.
It calls for harsher penalties for infringements ,including revocation of
licences.

<TEXT>
THAI banks, profiting from increased spreads between their cost of funds and
returns on lending, have reported sharply higher earnings in the first half
of 1992.
Net profits for Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, rose 45 per cent in the
first six months to Bt4.86bn (Dollars 192m) from Bt3.36bn in the same period
last year.
Total income was Bt37.53bn, against Bt37.25bn while interest expenses fell
to Bt21.76bn from Bt25.23bn, and operating expenses rose to Bt8.47bn from
Bt6.76bn.
Earnings per share rose to Bt4.86 from Bt4.2.
The biggest half-year increase so far was at Krung Thai Bank, whose net
profits jumped 123 per cent to Bt1.12bn from Bt502m. Earnings per share rose
to Bt8.3 from Bt5.2.
Thai Military Bank (TMB), the subject of a half-hearted boycott campaign
following the killing of more than 50 pro-democracy demonstrators in May
because it is one-third owned by the armed forces, reported a 60 per cent
rise in net profits to Bt757m from Bt473m, with earnings per share up to
Bt22.79 from Bt16.32.
TMB is expanding in the region and is planning to double its share capital
to Bt7bn to support new ventures in China, Indochina, Burma and the US.
Siam Commercial Bank's net profits rose 64 per cent to Bt1.92bn in the first
half from Bt1.17 and earnings per share increased 26 per cent to Bt50.5
against Bt40.3.
Thai Farmers Bank, whose aggressive pursuit of market share has worried some
investors, reported a rise in net profits of more than 50 per cent to
Bt2.39bn from Bt1.57bn, while earnings per share rose 16 per cent to Bt34.08
from Bt31.47.
Bank of Ayudhya's net profit rose 48 per cent to Bt1.16bn from Bt784m, with
earnings per share up 11 per cent to Bt2.91 from Bt2.61.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Cumulative losses of Dollars
358m in swaps market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMULATIVE losses in the swaps market total Dollars 358m, or 0.115 per cent
of the notional principal amount of swaps outstanding, according to a survey
released yesterday by the International Swap Dealers Association.
The survey was conducted among ISDA members, who account for about 70 per
cent of the Dollars 4,300bn swaps market.
'More than 90 per cent of the swap transactions in the portfolios surveyed
were with investment grade counterparties. This confirms the traditional
high credit quality of swap counterparties,' said Mr Akira Watanabe of
Mitsubishi Bank, vice-chairman of the association.
UK local authorities were the source of almost 50 per cent of the Dollars
358m of net losses.
Other categories of counterparties representing net losses were companies
(26 per cent), non-dealer financial institutions (17 per cent), and US
savings and loans institutions (6 per cent).
The report provided added ammunition for the association's fight in the US
against attempts to move over-the-counter swaps and options business on to
regulated exchanges, and bolstered ISDA's argument against calls for greater
regulatory control of over-the-counter derivatives business.
Some bank regulators have expressed concern that over-the-counter
derivatives business is increasing the level of risk undertaken by banks.
ISDA pointed out that losses in the swaps market compare favourably to other
types of credit losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S recently adopted stock exchange rules, might need revision, Mr Piero
Barucci, the new treasury minister has suggested. The rules were brought
into effect over the past 18 months to modernise equity trading.
The bourse legislation - concentrated in last year's law creating the
Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim) as Italy's new form of broking
and fund management hybrid - has been criticised domestically and by some of
Italy's Community partners.
The European Commission has been in contact with the Rome authorities
following complaints from some member states that the Sims law, which
obliges brokers trading certain types of securities to set up an office in
Italy, conflicts with EC rules on free competition.
Mr Barucci admitted it might be necessary to modify 'some points' of the
legislation to bring it in line with EC practice or to change regulations in
accordance with experience on the bourse since its introduction.
In a message to parliament, he indicated his preference for a simplification
of the supervisory and fiscal structure covering equity trading where these
were deemed to be prejudicial to the growth of a lively equity market.
Italy's stockbrokers are being squeezed by a drop in turnover and rising
costs, and they have complained bitterly about aspects of the new
legislation which they say have greatly increased the regulatory burden they
have to meet.
The new clearing and guarantee body for share trading on Italy's expanding
screen-based dealing system should start operations by the middle of next
month.
The new organisation will act as a clearing house for the country's
long-awaited government bond futures market.

<TEXT>
IN an otherwise quiet session in the Eurobond market, the European
Investment Bank launched a DFl 500m offering of floating rate notes via
Rabobank. Dealers said the issue was targeted at Italian investors, for whom
EIB paper is tax-exempt. The notes pay 60 basis points less than the
three-month Amsterdam interbank offered rate.
According to traders, there was little demand for the paper in the
Netherlands, where floating-rate notes are not a favoured investment, as
most institutional investors were keen to ensure fixed returns.
In the Euroyen sector, Mazda, the Japanese car company, launched two
offerings totalling Y30bn.
Elsewhere, Swiss Bank Corporation is to tender for up to Dollars 150m of
outstanding New Zealand Eurobonds. The 8 per cent bonds due 1997 were issued
in April 1987 and are believed to be held largely by European retail
investors. The price of the tender, which starts today and runs until
Friday, will be fixed initially at 48 basis points above the 6 3/8 per cent
US Treasury due 1997, but may vary during the tender period. At current
market levels, the indicated tender price is 107.10.
SBC has tendered for Commonwealth of Australia and Australian Wheat Board
Eurobonds. An official said the bank would either hold the bonds on its own
account, or sell them to investors.
Banque Paribas, France's fifth largest bank ranked by assets, has had its
long-term debt rating lowered from AA to AA- by IBCA, the European credit
rating agency. The agency cited Paribas's exposure to difficult markets,
such as French real estate, predicting that 'loan loss provisions are bound
to remain high'. However, the agency added that the bank should be able to
keep up its revenue stream.

However, it warned that profits would fall in the current year: a severe
drought in the South Island is affecting hydroelectricity lake levels.
Mr Rod Deane, chief executive, said savings were anticipated this year, but
these would be offset by interest and depreciation of NZDollars 100m

Another uncertainty facing the group was that the government may sell its

<TEXT>
DAIEI, the rapidly expanding Japanese retailer, will absorb a troubled
property affiliate, Nippon Dream Kanko, which reported consolidated losses
of Y450m (Dollars 3.52m) last year following the sharp fall in land prices.
Mr Isao Nakauchi, the Daiei chairman famed for aggressive acquisitions, said
his company would acquire Nippon Dream Kanko in a 'spirit of equality' for a
price expected to be set in October.
However, Daiei's rapid expansion has come as retail demand and property
prices have fallen. The takeover of Nippon Dream is a sign that Daiei is
under pressure.
Daiei recently agreed to acquire 34 per cent of Recruit, the business
information and property group, and has built holdings in several other
Japanese retailers.
Over the past few months, Daiei has shuffled shares around its affiliates to
raise funds for the Recruit acquisition and reduce its own debt burden, but
the complexity of the group structure has made unclear the true state of its
financial position.
Nippon Dream, in which Daiei now holds 28 per cent, runs pachinko parlours,
the Japanese version of pinball, and other leisure operations, as well as
owning a large tract of land in Osaka hit by falling property prices.
In the past, such land holdings were valuable as collateral, but Japanese
banks have become wary of their exposure to the weakening property market.

DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, reduced operating losses in the second
quarter, but after special restructuring charges it reported a final loss of
CDollars 72.6m (USDollars 60.5m), or 92 cents a share, against a loss of
CDollars 31.3m, or 47 cents, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens.
Sales were CDollars 549m against CDollars 557m. Before the special items
totalling 81 cents a share after tax, the operating net loss equalled 11
cents a share against 31 cents.
The domestic market for flat rolled steel remains weak, Dofasco said, and
imports are running abnormally high.
The first-half loss was CDollars 96.9m, or CDollars 1.23 a share, including
the special charges, against a loss of CDollars 26.8m, or 40 cents a share,
a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1bn.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: IBM confirms scheme to axe jobs

<TEXT>
SHARES in International Business Machines firmed yesterday morning after the
company admitted that at least 32,000 people would go in its job cutting
plan this year, well above IBM's earlier estimates of 15,000 to 20,000.
Two thirds of the job losses would be in the US and the rest mainly in
Europe.
Until the announcement on Tuesday, IBM had dismissed speculation that the
number of job cuts would range from 40,000 to 60,000. Analysts now expect
between 35,000 to 40,000 people to accept IBM's voluntary severance package.
Although the additional job cuts will cost IBM an extra Dollars 1.2bn, the
news was well received on Wall Street where shares in IBM firmed Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 94 3/8 yesterday morning.
IBM expects to take about Dollars 1bn in charges in the second half of this
year, with the biggest impact to its third-quarter results. Analysts have
estimated that charges related to the additional job cuts will reduce IBM's
second-half earnings by about Dollars 1 a share.
IBM, which last year reported its first annual loss of Dollars 2.8bn after
charges on sales of Dollars 64.8bn, said it would recoup these costs over
the next 18 months through savings.
The company also indicated that changes were afoot at its personal computer
division. In response to reports that its PC business would be turned into a
wholly-owned subsidiary, IBM said it had been working to sharpen the focus
of its PC operations, 'and you will continue to see us change'.
IBM would not comment about specific changes, but it has been working
towards increasing the autonomy and accountability of its business units
since December when it announced a restructuring of its worldwide
operations.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: LTV steel division remains in
the red

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LTV, the US steel group operating for five years under the protection of
bankruptcy courts, has reported a sharp rise in second-quarter net income,
thanks to a gain from the sale of a business. But its core steel operations
remained mired in red ink.
LTV's income was Dollars 138.6m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars
13.4m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. However, this was due to
a Dollars 150m net gain on the sale of its AM General vehicle manufacturing
business; without this it would have lost Dollars 11.4m. Sales totalled
Dollars 1.53bn, down from Dollars 1.56bn.
The company said the results mainly reflected lower quarter-to-quarter steel
selling prices and a decline in aerospace and defence operating income due
to the AM sale, partly offset by higher missiles division sales and a higher
volume of steel shipments.
The steel division had an operating loss of Dollars 28.4m, against Dollars
23.4m in the same period of last year. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 947m
and shipments were 8 per cent ahead at 1.88m tons.
The company said the loss was due to lower selling prices and higher
employment costs, mainly from a new union contract.
The group's aerospace and defence business reported income of Dollars 22.4m,
down from Dollars 37.4m, while energy products lost Dollars 2.9m, up from
Dollars 2.5m.
For the six months LTV reported net income of Dollars 95.3m, or 62 cents a
share, against a net loss of Dollars 32.9m, or 39 cents, while sales dipped
from Dollars 2.99bn to Dollars 2.92bn.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Provision warning from Hafslund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAFSLUND Nycomed, Norway's second biggest listed company, yesterday reported
a 40 per cent increase in half-year pre-tax profit to NKr757m (Dollars
130m), but warned of a 'relatively large' provision in the third quarter.
Mr Oeyvind Broeymer, vice-president of finance, said the company had granted
a NKr100m mortgage loan in connection with the 1990 disposal of Hafslund
Metall, acquired by the Ila Lilleby group, a small domestic ferro silicon
producer.
Hafslund also maintained a put option to transfer 33 per cent of the
subsidiary's shares to Ila.
Mr Broeymer said there was little equity left in Ila Lilleby because of huge
losses suffered in the past two years due to weak ferro silicon prices. The
company might find it difficult to repay outstanding debt on the Hafslund
loan and acquire the remaining shares of Hafslund Metall.
Negotiations are under way with Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, Ila's two
main creditors, but a relatively large loan loss provision will most likely
be made n the third quarter , Hafslund said.
Apart from this development, Hafslund said prospects for 1992 as a whole
were favourable.
Group half-year operating profit rose by NKr133m to NKr842m as operating
revenue increased 13 per cent to NKr2.907bn, including royalties of NKr289m.

credit demand

<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, the smallest of Germany's big three banks and the first to
announce its figures for the first half of the year, yesterday reported
group profits - excluding securities trading results - up 14.7 per cent to
DM875m (Dollars 593.6m) to the end of June.
The bank said demand for credit from its domestic customers had been
'persistently brisk' during the six months and total lending volume rose by
2.4 per cent to DM161.7bn. Taking into account trading profits, total group
profits were up 17.5 per cent to DM975m.
Reflecting a slight improvement in the interest rate margin, to 1.94 per
cent across the group, net interest earnings rose by 12.3 per cent to
DM2.2bn. Because of a weaker trend in securities transactions, net
commission income fell by 2.2 per cent to DM633m.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, warned that because of generally
difficult economic conditions the bank would probably have to make
provisions for individual loan losses. The effect of this would be countered
by extraordinary profits, chiefly via share disposals, he said.
Commerzbank has a large exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the ailing Canadian
property developer. It totals about DM560m, but Mr Kohlhaussen said
yesterday he felt the bank was unlikely to lose any money as a result. He
cited the bank's particularly good security, but also said he was heartened
by a recent visit to the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands.
Mr Kohlhaussen gave no clue as to when the bank would hold its rights issue,
and sought to dampen speculation that it was discussing concrete proposals
for a share swap and co-operation agreement with Paribas of France.

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday revealed a drop in
half-year net profit to NKr1.7bn (Dollars 291m) from NKr2.4bn last year, and
warned that for the year as a whole net profit will be below the NKr4.196bn
for 1991.
Lower oil prices, weaker refinery margins and 'extremely' low prices for
petrochemicals products contributed to the weaker six-month performance,
Statoil said.
'We are clearly not satisfied with the result and are looking at measures to
cut costs and reduce investments to adjust to a weaker market,' said Mr
Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive.
Group operating profit at the half-year fell to NKr7.1bn from NKr7.6bn last
time as operating revenue advanced by NKr2bn to NKr40bn.
Second quarter net profit dipped by NKr47m to NKr861m while operating profit
rose by NKr800m to NKr4.2bn. Operating revenue increased by NKr2bn to
NKr40bn.
Statoil also complained that a higher 1992 tax burden was unlikely to be
offset by high oil production and cost reductions.
For the individual business units, exploration and production saw half-year
operating profit dip NKr1bn to NKr4.9bn due to low oil prices.
The natural gas division's operating profit rose NKr200m to NKr2.1bn thanks
to higher volumes of gas transported. Refining and marketing operating
profit was slashed by NKr279m to NKr471m, hit by lower margins and weaker
shipping operations in a depressed tanker market.
Petrochemicals and plastics, the group's worst performer, plunged to an
operating loss of NKr172m from a profit of NKr100m last year due to a 'deep'
recession affecting the petrochemicals industry, Statoil said.
Statoil warned that results for refining and petrochemicals would be lower
this year.

UNION Bank of Switzerland said in a preliminary interim statement that
business in the first half of 1992 developed positively both for the parent
bank and the group, compared with the same period in 1991.
But the bank, Switzerland's largest, said business had slowed in recent
months because of the slow economic recovery and the caution investors were
showing in forex and securities markets.
Group cash flow was up and off balance sheet business made a much stronger
contribution to income growth than interest related operations.
Total assets of the parent bank at the end of June stood at SFr201.98bn
(Dollars 154.95bn) against SFr199.67bn at the end of March. UBS said it
would publish for the first time a full consolidated interim statement at
the end of August.

FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Ford of Europe turns in Dollars
24m profit
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Europe achieved a net profit of Dollars 24m in the second quarter of
the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 75m in the corresponding period a
year ago.
The pace of the company's financial recovery in Europe remains slow,
however, following a net profit of Dollars 84m in the first quarter which
compared with a loss of Dollars 129m in the same period of 1991.
Ford said Jaguar, its troubled UK luxury car subsidiary, suffered a loss of
around Dollars 70m in the second quarter, virtually unchanged from a year
ago. Jaguar made a loss of Dollars 90m in the first quarter compared with a
loss of Dollars 130m in the same period a year ago.
Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a net
loss in the whole of last year of Dollars 1.08bn from a net profit of
Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
The company said that Ford of Britain - now excluding Jaguar, whose
ownership was transferred last year to the US parent company - had achieved
a small profit in the second quarter as in the first quarter, after running
up record losses in the whole of last year.
Ford of Britain's financial performance improved thanks to higher production
volumes, cost reductions and in particular lower marketing costs.
Ford said its marketing costs across Europe were virtually unchanged from a
year ago, however.
Costs in the UK have been reduced 'substantially' by a cut in sales to the
daily rental fleets and through reduced dealer stocks, but this has been
offset by higher marketing expenditure in Germany, where competition is
becoming more fierce as the market declines.
Ford has lost market share in the west European car market this year largely
through the weakness of its ageing Sierra large family car range.
It hopes to boost its fortunes early next year, however, with the launch of
the new generation Sierra as well as a redesigned Escort/Orion later this
year.
In 1993-94 it is planning to export two new product ranges from the US to
Europe, the Probe sports coupe and the Explorer four-wheel-drive leisure
utility vehicle, while sales are also due to start next year of another
four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle to be produced for Ford in Spain by
Nissan.

drop

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER metal prices and reduced deliveries led to a 56 per cent fall in
second-quarter net earnings, at PT International Nickel Indonesia (PT Inco).
Net earnings were USDollars 8.6m, or 4 cents a share, compared with Dollars
19.4m, or 8 cents, in the second quarter last year. Net earnings for the
first half of 1992 were down by 43 per cent from Dollars 29m, or 12 cents,
to Dollars 16.4m, or 7 cents.
PT Inco, which was floated on the Jakarta stock exchange in April 1990 but
is still 58 per cent owned by Inco of Canada, said second-quarter nickel
production fell to 18.5m lb from 19.7m lb because of a planned rebuilding
and upgrading of one of its three electric furnaces.
Nickel deliveries fell to 16.8m lb from 21.3m lb.
The company's net realised price for nickel in matte - an intermediate
product - in the second quarter was Dollars 2.61 a lb compared with Dollars
2.67 in the first quarter and Dollars 3.07 in the second quarter of 1991.
Nickel stocks, which were 1.4m lb at the end of March, had risen to 3.1m lb
at the end of the second quarter. Net sales in the quarter fell from Dollars
66m to Dollars 44.6m and in the half year from Dollars 111.2m to Dollars
86m.

SEMEN Gresik, one of Indonesia's largest cement producers, yesterday
announced net profits of Rp40.8bn (Dollars 20m) in the six months to June,
up 49 per cent on a year earlier.
However, brokers warned of depressed earnings in the second half and
estimated 1992 net profits at about Rp65bn.
The company, in which the government retains a majority stake, went public
last year and is undertaking a Rp605bn expansion to lift capacity to 4.1m
tonnes per annum by mid-1994 from 1.5m tonnes.
Sales for the six months to June fell 2.3 per cent to 669,483 tonnes while
operating income fell 13 per cent and operating margins fell to 14 per cent
from 17 per cent.
At the end of June, Gresik held Rp392bn on time deposit and interest income
of Rp51bn for the half-year accounted for 82 per cent of taxable income.
Brokers expected time deposits to fall to Rp60bn by year-end as payments for
the expansion programme became due.
Gresik's share price yesterday was unchanged at Rp5,700, but brokers said it
could suffer from the expected flotation next month of Semen Tonasa, a
state-owned cement company with a capacity of 1.2m tonnes a year.
Plans to float Tonasa in 1990 were postponed after a fall in the Jakarta
stock exchange.

COLORVISION, the consumer electronics retailer, reported profits before tax

The outcome was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 808,000, needed
after payments made to creditors, which had not been accounted for, came to
light after the accounts were computerised last year.
The company reported profits of Pounds 2.21m pre-tax for the 12 months to

Turnover was Pounds 88.5m. Like for like sales for the 12 months ended March
31 rose by 17 per cent. The group has expanded the number of stores from 75
to 83.
Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said: 'It is evident that the economy is
still in recession but nonetheless we have continued to increase our share
of the television video recorder, camcorder and satellite dish markets.'
A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 8.1p for the 18 month
period.
Earnings per share were 6.5p.

its status as a special operator to the Euro Disney theme park as sales to
the resort had been disappointing.
The company said it was unlikely to remain a special operator when its
contract comes up for renewal next year.
Euro Disney said it had eight special operators in the UK and most appeared
happy with the arrangements. In some cases, operators had asked for
additional Euro Disney capacity to meet demand.
Special operators have the right to book places at Euro Disney's own hotels
and receive assistance with promotion and marketing.
Mr George Marcall, Airtours sales director, said it was difficult to say how
well the rest of the company's high season programme was selling. 'The
situation is getting better. Prices are holding,' he said.
Airtours shares closed at 253p, up 22p on the day.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructured FMT in the black on reduced
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FMT, the Brighton-based producer of sophisticated machining centres,
lightened the gloom hovering over the UK machine tool industry by announcing
it had made a first-half profit and won Pounds 1.7m of orders in June.
Profit figures were not disclosed, but were struck on slightly lower
turnover of Pounds 7.5m. The company has gone through a series of
restructuring moves in the past year which have reduced employment from 450
to just over 200.
Mr Mike Bright, chairman, said he had 'high hopes' that the company could
remain in profit this year, even though the effects of reduced order intake
in the UK over the past months had not yet fed through to the results.
The recent batch of orders includes more than Pounds 1m to rebuild seven
machine tools for two customers, Cummins Engine and Rockwell.
In addition, two new machining centres have been ordered by Crosrol, the
textile machinery manufacturers. Together with pallet stands, these are
valued at more than Pounds 650,000 and will extend two machining cells
already installed.
FMT, formerly called KTM, was acquired in 1988 by Mr Bright and five senior
managers in a Pounds 10.6m buy-out from Vickers, the engineering group.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fairey to buy Infrared Eng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIREY GROUP, the diversified engineering company, has agreed to buy
Essex-based Infrared Engineering and its marketing and technical support
subsidiaries in Boston and Stuttgart in a deal worth Pounds 11.5m.
Infrared makes specialist gauges used to measure moisture, fat and protein
for the food, paper and tobacco industries and the thickness of plastic
films and coatings.
Fairey said Infrared had achieved compound annual sales growth of 12 per
cent over the last five years, with 80 per cent of its turnover exported. In
the year to March 31 underlying pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.4m on sales of
Pounds 7.3m.
Fairey is paying Pounds 10.3m for Infrared by issuing 2.68m new shares to
the six vendors who are currently directors.
The five executive directors remaining with Infrared after the acquisition
will retain 827,676 Fairey shares.
The balance of the shares has been underwritten by Cazenove and will be
placed with investment clients at 380p per share. Fairey's shares added 7p
to 400p.
By separate contract, Fairey has agreed to buy from the Infrared directors'
pension fund the freehold building from which Infrared operates for Pounds
1.2m cash.
Fairey expects to increase its dividend for the six months to June 30 by 10
per cent to 3.3p.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Misys turns in strong recovery to Pounds
9.12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISYS, the computer services group, reported a strong recovery in the year
to May 31, with pre-tax profits rising 62 per cent from Pounds 5.63m to
Pounds 9.12m.
The increase was mainly the result of reduced costs, improved margins and
tight control of working capital, said Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman.
There was also an absence of exceptional charges - last time Pounds 1.05m
was deducted from the pre-tax line for redundancies, full listing costs and
losses on the sale of Modular Technology. Operating profits rose 28 per cent
to Pounds 8.87m (Pounds 6.93m).
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 68m (Pounds 67.5m), though the cost of sales
declined by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 28.6m. Overheads fell by Pounds
229,000 to Pounds 30.6m.
Mr Lomax said that the margins were better because the software content of
the group's sales was increasing and the hardware reducing. Software is
priced on the size of applications, or the number of stations, giving it
higher margins.
However, product sales were down by 7 per cent, though this was compensated
for by the 18 per cent increase in service revenues, which now account for
39 per cent of total sales. In the year to May 1990 the figure was 25 per
cent.
Mr Lomax said the demand for working capital was 'modest', that the group
carried very little stock and that debtor days were 36 - 'good within the
industry', he said.
The company has cash balances of almost Pounds 10m (Pounds 6.9m), after
spending Pounds 3m on acquisition costs. Always known as an acquisitive
company, Misys bought Innsite, the provider of software for the hotel
industry, and a maintenance company during the year.
At the end of the period, it bought the balances of Countrywide Holdings
(UK) and Countrywide Management Group that it did not own - 'a large infill
acquisition', said Mr Lomax, to boost Misys Financial Systems with insurance
trading products.
Earnings per share rose to 17.8p (11.5p) per share and the final dividend is
lifted 9 per cent to 3.83p to make 6.1p (5.67p) for the year.
The shares closed up 13p to 304p.
COMMENT
Computer software companies fall into two camps. There are those, like
Misys, which make products and then market them. They have the benefit of
short order books. They were hit hard earlier in the recession and are now
bouncing back. Then there are the Hoskyns and Logicas of this world which
make bespoke systems to order. Things aren't so pretty there. Misys also
locked many of its customers into good service contracts in the good times;
these are now helping it in the bad. That, and the financial services side
contribute the bulk of profits, which makes the Countrywide purchases, with
their recurring revenues, seem sound. Assuming, perhaps generously, pre-tax
profits of Pounds 14m for the current year, earnings will be 25.2p per share
giving a prospective multiple of 12.1, a marginal premium to the market
average. A buy, but not without risk.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Higher revenues boost margins at The
Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER REVENUES boosted operating margins at The Telegraph, the UK newspaper
group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group has a 68 per cent stake, in
the half-year to June 30.
That led to a 30 per cent increase in operating profits, from Pounds 16.4m
to Pounds 21.3m, and lifted pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 21.6m.
The group was floated on the stock market early this month at a price of
325p, but the shares fell sharply when dealings began. Yesterday they rose
16 1/2 p to 292 1/2 p.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph, said that the low cost
base meant a rise in revenues had an even greater effect on profits.
Operating margins rose from 14.9 per cent to 17.8 per cent.
Sales rose 8.6 per cent to Pounds 119.9m, with revenue from circulation,
including a cover price rise in February, and advertising contributing
roughly equally to the gain. Mr Cooke said display advertising had been dull
in March and April, but began to recover in May and was good in June.
The pre-tax result, which included first quarter profits of Pounds 9.5m
(Pounds 7.9m), was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 2.2m relating to
the flotation (Pounds 1.5m) and net interest income of Pounds 700,000
(Pounds 4m).
The prospectus had warned that the second quarter would bear, for the first
time, the Pounds 1m a quarter cost of moving to Canary Wharf in London's
Docklands. It said interest income would be Pounds 600,000 lower in the
quarter, and Pounds 1m lower in future quarters, because of the Pounds 20.2m
purchase of a stake in Trinity International and the Pounds 13.4m cost of a
special pre-flotation dividend.
Associate profits rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 1.8m, largely
reflecting the 15 per cent stake in John Fairfax, the Australian media
group.
This is regarded as an associate, although The Telegraph does not have any
contractual right to board representation.
The tax charge rose from 20.4 per cent to 31 per cent, as accumulated tax
losses dating back to the mid-1980s had now been used up. As a result,
earnings per share fell slightly to 11.1p (11.4p). The interim dividend is
the promised 4.5p.
COMMENT
The Telegraph's rather meagre statement yesterday shows it has not quite got
the hang of being a public company yet, and the doubts about having a
majority shareholder remain. That said, the company redeemed itself with
slightly better than expected results. The jump in operating margins came as
something of a surprise even though the prospectus published a month earlier
hinted at the high operational gearing of the group. It is a reminder of the
money that can be made in a relatively mature market when things start
moving the right way. The February price increase has not hit copy sales,
and arguably readers are getting a better product as new sections are
introduced. Forecasts have gone up to Pounds 44m (Pounds 40.5m) or more and
the prospective p/e of about 13.3 is now reasonable. The shares may find it
difficult to rise above the 325p issue price for some time, though.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Expanded David S Smith declines to Pounds
15m - Acquisitions shift balance towards Continent and specialisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID S Smith, the UK's largest paper maker which has expanded its packaging
interests, suffered a 36 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 23.9m
to Pounds 15.4m, in the year to May 2.
However, the fall was only 5 per cent to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 25.3m) before
exceptional costs of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 1.4m). These related mainly to
redundancies and other reorganisation expenses related to rationalisation of
a number of production facilities.
The figures were slightly better than the market had expected and the shares
rose 4p to 264p.
The company acquired Kaysersberg Packaging of France on April 1. The total
consideration for this and some other smaller acquisitions during the year
totalled Pounds 177.3m. They contributed Pounds 17.5m to sales of Pounds
361.5m (Pounds 363.5m) and about Pounds 1.5m to operating profits of Pounds
22m (Pounds 31.3m).
Mr Peter Williams, who became chief executive in May 1991, said the
acquisitions had shifted the balance of Smith's business to continental
Europe and specialist packaging, rather than commodity product areas.
The acquisitions, financed largely by a Pounds 50.7m rights issue at 295p in
May last year and a Pounds 97.4m placing at 283p in January this year,
greatly increased the company's size - thus reducing its dependence on the
future of its Kemsley mill.
Kemsley, acquired in 1989, has absorbed considerable capital expenditure. It
will not be fully on stream until autumn 1993. Kemsley was a 'tremendous
opportunity,' Mr Williams said, but had been a drag on the company, costing
about Pounds 6m at the operating level as well as requiring heavy spending.
Mr Williams said he was reasonably satisfied with the results, considering
the difficult trading conditions. Prices for corrugated packaging had fallen
and volumes were weak. He hoped there might be some recovery coming, partly
because some competitors had announced capacity closures.
Capital expenditure during the year was Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 15m). But Mr
Williams said the figure would probably more than double this year as
spending on Kemsley peaked.
Shareholders' funds had risen from Pounds 118.2m to Pounds 204.2m, mainly
because of the share issues, and net debt had increased from Pounds 25.5m to
Pounds 46.1m.
Interest receivable of Pounds 2.1m compared with Pounds 6m payable.
Earnings per share were 11.5p (23.3p) and the promise of a 6.75p final
dividend made with the placing is being kept, to give an unchanged total of
9.5p.
COMMENT
Under new management, Smith is continuing some of its past characteristics -
rapid expansion through acquisition and plenty of share issues. Fortunately
the story the management has to tell has, if anything, improved. Hopes for
Kemsley are high, especially as on current progress it should be ready to
enjoy the economic upturn when it finally comes. Meanwhile, the Kaysersberg
deal should provide a boost to profits and earnings this year, although
there will be an interest charge too. Profits should jump to Pounds 33m,
giving a p/e of 13, and leap again the following year, with the multiple
coming down to about 10. The company's amazingly loyal shareholders can now
see their reward on the horizon, although even they may get a little
restless when the price rises to the rights issue level.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jobs warning as Scholey retires from
British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ROBERT Scholey brought down the curtain yesterday on his 47-year career
in the steel industry with a warning that British Steel could reduce its
costs further and would emerge from the recession 'as sharp as a knife.'
Speaking at his last annual meeting as chairman of the struggling UK steel
maker, Sir Robert said: 'We shall shrink not in terms of tonnage produced
but in terms of labour costs. The days when steel could be seen as a large
employer of people are over.'
His statement coincided with the announcement that British Steel had signed
a definitive agreement with Avesta which will lead to the merger of the
Swedish stainless steel producer and virtually all British Steel's stainless
operations.
Preliminary agreement on the deal, which creates a new force in the world
stainless industry, was announced on June 29.
Yesterday, Sir Robert said such strategic alliances were necessary in
Europe, 'and most probably a requirement on a more global basis, and will, I
believe, go a long way to resolving the current problems of the world steel
industry.'
His warning of further job cuts echoed the company's position when it
announced - also on June 29 - its Pounds 55m pre-tax loss for 1991-92. The
workforce was cut by 7,000 during the year to 44,800, and, with the closure
of Ravenscraig in Scotland and concentration of hot rolled coil production
in South Wales, is expected to dip below 42,000 by the end of the current
financial year.
Sir Robert regretted that his last AGM came at a time when trading
conditions were so difficult.
He will be replaced as chairman by Sir Alistair Frame. The outgoing chairman
paid tribute to two British Steel directors who are also retiring, Mr Frank
Fitzgerald and Sir Derek Birkin.

FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Internal inquiry at Richmond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHMOND OIL &amp; Gas, the natural resources company which finds itself at the
centre of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry into irregular share dealings, has
launched an internal investigation into the underwriting arrangements for
its 1989 flotation.
Mr Terry Steele, a non-executive director appointed in January 1991, said
that possible changes to the board had been discussed, but any decision
would depend on the outcome of the internal inquiry.
He hoped to 'hear some comment internally' on the company's own inquiry
before the weekend. A full board meeting is scheduled for August 5.
Mr Steele said a statement would be made by Mr Robert Fox, chairman, when
the internal inquiry was completed.
An investigation by Price Waterhouse, reported in the Financial Times
earlier this week, cited evidence for what appeared to be a circle of funds
in the July 1989 flotation. The accountancy firm suggested that the cash
circle was used to give the impression that the sub-underwriting for
Richmond's offer had been fully financed.
Mr David Wilkinson, then chairman and now joint managing director of
Richmond, said before the article appeared that he had been unaware of any
such circle.
Mr Steele said Richmond had contacted the SFO several weeks ago regarding
its investigation, which was prompted by the Price Waterhouse report.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Ford returns to half-year profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR yesterday underscored the gradually improving outlook for US car
manufacturers when it reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 502m
(Pounds 262.8m), compared with a loss of Dollars 324m a year ago.
However, Mr Harold Poling, chairman, said the US economy remained fragile,
and those in many main overseas markets, remained fragile. He said it would
continue to be difficult to achieve healthy results in the rest of 1992.
Ford's profits, on revenues up 13 per cent at Dollars 26.8bn, worked through
to earnings of 93 cents a share, against losses of 68 cents in the second
quarter of last year. This was lower than Wall Street forecasts of around 99
cents.
However, analysts said underperformance was due to a higher-than-expected
tax charge, and that on an operating basis the company had done better than
predicted. The figures followed higher-than-forecast results from Chrysler
on Tuesday.
In the US, which has seen improving demand for vehicles after the 1991
recession, Ford's car operations earned Dollars 148m, compared with a loss
of Dollars 565m.
The main factors in the turnaround were improving sales volumes across the
industry, leading to higher factory use and lower discounts to buyers. In
addition, Ford improved its share of the car and truck market, thanks
largely to its revamped Taurus and Sable mid-sized cars and Explorer
four-wheel drive vehicles. It also cut the proportion of its vehicles going
to low-margin fleet buyers.
Outside the US, the motor business earned Dollars 65m, compared with a loss
of Dollars 2m. However, Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker Ford bought in 1989,
lost about Dollars 70m, roughly the same as a year ago.
The group's overall results were also buoyed up by lower interest rates and
record earnings by its financial services business - Dollars 289m, up
Dollars 46m from 1991, thanks to lower credit losses and higher net interest
margins.
Mr David McCammon, Ford's treasurer, said the company expected profits to
dip from the second quarter level in the third quarter, due to seasonal
factors.
For the six months, Ford reported net income of Dollars 840.3m, or Dollars
1.53 a share, compared with losses of Dollars 1.2bn, or Dollars 2.56 a
share, a year ago on revenues which rose from Dollars 45.2bn to Dollars
51.4bn.

FT  30 JUL 92 / BAT sees sharp rise in pre-tax profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED mortgage indemnity losses helped BAT Industries, the tobacco and
financial services group, increase pre-tax profits by 55 per cent to Pounds
645m in the six months to June 30. Group revenue rose 5 per cent to Pounds
9.42bn.
Eagle Star, the group's insurance subsidiary, which has been hit heavily by
UK domestic mortgage losses, cut its first-half loses from Pounds 175m to
Pounds 47m.
The improvement in Eagle Star's general business allowed the group to use
more Advance Corporation Tax, cutting its tax rate from 57 per cent to 42
per cent.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 22.9p (10.1p) and the interim
dividend was lifted by 9 per cent to 14.6p.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the dividend increase was in line with
BAT's commitment to sustained dividend growth in excess of inflation, and
was a rate he expected to be at least maintained. BAT's shares closed 22p
higher at 756p.
The group said the 6 per cent increase in tobacco's trading profit to Pounds
475m reflected good performance in most domestic and export markets. Export
volumes grew 20 per cent and now account for a fifth of total cigarette
sales.
Trading profits from BAT's financial services businesses jumped to Pounds
252m from Pounds 83m. Farmers - the group's US arm - increased its
contribution from Pounds 168m to Pounds 204m.
During the second quarter, BAT said Farmers had become the fourth largest
property and casualty insurer in the US, having progressed from eighth
largest in 1988.
Sir Patrick said the sustained improvement in Eagle Star's underwriting
performance was especially encouraging, and had been aided by fair but
rigorous claims handling procedures.
Eagle Star made provisions for losses on its domestic mortgage business of
Pounds 49m, compared with Pounds 121m previously. Claims are triggered when
the proceeds from the sale of a repossessed property are less than the value
of the outstanding mortgage.
Sir Patrick said talks were continuing with building societies to see
whether they could agree a new system, whereby both insurers and building
societies groups 'shared the pain' of a fall in the house prices.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Beyond the economic chill in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD A J MAYNARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Please do not listen only to the gloomsters. Your analysis of the
impact of Japan's latest rate cut ('Time runs out for the patience
principle', July 27) paints a picture of a nation with nothing to look
forward to but economic rigor mortis.
It is true that corporate profit growth rates, capital expenditure, business
confidence, consumer spending and the Tokyo stock market have all taken a
buffeting.
But gloomsters overlook two factors; one economic, the other sociological.
With a full-year net trade balance close to (or above) Dollars 100bn, no
government budget deficit, and gross national product on course for at least
2 per cent growth, Japan's economy is still more robust than any other among
the G7 nations.
But perhaps more significant; whenever in the past the Japanese economy has
been hit by what looked like a knockout blow, as it was by the quadrupling
of oil prices in the 1970s, its response has always been a period of
analytical reflection (known as 'hansei') - followed by re-emergence as a
more efficient and better-structured economy ready to enter another
formidable growth phase. I'm going to watch it happen all over again.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Intolerable burden on Blue Arrow judge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDMUND LAWSON QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write purely in a personal capacity.
That said, let me declare a possible interest: I acted as counsel to a
corporate defendant in the Blue Arrow trial, my client being acquitted by
direction of Mr Justice McKinnon and therefore not involved in the appeal
which was finally resolved on Tuesday.
And, please, let me disclaim an interest: my first and only contact with Mr
Justice McKinnon was in connection with that trial. It happens that I lack
judicial ambition. Thus, in writing as I do, I have neither a personal nor a
professional axe to grind.
The extent to which Mr Justice McKinnon is to be criticised in respect of
aspects of the conduct of the trial is for others to assess.
However, it ought at least to be pointed out that throughout, he dealt
courteously and promptly with every submission made; he had the courage and
integrity to confess that, in respect of corporate defendants, his previous
rejection of an application to direct acquittal was 'wrong'; and ultimately
he sought to reduce the jury's burden in a genuine, albeit - as the Court of
Appeal indicated - erroneous but undoubtedly bona fide attempt to secure
fairness.
Lord Lane, before his retirement, spoke of the 'intolerable burden' on
judges trying serious fraud cases. Those of us who sat through the Blue
Arrow case witnessed a supremely honourable attempt to discharge that
burden.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report of the study, sponsored by the Department of Employment, on
employee involvement ('Team briefing has little effect on commitment', July
27), is unjustifiably gloomy about team briefing. Many employers would be
pleased that the introduction of a simple monthly drill contributed to
nearly 60 per cent of employees knowing more about their organisation.
Team briefing has become part of the accepted vocabulary of the workplace -
a tribute to the many employers who know that ignorance is incompatible with
effectiveness and profitability.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: The case for independent input
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M F PADOVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The topical subject of corporate governance and the desirability of
involving non-executive or 'independent' directors centres on the belief
that this leads to better corporate decision-making. Independents are
expected to be good at distinguishing the wood from the trees, and at
ensuring that executives (normally with unquestioned technical competence)
use to the full the experience and objectivity which non-executives can
bring.
Why then, with near unanimity among both practitioners and regulators on the
desirability of the independent input, is it ignored as an aid to good
decision-taking in some regulatory bodies themselves?
Take the Serious Fraud Office. Would it not be sensible to have a panel of
senior professionals, businessmen and academics, who could be co-opted when
decisions are to be taken on whether to prosecute, what charges to bring,
how much 'plea bargaining' to allow, what further resources to allocate to
an investigation, and so on.
There is little confidence in the effectiveness and efficiency of recent
City prosecutions: the success ratio has been low and judgment on which
cases to press on with and which to abandon has looked unbalanced to say the
least.
The SFO has achieved little in protecting the City's good name at a time
when this has never been more important and when most would agree that in
reality London is a 'cleaner' place to do business than any comparable
financial centre.

Sir, With reference to your article 'On Parade' (July 14) and at the risk of
disagreeing with Mr Algosaibi (Letters, July 16), I have been travelling

customs/immigration system well enough to negotiate it within 20 minutes,
without special treatment. Is this is a marketable service?

FT  30 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A vacuum in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS NOT only in Europe that the end of the cold war has allowed simmering
disputes to re-emerge. China's reassertion of its claim to the Spratly
Islands, a group of remote atolls and rocks surrounded by a seabed that
might yield oil, is a reminder of the fragile security balance in the
world's fastest-growing region. Asia's patchwork of bilateral relationships
may no longer be adequate to handle the potential confrontations.
Acceptance of China's claim to the Spratlys would effectively concede to it
control of the entire South China Sea, deeply alarming for Vietnam and the
neighbouring south-east Asian nations, most of which claim all or part of
the Spratlys for themselves. What the latest row exposes is the deep
suspicion between Asian countries and their perception of a power vacuum
following the closure of US bases in the Philippines. Asia lacks a forum in
which positions can be sounded out, disputes aired and confidence built.
Asia's security framework remains as it developed during the cold war: a
central relationship between the US and Japan, bilateral ties between the US
and other countries, and a strong US naval presence. As well as countering
Soviet influence, this network helped to keep the regional peace. However,
the underlying rationale for it has disappeared. The regional aims of all
five leading powers - the US, Russia, China, Japan and India - are now
unclear. There are strong fears in Asia of a lessening US commitment because
of domestic pressure for defence cuts. South-east Asian countries are
responding by spending heavily on arms, and vying to host American forces.
Among potentially dangerous problems are the wobbly peace process in
Cambodia and Korea. Washington has scaled down its military presence in
South Korea, although it views the North's nuclear development as the
region's most serious threat. The manner and timing of the unification of
the two Koreas carries the potential for political uncertainty and economic
instability. However, Seoul resists 'two plus four' talks along German lines
because the four would include Japan.
Mixed feelings about the role Japan should play are at the heart of
uncertainty about regional security. As the pre-eminent economic power with
large investments in other parts of Asia, it has a mutually dependent
relationship with the rest of the region. It is also a substantial military
power. However, the debate over its participation in peace-keeping forces
revealed deep reservations in Japan and elsewhere.
The next US president will need to reiterate explicitly Washington's
commitment to a strong role in preserving Asian security. Asian countries
should meanwhile make greater efforts to discuss security problems among
themselves. Meetings of the Association of South-east Asian Nations are
being used on an ad hoc basis, but it is doubtful whether Asean has the
substance or scope to be a proper security forum. There is a good case for
an Asian security framework along the lines of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe, with all the regional powers including Japan
playing key roles. Precisely because Asian nations find it so hard to
discuss their potential differences, they should make the attempt to do so.

BRICKS &amp; MORTALS The dream of the 80s and the nightmare of the 90s: the
inside story of the property world
By Alastair Ross Goobey
Century Business, Pounds 25, 218 pages
The UK property market is still in the grip of the worst recession that most
of its participants have seen. The half-empty, loss-making office blocks and
shopping centres that litter the country are monuments to a startling
reversal of fortune over the past five years.
The industry is paying a heavy price for the delusions of the second half of
the 1980s. That was a time when finance was easy and cheap; rents appeared
to have no upper limits, buildings changed hands every few months at
increasingly inflated prices and developers ignored the scale of the
property expansion, convinced of the superiority of their projects.
The perpetrators of this self-confidence trick were a motley crew. They
ranged from the urbane, such as the old Harrovian Beckwith brothers to
down-to-earth, self-made men, such as the Richardson twins, who became the
standard bearers for the regeneration of the Black Country in the English
Midlands.
Some were obsessed by deal-making: Tony Clegg of Mountleigh, who would
conduct five meetings at once by portable phone over breakfast, sold most of
his development projects before completion.
Some, such as Greycoat's Geoffrey Wilson, kept a resolutely low profile, in
spite of creating some of the most notable buildings in London, such as
Embankment place above Charing Cross station. Others, including the
eccentric Godfrey Bradman of Rosehaugh hogged the headlines.
Such characters and the ups-and-downs of the property industry is a
compelling story, which, surprisingly, has not been told properly since 1967
when Oliver Marriott wrote The Property Boom. This neglect prompted Alastair
Ross Goobey, chief investment strategist of James Capel, to fill the gap.
Bricks and Mortals is a valuably detailed and accurate chronology with a
good section on the changes in building design and architecture in the
1980s. But it is not as entertaining or as comprehensive as The Property
Boom. It begins badly, with an overlong and sometimes clumsy account of the
structure of the UK property industry such as. Later, it often degenerates
into a catalogue of deals.
Nor does Bricks and Mortals fully live up to its subtitle: The dream of the
'80s and the nightmare of the '90s . . . While it covers the slow recovery
of the industry in the 1970s and the heady 1980s in detail, it does not do
justice to the drama of the present slump.
Overall, Ross Goobey adopts a relatively sanguine attitude to the state of
the property market, believing that the decline in rents, one of the
principal causes of the current slump, will reverse sooner than most
commentators think.
At times, the book gives the impression that it has been overtaken by
events. It skates over the desperate position of some of the companies it
describes: the collapse of Olympia &amp; York and Mountleigh command just a few
paragraphs.
Ross Goobey's central thesis is that the newcomers of the 1980s made the
same mistakes as those who fell in the 1970s crash. Those who survived the
earlier crash, such as Lord Sterling of P&amp;O and John Ritbat of British Land,
avoided the same mistakes a second time around.
The author pins much of the blame for the current crash on the personalities
involved. 'It is not too extreme to count the story as a tragedy. Tragedy
involves people perhaps with heroic visions but certainly with fatal
failings,' he says.
In some cases this approach succeeds. For example, he cites an
over-ambitious nature as an important factor in Mr Godfrey Bradman's
downfall. 'You can lose as much on a small development if it goes wrong as
on a major project, but the upside is not nearly as exciting.' In other
cases, however, Ross Goobey fails adequately to demonstrate the link between
personality and business problems.
By casting developers as tragic heroes, he also underplays the contribution
of the banks, advisers and government policy to the crash. For example, he
skims over the effect of the relaxation of planning controls in fuelling the
rapid increase in property developments. The enterprise zones, which
delivered millions of square feet of unwanted office space, receive only a
cursory discussion.
As a former adviser to Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, it is perhaps
unsurprising that Ross Goobey makes light work of the Treasury's forecasting
and policy mistakes. But if the government's economic mismanagement had not
been so pronounced, many of the developers he describes would have ridden
through the downturn.
While Ross Goobey is right to focus on the poor judgment of the current crop
of developers, he may place too much emphasis on the ability to learn from
mistakes: plenty of the fallen heroes of the 1980s lived through the crash
of the 1970s.
But he is doubtless correct when he says that similar errors will be made
again. The shortcomings of policy makers, bankers and developers will
probably see to that.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Lessons of the debt crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 10 years ago Mexico declared a moratorium on debt service, whereupon
the contagion spread. It was a time of panic, an occasion for improvisation.
Ten years later, with private capital flowing into Latin America, commercial
banks reeling from losses closer to home, and industrial countries mired in
recession once more, the 'debt crisis' seems history. But it has left much
behind: problems still unsolved, lessons learned, and lessons unlearned.
Improvisation worked. The collapse of the financial system that threatened
did not occur. Notwithstanding the endeavours of the commercial banks, it
has still not occurred. The case-by-case approach to the problems of
indebted countries has also succeeded. Those who have made serious efforts
to adjust, like Mexico, thrive; those that have not, like Brazil, wallow in
failure. Yet everything was not done well. It took too long to recognise the
nature of the problem and still longer to move from palliatives to remedies.
For this - indeed, for most of the serious errors - blame falls heavily on
the industrial countries.
It is the developing countries that have had the hardest lesson: in the
'lost decade', per capita income in Latin America fell by close to a fifth.
But the lesson has, for the most part, been learned.
'Good policy' - non-inflationary budget finance, positive real interest
rates and openness to trade and foreign direct investment - matters. It was
possible to get away with less than this in an environment of low real
interest rates. In a more unfavourable environment, it was not. Only
countries as efficient as South Korea survived high levels of external
indebtedness unscathed.
The lesson to be learned about commercial banks is, it appears, that they
never learn their lesson. Each time commercial banks have been offered the
chance to trade their way out of past losses, they embrace new ones. The
threat of third world debt has receded. New threats have taken its place.
The immediate response of the industrial countries to the crisis was
successful. But they bear much responsibility for its creation and for the
inordinately long time it took to resolve.
The inflationary policies of industrial countries generated the negative
real interest rates of the 1970s that made borrowing so attractive. The
sudden volte face in US monetary policy under Paul Volcker then triggered
the debt crisis. It was industrial country fiscal deficits which kept real
interest rates painfully high, their refusal to recognise that illiquidity
cannot be distinguished from insolvency which meant that organised debt
reduction came only seven years later, and their protectionism that
militates against the unilateral moves towards economic liberalism of many
developing countries.
It is now well known that countries politically incapable of meeting their
liabilities need some sort of bankruptcy procedure that ensures all
creditors share the losses. Will that lesson be applied soon enough to the
problems of the former Soviet Union? It is evident that the poorest
countries must rely largely on concessional official assistance. Will this
lesson be applied to Africa on a large enough scale?
It is clear too that the market must be allowed to work. Will it be allowed
to, however, not merely by the poor, but even when it causes political pain
 -as over the question of farm trade reform, now the chief obstacle to
global trade liberalisation - by the rich?

FT  30 JUL 92 / Arts: Midsummer dance in Italy - Freda Pitt reviews a mixed
season of successes and failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FREDA PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN summer dance invasion this year has, as ever, been numerous in
companies and varied in offerings. There have been celebrations of obvious
anniversaries: Rossini was given a charming birthday tribute at the Ravenna
Festival in Mischa van Hoecke's Adieu a l'Italie; Christopher Columbus
became the subject of an extravaganza involving the entire ballet troupe of
La Scala, Milan, with Carla Fracci as Queen Isabella, and Columbus himself
taking rather a back seat. Alberto Mendez' choreography was at its best in
scenes showing American Indians, but the accompaniment of Donizetti scores
proved unexpectedly dull.
The season proper began auspiciously with the arrival of Pina Bausch's
production of Gluck's Iphigenie auf Tauris, which was shown first in Turin,
and then in the Teatro dell' Opera, Rome. This staging dates from 1974, when
Bausch had just joined the Wuppertal Opera - whose company made the journey
to Italy - and it made quite a change to hear an orchestra tuning up before
a Bausch performance. The singers were tucked out of the way in the theatre
boxes so that the dancers had the stage to themselves, and the score was
well presented by the Wuppertal forces under Peter Culke. Albeit this is an
early production, Bausch has not sought to modify it, and she called upon
three veterans of her company for the central roles: Malou Airoudou as
Iphigenia; Dominique Mercy as Orestes, and Lute Forster as a terrifying King
of the Scythians.
Turin's Dance Festival, which also presented John Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet,
the Prague National Ballet and London Contemporary Dance Theatre, chose to
open in early June, a somewhat rash decision in view of our capricious
weather. Within 30 minutes of the Hamburg Ballet's beginning Mozart Requiem
the heavens opened, and umbrellas offered little protection from the
downpour in the Parco Rignon, though the performers were under cover. We
could admire the standard of the dancing in a work which intersperses
Mozart's score with Gregorian chant (not without taste), and offers a decent
view of Neumeier's slightly distorted classic manner.
Music for the Turin performances is almost invariably recorded and this sad
fact now obtains at the Spoleto Festival, where few successes were notched
up this year and a decline in the dance content was discomfitingly evident.
Little on view belonged without argument in the dance category, and Maguy
Marin's Cortex - her first piece for her group after a two-year silence -
contained much more talk than movement and was not noticeably original, save
in its preponderance of speech. Her target, yet again, was the bourgeoisie,
and more specifically bank clerks, who seem to be her bete noire. The need
to translate the spoken text into Italian slowed the action even further,
since not all the performers could speak fluently in a foreign language.
At Spoleto's Roman Theatre the Bolshoy Theatre Grigorovich Ballet appeared
with recorded accompaniment and no scenery. This is not the main Bolshoy
troupe; but an off-shoot created two years ago, made up of some 50 very
young dancers selected by Yury Grigorovich from various schools. The
repertory originally comprised familiar Grigorovich choreography, but now
(with the assistance of two of the dancers, Sergey Bobrov and Andrey
Melanin) Grigorovich has produced a new work especially for the ensemble.
This Elektra is set to excerpts from Richard Strauss's opera, with
additional music from his Legend of Joseph. Grigorovich has, alas, asked
more of his immature artists than they can yet give in terms of
expressiveness. Technically they are carefully chosen, but interpretations
were bland. Maria Mosina offered only a brave try as Elektra - her final
dance of madness and death, veiled in black, could prove telling if given to
a more assured ballerina.
During a press conference, Grigorovich stated that he would certainly not
invite Pina Bausch to Moscow, as he found no interest in her work. But her
stark, barefoot treatment of the House of Atreus - in her Gluck staging -
made a much stronger impression than Grigorovich's balletic version, with
its style familiar from his Spartacus - especially in the male groupings.
The lack of experience among the young Moscow dancers also affected their
presentation of Raymonda's second act: good, clean technique was on display,
but it was uncomfortably like an end-of-school performance.
In Rome, the most extensive festival - Roma-Europa - included music, film,
literature, as well as dance, from ten European countries. Its most
talked-about dance event was a brief series of appearances by Sylvie Guillem
and Laurent Hilaire. Their programme comprised a first part made up of works
by Balanchine and Robbins, and a new 45-minute piece by Maurice Bejart, who
tackled an impossible and self-imposed task of reconciling a taped text by
Pier Paolo Pasolini with totally unconnected dance scenes of a couple's
somewhat stormy relationship. The evening proved one of the season's
successes.

FAR AND AWAY (12) Empire
NIGHT ON EARTH (15) Lumiere, Gate Notting Hill, Camden Plaza
THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (U) Barbican
THE HISTORY of the wheel has been recapitulated in the history of the reel.
If trains and cars first assaulted the distances between towns and nations,
the movie projector has obliterated them. Two films this week, Ron Howard's
Far And Away and Jim Jarmusch's Night On Earth, skim their plots or
characters around the globe as if the friction of reality had never existed.
In most other respects the two films are perfect opposites. One stars Tom
Cruise, was shot in 65-millimetre - the first film to use the process since
Ryan's Daughter - and is an ocean-crossing epic about human love and
self-betterment. The other, a set of five low-budget stories about cab
drivers, is a comedy of stasis masquerading as a comedy of movement.
In Far And Away Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman leave the old country to find a
home in the new. In Ireland the land is green, the sea sparkles and the
smoke curls from the cottages, indicating that the feudal English have been
torching the villages again. We are in a troubled Western Ireland, circa
1890.
In America, once past that gateway to Irish-American freedom called Boston,
the West beckons. Here men are men, women are women and horses are Formula
One racing cars with tails. These hurtle their riders to glory in the
climactic, eye-boggling Oklahoma land race. By the close of this film - two
hours of romance, fisticuffs, music, spectacle and bullhorning Celtic charm
 -we feel we have been to Fantasyland and back via Cimarron, The
Streetfighter and The Quiet Man.
And, come to that, via PG Wodehouse. I kept being reminded of that author's
Irish comedy double-act called Pat and Mike. This duo, you recall, only ever
had one routine. Pat (or Mike) tells Mike (or Pat) about a ballet in which
the dancers rush in and out from stages left and right. Then after a lot of
music hall cross-talk Pat (or Mike) finally explains 'Faith and begob, 'tis
a Rushin' Ballet.'
That is Far And Away in a nutcracker. Characters rush in and out from screen
left or right, the soundtrack surges with full-orchestra music, and hanging
over all like a deus praesens is the 'Faith and begob' school of Irish
locution. This is represented by Cyril Cusack and assorted worthies sporting
cloth caps, potato-dust faces and singsong accents.
The opening half hour, it must be admitted, has a winning dottiness. Tom
Cruise's father, mortally injured by his landlord's hitmen, bequeaths his
bully-boy courage to young Tom - 'You're an especially odd boy,' the old man
keens - and soon Tom is proving both his oddity and his pluck. He invades
the mansion of the wicked landlord (Robert Prosky), gets shot, gets nursed,
gets up, gets knocked down again, and then receives a ladder-and-window
visit in his bedroom from the daughter of the house, Nicole Kidman (alias
Mrs Cruise). 'I'm running away because I'm modern,' explains the Australian
actress in an Irish accent.
Enough said. Our couple soon take ship to Boston where they masquerade as
fine lady and servant: at least until Cruise earns a penny as a prizefighter
while Kidman becomes estranged, rueing her fall from social grace. By the
time they reach the Oklahoma land race, they have both been up and down and
round and round: two socio-economic yo-yos suffering from existential
dizziness.
A strange madness overtakes the cinema, we have noticed, whenever there are
two '9's in the year. Everything suddenly goes all epochal. Remember Gone
With The Wind (1939)? Easy Rider (1969)? Now we face a whole decade of this
stuff. Far And Away was conceived and directed by Ron Howard of Cocoon,
Willow and Parenthood. He wanted to tell his own ancestors' story but has
succeeded instead in making a historical soap opera which suffers from
elephantiasis.
Every emotion is blown large and primal to fit the wide screen: from the
early rage of our peasant hero to the final earth-kneeling clinch on Western
soil. In between we have the nose-crunching boxing scenes, the sentimental
Christmas idyll out of Meet Me In St Louis, the spectacular land race and
the quick-witted bickering of the hero and heroine, which is either Beatrice
and Benedick or Rhett and Scarlett, according to your taste in cultural
invocations.
Global expansiveness apart, the only characteristic Far And Away shares with
Night On Earth is a tendency to prove that the more geographical space a
film covers the less it moves dramatically or psychologically. Howard's film
demonstrates this unwittingly: in the un-transplantability of Tom Cruise. Is
he of Ireland? Boston? Oklahoma? No, he is of Hollywood, where that
toothpaste commercial grin, cartoon-handsome face and acting-class
earnestness radiate American Boyishness. If you like your history
re-processed in Wishfulfilmentscope - and many do - Far And Away is for you.
Low-budget independent cinema has its own version of running on the spot.
Cover the globe for you, guv'nor? Certainly. Step in: 'in' being the taxi in
Jim Jarmusch's five-story feature, brought to you by the mournful movie wag
who made Stranger Than Paradise, Down By Law and Mystery Train. You will
experience night rides through LA, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki
without feeling that you have changed locales at all.
But this is artful immobility. Taxis, as we know, are the same
internationally: zones of terror where we part with large sums of money for
the privilege of sitting in a traffic jam hearing a man's life story. The
taxis do move in Night On Earth; but they do not get anywhere. The sky
outside is as dark as a parrot's shawl while the changing duos inside fail
to resolve their encounters.
Casting agent Gena Rowlands sees star quality, but fails to sign it, in
foulmouthed cabbie Winona Ryder; Giancarlo Esposito wrests the taxi's wheel
from East German ex-clown Armin Mueller-Stahl who, despite a cab licence,
cannot drive; Roberto Benigni inflicts unwanted sexual confessions on a
dicky-hearted priest; and only in France and Finland do a blind girl
(Beatrice Dalle) and a bereaved father (Matti Pelonpaa) offhandedly suggest
that enlightenment can come forth from darkness.
Two hours of heads bobbing in leatherette-clad capsules and you may feel
like hailing the nearest bus. At moments of maximum claustrophobia, our
imaginations flash out yearningly to the Oklahoma land race. But cinema is
oddly suited to these exercises in oubliette entrapment. Not only is being
in a taxi much like being in a movie theatre - the darkness, the rectangular
slices of passing scenery, the non-stop soundtrack - but Jarmusch's comic
miniaturism is enhanced by being writ large on a cinema screen.
Look at Gena Rowlands's genteel twitches of incredulity as she swaps folk
wisdom with the chain-smoking, chain-swearing Winona Ryder. Or at Armin
Mueller-Stahl's bemused, I'm-a-stranger-here curiosity as his black American
passenger explodes at his (the passenger's) raggedy-mannered, out-all-night
sister, whom they have picked up en route to Brooklyn.
The reaction shot is king, even when in the Helsinki story the dim Northern
light barely leaks through to the glum moustachioed visages. At two hours
Night On Earth may be too much of a good thing, but a good thing it
undoubtedly is.
So is The Thief Of Bagdad, to which I could give but short shrift last week.
The glorious 1940 Alexander Korda epic, made by a bevy of directors
including Britain's Michael Powell, has been reissued in a brand new print.
Thrill to the giant spider's web climbed by Sabu. Tremble at the mighty
genie whooshing from the bottle. Gasp at the flying white horse which hoofs
it aerially over the multi-coloured onion domes.
I am beginning to sound like a movie poster. But that is how all critics
sound when their defences are down and they are praising a film they fell in
love with long before they were critics.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THIRD successive concert performance of an opera at the Albert Hall was
given by the Budapest Festival Orchestra (making its Proms debut) under Ivan
Fischer, the orchestra's co-founder, and with two internationally eminent
Hungarian opera singers in the roles of Bluebeard and Judith.
This should have guaranteed a degree of idiomatic rightness generally deemed
unavailable to non-native Bartok interpreters. Strangely, Tuesday's
Bluebeard's Castle did not work out that way. The players had already,
earlier in the evening, made us familiar with their corporate
characteristics of well-drilled ensemble and forceful attack in their
Berlioz Benvenuto Cellini Overture and the Liszt E flat Piano Concerto (with
Zoltan Kocsis, the other orchestra co-founder, a percussive-toned and
intermittently rather mannered soloist). It was in Bartok that their
limitations were most fully demonstrated: in simple terms, and in spite of
the natural advantages of spacious resonance offered by the acoustics, the
sound qualities of the playing seemed to lack depth, beauty, poetry, pathos.
Bartok rigorously ordered the internal relationships of component parts and
tempo choices, of each episode relative to the next; Fischer, though an
alert, urgent organiser of individual sections, never gave the impression of
fully perceiving the crucial importance of those relationships, with the
result that the opera's cumulative intensity failed to build up. The bass,
Laszlo Polgar, was grave, dignified, eloquent, but not sufficiently grand or
free at the top in the perorations of the Fifth Door; the mezzo, Ildiko
Komlossi, regularly spoiled the glamorous richness of her timbre with a
heavy beat.
The performance was by no means a disgrace or a waste of time - how could it
be? - but at the end of it I could not conceal a feeling of considerable
disappointment.

The Mary Whitehouse Experience was one of the funnier of the new wave comedy

FT  30 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Oil grant is allocated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL OIL MARINE PLC AND ANOTHER v AMERADA HESS LTD AND OTHERS Court of
Appeal (The President, Lord Justice Staughton and Lord Justice Scott):
July 23 1992 GRANTS FOR capital expenditure incurred in the construction of
an oil terminal by pipeline groups under agreements providing for
participation adjustments to be made by proportional debiting and crediting
of expenditure and receipts each year, is allocated between groups in
proportion to their participation when it is received, not when the capital
expense was incurred, and is deducted from expenditure in the calculation of
participation adjustment payments.
THE Court of Appeal so held (Lord Justice Scott dissenting) when dismissing
an appeal by BG United Kingdom Inc and other defendants from Mr Justice
Saville's decision on preliminary issues relating to the allocation of
regional development grant, in an action by Total Oil Marine plc and
another, against Amerada Hess Ltd and others.
LORD JUSTICE Staughton said the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands
was supplied with oil and gas by two pipelines from the North Sea.
The oil was collected from wells owned by a number of companies.
The Ninian pipeline, owned by the Ninian Pipeline Group, was operated on
behalf of the companies by BP Petroleum Developments Ltd. The Brent
pipeline, owned by the Brent Pipeline Group, was operated by Shell UK Ltd.
Membership of each group and the shares of each group and each participating
company varied from time to time.
Massive capital expenditure was incurred in the construction of the terminal
between 1975 and 1980. It qualified for a Pounds 534m grant under the
Industry Act 1972. The grant was paid in four amounts between March 1983 and
November 1984.
On preliminary issues tried in November and December 1990, Mr Justice
Saville declared that (a) as between the two pipeline groups, grant should
be appropriated in proportion to their respective participation at the time
it was received; and (b) grant should be taken into account as negative
capital cost in the calculation of participation adjustment payments when
received.
Mr Stamler for the appellants argued that grant should be allocated in the
proportion prevailing when the capital expenditure was incurred; and should
not be brought into account in the adjust-ment to past capital expenditure.
A 'terminal participants' agreement' and a 'terminal construction agreement'
between the two pipeline groups on behalf of themselves and the member
companies, were executed on June 28 1976. Each had some retroactive effect.
In the participants' agreement, Article V regulated the extent to which each
pipeline operator was to bear the cost of capital expenditure in any year.
Article VI was concerned primarily with payment to be made by one pipeline
group to another when and as often as there was a change in the proportion
that each was using or was capable of using the terminal.
Article V regulated who should bear capital expenditure on general support
facilities, such as main roads in the terminal, in any year. By Article VI
whenever there was a change in the proportion of one operator's peak
pipeline capacity, there was to be a valuation of all the general support
facilities. The operator whose proportion had increased had to pay an
appropriate percentage of the value to the operator whose proportion had
decreased.
The treatment of common facilities, such as pipes and pumps was similar.
For both the general support and the common facilities, the procedures
required calculation of the 'depreciated replacement value' in accordance
with a formula based on replacement value previously determined ('item A'),
capital costs expended since that previous determination ('item B'), and an
escalation factor based on average earnings and costs ('item E').
By clause 6.06 in Article VI the procedures were to be reviewed from time to
time 'to ensure that all pipeline operators shall always bear an equitable
share of the cost of the said facilities'.
Under the construction agreement BP was appointed constructor. There was to
be a joint account by which accounting records were to be sub-divided to
enable 'costs and receipts' to be allocated to groups in accordance with the
terminal participants' agreement.
Attachment C, headed 'Accounting and Control Procedures', provided by clause
3.11.3 that all applications for grants should be channelled through the
constructor and credited to the relevant sections of the joint account.
The first question was how regional development grants received should have
been distributed?
The whole tenor of the financial provisions was that there was to be a
running account in each year, and that with one exception all expenditure
and receipts were to be debited or credited to it in the proportions
prevailing that year.
Receipts mentioned in Attachment C were meant to be credited in the
proportions prevailing during the year of receipt. It seemed a clear
inference from clause 3.11.3 that participants should account for grant to
operators in the proportions prevailing at time of receipt.
In agreement with the judge, it was held that by the terms of the two
agreements grant was to be allocated to pipeline groups in the proportions
prevailing when it was received.
The second question was whether grant was to be taken into account as a
deduction or negative capital expenditure, in calculating participation
adjustment payments.
Common sense suggested that it should be, since the apparent aim of the
provisions was to transfer the burden of past capital expenditure to new
entrants, or to those whose participation was increased.
The agreements contemplated not only grants, but also other receipts such as
the proceeds of sale of surplus.
It would seem unfair if a new entrant had to pay the historic cost of assets
when they had been sold and the proceeds had been received by his
predecessor. The inference in clause 6.06 was that it was intended to
provide for equitable sharing.
When assets were 'removed, replaced or abandoned', the depreciated
replacement value was to be adjusted for the future, presumably by removing
that element of it which represented the cost of the asset.
It would not be right to deduct proceeds of sale when calculating item B in
the formula.
Owners of the asset would have lost their credit for depreciated replacement
value and would have received the proceeds of sale in the proportions
currently prevailing. But they should not also have to suffer a deduction of
those proceeds of sale from their shares in the value of the remaining
assets.
It was held that item B in the formula for calculating depreciated
replacement value should be subject to a deduction for grant received in the
period in question.
It followed that, on the next occasion the calculation was made, item A
would also be a net figure.
The appeal was dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE Scott dissenting said that taken overall the provisions in the
construction agreement regarding receipts did not support the proposition
that grant should be allocated in receipt proportions.
The legislative system did not contemplate the benefit of grant being passed
on to subsequent purchasers of the asset.
Since the contractual provisions did not provide an express answer to the
issue, a contractual intention that grants should be allocated in
contribution proportions should be imputed to the parties.
His Lordship would have allowed the appeal on both questions.
THE PRESIDENT agreed with Lord Justice Staughton.
For the appellants: Sam Stamler QC and Steven Gee (Herbert Smith)
For BP: Anthony Grabiner QC and Laurence Rabinowitz (Gary Hodgson)
For Total: Michael Burton QC and Julia Dias (Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens)
For Amerada: Marion Simmons (Rowe &amp; Maw)

FT  30 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Games war on the
cards in Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American visitors at the Barcelona Olympics could be forgiven for being
confused about their choice of credit cards, writes Gary Mead. Should it be
Visa, or maybe American Express?
The arch rivals traded punches during February's Winter Olympics at
Albertville where Visa - one of 12 leading official sponsors sanctioned by
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) - accused Amex of 'ambush
marketing'.
Visa is believed to have paid Dollars 20m to join the IOC's sponsorship
programme. In return, Visa may use the five Olympic rings on its advertising
and promotional materials.
Visa complained that although Amex was paying nothing, its advertising
implied a close association with the Games.
In February, Amex was sued by the IOC for alleged improper use of Olympic
symbols. The French courts found against Amex on one count but rejected the
IOC's claims on another, related accusation.
The recriminations have now resurfaced. In the US, where comparative
advertising is king, Visa is exploiting its Dollars 20m payment with
television advertisements which hint that not only does Visa have an
exclusive connection with the Barcelona Olympics, but that its main
competitor, the green Amex card, is positively unwelcome.
Thus Visa has run a series of 30-second commercials showing a range of field
and track, wrestling and basketball events. The commercials cut from sport
to disgruntled clerks behind a grille, with the voice-over commentary: 'You
think they're tough? Wait till you see the guys at the ticket window if you
don't have your Visa card. Because once again the Olympics don't take
American Express.'
To combat that truth-economical slogan, Amex have replied with their own
Barcelona-connected television ads. One commentary begins: 'American Express
first came to Barcelona in 1921' and quickly runs through all its
Spanish-based services. It concludes: 'So if you go to Barcelona, take the
American Express card - obviously we are here for more than just the fun 'n
games.' Another Amex ad puts it more bluntly: 'Remember, to visit Spain you
don't need a visa.'
A word of warning to US readers; cash does very nicely in Spain.

<TEXT>
When the Boston police received several telephone calls last week reporting
UFO sightings, they knew what to tell the panicked sky watchers - the
strange object was not a UFO, it was a Virgin Lightship blimp.
Dirigibles are making a comeback. Ten years ago, only Goodyear Tire and
Rubber clung to that form of advertising. More recently two companies -
Virgin Lightship and Airship International - have begun hiring out blimps as
an advertising tool. Fuji Film now owns and runs its own dirigible, and
Goodyear has added two more to its fleet.
The popularity of dirigibles is based on more than just the romance of the
past. Virgin Lightship runs three in the US and Europe. Besides Virgin
Atlantic, clients for the dirigible include McDonald's restaurants of
Canada, the telecommunications group MCI, Coca-Cola, Renault cars and the
Daily Star of London.
Virgin Lightship, which is based in Orlando, Florida, and Telford, England,
was the brainchild of Richard Branson, a well-known balloon aficionado.
Though smaller than others in the market, the company's dirigibles are the
only ones lit from within, making them easily visible at night. The
company's main competitor is Airship International, operating dirigibles for
Metro Life Insurance and Anheuser Busch, which uses the blimp to advertise
its Budweiser beer brand and Sea World, its amusement park in Florida.
The Virgin blimp is producing results. The awareness of the airline in
Boston, where the blimp was to be seen, after a month of marketing was four
times greater than in Los Angeles, where it was not seen.
Goodyear has also found its blimps effective. 'Name recognition for our
company goes up at least 10 per cent after our blimp has spent two to three
weeks in a city,' said Micky Wittman, manager of the company's airship
programme.
'We get a lot of attention from the press,' said Ms Ingraham of Virgin
Atlantic. 'And, of course, we love the UFO sightings.'
Dirigibles are expensive to operate - between Dollars 150,000 and Dollars
250,000 a month. But companies say the money is worth it because of deals
with television companies.
Dirigibles make perfect television camera platforms. They are
petrol-efficient, can stay up almost indefinitely, and are steadier than
helicopters.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Technology: Betting the farm to construct a network: British
Entrepreneurs - Louise Kehoe continues a series profiling risk takers whose
'can do' attitude is yielding dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Madge freely admits that he knew nothing about computer networking
when he formed Madge Networks in 1986. 'But I recognised the business
potential of the technology,' he recalled, in the course of an interview at
the 200-year-old Buckinghamshire farm that houses Madge Networks'
engineering offices.
He attributes the success of Madge Networks, which is expected to more than
double its 1991 revenues to surpass Dollars 70m this year, to a mix of
'common sense, business sense and good luck'.
Focusing on IBM-compatible Token Ring network systems, Madge has developed a
range of adapter cards, routing bridges, and cabling hubs ' the critical
'plumbing' elements of computer networks ' as well as software programs that
optimise the performance of networks.
Madge set about creating his own business after the computer games company
that he was working for went into bankruptcy; a setback that only served to
harden his determination to be his own boss.
It was literally a case of 'betting the farm'. Madge mortgaged his property
to fund the new venture , taking on 'considerable personal financial risk'
to hire four former colleagues and to develop from scratch products that
would compete with International Business Machines' own networking systems.
'Others were concerned about competing with IBM, but we had nothing to
lose,' Madge recalls. 'We didn't know how wide our market niche could be,
but it was clear that Token Ring technology would be a success.' IBM's
endorsement of Token Ring networking, which works on the principle of
passing blocks of information or message 'tokens' between computers, all but
ensured a large scale market.
From the outset, Madge wanted to build an international business.
In 1987, slightly more than a year after the UK company was founded, Madge
established its US subsidiary, based in San Jose, California, in the heart
of Silicon Valley. The decision proved critical to Madge Network's success.
'The US pioneers the use of new technology. Our products were very quickly
accepted there and sales went up like a rocket ship. Last year, 40 per cent
of Madge sales were in the US.'
Madge Networks does not hide its British origins; at trade shows, US guests
are given fish and chips and bowler hats. Many customers, however, think of
Madge as an American company, he acknowledges. 'That is an advantage.'
In international markets, there is a broad perception that US high
technology companies are more likely to develop quality products, Madge
says. 'US culture has permeated high technology markets in all countries.'
It is, he suggests, more difficult for a UK high technology company to sell
in France, for example, than it is for a US high technology company. 'The
barriers between different countries in Europe are much harder to overcome
than those between the US and Europe.'
Madge is, however, 'highly sceptical' of European government funded efforts
to boost high technology research and development. 'Centralised funding
creates overblown bureaucratic organisations,' he complains. 'There is an
old boys' network, so most of the funding goes to established companies with
large R&amp;D groups, which have very low productivity.'
Although EC programs may have been created to stimulate R&amp;D, they 'distract
people from being market oriented. There has got to be a market pull for new
technology; it cannot be pushed by committees.'
Having built businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, Madge is in no doubt
that it is 'very considerably harder' to form new ventures in the UK. The
small home market is a significant disadvantage for British entrepreneurs,
Madge says.
Ready access to venture capital also makes life easier for US entrepreneurs,
especially those who already have a track record in the industry, Madge
suggests. 'In the US, there is usually very little personal risk attached to
starting a new company. All that the founders are risking is the loss of
their own salary.'
However, Madge himself has eschewed venture capital. 'In 1988 we tried to
raise venture capital. We got one offer from a British venture capital
group, but the valuation that they put on the company was terrible.'
Instead, Madge turned to a US technology partner, 3COM, with which it had
formed a development alliance. 3COM took a ten per cent stake in Madge
Networks, paying 20 times as much for its shares as the venture capitalists
were willing to offer.
Although the 3COM alliance, which also involved Microsoft, did not live up
to expectations, partnerships are now an important part of Madge's business
strategy.
What's next for Madge? With almost 200 employees world wide, Madge is hiring
at a rate of two or three people per month. The company is developing
products for faster networks based on fiber distributed data interface
technology, as well as broadening its base in PC networking to include UNIX
workstations.
'Our goal is to provide the best networking products for large corporations
to perform enterprise critical applications.
'We intend to become one of the largest specialised networking equipment
companies in the world', Madge insists.
The series will continue next week.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Whipped-up taste for
sour cream - John Thornhill explains how Sainsbury's turned creme  fraiche
into a smash hit with shoppers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Catherine Zeta Jones smiles seductively at the camera and purrs: 'It's
irresistible.'
The actress, who is the sweetheart of the tabloids after her performance in
the television series The Darling Buds of May, is describing the attractions
of creme fraiche in the latest of a series of 'celebrity recipe'
advertisements run by J. Sainsbury, Britain's biggest grocer.
She has demonstrated how to make a fresh fruit brulee using one of
Sainsbury's new products, creme fraiche, described as having the smooth
texture of double cream with a pleasant sharp flavour.
The recipe seems to have tickled the taste buds of the nation and has been
cooked for countless dinner parties as hosts attempt to beat the Joneses
with their culinary skills.
But the product also illustrates the marketing power of the big grocery
chains and their ability to change the nation's eating habits.
Sainsbury's is coy about releasing sales figures for fear of giving its
rivals sensitive information. But Mr Tom Vyner, managing director, describes
them as 'astronomic'.
'If a brand manager developed a product that sold Pounds 1m in the first
month and Pounds 12m in the first year he would be happy', he says. Creme
fraiche is selling more than that, he adds.
Each year, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Safeway launch more than 1,000 own-label
lines apiece and are powerfully placed to control a product's development
from initial conception to in-store promotion. Their position in the market
gives them valuable knowledge of consumer spending patterns and increasingly
pitches them into competition with the big consumer products companies, such
as Nestle.
Last year, Sainsbury's spent Pounds 15m supporting its brand image in
television and press advertising. Its arch rival, Tesco, laid out Pounds
24.9m, outspending every other consumer product brand in the UK. It, too,
has created new markets almost overnight and cites the example of free-range
chickens backed by television advertisements featuring a clucking Dudley
Moore.
Ideas for new products stem from many different sources, according to Mr
Robin Whitbread, Sainsbury's marketing director. The company's buyers visit
stores abroad to see what sells well. Its suppliers suggest possible new
lines and its market research department sifts piles of data. 'We are
looking for what sells in large volumes abroad but does not sell in the UK,'
he says.
The idea for selling creme fraiche came from one of its buyers who visited
D'Isigny, a French food manufacturer in Normandy.
Sainsbury's conducted trials to assess whether creme fraiche was acceptable
to the British palate using a panel of 100 volunteer tasters.
'We thought that the product was absolutely right for the JS customer and
complemented the rest of our dairy range' says Whitbread.
Last year, creme fraiche was launched at selected Sainsbury's stores under
D'Isigny's own label. Initially, it was promoted solely by means of
shelf-edge labels describing where the product came from and how the French
used it.
Once Sainsbury's became convinced that the product had mass appeal, it
decided to launch its own-label creme fraiche last March. The company's
designers created the package and wrote an accompanying recipe leaflet. A
press release attracted comment from food writers and magazine
advertisements were also placed. Creme fraiche was launched in 170 of its
320 stores at a specially-reduced price of 69p for a 200ml tub. The regular
price was set at 75p or 4p less than the D'Isigny branded product, which was
subsequently withdrawn.
After an encouraging response, creme fraiche was extended to all Sainsbury's
stores and in May the company began supporting it with television
advertisements.
'The celebrity is important but the food is the real hero,' Whitbread says.
'The campaign works both from a strategic and a tactical point of view. It
emphasises both the values of the JS brand but also the attractions of
individual products.'
Some of the celebrity recipe advertisements have generated more than tenfold
increases in sales of particular products and necessitate close liaison
across all functions of Sainsbury's business: the buying department has to
step up orders of related ingredients; the distribution experts have to push
more products through the system; and the store staff have to know about
various promotions to answer customer inquiries.
Over the past 20 years, Sainsbury's has increased its number of lines by
four times tempting the British middle classes with new products as varied
as mangoes and pink champagne. The company claims it was also the first
grocery chain to introduce fromage frais in 1984 helping prepare the palate
for creme fraiche. Total UK sales of fromage frais are now Pounds 88m a
year.
But new food products and concepts do not always work. For example,
Sainsbury's was disappointed with the results of its first experiment with
ready-made chilled meals in 1985-86 - although it has since expanded its
range with greater success.
Other retailers would attest to the truth of that remark. Although
Sainsbury's claims it was the first to sell creme fraiche in the UK market,
the product briefly appeared on Marks and Spencer's shelves four years ago.
'We think it was ahead of its time,' the company said, adding that it was
likely to reappear in its stores over the coming months as a result of its
success 'elsewhere'.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Working Russian model now in need of
overhaul - Andrew Jack looks at how the traditional Soviet accounting system
is adapting to modern demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASKING A foreigner to understand the Russian accounting system is as
daunting as learning to ride on the Moscow underground. Being able to read
the script is only the start of overcoming the challenge.
The metro system's use of the cyrillic alphabet is intimidating enough, let
alone how it is spoken by announcers on the trains. The practice of naming
each line after its final destinations - which, since most have been
extended, are no longer the end points - is still more confusing.
Add to that the recent practice of re-naming a vast number of stops which
have connotations with the old Communist regime, and it should come as no
surprise that the unsuspecting visitor can end up heading at full speed in
the wrong direction.
So it is with the Russian accounting system. A casual glance at the
continued widespread use of abacuses in shops and offices, for example,
makes it tempting to say that there is no system, or only a very inefficient
one. But that would be as inaccurate as saying that the metro does not work
because it may not always deliver foreign visitors to their chosen
destination.
The idea of financial reporting is firmly rooted in the enterprises of the
former Soviet Union. A sophisticated system did exist, and it operated
effectively. But its objectives were entirely different to capitalist
equivalents.
Accountancy was and remains a thriving occupation in the Commonwealth of
Independent States. There are many hundreds of thousands of accountants, and
the chief accountant in an enterprise is generally an extremely powerful
figure.
Nevertheless, the vast majority of accountants are in practice really
book-keepers. Mr Richard Lewis, a partner in the Moscow office of Ernst &amp;
Young, says: 'Accounting was not financial but statistical. The accountant
was reduced to filling in forms on a matrix. The job did not have much
prestige.'
This reflects the purpose for which Soviet accounts were prepared in the
past. Under the old political regime, the objective was to provide central
planners with the necessary information to achieve centralised control of
the economy. That meant controlling operations to achieve planned targets,
and protecting socialist property.
It was implemented through a single, unified accounting system, which would
allow data from every enterprise to be easily aggregated. This was achieved
by a formulaic 'chart of accounts' with detailed instructions and categories
for every budget item, and by a series of standardised record-keeping and
reporting forms.
But as Mr Leonid Schneidman, a senior official with the former Soviet
Ministry of Finance who works for Price Waterhouse in Moscow, says: 'The
objectives of accounting have become much wider now.'
Difficulties with the old system emerged in the late 1980s, principally as
western companies began to establish joint ventures. Before that time, there
was little communication with or attempt to understand the eastern system by
the West, or vice versa.
Since then, accountancy firms opening offices in the CIS have been able to
find work doing 'accounts conversion', translating the Russian accounts of
joint ventures into a format which is more easy and useful for western
companies.
Mr Lewis recalls a great deal of resistance from the Ministry of Finance
when it came under pressure to adjust its existing system simply because
western companies did not understand how it operated.
But - partly in response to the disappointing volume of interest in joint
ventures by western partners - it has bowed to calls for reform. A series of
regulations has allowed reporting in a more western-style format alongside
the traditional requirements.
Now with a new Chart of Accounts approved at the start of this year,
legislation on financial reporting and a series of new working parties are
helping to create a framework for reform in Russia. Many of the same
elements are being echoed in the other CIS states.
One of the most significant changes has been the greater emphasis placed on
the profit and loss account. Traditionally, Soviet accounts laid most stress
on the balance sheet. This reflected the state's concern with guarding
socialist assets.
Enterprises were required to keep track of how asset purchases were
financed, to reflect this custodial role. Depreciation rates were very low,
reflecting the longer period of use for which assets were employed than in
the West. And all assets were held at historical values, since there was no
concept that changes in economic conditions would change their value.
Profits were far less important for enterprises. As Mr Richard Lewis says:
'No one in the past was concerned about whether you made a profit. If you
made one, it was likely to be taken away, whereas if you made a loss, you
would be given money by the government.'
A profit and loss account has always existed, but in a very different
format. Costs of production included 'period costs' such as administrative
and general expenses as well as 'product' costs. That makes it very
difficult to calculate trading profits.
Where earnings existed, they had to be distributed. There was no concept of
retained earnings which could be held in reserve.
At the same time, revenues were historically only 'recognised' on the profit
and loss account when cash was received. This was partly a conservative
response to concerns over whether or not the enterprise would be paid. But
it makes it impossible to correlate income and expenditure in a single
accounting period.
The new chart of accounts permits the western concept of accrual accounting
 -which matches expenses to the period in which they are incurred, and
income to when it is invoiced. It introduces the idea of retained earnings
and distinguishes period and product costs. Significantly, it allows for
provisions for bad debts, which were only written off in the past when there
was absolutely no chance of recovery.
It also give instructions on the treatment of foreign currency transactions,
share issues, leaseholds and investments, and permits the inclusion of
certain intangible assets on the balance sheet.
These modifications will be welcomed by westerners trying to understand
Russian accounting. But they are not without problems - a point made by Mr
Zubaidur Rahman, a director of Deloitte &amp; Touche in Moscow who is an
academic and a key representative on the working parties bringing about
accounting reform.
He stresses that the changes have been introduced within the existing
framework of the chart of accounts, to prevent the transition from being too
sudden or marked. Even so, the changes listed are optional, and are unlikely
to be adopted quickly by many enterprises.
Many Russian accountants are concerned that preparation according to the new
rules could make the financial statements look less favourable, and threaten
their jobs. Like the Moscow underground, which works well but uses
antiquated equipment, modifications will probably come only over a
considerable period of time.

LOTUS Engineering, the consultancy design and engineering arm of General
Motors' troubled British sports-car subsidiary, is looking for a partner -
almost certainly in the aerospace industry - to produce and distribute a
roadgoing form of the 'supercycle' with which Chris Boardman of the UK is
dominating Olympic pursuit cycling.
It wants versions of the LotusSport pursuit cycle being used by Boardman,
offering a more traditional riding position but incorporating the basic
concept of a one-piece moulded monocoque frame, on world markets by early
next year.
Failure to do so may risk losing the benefit of the unprecedented - and
largely unexpected - publicity for the machine. 'We could lose the market to
makers of replicas which might look the same but lack its integrity and
performance, ' Lotus said yesterday.
Lotus plans to build a very limited number of machines over the next few
months at its Group Lotus headquarters in Hethel, Norfolk, which has
extensive facilities created originally for sports car production. The
machines will be built for top competition cyclists and will cost at least
Pounds 5,000 each.
Lotus might go on to build up to 1,000 somewhat less expensive units a year
 -forgoing carbon fibre at Pounds 330 a kilogramme and titanium at Pounds
150 a kilogramme - within its existing facilities.
It is mainly interested in finding a partner to which it can either license
the manufacture of a much higher volume of cheaper machines, a subcontractor
capable of building them - or taking part in a joint venture that might lead
to purpose-built facilities being created at Hethel.
Lotus Engineering does not expect initial derivatives of the 'supercycle' to
be sufficiently cheap to challenge manufacturers such as Raleigh in the
highest-volume sectors of the conventional cycle market. But it believes
there is scope for world-wide sales of many thousands a year towards the
upper end of the market.
The cycle is seen as presenting a potential challenge both to conventional
racing and quasi-racing cycles and to the fad for 'mountain' bikes, most of
which are unlikely ever to be used on a mountain but which nevertheless have
a strong lifestyle image for which buyers are prepared to pay upwards of
Pounds 600.
Although Lotus lays claim to having done substantial development work on the
cycle, and has invested some Pounds 125,000 in it, it is not a Lotus design.
It acquired the rights to the machine from its creator, Norwich-based
engineer Mr Michael Burrows, who had spent several years trying to interest
a number of cycle manufacturers in his concept.
The machine was unacceptable to the international cycle-racing authorities
when Mr Burrows first attempted to introduce it three years ago. The ban was
lifted last year.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Unfit water may prompt prosecutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCIPLINARY action is being considered against 28 of the 39 water companies
in England and Wales over breaches in drinking-water standards, the Drinking
Water Inspectorate said yesterday.
At least three companies may face prosecution for instances 'where it is
very probable that water was supplied that was unfit for human consumption',
said Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, presenting the inspectorate's annual
report.
However, drinking water 'is of a very high quality', he said. 'We are
talking about fractions away from perfection.'
Even where water had failed to pass the inspectorate's standards - which
incorporate both UK and European Community directives - the inspectorate's
medical advisers had concluded that there was no risk to public health, he
added.
The inspectorate's comments are likely to fuel the debate about whether the
UK's water standards are unecessarily and expensively high.
Mr Michael Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies, said: 'We have
been screaming for the past few years that customers are paying billions in
higher water bills for measures not necessary for their health. Many of the
quality standards we are meeting are purely aesthetic - smell, colour,
taste.'
Water companies have pledged to spend Pounds 28bn during the 1990s to meet
EC standards. Of that, Pounds 1.8bn will be spent by 1995 to meet
drinking-water standards.
The inspectorate's annual report - the second since it was created in 1990 -
showed an apparent deterioration in water quality because of an increase in
pesticide levels. A total of 98.7 per cent of tests passed the national
legal standards, compared with 99 per cent the year before.
However, the 'statistically significant' drop might be due to increased
testing for pesticides, the inspectorate said.
Excluding pesticides, the 'pass rate' had risen from 99.2 per cent to 99.3
per cent.
The 28 companies that may face disciplinary action include the 10 water
services companies. The action would be to force them to sign undertakings
to make rapid improvements.
Nine companies on the inspectorate's target list have breached the standards
for permissible levels of bacteria in waterworks and five for levels of
faecal bacteria. The others are on the list for bacteria in reservoirs or
for supplying inadequate data to the DWI.
EC legislation requiring increased sewage treatment to improve water quality
in rivers and seas may cost Northumbrian Water more than Pounds 500m,
forcing a steep rise in customers' bills, the company's finance director, Mr
Alan Jones warned yesterday.
Northumbrian Water, which serves north-east England, believes that of
Britain's 10 privatised water and sewage companies it may be the worst hit
by the new EC urban waste water treatment directive, due to take effect from
1998.
The directive will impose absolute standards, with still more stringent
requirements for waters designated 'sensitive'.
Northumbrian Water is currently investing Pounds 100m a year, mainly on
environmental improvements. But Mr Jones said the directive might mean
another Pounds 100m a year, and if a large proportion of the region's waters
were designated 'sensitive' the cost might be even more.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Lenders aim to ride out mortgage storm: David Barchard on
why home repossessions are down while arrears have risen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANGING OVER the latest gloomy set of repossession and arrears statistics
from the Council of Mortgage Lenders is an even grimmer question: what is
going to happen to the 305,140 people who are more than six months in
arrears with their mortgage payments?
Since Christmas, lenders have done their best not to evict borrowers. As a
result, the figures for repossession show a deceptive improvement. The
35,750 in the first half of this year were 8.2 per cent down on the second
half of 1991.
The slackening has several causes. Lenders are well aware that prices in the
housing market would tumble even faster if they repossessed homes of
customers in trouble as swiftly as they would have done two or three years
ago.
Since December they have also been under strong political and media pressure
not to repossess homes.
Although they say that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears of between
two months and six months peaked last autumn and has been falling gradually
since then, arrears over six months are getting steadily worse. Yesterday's
arrears figure compares with 275,000 at the end of last year and 221,900 a
year ago.
People more than six months in arrears with their mortgage payments often
have other debts and their chances of righting the situation are usually
slim. Since January, building societies have tried to offer deals to
customers who have even a faint prospect of financial survival.
Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said he
believed that most cases of long-term arrears would not go as far as
repossession. His confidence seems to be based on pledges by lenders that
customers who stick to revised payment arrangements will not be evicted when
the market improves.
Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, says categorically it
will not evict any customer who keeps up with a payment agreement.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is
much more pessimistic than Mr Boleat. He warned that arrears might be well
above expected levels of 65,000 or 70,000 this year and stay very high for
several years to come.
He said: 'I fear that over half of the 305,140 cases will eventually be
forced to give up their homes. Unless the economy starts to recover, their
prospects will be very bleak indeed. The irony is that an economic recovery
depends largely on a recovery in the housing market.'
He said the situation had passed the point where lenders could have much
impact on the arrears backlog. Since the start of the year, only a handful
of individuals had been saved from eviction by mortgage-into-rent schemes
operated by building societies and housing associations.
Barring direct government intervention to save home-owners from eviction, it
seems inevitable that the next few years will see repossessions running at
levels around or above the 75,540 recorded last year. Repossession will be a
severe embarrassment to the government and is one of several factors keeping
the housing market subdued.
However, since the end of last year lenders have managed to keep the stock
of repossessed houses on their books more-or-less unchanged at around
68,000. But the thought that the housing market may not after all be drowned
in a flood of repossessed houses is no comfort for families in debt who know
that sooner or later they are going to be forced out of their homes.
THE BIGGEST single housing association contract, worth Pounds 60m to build
1,500 homes, was awarded yesterday to Countryside Properties, the publicly
quoted residential, commercial and industrial property developer, Andrew
Taylor writes.
The contract, for affordable homes in parts of London and south-east
England, was granted by South Thames Housing Partnership. The total cost of
the development is expected to be about Pounds 92m, of which Pounds 60m will
be public money.

LOCAL authorities are meeting obligations imposed by the Citizen's Charter

in housing management processes, according to the Audit Commission, the
local government watchdog.
In a report on housing services, the commission says 95 per cent of urgent
repairs were carried out within target times - often as little as a few
hours - set by the councils surveyed. Most tenants were offered choices when
significant work was carried out on their homes.
Tenants were represented on estate management bodies in only 13 per cent of
the district councils surveyed.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Accounting change on subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES will be forced to include more of their subsidiaries in
their group accounts under a new standard issued by the Accounting Standards
Board yesterday.
Accounting for subsidiary undertakings, the second financial reporting
standard (FRS) to come into effect, tightens criteria under the 1989
Companies Act for subsidiaries that must be consolidated or placed in group
accounts.
It comes into force for financial periods ending on or after December 23
this year.
Mr David Tweedie, ASB chairman, said the new standard was 'the foundation
stone for how we will deal with group accounts'.
He said that additional standards stipulating whether to consolidate joint
ventures, associated companies and off-balance-sheet companies would follow
over the next two years.
FRS 2 tightens one part of the 1989 Companies Act which allows subsidiaries
to be exempt from consolidation if they are very different from the parent
company.
The standard says that banking and insurance subsidiaries, as well as
non-profit entities, should now be consolidated, whereas previously they
could be exempted.
In principle, all subsidiaries should be consolidated when a parent company
can direct their financial and operating policies with a view to gaining
economic benefits from their activities.
The new standard also incorporates the third ruling issued by the ASB's
urgent issues task force earlier this year dealing with goodwill - the
difference between the purchase price of an acquisition and the value of its
net assets.
It states that any goodwill written off on the acquisition of a company must
be passed through the profit-and-loss account if the company is later sold,
unless it has already been written off against profits.

FT  30 JUL 92 / BR wins deal for shake-up on bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, CATHERINE MILTON and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A year of intense but largely invisible, negotiation, British Rail has
won union agreement to abandon one of the most antique pieces of industrial
relations machinery - the 75-year-old Railway Staffs National Council.
That body, to which the most trivial disciplinary case could, theoretically,
be referred is being replaced with bargaining machinery based on BR's five
businesses and 30 profit centres.
At the top will be a Railway Joint Council, its remit restricted to pay and
basic conditions of employment for the 116,000 employees covered by
collective bargaining. At the business councils, more detailed matters such
as grading will be discussed, and at the profit centre councils almost
everything else.
Crucially for BR, there will be no 'reference up' from one level to the
higher level, although local disputes can be referred to the profit centre
councils. Individual grievances have been removed from the collective
bargaining machinery altogether.
Mr Gareth Hadley, BR's group employee relations manager, said the changes
were not merely a response to BR's more devolved structure and future
franchise-based system. 'Regardless of the current changes, we wanted to do
things in a different way with decision-making at the lowest possible level
and individual matters separated from the collective,' he said.
The unions, particularly the main rail union RMT, have been suspicious of
the potential 'fragmentation' of union power, and the RMT executive voted by
only a slender majority to accept. A similar attempt to change the
bargaining machinery lay behind the rail strike of 1989.
The unions remain concerned about arrangements for promotion and transfer
across businesses, but Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT, said: 'We have
achieved our objectives within a trade union framework and with the BR board
committed to encouraging employees to join a union.'
The unions also say they have won improvements on earlier drafts of the
plan.
THE government will be ready to award cash grants for big rail projects as
part of its plans for rail privatisation, Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, said yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
That is a significant departure from previous policy. So far, British Rail
has had to finance all its investment from revenues and loans. Grants have
been available only for loss-making commuter services and branch lines.
Speaking to business people in Aberdeen, Mr MacGregor said the track-owning
part of BR would have to fund most of its investment from charges to train
operators. Where projects would not earn returns large enough to justify
investment, the government would consider direct grants if the project
yielded wider benefits, such as relief of road congestion.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Japanese praise British companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies underrate the standing in which they are held by Japanese
business customers, according to a survey from Touche Ross, the accountancy
firm, released yesterday.
The survey of 100 companies - which included both Japanese companies and
British firms supplying their Japanese counterparts - showed that all felt
relations had remained stable or improved over the past five years.
Japanese companies said UK suppliers had improved their communication
skills, quality and attention to customers.
The British companies believed improved relations resulted as more Japanese
companies traded in the UK. Mutual understanding was better. UK companies
were often less positive than the Japanese about the UK's competitiveness,
and underestimated the quality, cost and availability of British labour, the
report says.
It suggests that the British sometimes failed to grasp the importance of the
Japanese idea of partnership, which involved a commitment to total customer
satisfaction, including socialising.
The report concludes that UK companies still have a lot to do to improve
communications, quality control and reaction times as suppliers.

MOST shoppers believe high-street retailers generally provide good service,

says a report from the National Consumer Council published today.
The organisation's survey of almost 2,000 shoppers in March showed that a
quarter of respondents thought at least one type of store provided poor
customer care. Many complained vociferously about unhelpful staff, poor
service and long check-out queues at supermarkets. 'Little seems to have
changed since we last asked about the high street 12 years ago,' the council
said.

FT  30 JUL 92 / The BCCI Indictments: Dollars 105m fine unlikely to be a
burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US plea-bargaining with Saudi former intelligence chief Sheikh Kamal
Adham, who admitted violating banking laws and agreed to pay a Dollars 105m
fine, was settled after long negotiations understood to have involved some
political manoeuvres because of his past importance to US administrations.
The fine is unlikely to trouble Mr Adham, who has acquired considerable
wealth through prominent Middle East deals. His biggest coup is believed to
have been a Dollars 400m commission 20 years ago, agreed by a group of
Japanese oil companies seeking a foothold in Saudi Arabia.
'The BCCI charges might have appeared to many Americans to have involved big
money, but it would have been the equivalent to taking the paper clips for
Adham,' said an Arab former banking official yesterday.
In the UK, where Mr Adham is regarded as an old friend of British
intelligence interests, he agreed this year to act as a witness in cases
being compiled by the Serious Fraud Office.
The 61-year-old Mr Adham is viewed as something of an eminence grise in
Egyptian society. Like many other prominent Arabs, he is an old boy of
Victoria College, Alexandria, and many of his business connections relating
to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International stem from old school
acquaintances.
Mr Adham, with Dr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi businessman, and Mr Roger Tamraz,
a banker who recently turned out to be the champion of an alternative BCCI
liquidation plan, emerged as the purchasers in 1975 of the Detroit-based
Bank of Commonwealth.
Two years later, Mr Adham headed a new takeover for the bank that would
become known as First American.
He made a brief and unprofitable foray into British banking in 1975 when
First Arabian Corporation bought a 25 per cent stake in the troubled Edward
Bates Bank, which was caught up in the UK's secondary banking crisis.
Mr Adham and his partners were persuaded to supply a letter of comfort that
needed to be drawn upon almost immediately. Some Pounds 70m is thought to
have been ploughed into the bank by Arab interests. The bank was later taken
over by an Arab consortium, joined by a 20 per cent stake from Barclays
Bank, and renamed Allied Arab Bank.
The key to Mr Adham's standing in the west, however, is his long and
distinguished pedigree in Middle East intelligence operations. He was
trained by the CIA.
A half-brother of Iffat, favourite wife of the late King Faisal of Saudi
Arabia, Mr Adham became one of the few advisers to win the king's complete
trust. Mr Adham was never so close to King Khalid, Faisal's successor, who
dismissed him in 1979 when he discovered that Mr Adham had been a mediator
in bringing Egypt and Israel together in the Camp David peace accord.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: IMF's craving for role satisfied
 -Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw
the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed
the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was
handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS an ill wind that blows no one any good. The debt crisis was, indeed,
an ill wind: between 1982 and 1990 consumption per head fell at an average
annual rate of 0.3 per cent in the World Bank's list of 15 'severely
indebted middle-income countries'.
Yet the crisis also blew some good. It transformed policy in many indebted
countries, mostly for the better, and gave international financial
institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank, new tasks.
For the World Bank this was hardly necessary: long-term development is task
enough. For the IMF, however, the debt crisis was a godsend.
Having lost its empire in the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed
exchange rates in the early 1970s, the IMF had been consistently searching
for a role. A series of unpleasant surprises - the twin oil shocks of the
1970s and the debt crisis - gave the institution the role it craved.
The Fund became the principal interlocutor on macro-economic policy between
the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, on the one hand, and
developing countries on the other.
It is, however, an agent rather than a principal. The central decisions  -
the initial response to the Mexican crisis in the summer of 1982 and then
the Baker and subsequent Brady plans - were taken by policy-makers of the
G7.
But the IMF, assisted by the World Bank, has played a valuable role: giving
its seal of approval to policy changes in debtor countries; bringing
together creditors and debtors; cajoling creditors; and, in the end, helping
to underpin the comprehensive debt reduction packages agreed under the Brady
Plan.
While the IMF focuses on macro-economic policies, resolution of the debt
crisis required more than macroeconomic policy change.
In all countries that have resolved their debt problems, structural reform
has been essential: reform of institutions, reform of trade policies, and
reform of tax systems. This is why the World Bank's view - articulated in
the structural adjustment lending that has reached a quarter of total World
Bank lending - has been as important as the work of the IMF.

<TEXT>
Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw
the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed
the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was
handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt?
SELDOM have economic fortunes changed so rapidly. From being regarded as a
financial disaster zone two or three years ago, Latin America has emerged as
hot financial property. Some Latin countries are now regarded as the likely
economic 'tigers' of the 1990s.
Capital has started to flow into the region again for the first time since
the 'Mexico weekend' put a sudden stop to capital inflows 10 years ago. Net
inflows were estimated last year at Dollars 36bn-Dollars 40bn, three times
the level of the previous year. This year, the figure is expected to be
considerably higher. Latin stock markets put on record-breaking performances
last year, while the region's governments and companies have found once more
that they can raise money on the world's bond markets. Multinational
companies in Europe and the US have begun to increase their direct
investment in the region.
Most important, the inflows have helped rekindle economic growth, stunted
during the decade of debt.
Much of this money is responding to changes in government economic and trade
policy. Governments have welcomed international capital, opened their
economies to outside influence by lowering trade barriers, and slimmed
bloated and inefficient public sectors.
In part, these shifts reflect the transformation in the global ideological
map after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mostly, however, the shift has
represented a pragmatic, rather than an ideological, response to the debt
crisis.
In the early stages of the crisis - viewed initially as a balance of
payments phenomenon - governments suppressed imports, then tried to expand
exports, in order to create current account surpluses. This led to trade
liberalisation and export promotion policies. The problem was that the
current account surpluses were being chalked up by the private sector, which
thus owned the foreign exchange, while the debt was owed by the public
sector, which needed the foreign exchange.
Governments were limited in their ability to secure that foreign exchange.
The debt crisis had more or less cut off external finance, and the tax
systems in most Latin countries were so inefficient that most governments
could not secure domestic funds with which to buy foreign exchange. Some
resorted to issuing domestic debt or printing money to obtain the foreign
exchange. Both courses had inflationary consequences, since domestic
government debt often became regarded as a liquid asset and was soon treated
like currency.
The 'successful' Latin governments of the late-1980s have been those that
have put their fiscal houses in order, through tax reform, through cutting
out subsidies to state-owned industries, and through privatisations.
This allowed non-inflationary service of the foreign debt, while the burden
of servicing that debt fell in most countries. With exports rising, debt
service became a smaller and smaller proportion of foreign exchange
receipts. Furthermore, the Brady initiative from the US in 1989 paved the
way for negotiated reductions in national foreign debts.
The debt service savings Brady has brought about have been modest (except
for Costa Rica, where a deep discount was negotiated), but the initiative
has provided an important stimulant to economic and financial confidence in
the big debtor countries. This has been enough to confirm an end to the debt
crisis, although - in part because Brady addressed only the bank debt and
some countries owe most debt to other governments and the multilateral
institutions - not to confirm an end to every country's debt problem.
This more optimistic outlook, however, owes a significant amount to the
rapid fall in US interest rates over the last two or three years. This has
dramatically reduced debt service burdens, since a large portion of the debt
remains in US dollars at floating interest rates.
Low US interest rates have had another effect. With deposits in US dollars
earning only 4 per cent, against 9 per cent two years ago, investors have
been forced to seek the higher returns available in the capital-starved
region to the south.
So far, much of the returning money has been 'hot' - footloose capital often
parked short-term in banks or triggered by companies borrowing abroad rather
than in their more expensive domestic markets. A lot of money is also going
into the region's stock markets - hence an explosion in stock market values,
to the benefit of a narrow group of speculators. But, with the notable
exception of Mexico, Latin American countries have not yet been able to
raise much new equity capital. In the international market for shares, some
investors have also begun to express concern about the low standards of
disclosure of Latin companies while, in the bond market, some corporate and
bank borrowers have been distinctly second-rate.
Mr Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former minister of mines and energy in Peru, is
among those who believe that the owners of this capital will not repeat the
banks' mistakes of the 1970s. Because it is in private hands, it gives 'some
protection to the always present risk that governments will repeat in the
1990s the mistakes of the 1970s'. However, the challenge is to attract some
of this capital into productive investments in the region - such as
rebuilding infrastructure which has fallen into disrepair in the 1980s, so
that growth is not restrained by bottlenecks.
This dilapidated infrastructure is part of Latin America's so-called social
debt that emerged in the 1980s. In the 'lost decade', per capita income in
the region fell by close to a fifth (albeit from unsustainable debt-inflated
levels at the start of the decade).
The pressure poverty places on the governments of what is now, more or less,
a democratic continent is extraordinary. Governments, even in their new,
slimmed roles, are essential to solving these social problems, but there are
questions about how well-equipped they are for the task.
Most Latin American governments have now come to terms with the need to
encourage both foreign and domestic investment as the main stimulus to
economic growth. Growth, as the World Bank's chief economist, Mr Larry
Summers, has pointed out, 'can raise a lot of boats'.
As reminders of the fragility of Latin American democracy, Venezuela
suffered a coup attempt in February, from which the government is still
rocking. Faced with a destructive guerrilla war, the Peruvian president
suspended Congress in April, in effect appointing himself dictator. Brazil,
whose economy makes up half of Latin America's, is suffering a political
crisis, its president beleaguered by corruption allegations.
The new love affair between international finance and Latin America may
prove to be more than just a brief flirtation, bound to end in tears, but it
is by no means certain that it represents the start of a long relationship
that will benefit both parties.
History suggests caution. Mr Victor Bulmer-Thomas, a historian of Latin
America at London University's Queen Mary College, points out that the
region has suffered debt crises at approximately 50-year intervals since the
1820s. Each crisis - in the 1820s, 1870s, 1930s and 1980s - triggered a
tremendous shift in economic policy and, after each one, creditors were
forced to recognise that the debts would not be paid in full.
'If any of my grandchildren go into banking, I shall recommend some serious
reading of economic history as the year 2030 approaches,' he says.

'I DIDN'T think it would be cured overnight, but I didn't count on it taking
as long as it has to resolve. You squirm because it took 10 years,' says
Paul Volcker. As chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1979 to 1987, he
had a central role in dealing with the debt crisis from the outset, writes
Stephen Fidler.
He believes the agreement in principle recently signed by Brazil and its
bank creditors signals an end to the debt crisis. 'Latin American debt is no
longer a threat to the financial system, nor are the problems of most Latin
American countries caused by their foreign debt. Brazil has lots of problems
but they don't stem from its foreign debt.'
Did industrialised countries share the blame for the crisis, because they
encouraged private banks to 'recycle' Opec oil surpluses during the 1970s?
'I think it's fair to say that the (recycling) was looked upon benignly for
a while. But, once momentum of this sort starts, it's very hard to slow it
down. One cannot cut it off and it's very hard to modulate it.'
However, Mr Volcker - now chairman of James D. Wolfensohn, a New York
investment bank - does not believe that the euphoria about Latin America,
recently developed in international financial markets, is yet a cause for
concern. 'I still have something of a central banker's mentality, which is
the mentality of a puritan - they have a haunting feeling that somebody,
some place, might be happy. But I don't think there is an imminent danger.'

system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the

'IF GREED often drives people apart, fear often brings them together.' So
says Mr William Rhodes, now vice-chairman of Citicorp, who led the
international banking community's response to the debt crisis, writes
Alexander Nicoll.
With Citibank the biggest lender to Latin America, Mr Rhodes was chairman of
advisory committees - formed by banks to lead their negotiations - for
Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Uruguay.
Recalling the IMF meeting in September 1982 in Toronto being compared to
rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic, he says a sort of partnership
swiftly developed among central bankers, heads of international institutions
and commercial banks. 'The resulting co-operation ultimately overcame the
widespread fear that the international system would collapse.'
Mr Rhodes attributes the containment of the debt problem to this
co-operation, and to political leadership in Latin America. Also important
was the approach to debt problems on a case-by-base basis, and the fact that
no solution was imposed on banks.
Economic reforms by Latin American governments are useful examples for other
developing countries: 'The formula entails a strong head of state, a viable
economic plan, an economic team that works together, a belief in the plan by
all senior officials involved, and - this is most important - a method to
convince all levels of society of the benefits of economic reform.'
However, in retrospect, Mr Rhodes feels that the return of Latin American
borrowers to the markets might have been accelerated if structural reform -
such as privatisation, deregulation, and improvement of trade policies and
tax systems - had been attempted sooner.

1982
MEXICO, facing foreign borrowing requirement of more than Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 10.4bn) for the year, raises Dollars 5bn in first quarter, although
at higher interest rates than previously. Outflow of dollars prompts several
sharp devaluations of peso during year. Inflation accelerates rapidly and
oil revenues decline.
April - Argentina's invasion of Falkland Islands provokes conflict with
Britain and slows new lending to Latin America. Mexico draws on swap line
with US Federal Reserve and meets difficulties in arranging loans from
banks.
August - Mexico introduces exchange controls, seeks emergency finance from
US and international financial institutions. On August 20 finance minister
meets creditor banks in New York and announces three-month moratorium on
Dollars 10bn of debt principal repayments. Central banks agree Dollars
1.85bn emergency loan to Mexico 'to ensure continued smooth functioning of
the international financing system'. US provides Dollars 2bn credit. Mexico
to seek International Monetary Fund and bank loans. Creditor banks form
advisory committee chaired by Citibank.
September - Mexico nationalises banks and imposes total exchange control.
Central bank heads consider Latin American payment problems. One says: 'To
say that we are concerned could be an understatement.' International
Monetary Fund and World Bank hold annual meetings in Toronto in atmosphere
of panic.
October - Brazil arranges emergency short-term bank loan, sells gold.
November - IMF managing director Jacques de Larosiere tells bank chairmen he
expects them to make new Dollars 5bn loan to Mexico and Dollars 1.5bn loan
to Argentina, to support economic policies under International Monetary Fund
programmes.
December - Banks commit to Mexico loan. Brazil arranges Dollars 1.5bn in
emergency loans from US and says it will seek new 'jumbo' bank loan. But, as
year ends, Brazil also halts repayment of debt principal.
1983
January - Pattern emerges for handling LDC debt problems. Key elements are:
IMF-agreed economic programme and IMF loan, rescheduling of some debt
principal repayments to banks and governments, and large new loans. This
involves close co-operation among debtors, international institutions and
creditors. Packages under way for Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Yugoslavia and,
soon, Chile and Peru contain all these elements. Bridging loans tide
borrowers over until the full agreements are signed.
February - Brazil signs Dollars 4bn new bank loan and Dollars 4.8bn
rescheduling, but suffers severe difficulties in maintaining short-term
interbank lines of credit to foreign branches of its banks, a crucial
element of financing programme. It misses first-quarter International
Monetary Fund economic targets. Interest payment arrears build up to Dollars
2bn by August. Economic programme and rescue package have to be re-drawn.
March - Mexico's banks sign Dollars 5bn new loan (agreed in 1982) and, in
August, agreements rescheduling Dollars 20bn of debt principal falling due
to banks in 1983 and 1984.
September - At International Monetary Fund annual meeting, Brazil agrees in
principle with creditors on Dollars 11bn rescue package involving Dollars
6.5bn new bank loan, rescheduling of debts falling due up to the end of
1984. Leading creditor banks and central bankers embark on successful
worldwide 'roadshow' to persuade other creditor banks to join the deal.
Brazil begins to reduce interest arrears.
1984
Argentina builds up interest arrears of Dollars 2.7bn by end-March. Impasse
in Argentina's negotiations with IMF and banks means US banks must count
loans as 'non-performing' for first time in debt crisis.
June - Banks agree in principle to provide 'multi-year rescheduling
agreement' (Myra) for Mexico, lowering interest rates on rescheduled debt
and stretching out six years' maturities, totalling Dollars 48bn. Poland
signs Myra in July. In September Venezuela agrees in principle on Dollars
21bn Myra. In December Argentina agrees in principle on Dollars 14bn Myra
and agrees to cut interest arrears, and International Monetary Fund endorses
economic programme.
1985
International Monetary Fund suspends loans to Brazil and Argentina as
economic targets missed. In negotiation of new targets, Brazil seeks greater
flexibility from International Monetary Fund - but in August finance
minister and central bank governor resign in frustration over lack of
economic austerity policies, and government embarks on expansionist
approach. Peru announces unilateral limit on debt service payments: 10 per
cent of export receipts. Argentina agrees new economic stabilisation package
with International Monetary Fund as inflation reaces 1,000 per cent. In
July, Mexico introduces new austerity package as oil revenues drop and
misses International Monetary Fund targets. In September, earthquakes
devastate Mexico City. Brazil seeks International Monetary Fund 'monitoring
of economy' rather than full agreement.
September - At International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Seoul, US
treasury secretary James Baker unveils new approach to debt, known as
Programme for Sustained Growth or Baker Plan. Key elements are:
Economic reform by debtor countries to promote growth and balance of
payments adjustment, and to reduce inflation.
Increased structural adjustment lending by multilateral development banks as
well as continued central role for IMF.
Increased lending by commercial banks: net new lending of Dollars 20bn over
next three years to heavily indebted middle-income countries.
Maintenance of case-by-case approach to debtors.
Larger debtors and creditors give qualified support to Baker Plan.
Chronology of events: 1986-1992
1986
June - Mexican finance minister Jesus Silva Herzog resigns as oil revenues
drop and economy worsens. In July his successor Gustavo Petricioli agrees
growth-oriented economic programme with International Monetary Fund,
clearing the way for negotiations with banks.
At International Monetary Fund annual meeting, a year after Baker Plan
announced, banks and Mexico agree in principle on Dollars 7.7bn new loan and
Dollars 54bn loan rescheduling, first under the plan, with 20-year maturity
and 13/16 percentage point interest margin - seen as too concessional by
some banks. By December banks' commitments to loan are sufficient to put the
International Monetary Fund's rescue package into effect.
1987
February - Brazil halts interest payments on Dollars 68bn of debt to banks.
April - Argentina agrees with banks in principle on Baker Plan deal for new
loan and Dollars 24bn rescheduling on terms similar to Mexico's. Package
features first 'menu of options,' including chance for banks to convert
loans into 'exit' bonds.
May - Citicorp, biggest lender to third world, adds Dollars 3bn to loan loss
reserves and says it will seek to 'liquefy' third world loan portfolio by
selling loans and using instruments such as debt/equity swaps. Its share
price rises. Other US banks follow with similar loss provisions.
August - Bank of England issues guidelines to UK banks on loss provisions.
September - Brazil proposes to convert Dollars 34bn of bank debt into
securities, taking advantage of discount at which loans trade in secondary
market. It is rebuffed by Mr Baker. He proposes new International Monetary
Fund funding facility to compensate debtors for unforeseen shocks which
could undermine Fund programmes.
November - Brazil and banks reach interim agreement to end halt in interest
payments. Brazil agrees to seek accord with Fund on economic programme.
December - Mexico and J P Morgan, the US bank, announce innovative plan to
retire Dollars 20bn of debt in exchange for securities with principal backed
by US zero coupon Treasury bonds held by Mexico. Banks invited to tender
loans competitively - those putting the highest discount on their loans to
win bonds.
1988
March - Mexican exchange auction results in issue of only Dollars 2.5bn of
bonds in exchange for Dollars 3.6bn of bank debt, an average discount of 33
per cent. Brazil holds first debt-for-equity auction.
June - Brazil's creditor banks agree in principle on Dollars 5.2bn loan and
Dollars 61bn rescheduling.
October - US makes Dollars 3.5bn emergency loan to Mexico, again suffering
liquidity problems following drop in oil price.
1989
March - US Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady announces controversial
'suggestions' on debt problems, dubbed the Brady Plan. Key new element
embraces concept of allowing debtors, provided they pursue approved economic
policies, to reduce outstanding debt. However, this should be on a voluntary
basis for creditors - along lines of Mexico/Morgan offer. International
Monetary Fund, industrialised countries and leading bankers give debt relief
qualified backing.
July - Mexico and banks agree first Brady Plan deal covering Dollars 52bn of
debt, including options for banks to exchange loans for collateralised
floating rate bonds at a 35 per cent discount, exchange loans for bonds of
same par value but lower fixed interest rate, or advance new money to
finance Mexico's interest payments.
September - J P Morgan adds Dollars 2bn to loan loss reserves, bringing them
to a level equalling its medium- and long-term lending to countries which
have restructured debts. It says increase reflects rising expectations about
the size of debt reductions possible under Brady initiative. Its share price
rises. US President George Bush appeals to banks to support Brady Plan.
November - UK banks increase provisions against third world debt losses.
Lloyds Bank says 15 of 29 problem countries are not paying interest and that
it has made 100 per cent provisions for more than half of the 29. Peru,
which had cut itself off from the International Monetary Fund and built up
Dollars 800m of arrears to the Fund, agrees to resume payments to
International Monetary Fund and accept economic programme.
1990
Of Mexico's creditor banks, 49 per cent choose to exchange Dollars 22bn of
debt for lower interest, fixed-rate bonds of same face value, and 41 per
cent choose to exchange Dollars 20bn of debt for floating-rate bonds at 35
per cent discount to face value, saving Mexico a total of Dollars 1.3bn per
year. Costa Rica, the Philippines, Uruguay and Venezuela agree Brady debt
reduction deals.
1991
April - Brazil reaches preliminary agreement on settling Dollars 8bn of
interest arrears to banks.
September - International Monetary Fund approves Peru economic programme.
October - Mexico's Nafinsa issues 10-year Eurobond, longest maturity for
Latin American capital market issue since debt crisis began.
1992
April - Argentina reaches outline agreement on Brady deal covering Dollars
23bn of debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears.
July - Brazil reaches outline deal on Brady deal covering Dollars 44bn of
debt. Brady says after Brazil agreement that more than 90 per cent of the
commercial bank debt of big debtor countries would be dealt with. He says:
'It represents a milestone in finally putting the Latin American debt crisis
behind us.'

THE African National Congress (ANC) yesterday warned that South African
security force members who assault people in their custody face prosecution
under 'a future democratic government'.
The warning follows a pathologist's accusation at the weekend that police
had killed scores of detainees in recent years. Since the claim, a further
two men in police custody have died, one in a police station.
The police came in for further criticism this week when the Goldstone
commission of inquiry into political violence said the force had failed
effectively to prosecute perpetrators of violence on black commuter trains.
The commission said it had been unable to say who had been responsible for
the killings, adding that 'victims were members of various black ethnic
groups'.
The police, meanwhile, launched a 'peace offensive' yesterday to restore
their authority in black townships around Johannesburg.
Mr Hernus Kriel, the law and order minister, said 5,000 police and troops
would take part in the 'stabilisation' operation in 16 townships, some of
which are sliding into anarchy. Between July 1991 and April this year, 138
people have been killed and 261 injured.

The Mexican government is threatening to confiscate and destroy about 5,000
tonnes of Irish beef, worth about Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m), which has been
exported to Mexico by meat export companies in Denmark, Ireland and Britain,
according to Mr Niels Juul, of the Danish Bacon and Meat Council, write
Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen and Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The beef, from
EC intervention stocks, is at present either in cold store in Mexico or on
ships waiting in the Mexican port of Tampico. However, a Mexican official
denied yesterday that the government intended to destroy or confiscate the
meat. Of the shipment, 524 tonnes would be allowed to be sold; 2,300 tonnes
would have to be sent back immediately and the rest at a later date to
Ireland. Samples of the meat had been tested and found biologically
contaminated. In the EC view, increasing resistance among Mexican farmers to
beef imports from European stocks appears to be behind the Mexican action.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S new government has warned that a freeze on new building in Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories will also curb economic growth in
the short term and delay a fall in unemployment, currently running at a
record 11.5 per cent, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The Labour-led coalition which took power earlier this month is committed to
shifting resources from the territories to Israel 'proper' and increasing
infrastructural investment in an attempt to generate high growth sufficient
to cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union.
A freeze on 6,000 settlement housing units, and restrictions on construction
activity within Israel, are a first step towards implementing this policy.
This week, the government has also taken steps to rescind government
incentives from industrial plants in Jewish settlements. The actions are
expected to help secure Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees
Israel wants to finance immigration absorption. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister, and Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, have both
warned that a short-term effect will be to limit growth.
Mr Shochat told parliament's finance committee that gross national product
in 1993 was unlikely to grow significantly. 'The fruits in employment and
investment will be seen in 1994-95,' he said. Growth this year is expected
to be around 5 per cent, with more than half accounted for by state-backed
construction.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Breakthrough elusive in farm talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO DAYS of informal talks between Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture
commissioner, and Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, aimed at
averting farm trade conflicts between the US and the EC ended inconclusively
in Ireland yesterday.
The two sought a compromise over the Uruguay Round of world trade
liberalisation proposals - blocked for 20 months by a US-EC dispute over
cuts in EC farm subsidies - and the US threat to impose punitive tariffs on
Dollars 1bn worth of EC exports in retaliation for damage done to US farmers
by the EC's oilseed subsidy scheme.
Mr MacSharry said after the talks at Dromoland Castle in the west of Ireland
that he remained optimistic that the Uruguay Round would be successfully
concluded by October this year, but said that many issues remained to be
resolved.
'The major problem is still export volume,' he said, referring to the need
to cut both the volume and the value of subsidised EC farm exports,
especially cereals.
He and Mr Madigan were making 'a big effort' to avoid a trade war between
the EC and the US, he said. The latest discussions had been a 'stocktaking
exercise' during which both sides had reviewed the other's positions on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the oilseeds dispute.
In the oilseeds dispute, the US government is expected to publish in three
weeks' time the final list of Dollars 1bn in EC agricultural exports which
will be subject to punitive tariffs if the EC does not reform its oilseeds
subsidy regime. Two Gatt dispute panels have supported a US claim that EC
oilseed subsidies have harmed US soyabean farmers.
The most recent EC proposals for a compensation package were rejected by the
US in Geneva on Monday. Mr Robert Green, US Agriculture Department
under-secretary, this week told the American Soyabean Association (ASA) that
the EC compensation offer was unacceptable because it provided no advantage
to injured soyabean producers.
The Bush administration is expected to proceed with sanctions unless the
compensation is satisfactory to the ASA.
Mr McSharry, the Irish appointee to the EC Commission, has been angered that
some Dollars 200m of Irish products have been targeted in the initial US
'hit-list' published in June. This would cause a disproportionate share of
retaliation to fall on Irish producers and prove particularly damaging for
the Irish dairy processing industry, officials say.

FT  30 JUL 92 / US-EC conflict looms on coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US coal producers may ask Washington to retaliate against the EC for
allegedly restricting US coal imports and disrupting world trade with hefty
subsidies to Community coal mines.
The National Coal Association (NCA) of the US is considering action because
British Coal has complained to the European Commission about alleged
'dumping' of cheap US coal in the European market.
That complaint has been stalled in Brussels since February because of the
political sensitivity of the case.
But the NCA has now raised the temperature with a letter to Mrs Carla Hills,
the US trade representative. In the letter the association denies the
dumping charge and says it is examining possible 'defensive action' under
Section 301 of the 1988 trade act, which provides for retaliation against
third countries.
The NCA adds that it is considering 'the option of an antitrust claim'
against British Coal and other EC complainants, although the basis for such
a claim is unclear.
If the NCA asks Mrs Hills to look at EC subsidies under Section 301, she
will have to launch an investigation, although it is up to President George
Bush to decide whether retaliation would be politically advisable.
A formal investigation would certainly increase trade tension with the EC
and add to a growing list of bilateral disputes between the trading partners
over such issues as oilseed subsidies, steel dumping, and public procurement
legislation. It could also damage the chances of agreement in the Uruguay
Round of world trade talks.
The European Commission is acutely aware of its vulnerability to
counter-claims on coal subsidies. Most European producers charge well above
the world market price for coal, with German and Spanish mines among the
most heavily subsidised.
The framework policy for such aid expires at the end of next year and the
Commission's energy directorate has prepared controversial proposals for a
replacement system which would try to bring the highest coal production
costs in the Community down to the 1992 average of around Ecu110 (Pounds
77.77) per tonne by 1997.
France and Britain are already producing coal at below the average cost, but
Germany - which produces at Ecu137 per tonne - and Spain would both have to
cut costs. If they failed they would be disqualified from further operating
aid until they had closed inefficient mines.
The Commission - which also wants to introduce greater transparency into aid
schemes - is likely to approve the new scheme and submit it to EC ministers
in the autumn, but it will then require the unanimous approval of member
states.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Moment of truth for Zimbabwe reforms: Tony Hawkins previews
a budget of all-round cuts when the economy is at its weakest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S moment of fiscal truth arrives today when Mr Bernard Chidzero,
the finance minister, delivers his budget to parliament.
After 18 months of painfully slow implementation of structural economic
reforms, the man who has presided over the country's descent into low-income
from middle-income status, is committed by agreement with the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank to announce spending cuts, subsidy reductions
and tax increases.
The timing could hardly be worse. The country is experiencing its steepest
fall in output since the depression of 1931. Official forecasts are for
gross domestic product to fall 9 per cent this year, largely because of a 35
per cent decline in agricultural production after the worst drought in
living memory.
The macro-economic aggregates are almost uniformly horrendous: the country
has a balance of payments deficit of more than Dollars 1bn, or 20 per cent
of GDP; inflation, now 39 per cent, is likely to exceed 40 per cent for a
month or two before peaking; and 75,000 retrenchments are planned over the
next year - 6 per cent of the employed workforce - when unemployment is
already 1m, or 20 per cent of the labour force.
The business community, which at first enthusiastically embraced the
structural adjustment programme sponsored by the IMF and World Bank, is
hurting. It is critical of heel-dragging by the government especially in the
field of para-statal and public sector reform. The government's claim that
it is eliminating para-statal subsidies is accurate but the method -
allowing state enterprises to indulge in an orgy of cost-plus pricing - is,
along with a 46 per cent devaluation last year, largely responsible for
escalating production costs. Industrialists complain bitterly that no
efforts are being made to improve efficiency and productivity in state-owned
monopolies.
Industry is caught in a classic cost-price squeeze; demand at home - and
increasingly in the region - is collapsing because of the drought and a weak
South African economy - the country's main market for non-traditional
exports. Companies are reporting costs increases of more than 40 per cent
over the past year.
The government's enhanced structural adjustment facility loan from the IMF
stipulates that Zimbabwe's central bank maintain positive real money market
interest rates (the 90-day rate for negotiable certificates of deposit).
With inflation about to move above 40 per cent, interest rates are set to
rise further.
Some banks are warning the government of overkill, but with all escape
routes closed, other than to the IMF and World Bank, an unparalleled spell
of monetary and fiscal discipline is looming. Past promises to cut spending
during Mr Chidzero's 10-year tenure at the finance ministry have come to
nought, but this time, the terms of the IMF deal will force him to do what
he should have done years ago.
Mr Chidzero is committed to cut government spending to 42 per cent of GDP
from 48 per cent last year. This implies cutting spending by some ZDollars
2bn (Pounds 210m). This is to be achieved by postponing capital projects,
reducing most spending programmes, slimming the cabinet and retrenching
14,000 public servants by mid-1993. Subsidies are due to be cut by 45 per
cent.
Businessmen already question whether Mr Chidzero can deliver his promise,
partly because he is locked into heavy debt-service expenditure as a result
of past fiscal follies. Interest charges will absorb about 20 per cent of
total spending this year after devaluation and the rise in interest rates.
When education (22 per cent), defence (14 per cent) and health (6.5 per
cent) are taken into account, there is scant room for manoeuvre. Had the
tough fiscal and monetary medicine been imposed sooner rather than at a time
of severe drought-induced deflation, the economy would have been far better
able to withstand the difficulties.
President Robert Mugabe's government is half way through its third term in
office and must go to the polls early in 1995. By then living standards in
Zimbabwe will be no higher than at independence 15 years previously and
lower than in the 1975 boom during Mr Ian Smith's unilateral independence
regime.
If drought can be blamed for part of this dismal performance, the World Bank
repeatedly affirms that ill-conceived economic policies and weak economic
management are ultimately to blame. With no viable political opposition in
sight, Mr Mugabe must take risks now if he is to win in 1995. But there is
little in the government's record on public spending to justify the belief
that this time Mr Chidzero really means what he says.

MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday proposed a
further enlargement of the world body's responsibilities in Croatia despite
his earlier complaint that it was already over-extended in former
Yugoslavia.
Specifically, he endorsed 'with some misgiving' a recommendation by General
Satish Nambiar, the UN force commander, that his staff be authorised to
control civilian entry into UN-protected areas and exercise immigration and
customs functions at their borders.
Additionally, the secretary-general said there was a possibility of
establishing a UN military presence in the Prevlaka Peninsula, between
Dubrovnik and Serbia-Montenegro, to ensure that it stayed demilitarised. In
seeking a Security Council mandate, he stressed that his recommendations
illustrated how the situation in former Yugoslavia had brought about the
UN's involvement in 'quasi-governmental functions which go beyond normal
peace-keeping practice'.
Croatia and the Serbia have agreed on the release of all prisoners from
their conflict in Croatia, the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva.
The ICRC said the Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, and the Croatian
deputy prime minister, Mr Mate Granic, had agreed to release the remaining
1,200 prisoners under ICRC auspices by August 7. The ICRC said it had
already helped secure the release of 4,000 prisoners from the conflict.

THE radical right-wing in Germany now presents as big a threat to internal
security as left-wing urban guerrillas once did, the government said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
At least 4,400 of the 40,000 right-wing extremists in Germany are prone to
violence and some may want to stockpile weapons for possible terrorist
attacks, it said in a written answer to a query in parliament. 'The
government takes the dangers to internal security arising from right-wing
extremism and xenophobia as seriously as the left-wing extremist attacks of
the 1970s,' it said.
Skinheads make up 4,200 of the 4,400 violent right-wingers identified by
Bonn's internal security watchdog, the Federal Office for the Protection of
the Constitution (BFV). The Ku Klux Klan from the US was also active in
providing neo-Nazi propaganda, the government said.

</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government's L30,000bn (Pounds 13.8bn) emergency economic
package yesterday cleared its main hurdle when the chamber of deputies
approved the measures by an ample majority in a motion of confidence.
But the troubled state of Italian party politics was underlined yesterday by
the resignation of the Christian Democrat Mr Enzo Scotti as foreign
minister.
His resignation was prompted by a long-running feud within the Christian
Democrat party over a controversial decision demanding that all cabinet
members renounce their parliamentary seats.
Mr Claudio Vitalone, the foreign trade minister, also under pressure,
decided to give up his senate seat rather than his ministerial portfolio.
Mr Scotti in particular was deeply unhappy about resigning his seat in
Naples and yesterday parliament was due to decide on the position of the 10
Christian Democrats in the 24-strong cabinet who were meant to resign their
seats.
A former interior minister, he was never at ease in the foreign ministry.
However, it was not clear whether his move yesterday was an attempt to
persuade the party, which has yet to agree on a new secretary-general, to
reverse its decision, or indeed whether he could be persuaded to change his
mind.
Now that the Chamber of Deputies has approved the economic package, which
mixes revenue cuts with increased taxes and a one-off tax on bank deposits,
ministers are confident it will also be passed by the Senate next week.
That would clear the way for planning the 1993 budget. This is due in
September and will seek to raise an extra L83,000bn next year in revenues
and spending cuts to reduce Italy's huge public sector deficit, it was
revealed yesterday. The 1992 deficit is likely to be L150,000bn against the
original L128,000bn.
The lira strengthened to 755.9 against the D-Mark yesterday in anticipation
of a favourable outcome. This compared with close to 761 a week ago, not far
off its 765 floor within the exchange rate mechanism.
The month-old government, headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, imposed a confidence
vote on the chamber of deputies in order to speed up implementation of the
package. Opposition deputies had put forward 651 amendments, but these were
ruled out by the main 318-246 vote.
In the full 630-seat house, the government coalition of Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals has a 16-seat majority and a
three-line whip was enforced by the government, with threats of expulsion
from the coalition parties directed at any potential deserters.
The comfortable margin was largely due to abstention by deputies of the
breakaway communist grouping, Reconstructed Communism.
Parliament must now turn its attention to discussion of special powers being
sought by the government to address reforms of the health service, the civil
service, pensions and local government finance.
However, this debate will not be completed until early September, with both
houses taking a summer break.
In outlining plans for a tough austerity package for next year, the
government said it hoped the bulk of the L83,000bn to be taken out of the
economy would come from savings from structural reforms, with a further
L15,000bn from privatisations.

Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic said yesterday he would again go to

Meanwhile, leaders of Bosnia's factions agreed to set up an international

The biggest aid convoy to reach Sarajevo by road arrived in the besieged

The convoy took an overland route from the Adriatic coast, which UN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREEK opposition has assured the conservative government of an
overwhelming majority in favour of the Maastricht treaty in a parliamentary
vote tomorrow by giving the pact its backing.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek opposition leader, told a parliamentary
debate that he supported ratification despite concern about Greece's ability
to participate in European union.
He said Maastricht gave Greece an opportunity to compete in 'a difficult and
unfair race. Unfair because we are last on the starting block and because
the treaty defines the interests of the rich north.'
With the support of Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok),
the government is assured of victory. Only seven hardline Communist deputies
in the 300-member house are expected to vote against ratification.
Pasok's decision should also make the Economy Ministry's task easier when it
launches fresh austerity measures aimed at achieving convergence with the
rest of the EC by 1997. A consensus, however grudging, on the need for
reform is expected to soften the impact of continued wage curbs, pension
cuts and higher unemployment as jobs disappear in the public sector.
The government has brought the ratification process forward by several
months. It was originally due to happen in November, when Greece's
application to join the Western European Union is likely to be approved.
The government also hopes to distract attention from what most Greeks will
consider a serious diplomatic defeat over accession to the WEU.
By joining the WEU, Greece had hoped to secure a guarantee against the
perceived threat to its security from Turkey, its Nato ally. Under Article 5
of the pact, WEU members are obliged to assist each other if attacked. But
last month the WEU ruled that the mutual assistance clause does not apply to
conflicts between allies.

FT  30 JUL 92 / Heseltine puts Post Office sale on agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POST OFFICE may be privatised after a wide-ranging review of its
organisation and structure which was announced yesterday by the government.
In a departure from previous policy, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, put privatisation of the Post Office firmly on the
political agenda.
He said he had no preconception of the likely outcome of the review and did
not rule out leaving the corporation in the public sector. But he claimed
that public ownership meant the Post Office was 'shackled' and its market
was being 'creamed off' by competitors.
'There is growing interest worldwide in the potential advantages of
freeing-up of postal markets,' he said.
Mr Heseltine reiterated the government's commitment to the proposals in the
Citizen's Charter on the Post Office. At the moment the Post Office has a
monopoly on letters under Pounds 1. The Citizen's Charter suggested lowering
the threshold to a level closer to the price of a first class stamp,
currently at 24p.
The Citizen's Charter, however, made no mention about the possibility of
changing the ownership of the Post Office.
'We want to see if there are ways the Post Office can be given a bigger
opportunity to raise money, compete more effectively and offer shares to
their own workforce,' Mr Heseltine said.
'I am not suggesting a management-employee buy-out is my preferred solution
but I would be very surprised if we didn't hear from people coming forward
from within the Post Office making suggestions of that sort.'
He said the Royal Mail title would be kept and disclosed that two companies
had expressed interest in the possibility of bidding for Parcelforce, the
parcel division. The government's commitment to a nationwide delivery
network within a uniform and affordable price structure was
'non-negotiable', he said.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, Post Office chairman, said the board would discuss how
the corporation could take advantage of the government's review. 'Every
effort should be made to give the employees a share of the action,' he
added.
Labour swiftly condemned the planned review, saying it had more to do with
privatisation than public service.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'The danger is
that the review will sniff out the profitable parts of the Post Office and
skim them off for the private sector.'

MR Justice McKinnon, the Blue Arrow trial judge, is unlikely to resign in
spite of severe criticism by the Court of Appeal of his conduct of the
trial; nor is he likely to be dismissed.
Removing High Court judges from office is very difficult. They have the
right to hold office 'during good behaviour'. Only corrupt or criminal
behaviour is likely to put their job at risk.
Criticism of a judge for his handling of a case by a superior court is an
everyday occurrence. Although critical of Mr Justice McKinnon, the Appeal
Court did praise some aspects of his handling of the case, in particular the
lucidity of his summing up. He has already been replaced with Mr Justice

SAUDI American Bank (Samba), the joint-venture Saudi Arabian bank 30 per
cent owned by Citicorp, has announced a 46 per cent rise on first-half
earnings to Dollars 119.2m over last year's figure.
Saudi Arabia's biggest joint venture bank said it had increased earnings in
treasury, corporate lending and retail operations. Samba said that it
expected a considerable improvement on last year's record earnings of
Dollars 200.5m.
Deposits grew by 19.3 per cent to Dollars 7.8bn, reflecting a gain in market
share in the buoyant Saudi market. Most Saudi banks have reported increased
deposits since the end of the Gulf War last year. Net loans and advances
grew by 23.4 per cent to Dollars 2.9bn. The bank made a Dollars 4.5m
transfer to loan loss reserves, a 31.3 per cent fall on equivalent figures
last year.
The Bahrain-based offshore Gulf International Bank (GIB) reported a 26.7 per
cent rise in first-half earnings to Dollars 25.6m over last year. Assets
rose to Dollars 6.2bn from Dollars 5.9bn, while deposits were up over the
six months to Dollars 5.6bn from Dollars 5.3bn.
GIB, formerly owned by six Gulf governments (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar) and Iraq, earlier this
year shed its Iraqi holding and was effectively taken over by the Gulf
Investment Corporation, which is owned by the six Gulf states.

<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has decided to extend for one more year its
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (Esaf), a fund used to provide
special low-interest loans to the poorest third world countries.
Esaf, which was set up in 1987, had been due to expire at the end of
November, after a one-year extension last year. But the IMF agreed on Monday
to a further year.
The fund is intended to provide balance of payments support to the poorest
IMF member countries, at an interest rate of only 0.5 per cent a year.
Finance ministers of the Group of 24 developing nations made a strong plea
at this year's spring meeting of the IMF for Esaf to be made permanent, but
the policy-making interim committee remained silent on the issue.
Although 72 low-income countries are eligible for Esaf assistance, China and
India have said they do not intend to call on the fund. Only 19 countries
had in fact used the facility by March this year.
Most of the Esaf user countries are in Africa, but Bangladesh and Bolivia
have also borrowed from the fund.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S IG Metall metalworkers' union said yesterday it would fight BMW's
plan to build a factory in South Carolina without union representation for
workers, AP reports from Berlin.
IG Metall, which claims with 3.6m members to be the biggest union in the
west, accused BMW of deciding to build in the US on political rather than
economic grounds, to the detriment of Germany's industrial base. It said it
would co-operate with the US autoworkers' union to see that the plant was
unionised.
Munich-based BMW announced last month it had chosen to build its first US
plant in South Carolina with an investment of Dollars 250m.
Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW chairman, said in a meeting last week with
reporters from South Carolina that the company would fight attempts to
unionise the plant, and that a second plant would be built in the state.
'We don't need an outside, third party between management and our
employees,' he said.
IG Metall yesterday released a letter sent to Mr von Kuenheim from Mr Klaus
Zwickel, a deputy president of the union, vowing that BMW will be 'no
exception' to the union's policy of seeing that workers are represented in
German-owned plants abroad.
The union would work closely with the United Automobile Workers in the US
during the construction phase of the South Carolina plant to secure union
representation, Mr Zwickel's letter said.
In Germany it would be unthinkable for BMW to open a new factory without
union representation, and German law requires that employees be represented
on an oversight council with power to influence company policy. Mr Zwickel
is a member of the oversight council at BMW.
The doctrine is considered a cornerstone of social peace, democracy and good
labor relations in Germany.
However, in recent years the high pay and benefits enjoyed by German workers
have come under increasing fire from employers who say Germany is losing its
industrial competitiveness.

President Kamuzu Banda of Malawi bowed to international pressure yesterday
by promising a review and possible relaxation of the law allowing detention
without trial, diplomats said, AP reports from Lusaka.
Mr Banda's announcement came two months after at least 22 people were killed
in anti-government riots, the nation's worst urban unrest since independence
from Britain in 1964. The riots were sparked in part by the detention of Mr
Chakufwa Chihana, an anti-government activist who had been held several
weeks without charges being filed. Western donors froze Dollars 74m in aid
in May to press for reforms. The president also said he would allow hundreds
of Asians to appeal for the first time against the confiscation by the state
of their businesses in the 1960s, according to diplomats.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Turkey braced for summer of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S 40,000 municipal workers are to strike from tomorrow, bringing
cities to a standstill in the first test of the fragile consensus between
labour unions and the coalition government.
With wage negotiations deadlocked for 100,000 workers in public sector
enterprises, and civil servants protesting against their pay award, Turkey
is braced for a summer of industrial unrest.
Labour unrest could prove a stumbling block to the two-party coalition's
pledge to lift the restrictive union laws inherited after the 1980 military
coup.
The budget is already under pressure, and the cabinet appears divided
whether to meet its promises or stick to its inflation targets and risk
alienating a key political constituency for both the conservative True Path
Party and the Social Democratic Populists.
Last weekend, Mrs Tansu Ciller, chief economics minister, revived her plan
for wage indexation, linking wage increases to the inflation rate, which is
running at 70 per cent. Union leaders quickly rejected the plan. 'She's
trying to put a freeze on wages,' says Mr Sevket Yilmaz, head of Turk-Is,
the main union confederation.
Mrs Ciller criticised the recent award to civil servants, a 30 per cent
increase over six months which is estimated to add a third to the
government's budget deficit. The recent award for the 500,000 civil servants
is estimated to have cost the treasury an additional TL9,000bn (Dollars
1.3bn), compared with a targeted budget deficit of TL32,000bn. Agricultural
workers were awarded an 86 per cent wage rise. It is unclear how the
government proposes to finance the increase.
The unions' case is that wages fell badly behind during the 1980s. The
average daily wage is around Dollars 3 in state industries. Unions are
trying to extend the social security net to compensate for low wages.
Mr Yilmaz says he has the support of Mr Mehmet Mogultay, the SHP labour
minister,
who has proposed a job security bill requiring an employer to seek court
approval before he can make people redundant. This could disrupt the
government's privatisation programme. Turkey plans to raise TL5,500bn
through sales of state assets in 1992. Bids were submitted last week for 11
state cement companies, a sale expected to raise Dollars 350-Dollars 400m.
Freedom to restructure the labour force is an important incentive for the
many foreign concerns showing interest in Turkey's state asset sales.
Overmanning is seen as the main reason for the losses of the 220 state
enterprises, which in 1991 came to an estimated TL13,000bn.

FT  29 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Spirits sector active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN the big spirits distilling companies showed a mixed performance,
with Guinness reacting most favourably to news that the European Community
intends to leave current rates of excise duty unchanged. Guinness jumped 21
to 534p, but Grand Metropolitan gained only a penny to 415p in spite of
hefty turnover of 6.8m shares, while Allied-Lyons lost ground.
Mr John Wakely, drinks analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the decision to
freeze excise taxes at a lower rate for southern Europe than generally
applies in the north will have very important implications over the next few
years. Duty in southern Europe is little more than the equivalent of Pounds
1 per standard bottle, compared with about Pounds 5 per bottle in Britain.
From the beginning of next year, UK consumers will be able to import from
the Continent substantially higher amounts of beer, wine and spirits, and Mr
Wakely believes that if the UK authorities wish to maintain a reasonable
level of sales 'in the long run they will have to cut excise duties'. Such a
development is likely to boost sales of spirits in the UK.
MMC rules
Allied-Lyons finished well above the day's low, helped by the European
Community ruling on excise taxes, to leave just a net decline of 3 at 602p
on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's (MMC) recommendation that
Allied's proposed brewing deal with Carlsberg should not go ahead in its
present form.
The shares fell to 592p on disappointment with the decision of the MMC -
which had generally been expected to approve the deal - as the ruling argued
that there were several reasons why the joint lager brewing agreement 'may
be expected to work against the public interest unless modifications are
made'.
Before the MMC announcement, Allied shares had been boosted by a buy
recommendation from County NatWest. Business was brisk, with 4.1m shares
changing hands during the day.
Generators upset
The two English and Welsh power generation companies, PowerGen and National
Power, were respectively the day's second and third worst performers in the
Footsie list amid fears that they may face a referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The referral worries emerged after news that Offer, the electricity industry
watchdog, has requested an explanation from the generators as to why
electricity prices have risen so sharply since May.
PowerGen fell 11, or 4.3 per cent, to 245p on heavy turnover of 5.2m shares,
while National Power retreated 10, or 4.1 per cent, to 232p on 8.1m traded.
Specialists were surprised at the market's strong response to the news,
saying it was too early to gauge whether the generators' reply would be
sufficient to head off the likelihood of an investigation into electricity
prices. 'But the market has obviously taken fright at the uncertainty,' said
one analyst.
New BAe setback
The long-running story that the European Commission may yet require British
Aerospace (BAe)to repay alleged illegal state aid, or 'sweeteners', paid by
the UK government to the group when it took over the Rover Group triggered a
slide in BAe shares.
The day's weakest individual performer among the Footsie's constituents, the
stock closed a net 10 lower at 180p, or some 5.3 per cent down, having been
as low as 178p. Turnover was 3.3m shares. BAe is alleged to have received
around Pounds 45m when it acquired Rover in 1988.
Mirror Group Newspapers encountered its first sustained bout of selling
pressure since the relisting a week last Friday. The shares, which were
requoted around the 50p mark, faltered at the outset yesterday and retreated
from an opening 74p to touch 67p before stabilising and ending another busy
session only a fraction easier at 73p. Turnover reached 5.2m.
Reuters, badly mauled over the past couple of weeks, staged a strong rally,
with bear-closing said to have been a big factor in pushing the shares up 42
to 1027p.
A series of savage profits downgrades caused Kwik-Fit, the tyres and exhaust
replacement company, to plunge 44 to 125p, the day's steepest individual
decline on the London stock market.
The drop in the share price was accompanied by some exceptionally heavy
activity in the stock, with some 4m shares changing hands.
The company's joint brokers were among those houses downgrading. Panmure
Gordon was said to have chopped its current-year profits forecast from
Pounds 36m to Pounds 23m and that for next year from Pounds 40m to Pounds
30m. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was thought to have lopped Pounds 11m from this
year's estimate to Pounds 24m, and Pounds 12m to Pounds 28m for the
following year.
A block of 7.7m Pilkington shares were traded at 78p - well below the ruling
price of 89p - minutes before the official close. The deal was thought to
have been a bed and breakfast (or tax-related) deal.
British Gas, up 4 at 245p, benefited from a series of sizeable switches from
the power generators.
Diploma fell 11 to 268p as a profits downgrade from Smith New Court
coincided with a hefty selling order from another top UK broking firm.
A large line of stock in BOC sent the shares down 10 to 614p. Fibre maker
British Vita suffered in similar circumstances as dealers reported
difficulties in placing a line of 400,000 shares. The stock finished 4 down
at 240p on turnover of 1.2m. A Pounds 15.8m one-for-10 rights issue from ML
Laboratories left the drugs group 28 adrift at 735p.
Continuing positive noises from the tour operators that summer bookings were
picking up and discounting going down lifted selected holiday stocks.
Property and leisure group Ladbroke benefited from positive notes from
County NatWest and SG Warburg, the former advising a buy on secure dividend
consideration. The shares rose 6 to 177p. Market sentiment also helped Thorn
EMI, 15 ahead at 732p, and Granada, 12 up at 245p.

FT  29 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical rally boosts share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market enjoyed a widely expected rally yesterday, rising
sharply in the second half of the session in spite of the predictedly
bearish survey of opinion from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
The driving force came from an early gain in the new Wall Street session.
Trading volume in London equities was not large enough to imply a convincing
change in the investment mood.
Equities opened firmly behind more stable performances in Tokyo and New
York. Traders were poised for a rally in a London market which had fallen by
more than 4 per cent in the previous trading account. Shares in Wellcome
stabilised as the Pounds 2.16bn share sale was absorbed. Dealers sensed that
some bear positions had been left open in blue chip shares which had been
sold to raise cash for the new Wellcome stock.
More significant, however, was the squeeze on marketmakers' books after the
prolonged selling bout. Traders seeking stock to meet previous selling
orders in such recent losers as Thorn EMI, Reuters and BAT Industries found
prices moving up ahead of them.
However, lack of genuine investment demand left the Footsie struggling to
hold its early gain of around 15 points. The CBI quarterly survey,
confirming that the economic recovery expected in April had 'failed to
materialise', had been so widely discounted that it had little effect one
way or the other.
The final impetus for London came when Wall Street, discounting its own bad
news in the shape of a heavy fall in the US consumer confidence index,
opened strongly, gaining nearly 30 Dow points during UK trading hours. The
UK market was quick to follow other European bourses in responding to Wall
Street.
A determined buyer for the September contract on the FT-SE Index in the
stock index futures market lit the fuse under the underlying blue chip
stocks. The FT-SE Index rose sharply and closed, just under the day's best,
at 2,373.4 for a gain of 25.4.
The day's Seaq trading total of 446m shares was not particularly exciting,
even by recent standards; Monday's Seaq total of 564.4m, worth Pounds 1.3bn
in terms of retail business, was swollen by trading in the 270m new Wellcome
shares.
One of the more genuinely firm sectors was the distillery industry, which
took a highly favourable view of the European Community agreement on a
package of binding excise duties which, in the view of City analysts, might
presage a curb on further increases in spirits duties in the UK and other
producer countries. Guinness, with major whisky interests, led the way
forward.
ICI, the market bellwether stock, which announces trading results tomorrow,
benefited from recommendation by a leading UK investment bank.
However, market strategists maintained that yesterday's rally was no more
than a technical bounce in a badly shaken stock market. Traders continued to
doubt whether either the stock market or the UK economy is ready to mount a
sustained recovery at this stage.

FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises on Chrysler results
and lower yields
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
IN SPITE OF more bad economic news, US equities posted their second best
performance of the year yesterday in the wake of a sharp decline in
long-term bond yields and strong second quarter earnings from Chrysler,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 51.87 up at 3,334.07, the best
one-day gain since January 14 and the second largest of the year. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 5.98 to 417.52, while the American SE
composite put on 2.49 to 384.55 and the Nasdaq composite appreciated 6.90 to
571.63. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly heavy at 218m shares, while
rises outpaced declines by more than three-to-one.
Stability on foreign markets set the tone for a solid start to trading, but
the buying did not really gather momentum until mid-morning when bond yields
plummeted on news of a fall in the Conference Board's latest index of
consumer confidence.
Although the confidence figures were bad in economic terms, equity investors
were cheered by one of the biggest one-day falls in long-term interest rates
this year - a decline that should stimulate activity in the housing market
over the coming months.
Technical factors also came into play when the Dow burst above the 3,300
mark, which has been a short-term ceiling for the average recently. After
that, computer program buying then kicked in, pushing prices even higher and
luring back to the market those investors who have stayed on the sidelines
during the recent losses.
Better than expected second quarter earnings from Chrysler also lifted
sentiment. The stock climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 21 3/4 in turnover of
6.1m shares in response to net income of Dollars 178m, a substantial
turnround from the Dollars 212m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago.
The two other big car manufacturing issues rose sharply on the Chrysler
news: General Motors moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 and Ford
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 , both in active trading.
Telmex, the Mexican telephone monopoly, jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 46
1/4 in turnover of 3.7m shares after revealing pleasing first-half results.
Tenneco added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 39 1/4 in heavy trading after the oil
group announced second quarter net income from continuing operations of 71
cents a share, a reversal of the loss of a year ago.
The Nasdaq market was led higher by hi-tech blue chips such as Apple, up
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 46 1/2 .
Everex Systems fell Dollars  15/16 to Dollars 2 1/4 after warning that it
would make a loss in its fiscal fourth quarter because of soft sales and
weakening margins in the price-competitive personal computer industry.
Canada
TORONTO posted a modest gain in continued moderate trading. The TSE 300
index finished 15.1 firmer at 3,411.5 and advances held a slim 256-to-237
lead over falls after volume of 23.1m shares valued at CDollars 258.1m.

Trading was a busy 119.4m shares. Telmex L shares jumped 7.1 per cent on

by more than 25 per cent since the company announced its Spanish cement
acquisitions earlier in the month, rose 6.5 per cent in heavy trading.
Televisa, reporting earnings up 62 per cent in the first quarter, gained 7.6

FT  29 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash trades quietly

STERLING cash rates were mostly unchanged in quiet trading, following the
forecast of a small Pounds 500m shortage by the Bank of England.
The overnight rate came down to 7 1/2 per cent after the market took out
most of the Pounds 500m shortfall by lunchtime. In the morning, the Bank
purchased Pounds 400m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The forecast
was later revised to Pounds 550m, and the Bank bought Pounds 150m of Band 1
bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent.
This straightforward trading softened period rates at the short end.
One-week money closed at 10 per cent, down from 10 1/8 per cent, one-month
was at 10 1/8 per cent from 10 3/16 per cent, and three-month off  1/16 at
10 1/4 per cent. However, dealers saw no fundamental factors softening rates
and still found plenty of reasons to be bearish about a base rate cut.
There is still the fear of a Lombard rate rise, and eyes are firmly fixed on
August 6, the date of the next Bundesbank council meeting. Sterling's slide
yesterday to 2.57 percentage points below its nearest competitor in the
European exchange rate mechanism, the Italian lira, was also depressing.
Yesterday's CBI quarterly survey underlined the view that economic recovery
is a long way off, and only made the atmosphere gloomier. But it had little
effect on the market, having been substantially discounted after its
contents were leaked at the weekend.
Futures trading was more subdued, closely tracking sterling's fall on the
foreign exchanges. The September short sterling contract dipped 6 basis
points from its opening of 89.73, but picked up to close at 89.69. Dealers
said a futures broker had bought 500 lots at 89.68 and, on a day when volume
reached only about 12,000 lots, this had had a substantial effect on the
market.
In the German interbank money market, dealers reported continuing tension as
German call money held close to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Banks quoted
call money within a broad range of 9.65 to 9.75 per cent, but said most
trade was at 9.70-9.75 per cent. Liquidity levels were not high, and some
dealers were concerned that pension fund payments due today would drain
funds from the market.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar at post-intervention low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dipped to its lowest point against the D-Mark since last week's
central bank intervention, after figures showed that US consumer confidence
had fallen sharply in July, writes James Blitz.
The US consumer confidence index dropped to 61.0 this month from a revised
72.6 in June, while the market had expected it to decline to 69.5. That news
triggered a new wave of dollar selling, with the currency weakening to a low
of DM1.4690.
With the dollar on its lows, the market was beset with rumours that the
Federal Reserve was intervening in the market, buying the currency at
DM1.4700. The rumour boosted the US unit by more than a pfennig within
several minutes. Later, when it proved to be unfounded, the dollar slipped
again to close in Europe nearly a pfennig down on the day at DM1.4740. At
the end of New York trading it was slightly lower at DM1.4730.
The see-saw dollar/D-Mark trading showed how fearful the market is about
intervention. Many analysts are convinced that the US currency will not test
the all-time low again. Traders said they expect these fears to fade with
time. The next key US indicator is tomorrow's figure for GDP growth in the
second quarter. The forecast is for an annualised drop to 1.7 per cent from
the first quarter's 2.7 per cent.
The yen remained weak against the D-Mark, following the Bank of Japan's
half-point reduction in the official discount rate on Monday to 3.25 per
cent. Traders said the Japanese currency continued to be undermined by the
fragile state of the Tokyo stock market, and a new round of allegations
about corruption in the ruling party. The yen finished against the D-Mark at
Y86.53 from a previous close of Y86.00. Against the dollar, the yen was
marginally firmer, at Y127.60, from a previous Y127.70, while in New York it
improved further to close at Y127.40.
Sterling firmed against the D-Mark in the morning, but retreated in the
afternoon in the wake of the dollar's weakness. A gloomy quarterly report
from the Confederation of British Industry on UK industrial trends had
little effect on the pound, as its contents had been well leaked in the UK
press over the weekend. However, the report, which said that manufacturing
output would continue to fall over the next four months and that more jobs
will be cut, darkened the economic gloom around sterling.
The pound closed unchanged at DM2.8425. But the gap between sterling and the
next weakest currency in the EMS grid, the Italian lira, widened to 2.57
percentage points on a scale measuring the currencies' strengths against the
ecu. The lira was unchanged against the D-Mark at L756.2.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New perspectives for Algerian
gas - Francis Ghiles explains how capacity may yet rise to meet demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSH of international oil companies signing exploration deals with
Sonatrach could not have come at a better time for Algeria's state
hydrocarbons monopoly. So high is the chance of any company finding gas
rather than oil that it was only recently, when exploration terms for gas
were improved to an acceptable level, that major oil companies decided the
risk was worth taking.
Sonatrach is faced with demands for gas beyond its present capacity. In the
words of a senior Sonatrach executive: 'We are sold out, but people are
asking for more'.
The new hydrocarbons law passed last December was the personal achievement
of Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the former Minister of Energy, who has now left
the government. The exploration companies, which have yet to spend any money
as a result of their new licences, will no doubt want to be reassured that
Mr Laoussine's policies will be endorsed by Mr Hassan Mufti, the recently
appointed minister of energy, and by Mr Belaid Abdesslam, the new prime
minister.
Nor is the political uncertainty limited to cabinet level. The blowing up of
the telephone cable linking the eastern town of Constantine to Algeria's
second most important oil and gas terminal at Skikda could be an ominous
event for the country's energy revenues. The damaging of gas pipelines and
facilities by Islamic dissidents would be significantly more costly.
Over the past 12 months Sonatrach has signed exploration agreements with
Occidental Petroleum, Total, Arco, Mobil, BP and Phillips Petroleum. Apart
from the political factor - and this is the big conditional - nearly
everything else about Algeria is attractive.
Conditions have changed for the better on two fronts simultaneously.
Algerian terms for exploration have become more rewarding for gas and
external demand for Algerian gas has grown beyond Sonatrach's current
ability to supply it. Companies searching for oil and finding gas now have a
realistic chance of getting a return on their exploration investment. As a
result some companies might be willing specifically to look for gas.
Another dimension of the new law is that it creates investment opportunities
for foreign companies able to enhance production from Algeria's existing oil
and gas fields. Rates of recovery had fallen below 20 per cent because
Sonatrach lacked the same degree of international experience gained by
global operators. Like many countries in the 1970s Algeria's drive to assert
its own sovereignty over all oil and gas production excluded it from the
advanced technology that less closed third world countries such as Indonesia
were able to enjoy.
Since the departure of the hardline Mr Belkacem Nabi, successive Algerian
oil ministers have increasingly recognised the mutual benefit to be gained
from working together with international oil companies and sharing the
benefits of their combined resources.
Sonatrach is also lucky in one other respect. Mr James Ball, director of Gas
Matters, points out that in a world where greenfield liquefied natural gas
projects cost Dollars 4bn for a couple of trains of LNG able to produce 5bn
cubic metres of gas a year, the prospect of increasing capacity by 10bn cu m
a year for half this outlay 'must be as frightening to competitors as it is
comforting to potential customers'.
Through a renovation and upgrading project being carried out by the same
three companies that built the LNG plants in the late 1960s and 1970s, MW
Kellogg and Bechtel of the US and Sofregaz of France will increase capacity
at LNG plants in Arzew and Skikda from 19bn cu m to 32bn cu m a year.
Meanwhile, the capacity of the nine-year-old trans-Mediterranean pipeline
which bring gas to the Italian mainland through Tunisia and the Straits of
Sicily is being doubled. After the work is completed in 1995, Sonatrach is
set to double its exports to Italy to 26bn cu m a year by the turn of the
century. Further sales to traditional Italian clients such as Snam, the
state gas pipeline company, and the more recent customer Enel, the state
electricity generating authority, could push the figure up to 30bn cu m a
year by the year 2000.
Italy is the most exciting but not the only market. Agreements have already
been signed to supply LNG to Turkey and Greece, while newcomers such as
Portugal and Germany have expressed interest in buying Algerian gas. The
collapse of the US market for LNG will free some extra supply for such
customers and potential central European buyers.
Exports to Spain are also set to increase and supplies are to reach Morocco
for the first time. Spain, a long established buyer of Algerian LNG,
recently committed itself to continuing imports at the current level once
the gas pipeline scheduled to be built through Morocco and across the
Straits of Gibraltar is completed. It is to supply Spain with 6bn-7bn cu m a
year from 1997. The dramatic rise in Spain's gas requirement is largely
driven by a policy decision to freeze the nuclear programme in favour of
gas-fired power. A further 1bn cu m will be bought by Morocco.
In addition to traditional oil and gas sales, a significant number of
spin-offs have produced new joint venture opportunities.
One of the first such ventures, formed after the shift in Algerian
investment policy began, was that between L'Air Liquide, Air Products and
Sonatrach to extract helium from the gas stream going into the LNG plants.
A much larger joint venture is the expansion of liquid petroleum gas export
facilities at Arzew. It encompasses the expansion of the existing 'Jumbo'
LPG plant and the increasing of production as a result of an upstream field
enhancement project in which Total is playing a key role.
The political uncertainty which besets Algeria today comes at a most
inopportune time for its gas industry. Its major competitor in European gas
markets was the Soviet Union, which in its new fragmented state, is not the
most reassuring and attractive prospect to western buyers.
It is beset by political and commercial problems that could raise far
greater obstacles than those faced and threatened in Algeria. Europe's other
major gas suppliers, Norway and the Netherlands, are not aggressively
selling. The only impediment to Algeria climbing through the window of
opportunity would now appear to be one of Algerian making.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries rise on consumer report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday on news of a July
consumer confidence report that was much weaker than expected.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 1/32 at 106
23/32 , to yield 7.427 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up
1/16 at 101 7/16 , yielding 4.194 per cent.
The news that sparked the buying was the Conference Board's consumer
confidence index for July, which fell to 61.0 from 72.6 in June. Most
analysts had been expecting a slight decline in the index. Most of the
activity was concentrated at the long end of the market, which in recent
weeks has lagged behind shorter-dated maturities. However, in the past few
days, the long bond has bounced back and is favoured by investors.
The short end of the market was held back by the auction of Dollars 15bn in
two-year notes. The sale was completed successfully at an average yield of
4.29 per cent, the lowest recorded at a two-year auction.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied, driven by good domestic demand as
investors continued to pin their hopes on lower interest rates.
In spite of the half percentage point cut in the Official Discount Rate to
3.25 per cent on Monday, dealers said that market participants expected the
weak state of the Japanese economy to prompt a further cut in interest rates
within the next few months.
The benchmark No 129, which opened with a yield of 4.965 per cent, climbed
steadily to yield 4.90 per cent by the close of trading in Tokyo. The
September futures ended at 104.87, against its close of 104.49 on Monday.
Money market rates continued to edge lower with the call rate slipping from
4 1/8 per cent to 4 3/32 per cent, while three-month certificates of deposit
traded at 4.03 per cent, against 4.04 per cent on Monday.
SPANISH government bonds rallied on foreign and domestic buying, partly due
to concern that there may be little interest in this week's auction of debt.
Dealers warned that the recent large decline in Spanish government bond
prices could deter investors from bidding at the regular auction of three,
five and 10-year paper.
'People are expecting a deserted auction - if investors don't participate in
the auction, there may not be the usual amount of supply and this fear of a
shortage of new supply has helped to push up bond prices temporarily,' said
one dealer.
The yield on 10-year bonds fell from 12.18 per cent to 12.05 per cent, while
five-year bonds saw a fall in yield from 13.01 per cent to 12.87 per cent.
GERMANY'S government bond market drifted lower in light trading as dealers
warned that the market was waiting for news from the Bundesbank council
meeting in early August.
The favourable inflation figures released yesterday fell within the market's
expectations and had little impact on bund prices. Western German consumer
prices were increased by 3.3 per cent year-on-year, according to preliminary
figures. The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from its opening of 87.47
to trade at 87.33 by late afternoon.
UK government bonds closed slightly weaker as dealers warned that funding
concerns were troubling the gilt market again. The Bank of England was
expected to announce preliminary details of its next gilt auction shortly.
The 9 per cent Treasury loan due 2008 traded at 100 3/4 , down  1/16 from
Monday to yield 8.90 per cent. Among shorter-dated gilts, the 10 per cent
gilt due 1996 ended at 102 1/8 , down  3/32 .

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF leaves Loral as sole
buyer of LTV unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group,
yesterday pulled out of a planned deal to buy a stake in the missiles
division of LTV of the US.
Loral, a New York-based defence electronics manufacturer which last week
announced plans to buy the LTV missiles unit with Thomson as a minority
partner, said yesterday it planned to go ahead with the purchase on its own
at a price of not more than Dollars 240m.
Thomson had originally planned to acquire the whole missiles division from
LTV, with Carlyle Group, a Washington DC investment bank, taking the
aircraft unit.
The French group had to back down in the face of a hostile reception in the
US Congress and defence department, and a restructured deal was announced
last week in which Loral would take control of the division with Thomson
taking a minority stake.
Thomson yesterday refused to comment on its withdrawal, except to say it
regarded its original deal with LTV, which is under the supervision of a
bankruptcy court, as 'having been terminated'.
Loral, however, said it had been unable to satisfy Thomson's demands for a
greater participation, including a seat on the board. It added that it
expected the deal to boost its earnings by 40 cents a share.
Thomson's hopes of entering the US missiles market through the purchase ran
into the opposition of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two leading US defence
companies, which together had hoped to buy the LTV operations.
In repeated congressional hearings Thomson was lambasted as the tool of a
sinister French conspiracy to take over the world defence industry. Senators
complained that US defence secrets would be siphoned overseas, and US
defence companies damaged by unfair competition from a state-owned rival.
The initial Thomson offer was withdrawn when it became plain that it would
be rejected by the committee on foreign investment in the US, a body chaired
by the US Treasury which rules on foreign acquisitions of companies in
sensitive technology areas.

red

<TEXT>
LTV, the US steel group which has been operating for five years under the
protection of bankruptcy courts, yesterday reported a sharp rise in
second-quarter net income, thanks to a gain from the sale of a business. But
its core steel operations remained mired in red ink.
LTV's income was Dollars 138.6m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars
13.4m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. However, this was due to
a Dollars 150m net gain on the sale of its AM General vehicle manufacturing
business; without this it would have lost Dollars 11.4m. Sales totalled
Dollars 1.53bn, down from Dollars 1.56bn.
The company said the results mainly reflected lower quarter-to-quarter steel
selling prices and a decline in aerospace and defence operating income due
to the AM sale, partly offset by higher missiles division sales and a higher
volume of steel shipments.
The steel division had an operating loss of Dollars 28.4m, compared with
Dollars 23.4m in the same period of last year. Sales rose 7 per cent to
Dollars 947m, and shipments were 8 per cent ahead at 1.88m tons.
The company said the loss was due to lower selling prices and higher
employment costs, mainly from a new union contract.
'Shipments are up, purchased materials costs are down and operating costs
have been reduced,' said Mr David Hoag, LTV's chairman. 'But these gains are
not sufficient to offset persistently low prices which continue to impede
the company's financial performance.'
The group's aerospace and defence business reported income of Dollars 22.4m,
down from Dollars 37.4m, while energy products lost Dollars 2.9m, up from
Dollars 2.5m.
For the six months LTV reported net income of Dollars 95.3m, or 62 cents a
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 32.9m, or 39 cents, while sales
dipped from Dollars 2.99bn to Dollars 2.92bn.
Loral yesterday reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 29m, or 85
cents a share, against Dollars 22.4m, or 83 cents a year earlier, Karen
Zagor reports from New York. Sales were slightly higher, at Dollars 681m
compared with Dollars 677m.
Operating income for the three months to June 31 rose 7 per cent to Dollars
68.8m from Dollars 64.1m. Bookings stood at Dollars 502m in the latest
quarter against Dollars 492m last year, while Loral's backlog slipped 5 per
cent to Dollars 2.73bn from Dollars 2.88bn.
Mr Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said the company
expected 'income, bookings, sales and margins to accelerate as the year
progresses, with double digit per share earnings increase for the year,
without acquisitions'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRISK sales of beer and soft drinks helped two leading Japanese brewers,
Asahi and Sapporo, lift unconsolidated sales for the six months to June.
However, the companies reported lower pre-tax profits due to a fall in
interest on investments.
While Japanese brewers are known for introducing new products and bright
packaging, Asahi, which launched 'dry beer' in 1987, said focusing on
traditional labels had helped beer sales rise 6.6 per cent to Y294.4bn
(Dollars 2.35bn). Sapporo's beer sales meanwhile rose 2 per cent to
Y222.3bn.
Asahi's operating profits rose 3.1 times to Y18.3bn and Sapporo's 2.4 times
to Y7.3bn, thanks to rationalisation of their operations. However, a fall in
interest received from bank deposits squeezed profits at the pre-tax level.
In the 1980s many Japanese corporations generated profits by issuing
commercial paper, and investing the funds in deposits and the money markets.
However, companies now face difficulties in gaining profits from such
transactions, as interest rates fall and Japanese banks are reluctant to
underwrite commercial paper.
Meanwhile, losses on securities holdings, following the Tokyo market's
slide, totalled Y29.7bn at Asahi and Y10bn at Sapporo.
Asahi's non-operating profits fell 61.5 per cent and Sapporo's by 67.6 per
cent.
For 1992 Asahi expects pre-tax profits to fall 11.2 per cent to Y15.5bn on a
6.2 per cent rise in sales to Y785bn, while Sapporo forecasts a 6.2 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Y8.5bn on a 4.1 per cent rise in sales to
Y555bn.
Asahi Breweries yesterday announced that Mr Yuzo Seto, vice-president,
becomes president from September 1, succeeding Mr Yotaro Higuchi who takes
over as chairman.

DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, reduced operating losses in the second
quarter, but after special restructuring charges it reported a final loss of
CDollars 72.6m (Dollars 60.5m) or 92 cents a share against a loss of
CDollars 31.3m or 47 cents a year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 549m against CDollars 557m. Before the special items
totalling 81 cents a share after tax, the operating net loss equalled 11
cents a share against 31 cents.
The domestic market for flat rolled steel remained weak, Dofasco said and
imports are running abnormally high. It expected markets to remain
competitive with heavy pressure on prices.
However, shipments were up sharply from the depressed first quarter, mostly
due to offshore exports, and were also higher than a year earlier.
The first-half loss was CDollars 96.9m or CDollars 1.23 a share, including
the special charges, against a loss of CDollars 26.8m or 40 cents a share a
year earli - er. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1bn.
Dofasco is completing a broad cost reduction programme. A limestone product
unit is being sold to Calic-therm of the Netherlands.
The company has dropped common share dividends to conserve cash, but

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: More bids likely for New York

NEW bidders are likely to emerge in coming weeks in the battle for the New
York Daily News, according to a key lieutenant of Daily Telegraph proprietor
Mr Conrad Black, who has made an offer for the ailing paper once owned by Mr
Robert Maxwell.
Mr David Radler, who heads Mr Black's North American operations, said he
does not expect the ownership of the Daily News to be resolved before
September. Mr Radler said that, in his opinion, another 'crisis' would be
needed before the paper's 12 trade unions were willing to throw their
support behind one of the bids.
The Daily News has operated under bankruptcy court protection since
December. The court recently extended until the end of this month the
deadline for the paper to file a reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of the
US Bankruptcy Code.
Only Mr Black and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of US News &amp; World
Report, have so far emerged as serious contenders for the Daily News. Mr
Radler declined to be drawn on which other parties may join the bidding.
Mr Radler, president of Hollinger, the Daily Telegraph's parent, predicted
his group has a 'slightly better than 50-50' chance of winning. He claimed
'we're the only ones who can demonstrate that we have the equity' for what
is expected to be a USDollars 300m deal.
Hollinger has no short-term debt at present and Mr Radler is confident it
can raise as much as CDollars 500m (USDollars 416.6m) from its banks. Should
Hollinger take control of the Daily News, Mr Radler said the paper's
publisher Mr James Willse would stay on, but that he and Mr Black were
likely to oversee the operation. Mr Radler said Hollinger had drawn on the
Daily Telegraph's resources in its bid for the Daily News.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday said at least 32,000 people would
take part in its voluntary workforce reduction programmes this year, above
its earlier estimates of about 20,000 job cuts, increasing the cost of the
programmes by about Dollars 1.2bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
IBM, which last year reported its first annual loss of Dollars 2.8bn after
charges on sales of Dollars 64.8bn, said it would recoup these costs over
the next 18 months through ongoing savings.
The company also indicated that changes were afoot at its personal computer
division. In response to reports that its PC business would be turned into a
wholly-owned subsidiary, IBM said it had been working to sharpen the focus
of its PC operations since December, 'and you will continue to see us
change'.
IBM would not comment about specific changes, but it has been working
towards increasing the autonomy and accountability of its business units
since December when it announced a broad restructuring of its worldwide
operations.

ASAHI GLASS, Japan's leading glassmaker, yesterday disclosed a one-third
fall in interim pre-tax profits to Y22.7bn (Dollars 181.6m) from Y33.9bn,
and revised sharply downward its forecasts for the full year.
In a gloomy commentary accompanying the results, it said a decline in
consumer spending and a tighter rein on capital investment by manufacturers,
meant 'the Japanese economy began to take on aspects of a business
recession'.
Citing a production slowdown in the automotive industry and dull domestic
demand for television sets, two main markets the company supplies, it said
circumstances were 'harsh' and the outlook 'does not allow much room for
optimism.'
Asahi Glass is projecting pre-tax profits of Y48bn for 1992 as a whole, down
20.3 per cent from the previous year. Until yesterday it had been
forecasting a modest 2.9 per cent rise to Y62bn.
Sales for the first half to June dipped 2.2 per cent to Y487.6bn but are
expected by the company to edge 0.8 per cent ahead to reach Y1,030bn for the
full year. The previous forecast was for Y1,060bn in revenues.
Glass and construction materials, which account for half its total business,
showed sluggish sales except for energy-saving products and those with high
safety or design specifications.'
The company benefited from a 6.3 per cent rise in non-operating income to
Y14.6bn and a 15.4 per cent drop in its interest bill to Y3.6bn.
As planned, the interim dividend of Y5 a share includes a Y0.5 payment to
commemorate its 85th anniversary. It is being paid from net earnings per
share of Y10.49, down from Y17.14 last time when the payout was Y4.5.

STRONG JUNE sales were behind a small improvement in second-quarter profits
at Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, agencies report from
Rochester.
Net income amounted to Dollars 361m or Dollars 1.11 a share, against Dollars
357m or Dollars 1.10 in the same period last year.
This brought net income for the first half to Dollars 506m or Dollars 1.56 a
share, against Dollars 535m or Dollars 1.65 a year earlier.
Fully diluted earnings per share were Dollars 1.51 against Dollars 1.64 for
the half-year and Dollars 1.06 against Dollars 1.09 for the latest quarter.
First-half sales totalled Dollars 975bn against Dollars 9.52bn last year
with the second quarter generating Dollars 5.27bn, compared with Dollars
5.03bn the same period a year earlier.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said: 'The results we delivered for the first
half were consistent with our 1992 operating plan and this gives us
confidence that the year as a whole will deliver what we expect: moderately
higher sales and good gains in earnings,'.

PLACER Pacific, the Austra-lian gold mining group, yesterday said net
earnings for the half year to June were ADollars 34m (USDollars 25.3m)
compared with ADollars 24m in the year-earlier period. It said all the main
mines it has an interest in met production targets.
Placer, which is 75.8 per cent owned by Placer Dome of Canada, said
production from the five top mines climbed to 1.19m oz, of which its share
totalled more than 520,000 oz.
The average price fell to ADollars 505 per oz from ADollars 524 in the same
period last year. Tight controls cut production costs to ADollars 216 an oz
from ADollars 258. Newcrest Mining, another Australian gold miner, said
higher metal prices and productivity helped it recover from a poor first
quarter, although net profits for the June half were down 9 per cent to
ADollars 23m. The second quarter contributed ADollars 13m.
Sales revenue for the half was ADollars 200m against ADollars 192m. Gold
production was 13.1 per cent higher at 371,082 oz. Costs per oz sold were
lower at ADollars 379, down from ADollars 382.

<TEXT>
THE European Community is poised to tap the international syndicated loans
market for the first time in nearly a decade with a three-year Ecu500m
(Dollars 675m) facility. The proceeds will finance imports of agricultural
and medical products by the republics which formerly made up the Soviet
Union.
The EC is expected to award the mandate to a European bank this week.
Deutsche Bank and National Westminster Bank are among those which have bid
for the position of lead manager, although Banque Nationale de Paris and
Societe Generale have been mentioned as contenders.
The EC traditionally prefers to borrow in the international bond markets -
where it can fund at below the London interbank offered rate (Libor) -
rather than the international syndicated loans market where pricing is much
higher.
An EC official stressed that in the case of funding exports to former Soviet
republics, the EC had chosen a syndicated loan 'because it gives us
flexibility to choose the date of drawing the funds. In this case we will
need a lengthy draw-down period which would be difficult to arrange with a
bond where we would have to take the funds and then be exposed to an
interest rate risk.'
The EC last tapped the international syndicated loans market in 1983 with a
Dollars 1.24bn term loan.

   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Allianz, Germany's largest insurance group, fell 3 per cent
yesterday after the Munich-based group reported flat net profits for last
year and its first loss on its mainstream underwriting business.
Group net profits rose 4 per cent to DM1.05bn (Pounds 360m) on premium
income up 27 per cent to DM48.7bn. The underwriting result - the net of
premium income and claims paid before investment income - fell from a profit
of DM182m in 1990 to a loss of DM1.78bn.
Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive, explained that the poor
underwriting performance was due to losses at Fireman's Fund, the large US
insurance company bought in 1990, and at Deutsche Versicherungs, the former
east German state insurance monopoly acquired for DM711m.
Another factor was the poor state of world insurance markets.
Mr Schulte-Noelle predicted that conditions would not improve substantially
during the current year. Premium income would rise to more than DM50bn, he
said, but underwriting profits would be hit by poor claims experience and
the effect of intense competition on premium income.
Deutsche Versicherungs and Fireman's Fund were consolidated for the first
time last year. This helped to boost group turnover but both made
underwriting losses of DM625m.
The underwriting figures were offset by a near-doubling in other income to
DM3.56bn, The main factors behind this were a DM929m contribution from
Fireman's Fund and extraordinary income of DM484m arising from the
restructuring of interests in Austria.
The shares fell by DM62 to close at DM1955.
The dividend is to be maintained at DM13.50 per share.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chrysler shares rise as profits
return
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Chrysler, the US car manufacturer, rose sharply yesterday morning
when the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results and
a return to profitability.
General Motors and Ford also saw their stock rise as Chrysler, the smallest
of the three and the first to announce second-quarter figures, made
optimistic noises about the industry's outlook.
The US sector has spent much of the past two years covered in red ink, due
to the recession which slashed demand for cars at a time when growing
Japanese manufacturing in the US greatly increased supplies of vehicles. The
result was a price war. However, 1992 has produced a slow recovery in
demand.
Chrysler reported net earnings of Dollars 178m, or 54 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 212m, or 95 cents, in the same period of
last year.
Wall Street expectations had been pitched at around 21 cents a share. Sales
and revenues totalled Dollars 9.31bn, up 19.2 per cent from the Dollars
7.81bn of last year.
Chrysler shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 21 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively traded issue.
The company, which has been financially stretched for the past few years, is
in the middle of a series of crucial launches of new models. The most
important is the LH series of mid-sized saloons, due to be rolled out during
the autumn, which has won enthusiastic reviews from the motoring press.
Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman, attributed the good second-quarter figures to
particularly strong sales of mini-vans, where Chrysler is the market leader,
as well as trucks and jeeps.
These are all relatively high margin products. There was also a better ratio
between retail sales and purchases by fleet customers, where margins are
generally extremely thin.
Mr Iacocca said the economy seemed to be improving and the car market was
getting stronger, despite mixed economic indicators. The chairman,
celebrated for his salesman's patter, said: 'I couldn't be more pleased with
the direction the company is taking.'
For the six months the group reported net earnings of Dollars 165m, or 46
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 17.5bn, compared with losses of Dollars
810m, or Dollars 3.61 a share, on sales of Dollars 13.66bn in 1991.

CADBURY SCHWEPPES, the South African subsidiary of the UK confectionery,
food and soft drinks group, overcame difficult trading conditions to achieve
a 29 per cent increase in profits in the 24 weeks to mid-June.
Management warned, however, that trading conditions had deteriorated
recently and growth for the full year was unlikely to match that of the
first half.
Strong sales volume growth in the soft drinks sector helped lift turnover
which rose by 24 per cent to R296.5m (Pounds 60m) compared with R239.9m.
Apart from growth in drink sales, consumer demand was generally weak,
reflected in slightly lower margins. Although selling prices were held below
inflation, they were partially offset by improved sales volumes and cost
controls.
Operating profit was 21 per cent higher at R26.2m (R21.6m).
Associated companies performed strongly, with profits rising by 48 per cent
from R4.9m to R7.3m.
The dividend is lifted to 15 cents per share (12 cents). Earnings per share
were 61.2 cents (47.8 cents).

FT  29 JUL 92 / Former partner offers KIO Dollars 2.5bn for Spanish holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Javier de la Rosa, the Catalan financier who was an investment partner
with the Kuwait Investment Office in Spain for six years until last month,
has offered to create a consortium to buy Grupo Torras, the holding company
for the KIO's vast property and industrial empire in Spain, for Dollars
2.5bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
A provisional offer was made to the Kuwaiti finance minister, Mr Nasser
al-Rawdan, nearly two weeks ago, bypassing the KIO in London, whose
relations with Mr De la Rosa have become strained in the last six weeks.
Mr De la Rosa could not be reached yesterday. The offer requires an informal
response this week. Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, president of the KIO, declined
to say whether he was considering accepting it.
The bid is a challenge to the new management of the KIO, which, since taking
office in May, has indirectly accused Mr De la Rosa and former KIO leaders
of mismanaging Kuwait's assets in Spain. It also coincides with evidence
that the KIO wants to sell its Spanish portfolio.
The offer creates a dilemma for the KIO. If it does not accept, it may have
tacitly conceded that Torras is worth more than Dollars 2.5bn and thus risk
supporting the view of former KIO managers that the Spanish assets are
fundamentally sound.
Since the mid-1980s, the KIO has spent Dollars 3.7bn buying Spanish
companies and creating its biggest chemicals, foods and paper groups, and
one of its most dynamic property developers.
But the KIO assets have been shaken by the collapse of the chemicals
division, Ercros. It filed for protection from its creditors earlier this
month owing more than Dollars 2bn after the KIO refused to inject fresh
capital into its fertiliser operations. Stock in two other Torras quoted
companies has fallen sharply.
The offer involves a Dollars 400m payment followed by two further payments
of Dollars 1bn each over the next two years. If the Kuwaitis signal interest
by the end of this week, a formal offer, to expire on October 25, would be
made.
Mr De la Rosa's role in a consortium would be limited because of the large
amounts involved. He promised to supply guarantees from reputable banks.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Brewers keep their places at the bar / Review of changes in
shares of the beer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years after the introduction of the government's beer orders, the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's overall view is that competition is
still weak in large areas of the UK beer market.
The latest MMC inquiry also found widespread evidence that wholesale prices
of beer to independent retailers have been falling while retail beer prices
have risen since 1989. 'It seems surprising to us . . . that retail prices
should continue to rise strongly in real terms at a time of economic
recession when demand for beer is falling,' it said.
As a result of previous government directives to the industry, the size of
the national brewers' tied pub estates is being reduced but their share of
total beer production and sales has been maintained. Grand Metropolitan's
exit from the industry has left five brewers controlling 78 per cent of the
market.
Their grip on the sales of lager - which the MMC viewed as a distinct
product - - was even tighter. Together they accounted for 80 per cent of the
market, and the strength of nationally advertised brands was putting more
pressure on the ability of smaller brewers to compete.
Although 19 regional and local brewers still produce their own lager,
several have recently withdrawn their brands and are buying one from a
national.
It is difficult to predict, says the MMC, how the national brewers' share
may change in the near future. Three regional brewers - Devenish, Boddington
and Greenalls - have quit the industry; and guest beers from the remaining
regionals have penetrated only a third of the nationals' tenanted estates.
The regionals, however, have been expanding their own pub chains, giving
them greater retailing strength. Independent pub operators have also entered
the field but many are tied to the nationals by loans and long-term supply
agreements.
Loan-tied customers represent 27 per cent of national brewers' sales through
pubs against 24 per cent in 1989; and the MMC estimates that supply
agreements of more than 12 months with pub retailers account for about 15
per cent of total beer sales by national brewers to the pub trade.
Since then, the Office of Fair Trading has intervened - notably in Allied's
arrangements with the Brent Walker Pubmaster estate - to limit supply
agreements. Agreements for five to seven years 'foreclose areas of the
market to competition from other suppliers and add to entry barriers', says
the MMC.
But national brewers were much better placed than others to compete for even
limited supply agreements because of their wide portfolio of beer brands,
extensive distribution networks and ability to meet retailers' requirements
for drinks other than beer.
The MMC received evidence that real wholesale prices of beer supplied to the
free trade, net of discounts, have been falling. Retail prices, by contrast,
have continued to rise strongly since 1989. These increases have been
ascribed to the continuing investment by national brewers and tenants in
improving pub facilities; the need for heavily borrowed independents to
raise cash; and the shift in demand towards premium beers which has affected
average prices.
It was suggested to the inquiry that national brewers used their managed
houses - where sales are bigger than those of tenanted or free trade pubs -
to exercise price leadership. 'We were not able to reach any conclusion on
this contention,' the MMC says.
The MMC's view of a chequered competitive background was not shared by
Allied and Carlsberg. They argued that the market was now highly competitive
and that such pressures would continue to increase.
Allied estimates that the proportion of beer sold through tied estates has
fallen from 44 per cent in 1989 to 36 per cent last year and will drop to 29
per cent by the end of this year. There has been a largely corresponding
rise in the free pub trade from 37 per cent to a projected 49 per cent; but
the take-home trade through supermarkets and off-licences has also grown
from 19 per cent to 22 per cent.
The existence of spare capacity in brewing added to these competitive
pressures as brewers vied to increase their sales volumes. But only national
brewers had been able to develop and sustain efficient national networks for
wholesale distribution of beer.
Professor M E Beesley, a member of the MMC, agreed with that view. These
were significant developments that would continue to shape strategies over
the next few years, he said.
The only channel for rivalry, he says, is long-term supply agreements.
'These are not the restorations of a now-forbidden monopolistic practice.'
Similarly, brands of lager disappearing from the market would be the result
of increasing competition, not less competition.
Any concern for local and regional brewers should be tempered by the fact
that they now have more opportunities than ever to extend their tied pub
estates, he adds.

FT  29 JUL 92 / British Aerospace poised to unveil strategy for recovery:
Group expected to focus on profitable core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Cahill, the new chairman of British Aerospace, is expected to unveil
next month his recovery strategy for Britain's biggest manufacturing company
aimed at refocusing the group on its profitable core military aircraft and
Airbus activities.
Mr Cahill, former BTR chief executive, will make his first public policy
statement as BAe's chairman when the company announces its financial results
for the first half of its current fiscal year next month, aerospace industry
officials and City analysts said yesterday.
The strategy of refocusing the company on core activities is also expected
to entail heavy asset write-offs which some City analysts believe could
amount to around Pounds 750m as well as a possible dividend cut.
BAe is experiencing difficult trading conditions in its main markets and
activities, and the City expects the group to report a loss in the first
half and for the whole of fiscal 1992.
Analysts estimate an operating loss of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m for
the full year before provisions.
The write-offs, and fears of a dividend cut, depressed BAe's share price
which yesterday fell a further 10p to 180p. This is less than half the price
of the rights issue of 380p last winter and less than a third of the share
price of 576p 12 months ago.
BAe's share price was also hit by a report that the European Commission
might require the UK government to recoup interest on Pounds 44.4m of aid it
paidto BAe when the company took over the Rover car group in 1988.
The EC is expected to issue in September a new order for repayment by BAe of
the Pounds 44.4m 'sweeteners' and possibly interest which it considers
illegal state support. But City analysts yesterday suggested the EC
initiative was relatively modest in the face of BAe'sdeeper structural
problems.
Mr Cahill has already introduced stricter disciplines on capital spending
and is expected to accelerate efforts to cut the cash drain from
unprofitable or non-core activities.
A priority is a solution to the company's loss-making regional jet business.
BAe has been struggling to find international partners for its regional jet
oper-ations.
UK aerospace industry officials said yesterday the company was increasingly
likely to shelve its BAe 146 regional jet programme if it failed to find
partners.
One hint that the the company's regional aircraft operations are to be
reshaped imminently was the decision to transfer all 146 product support
operations to BAe's Airbus division. This would ensure continued product
support for 146 operators in the event of an decision to shut down 146
production.
In spite of doubts over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)
programme in which BAe is a leading partner, the company's military aircraft
activities continue to be regarded as one of its main strengths together
with its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus large airliner consortium.

FT  29 JUL 92 / King Midas ends his golden reign / A look at the sudden
resignation of Lord Stevens as chief executive of Invesco MIM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Stevens has been the City of London's diminutive King Midas for most of
his 30-year financial career.
He built Invesco MIM into one of the City's biggest fund management groups
with more than Pounds 30bn under its control. Along the way, he became a
press baron, as chairman of United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily
Express, and received a peerage in 1987 from the then prime minister, Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, for his loyalty to the Conservative Party.
But his sudden resignation yesterday as chief executive of Invesco MIM comes
at the end of a less than golden year for the financier.
Invesco's share price has fallen from 111p last September to 66p yesterday.
However, shares in Drayton Consolidated, an investment trust managed by
Invesco and also chaired by Lord Stevens, have been falling further for
longer.
They closed yesterday at 170p, compared with their five-year high of 586p
which was touched in September 1989.
Drayton has a substantial portfolio of unquoted investments and some of
these have fallen sharply in value.
As a result, the merchant bank County Bank and the stockbrokers Cazenove
have been reviewing Drayton with a view to proposing reconstruction.
An Invesco board member said yesterday that the poor performance of Drayton
was the main reason for Lord Stevens' resignation from Invesco.
Lord Stevens, pictured above, has been Drayton's chairman for 12 years and
on its board since 1968.
The Drayton problems have been particularly unwelcome for Invesco because
they come at a time when it has been dogged by adverse publicity concerning
its role as a manager of pension funds for the Maxwell empire.
The company is convinced that it has done nothing improper in its work for
Maxwell.
However, the Invesco director says that the Maxwell relationship has
unsettled the group's clients and potential clients.
Lord Stevens had a series of business dealings with Mr Robert Maxwell in the
1980s.
For a while they appeared to be mirror images of each other. Mr Maxwell was
a media tycoon with a penchant for taking stakes in merchant banks and
invest-ment groups. Lord Stevens was a financier who took the helm of a
powerful newspaper group.
In 1985, Mr Maxwell sold a stake in Fleet Holdings, the owner of Express
Newspapers, to United Newspapers, which was the platform for United's
subsequent bid for Express.
Then in 1986, they each bought a stake in Britannia Arrow, the fund
management group, and succeeded in blocking the bid for Britannia from
merchant bank Guinness Peat.
Then, Britannia itself bought the fund management group run by Lord Stevens,
creating the corporate vehicle subsequently rechristened as Invesco MIM -
whose employees today have mixed feelings about the Maxwell link.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Allied and Carlsberg to link up: MMC attaches conditions to
joint brewing venture in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS and Carlsberg indicated yesterday that the Pounds 510m merger
of their UK brewing operations would go ahead after modifications to meet
the demands of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Nine months after the UK drinks, food and retailing group and the Danish
brewer announced their intention to create a joint force in the UK beer
market, the MMC recommended by a four-to-one majority that the merger should
only proceed if:
Carlsberg-Tetley, the merged company, undertook not to worsen the terms of
beer supplies to Carlsberg's existing customers among regional and local
brewers and independent wholesalers during the next three years.
The term of the supply agreement between Carlsberg-Tetley and Allied pubs
was reduced from seven to five years.
Allied amended its tenancy or lease agreements so that its tied pubs would
be free after two years to buy up to half their annual lager requirements
from suppliers of their own choice.
The European Commission, which conducted a separate inquiry, set similar
conditions for the merger.
Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied's brewing division, and Mr Michael Iuul,
Carlsberg International's managing director, said in a joint statement: 'We
are firmly of the view that the proposed joint venture is the best strategy
for both companies.
'When we have explored the practicalities of the conditions suggested in
greater detail, we are confident that we will find a mutually acceptable way
forward in the best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees.'
The most onerous condition would appear to be the obligation on Allied to
free its tenants to open their pubs to other lagers after two years. In
practice, however, few pubs would be likely to change brands unless faced
with extreme customer dissatisfaction.
The MMC found the merger would have positive and detrimental effects on
competition.
Carlsberg-Tetley would be a more effective brewer, the MMC said, with a
better balanced portfolio of brands than Allied and Carlsberg separately,
and able to compete more vigorously with the two biggest brewers, Bass and
Courage.
Since Carlsberg owned no pubs, the merger would not increase the number
nationally with tied beer supplies.
Against this, the MMC concluded that the merger would increase concentration
in lager production. Carlsberg-Tetley would have a 21 per cent share of the
market and the three largest brewers would account for 67 per cent.

FT  29 JUL 92 / PM backs Lamont on Community VAT deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR entered the row about the UK's agreement to an EC minimum rate
of value added tax with a vigorous defence yesterday of the deal struck by
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Ministers sought to brush aside Tory Euro-sceptic charges that the move
diminished UK sovereignty, insisting the agreement was vital to ensure
completion of the single market.
Mr Major said VAT had been a Community matter since the Treaty of Rome, and
emphasised that Monday's deal did not affect zero-rated goods and services.
He also highlighted the benefits for the Scotch whisky industry.
Mr Major's remarks came against a background of Tory wrangling on the deal.
While Mr Lamont called suggestions that the UK had ceded sovereignty 'a
complete scare, and a very silly, silly season story', Mr Nick Budgen, a
Euro-sceptic, said the chancellor was 'justifying his betrayal of the
British constitution on the basis that he has served a commercial interest'.
The agreement received a mixed reception from business leaders. The
Institute of Directors warned that it should not be taken as a precedent for
EC intervention in corporation tax and was a compromise 'which should not be
presented as a victory'. But the Confederation of British Industry and the
British Chambers of Commerce welcomed it as an important step towards
completing the single market.
The provisional agreement could still founder on Spanish and French
objections. Spain wants Britain to change the name of British-made sherry,
or grant equal tax treatment to Spanish sherry.
France wants a French-style 'control duty' on all EC-produced wine, a higher
harmonised excise duty on mineral oils, and a standard VAT rate on
'agricultural products' such as flowers.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Large users step up demand for lower electricity prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE electricity users yester-day stepped up their campaign to scrap the
Pounds 1.26bn subsidy Nuclear Electric receives from consumers as the
state-owned generator announced operating profits up 48 per cent to Pounds
482m.
Imperial Chemical Industries was prompted by the profits announcement to
re-emphasise its call for lower prices at a meeting with Professor Stephen
Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator. The
subsidy or levy, which adds 11 per cent to electricity bills, has long been
a sore point with large users.
'We think the size and concept of the levy should be reconsidered in the
light of the profitability of Nuclear Electric,' said Mr Chris Hampson,
director of ICI.
The company's electricity bill was substantially higher than last year,
making it hard to compete with other European companies, he said.
The Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group representing large electricity
consumers, called for a cut in the subsidy. 'When I think that our group is
subsidising Nuclear Electric to the tune of Pounds 5m it makes me very
annoyed,' said Mr John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group.
The council is waiting for Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, to reply to a
written appeal.
Mr Doug Rodger, who heads the Chemical Industries Association, also called
for the levy to be ended. 'I think the government should take another look
in the light of this improved performance and see if there is scope to give
large users a break,' he said.
Offer said yesterday the levy had always been designed to lapse in 1998, and
it looked forward to that date. But Prof Littlechild, is understood to be
considering ending the levy earlier.
Yesterday's results for the year to March 1992 show that Nuclear Electric
would not have made a profit without the subsidy. Its turnover would have
more than halved to Pounds 1.17bn, giving an operating loss of Pounds 783m,
rather than a profit of Pounds 482m.
That would have turned its bottom line profit of Pounds 62m, after
provisions for waste disposal and redundancies, into a loss.
Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric's chairman, who attacked critics of the
levy, confirmed that the company intended to be profitable without it by
1995.
Nuclear Electric will have to demonstrate it is economically viable when the
government reviews the future of the nuclear industry in 1994.
Mr Collier said the main force behind improving profitability would be
increased output. Nuclear Electric's power stations generated 7.5 per cent
more electricity last year, giving it an 18.5 per cent share of the
electricity market, compared with 17.4 per cent the previous year.
Profits would also be improved through job cuts and savings in goods,
materials and services, Mr Collier said. The company confirmed it planned to
cut 3,500 jobs by 1995.
Operating costs per unit had already fallen in real terms, the company said,
from 4.2p in the year to March 1991, to 3.9p this year.

FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Allianz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 3 per cent fall in the share price of Europe's biggest insurer
looked like a knee-jerk reaction to a well-trailed but still expensive
underwriting loss of DM1.8bn. Although the performance of Allianz has not
been out of line with the market this year, its shares now stand a full 15
per cent below their level of DM2,306 when the last rights issue was
announced in February.
The broader question is whether Allianz has frittered away shareholders'
funds on overpriced acquisitions unlikely to offer a realistic return in the
near term. After all, first-time consolidation of US and east German
subsidiaries accounted for DM1.25bn of extraordinary underwriting losses.
Conditions in the UK and French markets continued to deteriorate and the
domestic market is hardly healthy, judging by a two-thirds fall in
underwriting profit.
With its shares yielding only a shade over 0.6 per cent, Allianz still has a
low enough cost of equity capital to take a long-term view. But the patience
of some shareholders is clearly being tested. The promise of extensive
cost-cutting suggests Allianz is getting more serious about earnings. It may
also be nearing the bottom of the underwriting cycle in most key markets -
although it could be years before income matches costs in east Germany, in
spite of a promise of sharply higher premiums. Moreover, while it remains
difficult to pin a precise value on the investment portfolio through the
cloudy medium of German accounting practice, stated earnings from
investments reached DM3.56bn last year. Against this background, the group's
first ever underwriting loss looks less threatening.

FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There could scarcely be a better measure of the extreme suspicion with which
the market views British Aerospace than yesterday's further 5 per cent fall
in its shares. The immediate reason was suggestions that the European
Commission would again try to force the company to repay the Pounds 44m of
sweeteners attached to its purchase of Rover from the UK government in 1988.
Having failed once, it is by no means certain that the Commission would
succeed this time. Even if it did, the impact on BAe's gearing would be
trivial, given shareholders' funds of Pounds 2.7bn.
Doubtless the fall in the shares to a level less than half last year's
rights issue price owes much to deep uncertainty about what action BAe will
take to stem the losses in its regional aircraft division. The company, of
course, can say nothing ahead of its interim statement in September. But
here, too, the market may be erring on the side of pessimism, with regard
both to the size of the provision resulting from the worst case of outright
closure and to the impact on cash flow.
At its current level, the price is discounting a savage cut in the dividend
at the very least. Since the market is so determined to look on the bad
side, there is no telling how it may react if new car sales in August turn
out even more awful than expected. BAe has developed an unnerving tendency
to lurch from one problem to another. That is why it is now so difficult for
any remaining faithful to believe that rationalisation of the regional
aircraft business could herald a robust earnings recovery next year. Just
the same, it is worth pausing amid the gloom to recall that a dividend
halved this year might with luck be covered four times next.

FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry is decidedly gloomy about the UK's
short-term economic outlook. But one consolation from yesterday's survey is
that the impact of recovery on corporate earnings could be remarkable when
it comes. With costs under control and two-thirds of respondents still
operating below capacity, any revival in demand should produce a striking
growth in margins.
The benefit would, however, be felt more strongly in manufacturing than in
the services sector, where companies have been less successful in
controlling cost pressures. There is also a risk that it could be
short-lived, as cuts in investment spending during the recession give rise
to bottlenecks when it is over. The CBI is understandably anxious that the
government should not make this problem worse by concentrating its spending
cuts on investment projects. Sadly there is little, if any, historical
precedent for a chancellor heeding such advice.

FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: All clear for beer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's ruling on the Allied-Lyons/Carlsberg deal plainly suggests a
truce is breaking out between the competition authorities and the brewing
industry. Of the conditions imposed, the only one with any bite is that
which requires Allied to allow its pub tenants to buy half their lager from
the competition within two years. The condition has its paradoxical aspects;
the authorities give credit to the merger for providing stiffer competition
for Bass and Courage, while at the same time proposing to give Bass and
Courage access to Allied's pubs. But the amount of beer at risk is at most
150,000 barrels a year, or perhaps Pounds 5m in profit. In the context of a
deal which puts Pounds 135m cash into Allied's pocket, that scarcely seems
worth quarrelling over.
In any case, the pace of change in the industry seems to be slowing. The
only big deal pending is that between Allied and Brent Walker, which now
looks like going through with only minor modifications. There remains vague
speculation about a brewing link between Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
If that ever came to anything, yesterday's ruling might suggest that the
authorities would take an indulgent view.
As the dust settles, it becomes clear that quite a number of things are
going Allied's way these days, including the removal this week of the threat
of higher EC duty on gin and whisky. The shares have outperformed the market
fairly consistently over the past couple of years. There might be life in
them yet.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Foreign Affairs: Continent of conflicts - Ethnic disputes
lie at the heart of many of Europe's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What could have been done to prevent the chaos in Yugoslavia?' asks a
pamphlet published last week by the Oxford Research Group, an independent
study organisation*.
The question may seem academic until one looks at a map, at the end of the
pamphlet, showing 60 'current and emergent conflicts in Europe'. Most
involve ethnic groups whose national aspirations cut across not only
existing state borders but also, in most cases, any alternative federal
borders.
The author, Mr Hugh Miall, lists a further 14 conflicts in the Caucasus not
shown on the map and observes wryly that 'this list does not include the
conflicts in the non-European parts of the former Soviet Union, ie: central
Asia, eastern Russia and Kazakhstan.'
The thickest cluster of conflicts is in the Balkans, with a second intense
concentration in and around the ex-Soviet republic of Moldova.
The map is shaded in an original way - the darker a country is shaded, the
higher the proportion of the population belonging to the largest ethnic
group. No state scores 100 per cent but a suspiciously high number rates 99
per cent: Austria, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Poland.
This happy state of ethnic homogeneity is, of course, what so-called 'ethnic
cleansing' operations in Bosnia and elsewhere are aiming for. The fact that
Bosnia-Hercegovina is the palest area on the map, with the largest group
(the Moslems) representing only 44 per cent of the population, explains why
the effort to produce ethnic homogeneity is so protracted and bloody.
Ethnic homogeneity is not indispensable to a peaceful existence, as the
example of Switzerland shows. But the individual Swiss cantons are, by and
large, linguistically homogeneous. A cantonal solution was proposed for
Bosnia-Hercegovina by the EC, and at one point accepted in principle by all
three communities there. The problem is that it is impossible to delineate a
satisfactory canton for the Moslems, who are (or were) scattered throughout
the republic.
Mr Miall has also published a book**, which examines how and where disputes
have been settled peacefully since 1945. As he says, 'there are two main
phases in conflict when resolution is more likely to be achieved. The first
is at an early stage, before attitudes become too fixed and behaviour too
hostile. The second is at a later stage when the conflict has become a
stalemate and the parties are exhausted.'
Obviously, it is better to settle conflicts in the first phase; hence the
emphasis on 'early warning' and 'early action' in the document adopted by
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki
three weeks ago. The CSCE also established a High Commissioner on National
Minorities, described as 'an instrument of conflict-prevention at the
earliest possible stage'.
There is a danger, of course, that by drawing attention to national
minorities this 'eminent international personality' will create or
exacerbate problems which might otherwise be solved by quiet assimilation.
Some of the most successful nation states, such as France and the US, have
simply denied the existence of national minorities among their citizens,
insisting that citizenship and nationality are co-terminous.
But in the present climate few central and eastern European states can hope
to solve their problems that way. The dominant idea in the region today is
that states should belong to nations (or 'peoples'), not vice versa. Many
states are adopting constitutions which define them as 'the state of' the
Croat or Lithuanian people, as the case may be. This implicitly excludes
from citizenship those who do not share that particular national identity,
thus inciting them to look to another state for protection.
The Estonian government, representing a 'people' which comprises only 60 per
cent of the state's population, has gone so far as to reserve citizenship to
members of that people. It argues that the rest of the population - mainly
ethnic Russians - comprises immigrants (or their descendants) illegally
introduced by an occupying power, the Soviet Union. One may sympathise with
that argument, but it is not one the international community can afford to
endorse. However deplorable the forced population movements in Europe after
1939, any attempt to reverse them could lead only to chaos.
The only approach that offers any hope is to start from the principle that
whole populations should not be blamed or punished for past crimes.
In particular, civilian populations should be allowed to stay where they are
and should not be denied human or civil rights on the basis of ethnic
origin, language or national identity.
A different issue is raised by the continued presence of ex-Soviet troops in
independent states which do not want them. Most of these troops are Russian,
or at least speak Russian, and would like to go home if only they had homes
to go to. The Russian government says, sometimes, that it intends to bring
them back but there is much ambivalence about it.
Russia's handling of the break-up of the USSR has so far been admirably
unlike Serbia's handling of the break-up of Yugoslavia. More people have
been killed in Sarajevo alone than in the whole of the former Soviet Union -
at any rate in incidents involving Russians, as opposed to those where
'peripheral' nationalities are fighting each other. But, as a Serb speaker
noted on Monday at a conference sponsored by the New York-based
International Peace Academy, the situation in Trans Dnestr - where
Russian-speakers have proclaimed independence from Moldova under the
'protection' of the 14th Soviet Army - is similar to that at the beginning
of the Serbo-Croat war, when Serbs in Croatia proclaimed independence and a
supposedly neutral federal army was sent in to keep order. It sided with the
Serbs.
The proposed 'CIS' peace-keeping force in Moldova could easily do the same.
Indeed, the Commonwealth of Independent States could become a fig-leaf for
Russian troops reasserting control in parts of the former Soviet Union.
The CSCE and other international bodies can still avert these looming
conflicts if they act in time. The most urgent task is to persuade states
such as Estonia and Moldova to take seriously the grievances of
Russian-speaking minorities so that Russians will see international pressure
as the best instrument for protecting their stranded compatriots. *New

Red faces in Cleveland. When lawyers for the families of the victims of the
air-crash at La Guardia in March slapped in a claim for Dollars 80m in
damages, they duly cited all companies involved. There was USAir, which flew
the airliner; Fokker, which made it; Dow Chemical, which supplied the
de-icer used before the fatal take-off attempt; and Rolls-Royce, whose
engines powered the jet.
Alas, some legal whizz in Ohio thought Rolls-Royce meant fancy motor cars,
so the lawsuit named 'Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Inc' as a defendant. But the
car business has long been owned by Vickers, and the aerospace engine
manufacturer is a separate quoted company.
'We don't know why the car company is cited - perhaps it's the Vickers
connection,' purred an airy and disingenuous spokesman for the 'right' Rolls
in London. 'The suit's being refiled,' said a spokesman for the Cleveland
law firm, not a little embarrassed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions, like companies, often discover that mergers have unexpected costs.
Officials of the former print union Sogat, which last year merged with the
NGA print union to form the GPMU, estimate that redundancy payments to
former Sogat officials whose faces did not fit have reached about Pounds
330,000. Brenda Dean, the 49-year-old former Sogat leader, and most
prominent casualty of the merger, has pocketed Pounds 148,000.
The London Machine Branch of GPMU, a former Sogat stronghold, is so alarmed
by such figures, and by the NGA's domination of the merged union, that it
has called for a special conference to discuss Dean's departure. But Alf
Elderton, the branch secretary, admits that the response has been relatively
cool. 'People say a conference would cost too much money,' he says.
Tony Dubbins, the GPMU general secretary, defends the pay-outs on the
grounds that the merger has saved Pounds 1m from the joint wages bill of the
two unions. The pay-out to Dean - overshadowed only by the Pounds 220,000
paid to Clive Jenkins by the white collar union MSF - appears to have been
part of the merger agreement.

safe during the course of a day.
If this means that four out of five people do check their cards every day,
then Observer finds this even more staggering.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Observer: Governors under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What price a bust-up between Australia's central bank and the federal
government? One certainly seems on the cards if the opposition Conservatives
are elected next year, as looks likely.
John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, has just re-appointed trade union boss
Bill Kelty to the Reserve Bank board for five years, ignoring opposition
claims that Kelty's close relationship with Labor prime minister Paul
Keating makes him incapable of making independent judgments.
The Conservatives have been unhappy ever since Keating chose one of his old
treasury chums, Bernie Fraser, to head the Reserve Bank.
The head of Australia's central bank has traditionally been a non-political
appointment but Keating's choice of Fraser, which resulted in the early
retirement of the bank's able deputy governor, has raised questions about
the Reserve Bank's independence. John Hewson, the opposition leader, has
stopped short of threatening to fire Fraser and Kelty, but has talked of
amending the Reserve Bank Act to increase the bank's independence if he wins
the next election.
The tensions in Australia are just the latest sign that being a central
banker is not as cosy a number as it was once cracked up to be. Mariano
Rubio, the governor of the Bank of Spain, stepped down last week. His
chances of getting a third term disappeared after the Ibercorp scandal
broke.
Russia's central bank boss, Georgy Matiukhin, resigned a few weeks ago after
he lost the support of the government and parliament.
The central bank chiefs in Finland, Poland and Peru have all lost their jobs
over the last year and S Venkitaramanan, India's central bank governor, has
been under increasing pressure in the wake of the Bombay financial scandal.
Political pressures have played a role in unseating all these figures. But
few are quite as outspoken as Australia's Bernie Fraser who vowed last year
that he would not resign 'just to appease some dickhead minister'.

FT  29 JUL 92 / A lesson from the minister: The education white paper,
released yesterday, marks a return to a managed system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Parents know best the needs of their children - certainly better than
educational theorists or administrators, better even than our mostly
excellent teachers.' Education white paper
If schools were supermarkets, life would be simple. The successful would
thrive; the failures would go to the wall; and parents, knowing best the
needs of their children, would shop around for the highest quality at the
cheapest price.
Many on the right of the Conservative party believe such notions can be
applied to Britain's schools. In their book, vouchers, a minimal core
curriculum and the abolition of local education authorities (LEAs) would do
the trick, driving bureaucrats out of the classroom and freeing parents to
pick and choose as they see fit. 'The free market, if all the rules and
regulations can be swept away to make it truly free, will both raise
standards and diversify provision,' says Mr Stuart Sexton, special adviser
to Lord (then Sir Keith) Joseph when education secretary in the mid-1980s.
Post-Thatcher Tories continue to use market language. Entitled 'Choice and
Diversity', Mr John Patten's education white paper employs it page by page.
'Parents know best,' it says. 'Resources will follow pupils so that good
schools will flourish.' Opting out of local authority control will, it
argues, free the spirit of the nation's schools, allowing them to specialise
to appeal to parents, and leaving parents free to 'choose the school they
believe best suited to the particular interests and aptitude of their
children'.
In reality, however, yesterday's white paper marks the return to a managed
education system. Schools will be subject to less interference, and market
forces will play a greater role than before Mr Kenneth Baker's 1988
Education Reform Act encouraged schools to opt out of local authority
control. But standards and management, not choice and diversity, are the
guiding lights.
The main difference with the pre-Baker schools regime lies in the definition
of the standards and the identity of the managers. On the one hand, schools
will be expected to meet more rigorous, nationally-imposed and monitored,
standards. On the other, out go locally-appointed bureaucrats, in come
centrally-appointed bureaucrats - quangos, inspectors, curriculum designers,
task forces to rescue failing schools and, standing behind them all, Mr
Patten, with powers greater than any previously wielded by an English
education minister.
Mr Patten's proposals for the transition from local to national management
are workmanlike. An appointed Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) will take
over the payment of funds to opted out, 'grant-maintained' (GM) schools
which are funded directly by central government. It will also assume a range
of powers to plan school provision, progressively taking over functions from
local education authorities as the proportion of schools opting out of LEAs
increases. It will establish regional offices 'as the number of GM schools
grows'.
The white paper insists that the powers of the agency will be 'closely
prescribed'. But then so are those of existing local education authorities
under present policy, which is devolving budgetary discretion to all
schools. In effect, the government is proposing to replace elected local
councils with appointed education quangos.
Since all state schools are bound to follow the national curriculum, which
occupies about 85 per cent of available teaching time, the opportunity for
schools to specialise is limited - a point Mr Patten went out of his way to
stress yesterday in response to concern about a widespread return of grammar
and secondary-modern schools. Whatever the balance between grant-maintained
and LEA schools, the community comprehensive looks set to remain the basic
school model for the foreseeable future.
The Tory right will be disappointed that Mr Patten failed to axe local
authorities in one fell swoop. The government remains committed to parental
ballots before schools can opt out. Mr Patten predicted yesterday that by
April 1995 4,000 schools would be grant-maintained, including a majority of
secondary schools and a 'substantial number' of primaries, attracted to opt
out by new provisions allowing them to exit in clusters. That would still
leave LEAs with 21,000 schools, including most primaries. Until 75 per cent
of schools have opted out, LEAs will continue as now to be able to propose
the establishment, closure and significant enlargement to schools, and will
retain a veto over schools in their charge changing their characters.
The government is clearly anxious to avoid instant upheaval in the local
government system, still convalescing from the introduction of the unpopular
poll tax. Indeed, ministers have been going out of their way to talk up the
role of LEAs. Addressing the Council of Local Education Authorities last
week, Baroness Blatch, the schools minister, referred to 'successful
authorities of the future', noted 'clear evidence that at least some local
authorities are recognising the imperatives of greater competition and are
implementing changes to the way they deliver services', and highlighted the
opportunities for them in the new inspection and monitoring arrangements.
Earlier this week Mr Nigel Forman, the further and higher education
minister, stressed the 'valuable role' LEAs could still play in post-16
education.
For the next decade, therefore, partnership between local, national and
appointed authorities appears to be the name of the game. To see the new
system at work, consider three issues high on the government's education
agenda: surplus places, failing schools and special educational needs.
Schools in England and Wales currently contain about 1.5m surplus places, a
huge drain on the education budget. If schools were purely voucher-financed,
there would be no such thing as a surplus place: only 'real' places would
attract funds and, says Mr Sexton, 'those schools which persist in failing
to respond to parental demands for high standards would close'.
The white paper has no such touching faith in market forces eliminating
waste. Instead, local authorities and the funding agency are to have a duty
to report annually on surplus places. If they fail to remove them, Mr Patten
proposes to take new powers not only to direct them to produce plans for
doing so, but to publish proposals himself. Since such proposals must
inevitably include school closures, the implication is clear: the funding
agency, with Mr Patten's consent, will be empowered to close
grant-maintained schools, in defiance of their governors if need be.
Since, to date, one of the principal motives behind schools opting out has
been the desire to avoid closure or reorganisation, there is a grim irony in
that. But as one county education director put it yesterday: 'At last
they've stopped pretending the system doesn't need planning - now we can get
on with the job again.'
An equally firm grip is to be taken on failing schools. Few deny the
necessity for it. Figures for last year show a third of 16-year-olds failing
to gain a single GCSE pass at grades A-C, with one in 14 school-leavers
failing to gain a single graded GCSE. The post-16 staying-on rate is
improving, but last year only only one in five 18-year-olds gained so much
as a single A-level pass. Here again, the market is given a marginal role.
Mr Patten sees rigorous inspection and follow-up as the answer. Under this
year's Education Act, the fruit of Mr Kenneth Clarke's brief stint at the
education department, all schools will be subject to inspection once every
four years. Inspectors will be asked to declare failing schools as 'at
risk', and Mr Patten intends to ask the inspectorate to organise its first
cycle of inspections, starting in September 1993, so as to maximise the
early coverage of schools thought likely to be 'at risk'.
When a school is declared 'at risk' the government will expect the LEA (in
the case of a controlled school) or the governors (in a grant-maintained
school) to take urgent remedial action. Additional powers will be given to
LEAs for the purpose, including a power to appoint extra governors and to
withdraw delegation of funding.
It does not stop there. Where Mr Patten believes the LEA and/or governors
have failed to turn the school around, he will have new powers to send in an
education association to run the school. According to the white paper, the
association will be a 'small and cohesive body' of some six members with a
'remit to improve each identified school within a defined period,' and with
powers to 'require staffing changes at the senior management level and
within the teaching force.' Mr Patten says education associations will be
composed of retired teachers and people 'good at running things'.
Education associations are the most novel feature of the white paper, a bold
attempt by the government to get a hold on sink schools. Mr Patten envisages
them working by administering short, sharp shocks, returning schools to
grant-maintained status when done. Many commentators sympathetic to the
association idea are sceptical that it can be done quite so easily. Says Mrs
Alison Wolf of London University's Institute of Education: 'Running a school
is not a bag of tricks. Everything we know about schools tells us that
leadership and team building is key. It is crucial that when the
associations withdraw an effective management structure is left in place.'
The same emphasis on partnership and strong direction in defiance of the
market is evident in the third area, special educational needs. A fifth of
pupils are estimated to have special educational needs at some point in
their school life, and according to the Audit Commission, even the
best-performing local authorities are taking 50 per cent longer to assess
special needs than the government's guideline of 15 months.
Under the white paper, special schools will be able to opt out, but any
maintained school named in an special educational needs report will be
required to admit the child, whatever its head and governors think. Mr
Patten also intends to take powers to require local authorities and the
funding agency to rationalise special schools, and to permit himself to put
forward his own proposals, subject to a special inquiry.
Read between the lines, therefore, and what the white paper really says is:
'John Patten knows best the needs of children - certainly better than local
authorities and often better than our mostly excellent parents.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRAGEDY in Somalia raises a fundamental question, as pertinent to the
plight of countries such as Zaire or Angola as it is to the fate of 7m
Somalis. What responsibility does the west have for erstwhile client states
in Africa, once courted for strategic reasons, but abandoned when the end of
superpower rivalry made those considerations redundant? And when these
regimes collapse, should humanitarian imperatives override national
sovereignty and justify the intervention of the outside world, providing aid
where and when it sees fit?
The moral responsibility is clear. Africa's cold war legacy is the joint
creation of the west and the former Soviet Union, whose rivalry many of the
continent's leaders skilfully exploited. But the Soviet Union is no more.
Only the west has the capacity to help Africa cope with the legacy, assisted
by a United Nations now capable of playing a constructive role in world
affairs.
In the era when the Horn of Africa was one of the cockpits of superpower
rivalry, Somalia was courted by both Moscow and Washington. A shared border
with Ethiopia, itself a cold war battleground, and the need for access to
the Somali port of Berbera, strategically located on the Red Sea, made
Somalia's friendship worth buying with aid and arms. Those assets are
worthless in the new world order. Past rivalry over Somalia has been
replaced by near indifference.
In the seven months since General Siad Barre abandoned the capital to
competing factions, the country has descended into a state of anarchy from
which recovery will be a forbidding task. Some 30,000 people have died. More
than 1m Somalis have been displaced from their homes or have taken refuge in
neighbouring countries. Aid officials estimate that more than two-thirds of
the 7m population are threatened with starvation. while hundreds of children
are dying daily.
The arrival in Mogadishu last week of a 50-strong United Nations force to
help monitor Somalia's fragile ceasefire is a welcome development. But it
comes too late to avert catastrophe, and is too little to ensure a lasting
peace.
What more can be done? A good deal, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN's hard-pressed secretary-general. He accuses the western nations that
dominate the Security Council of double standards in dwelling on 'the rich
man's war' in the former Yugoslavia while largely ignoring the plight of
Africa, and has proposed a significant extension of UN humanitarian and
peacemaking efforts in Somalia.
Nobody should underestimate the difficulties. Mr Boutros Ghali would be the
first to admit that, with paymasters such as the US refusing to pay their
share of the budget, the UN is impossibly overstretched by its existing
commitments. What is more, intervention in Somalia is highly risky, with aid
shipments vulnerable to violent interference from rival warlords in the
capital.
Yet there comes a point at which humanitarian needs eclipse other
considerations. There are recent precedents, most obviously the UN's role in
opening up Sarajevo airport as a conduit for relief supplies. A relatively
modest operation in Mogadishu, properly guarded and backed with air cover,
would probably save hundreds of thousands of lives. Better still, in the
case of the other Somalias waiting to happen in Africa, would be timely
diplomatic intervention to avert disaster.

BBC2's Screenplay at 9.00 is 'Man to Man', a one woman monologue by Manfred
Karge, which was first admired as a stage play. Tilda Swinton, an
accomplished actress who seems doomed to play male characters, is the German
housewife who, to survive in Nazi Germany, takes on her husband's identity
after his death and plays out the role for over 40 years.
Anyone who thinks that all Jackie Collins' sex and shopping novels read the
same will be unsurprised that two of them, Lucky and Chances, have been
merged into one mini series which starts on ITV at 9.00 and sprawls over
much of the next two nights to provide six hours of escapist viewing. Mind
you they share a heroine, Lucky, a gangster's daughter.
Collins, upset at unsympathetic adaptations of her work, has written the
screenplay and produced this tale of passion, power and greed.
Has the demise of the Soviet Union left the CIA without a role? Not
according to its new director, Robert Gates, who maps out a future for
himself heading an Agency that ferrets out data on narcotics, terrorists and
nuclear proliferation. (BBC 1, 9.30).

Sun-battered Olympic athletes appealed for more bottled water to combat
dehydration as the heatwave continued.
Most competitors have yet to see a cloud over the Catalan city since their
arrival.
Spectators at the claycourt tennis stadium said the courtside thermometer
showed 41 degrees in early afternoon.
A French bottled water company said it had shipped 100 extra cases of water
to the US basketball team and 75 to the US volleyballers.
Humidity adds to the problem: rooms in the athletes' village do not have air
conditioning. Croat tennis player Goran Ivanisevic said it was like living
in a sauna in his room and many athletes complain they cannot get to sleep
until it cools down in the early hours of the morning.
Pollution is increasing. From the hillside diving pool it is now hard to

smog.
Temperatures are expected to fall gradually in the next few days.

FT  29 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: The compleat guide to drug abuse -
The insidious spread of new-generation performance enhancers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE other journalists sitting around the breakfast table each morning at
the Barcelona Press village, I keep my ears open for the subject that turned
the Seoul Games on their head four years ago - drug disqualification. So far
things have been very quiet.
Canada's Ben Johnson is keeping his head low. It is one of the great ironies
of these Games that while Johnson will once again be running in the 100
metres, his great rival, Carl Lewis of the US, is for the moment only a
reserve member for the US 100m relay team, though he is in the long jump.
There was a sprinkling of drug disqualifications before the Games began.
Canadian sprinter Cheryl Thibedeau was banned for life for failing a steroid
test in June. Nigeria has withdrawn six athletes, including women's long
jump and 100m medal hopefuls. Six South Koreans were also withdrawn for
failing tests.
Here in Barcelona, there were minor rumblings on Sunday when US 100m
freestyle silver medallist Jenny Thompson complained that the bulky,
well-muscled winner of the event, China's Yong Zhuang, had not been tested
afterwards.
None the less, among Olympic veterans in Barcelona there is consensus that
performance-enhancing drugs continue to play a significant role in Olympic
sport. Some who have attended half-a-dozen Games have run out of enthusiasm.
It is not because they have lost their love of sport. On the contrary, it is
because they no longer know which sporting achievements are real and which
are not. Some even question the value of attending the next Games in Atlanta
in 1996.
On the other hand, I might make it to Atlanta. Not as a meek and mild
reporter, but as a record-smashing, medal-grabbing Olympian.
I am overweight. I smoke. I drink. My arms are like pins, my thighs are
jelly. I am 38. None of this, however, worries me in the slightest, for I
have managed to get hold of a copy of the Underground Steroid Handbook -
Update 1992, which promises me I could get away with a trip to Atlanta. Such
is the world of performance-enhancing drugs these days that I can believe
it.
The handbook is written by one Daniel Duchaine, an inhabitant of Los
Angeles. Duchaine has been in the cheating business a long time. His first
underground steroid handbook, published in 1981 and sold perfectly legally,
proved highly popular: 40,000 copies went like hot-cakes.
My own edition is a special commemorative one; it was written by Duchaine
after release from prison on an anabolic steroids charge and published this
year, presumably to coincide with these Olympics.
Times are changing fast. Anabolic steroids - previously the athlete's drug
of choice - have not only become illegal. They are becoming obsolete. In the
last few years a new generation of performance-enhancing drugs has evolved,
and Duchaine sees it as his duty to guide a new generation of athletes
towards them.
'We now can't rely on stagnant, decades-old technology,' he writes, and sees
steroid illegality as something of a boon. 'We will now be legally and
ethically forced to look for truly effective steroid alternatives ..It's my
job to help athletes ..I believe in ten years' time we'll see athletes
 .bigger, faster, stronger, and (at last) socially acceptable.'
If you can stomach Duchaine's morality, the modest price of Dollars 19.95
will buy you all the information you ever wanted on performance-enhancing
drugs, old and new. The handbook is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to
become a successful drug-enhanced athlete. As a publication of Britain's
Sports Council magnificently understates the case, this 'puts the medical
profession and coaches in a most difficult position.'
It does not put athletes in a difficult position, for the handbook bends
over backwards to let them know exactly what they can get away with and how
to do it. One chapter, for example, lets American readers know how to get
around US Food and Drug Administration laws and import banned substances
'legally' through various deceptions. If all else fails, there is advice on
smuggling.
A much bigger problem, it seems, is simply getting hold of the real thing.
Banned sports drugs have become so sought-after that a multi-million dollar
industry of counterfeit drugs has sprung up - about 90 per cent of all black
market steroids, for instance, are fakes. Is your injectable Stanozolol
cloudy? In fact, the suspended particles in real Stanozolol have an
irridescent sheen. Hundreds of drug scams are being perpetrated.
There are also untold ways of beating a drug test. You can insert a catheter
tube into your urinary tract and fill your bladder with someone else's
drug-trace-free urine. You can use testosterone and, because it exists
naturally in the body, get away with it with careful calculation. Or you
could try Probenecid, a masking agent that hides drug traces in urine. Like
many athletes, you could stop steroid use at a specific time prior to a
competition drug test so no traces remain.
Or, like Daniel Duchaine, you could use a blocker that jams the tubules of
the kidneys for a few hours so that banned substances do not get into the
urine. 'This blocker works on many steroids, all amphetimines, narcotics,
uppers, downers, you name it: this stuff blocks it,' he crows. 'It always
works. So far it has not been banned, as it has not been detected. If they
ban it, I'll just find something else. I like drug testing: it's a
challenge, it advances the state of the art of performance enhancement.'
What about the newest of up-and-coming non-steroid performance enhancers?
Drugs wizards such as Duchaine are not at a loss. Personally, he favours
anti-catabolics: synthetic analgesics such as Cytadren that prevent adrenal
hormones from arresting protein synthesis in muscles. It adds to muscle size
and strength, and - some predict - is the drug of the future.
Alternately there is Clenbuterol, which magically burns off body fat and
promotes rapid muscle development, exercise or no exercise. Unfortunately,
there is no magic in the work of men such as Duchaine. He is real. His book
is real. The drugs he promotes are real. And they are a worry to everyone
concerned about the future of high-level sport.
I spoke to David Cowan, director of London's Drug Control Centre. His
greatest worry is not banned drugs for which tests exist, but the large grey
area of new sports drugs for which no international legal consensus on tests
exist.
Red blood cell-producing EPO, testosterone-stimulating HCG,
aggression-developing DHT, growth promoting HGH - all are banned, all are
detectable, but so far, despite growing concern over their use, the
International Olympic Committee has failed to take crucial decisions on
testing procedures.
Dr Cowan estimates that currently only about 10 per cent of drug testing is
random, out-of-competition testing. Most authorities agree that such testing
is the only way that the growth of Olympic performance-enhancing drugs can
be controlled. Until this happens, Daniel Duchaine's athletes will continue
to become bigger, stronger and faster.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Jobs: The virtue of a maligned 523-year-old - When it comes
to running organisations, Machiavelli's rulings have stood the test of time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS this is the Jobs column's last appearance before a month's summer
holiday, may it be permitted to take up the cudgels on behalf of a much
maligned person? His name was Niccolo Machiavelli.
Such an intervention in his case is scarcely premature. The late Florentine
political adviser has been getting the bad mouth for over half a millennium.
Or so we're informed, at least, by Shakespeare who had him described as
'murderous' by the treacherous Duke of Gloucester, then still in the early
stages of plotting to take over as Richard III, some time before King Henry
VI was finally done away with in 1471. How unjust a slur that is can be
gauged from the fact that Machiavelli was at most two years old at the time,
having been born in 1469.
But my leap to his defence is needled by more recent events. The goad is
that a large, though sadly unrecorded number of people have been accusing me
of damaging the cause of good management by inciting career-minded
executives to adopt 'Machiavellian tactics'.
The reason why I haven't kept a tally of the said accusations is that the
first few of them were delivered nearly a year ago. They arrived soon after
my return from last summer's holiday in the September when I reported having
stumbled across a re-freshingly frank book about management, called The
Bosses in Britain and The Managers in America, first published in 1958.
For instance, one thing pointed out by its authors - Professor Rosemary
Stewart and Roy Lewis - is that economists and such are indulging in
theoretical fancies when they assume that executives uniformly put their
companies' interests before their own. Real-life management is 'a system of
power, a hierarchy of positions', in which top bosses' personal ambitions
often clash with the interests of the outfits they run.
That report provoked a goodly handful of objections, all right, and not only
from economists either. Further flurries followed my later reports on 1990s
books by two other professors of management - The Organisation of Hypocrisy
by Sweden's Nils Brunsson, and Managing with Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer of the
US - which argue on similar lines.
But the latest spate of nearly two dozen written and telephoned protests was
occasioned by the Jobs column of just four weeks ago about a study by
psychologist Rob Irving, of the Whitehead Mann consultancy in London, of 300
successful senior executives. He found that the traits which singled them
out from people ranked lower in management were not the sort of abilities
that win top marks in master's degree courses at business schools. Indeed,
on verbal and numerical reasoning tests, the scores of the 300 were only
around the average for managerial staff as a whole.
Their differences from the general run were in their personalities. They
shared a voracious need to have power over other people, for instance. They
were also marked by a lust for personal achievement, being fiercely
competitive in pursuing the extremely high aims they had set for themselves
to the extent of being ruthless with anyone seen as standing in their way.
Even so, what has provoked the latest grumbles is not doubt that Dr Irving's
findings are right. All the 22 people who have made protests say that they
themselves have worked under bosses of the type he describes.
The point of the objections is not the fact that power-hungry and
intellectually undistin-guished characters do tend to take the topmost jobs,
in big companies particularly. The point is the moral claim that they
shouldn't do so, because it is clearly not in organisations' best interests
that they should be run by what no fewer than eight of the protesters refer
to in terms such as 'the sort of people championed by Machiavelli'.
Now, although holding no brief for the types identified by Rob Irving, I am
far from sure that it is right to condemn either them or Machiavelli on such
moral high ground. Theorising about the sort of people who ought to run
organisations is far easier than actually running them. And that is a job in
which all the evidence suggests power-politicking plays a large and
indispensable role. What's more, it's a job in which the advice handed down
by Machiavelli has stood the test of time.
Take for instance his warning to aspiring change-agents: ' . . .there is
nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more
uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new
order of things. The reason is that the innovator has for enemies all those
who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those
who only may do well in the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of
the opponents who have the laws on their side, and partly from the
incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have
had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are
hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans; whilst the
others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along
with them.'
I can imagine at least one person who might ruefully reflect on those words
right at this moment. He is Sir Peter Kemp who last week was pushed into
early retirement from his top civil service post. On the Monday he was being
publicly praised by his political boss, Citizen's Charter minister William
Waldegrave, for his 'outstanding success' in driving through the biggest
changes to Britain's central bureaucracy for nigh 150 years. A couple of
days later, he was out of a job.
True, there is a drawback to that particular Machiavellian ruling. Its nub
is that executives who want to stay at the top of their organisation do best
to avoid responsibility for making radical reforms, however much they may be
needed. The smart thing is to saddle someone else with the responsibility
instead.
But if it is true - as it seems to be - that there is usually a heavy risk
in pushing through sweeping changes, then it is surely morally better for
the fact to be brought out into the open so executives at all levels may be
forewarned. And that is where Machiavelli's great service to posterity lies.
Fortunately it is a virtue which, despite Shakespeare's slur on him, was
known to one of the bard's contemporaries - Sir Francis Bacon, who wrote:
'We are much beholden to Machiavel and others, that they write what men do,
and not what they ought to do.' Moreover, if the Jobs column ever came to be
counted among the associated 'others', it would be proud.
FINALLY before the holiday to another topic of readers' complaints: the
recent absence of any puzzles centred on decoding letters into figures of
the sort printed here last year. By way of atonement, here's a division sum.
