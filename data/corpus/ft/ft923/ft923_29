FT  29 JUL 92 / Print workers back collective dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG preference for traditional collective bargaining in contrast with the
continental European system of works councils has been expressed by GPMU,
the print union, in a motion for this year's TUC Congress.
The motion also speaks out against European-level negotiations between the
European TUC and Unice, the European employers body. It says that if
European collective bargaining is developed, it should be done at sectoral
level.
Mr Tony Dubbins, union leader, said: 'We don't want to end up with the ETUC
or the TUC starting to assume a collective bargaining role on behalf of
print workers.'
The motion challenges the increasingly Europhile consensus of several larger
unions, such as the GMB general union, and of the TUC itself. A motion was
passed at last year's congress praising the continental model of statutory
employee consultation.
In spite of the union's assertion of 'traditional values' in industrial
relations - which is certain to fail at the congress - the union has been
developing a close working relationship with IG Druck, the German print
union. The links between the two unions are probably closer than the more
publicised alliance between the AEU engineering union and the German IG
Metall.
The union has also benefitted from an EC grant of Pounds 1.5m to the
European Graphical Federation, the European grouping of print unions, for of
seminars to examine the strategies of Europe's printing multinationals.

FT  29 JUL 92 / 'Insulted' Birmingham leads the opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION from local education authorities to the white paper was
predictably led by Birmingham, which had been singled out by Mr John Patten
as 'the worst education authority in the country'. The education secretary
claimed that Birmingham had 'kidnapped' Pounds 55m earmarked for education
and used it for other purposes.
Sir Richard Knowles, leader of the Labour-controlled authority, said Mr
Patten's remarks were 'a gross insult' to the city's governors, teachers and
pupils.
He pointed out that the performance of Birmingham pupils in GCSE
examinations had improved recently, and he also drew attention to government
praise for the city's training service for school governors.
Sir Richard also criticised the size of the education grant Birmingham
received. He said the latest teachers' pay award would cost the council
Pounds 2.6m in the current year, even though the government had said it
would bear the whole cost.
If reaction from other local authorities to the government's white paper was
more restrained, it did reflect deep unease that government seemed so ready
to dismiss the role of local education authorities.
The Conservative-controlled Association of County Councils warned that there
was a gap between the document's high aims and the organisational changes it
envisaged. 'Everything to which the white paper aspires could be delivered
through responsible local government,' it said.
The Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities accused the
government of 'continuing dogmatic antagonism' towards the education
authorities which had been 'the engine room behind innovations and diversity
in education since the war'.
Regret was expressed that such an important policy paper was prepared
without consulting the local authorities. Some local-government figures also
expressed concern about the process of change in the system that will be
needed as more schools become grant-maintained.
They are concerned that the need to make sure the new arrangements fall into
place properly may divert money and effort away from classrooms.
There are doubts, too, about the more impact the government's plans will
have more generally on local government. The Association of County Councils
believes the government has not taken properly into account the link between
the reduced role in education local authorities will play and the work of
the commission on local government in reviewing the structure of local
government in non-metropolitan areas.
The commission, which started work at the beginning of the month, will have
to plan the reorganisation of the existing district and county arrangements
without knowing definitely how much of the education function will be left
to the new authorities.
Local authorities believe, too, that as more schools become grant-maintained
there will be greater pressure on their budgets, both on education and on
other areas such as social services.

FT  29 JUL 92 / New TUC adviser fuels speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHARLES CLARKE, who for nearly 10 years was chief of staff and leading
'fixer' to Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, is taking up a senior
advisory post at the Trades Union Congress.
The appointment has renewed speculation that Mr Norman Willis, the TUC
general secretary, will announce his intention to step down at this year's
TUC congress.
TUC officials have pointed out that Mr Clarke will be working for Mr John
Monks, Mr Willis's deputy, who is now in effect running the organisation.
Nominally he has been appointed, on a short-term contract, to work on
'campaigns and communications' but in practice he will be writing a
consultancy report on the rationalisation of the TUC, which will be a
leading theme of this year's congress.
Mr Willis has at least another three years in office and for that period
remains president of the European TUC, but leaders of the four main TUC
unions are expressing increasingly open frustration at his management style.
At the last meeting of the finance and general purposes committee, Mr Willis
was repeatedly interrupted or ignored by union leaders.
Some TUC officials believe that Mr Willis, who is at present recovering from
an operation, will tell congress that for health reasons he cannot continue
to run the TUC but will see out his period in office at the ETUC.
If Mr Clarke were to stay at the TUC it would not necessarily signify a
reassertion of unions links with Labour, as he is not popular in the office
of Mr John Smith, the new Labour leader.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Industry to help focus teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS and industrial sponsors will be encouraged to support schools
specialising in technology, science, languages and other fields.
More than 90 per cent of secondary schools already have some form of link
with local business communities, and the white paper says the government is
keen that the existing commitment of business and industry to schools should
be 'reinforced and supported'.
A new category of sponsor-governor will be created at schools specialising
in particular subjects, with legislation introduced to permit up to four
such appointments.
Under the proposals the education secretary will have to approve the
appointment of sponsor-governors, taking account of 'the financial and
curricular benefits which the school would derive from such sponsorship'.
Many of the schools will specialise in the teaching of technology -
particularly its vocational aspects - which the white paper describes as the
government's top priority. 'The economic health of the country requires the
vigorous promotion of technology in schools and the active involvement of
private-sector sponsors in that process.'
The 15 city technology colleges, which have been established in partnership
with business to implement an innovative curriculum, were, the white paper
says, proving outstandingly popular with parents in inner-city areas. One
hundred secondary schools - both local-authority and grant-maintained - had
been selected this year to become the first of a chain of technology
schools.
They will then be joined by a wider network of technology colleges - schools
specialising in technology - established in partnership with business
sponsors.
'Technology colleges will have the strong curricular emphasis of technology
schools. In addition, like city technology colleges, they will enjoy a
direct commitment from their business sponsors, leading to a more focused
technology curriculum as well as other benefits.'
Business sponsors, in return for up to four seats on the governing body and
a direct role in the school's management, would be expected to make a
'substantial contribution' to the initial and continuing capital costs of
turning a school into a technology college, the white paper says.
In addition to their financial contributions, the government wants sponsors
to use their expertise to enrich a school's curriculum and to offer pupils
work experience and other vocational opportunities.
Existing grant-maintained schools, which are already running their own
budgets outside local-authority control, will be able to apply to become
technology colleges and seek a contribution towards the cost from the
government. Schools doing so would not be required to undertake a second
ballot on opting out. They would, however, need to demonstrate that they had
the support of sponsors for the project and 'show evidence of full
consultation with parents and interested parties'. The schools' existing
governors would remain in a majority.
The white paper emphasises that schools opting for subject specialisation
would continue to teach the full range of national-curriculum subjects, but
says that should not stop them choosing to develop special expertise.
Other leading industrial nations combined the attainment of high standards
with a measure of specialisation, the white paper stresses. 'Such
specialisation does not mean selection, which implies choice by the school;
instead it means increased choice for parents and pupils.'
The white paper says that high-quality, enthusiastic staff would be
attracted to a school which had shown its commitment to excellence in a
particular subject.
MAIN POINTS OF PATTEN'S PLAN
New powers to replace governors of failing schools or groups of schools
Making opting out easier so all schools can become grant-maintained
A Funding Agency for Schools to distribute cash to opted-out schools
Allowing clusters of small primary schools to opt out together
Encouraging more schools to specialise

FT  29 JUL 92 / White paper stresses choice in schools: Tough new powers of
intervention - Role of local authorities to diminish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDUCATION in England and Wales in the next century will be characterised
'not by uniformity but by choice', with a variety of schools playing to
their strengths and enjoying parity of esteem, according to the vision set
out by the government yesterday in its white paper on education.
Self-management of schools, a declining role for local education authorities
and tough powers of intervention in schools where standards are at risk are
the cornerstones of the proposals.
'We intend to create a stable system of education that sets international
levels of excellence,' the government says in the white paper. 'Other
leading nations have high standards and a high degree of specialisation. We
can match and outstrip them.'
The essential conditions for achieving excellence and fulfilling talent, the
white paper says, are diversity and choice. The education system of the
future will be one that offers opportunities to all children, not one in
which children are 'forced to conform to the needs of some theoretically
based, undifferentiated and under-performing system'.
The main proposals of the white paper include:
Failing schools: The school inspection arrangements will be used to identify
schools that are failing to give pupils an acceptable standard of education,
or are at risk of doing so. Governing bodies will be expected to take urgent
remedial action, and powers of local authorities to force them to do so will
be strengthened.
Where the government believes a local authority and governors have failed to
improve standards in a school that is 'at risk', it will be able to send in
an Education Association - a group of six specialists who will have the
powers to put the school under new management until its performance reaches
a satisfactory standard. The association will be responsible for providing
the 'essential leadership and management that has previously been lacking at
the school'. That might involve staff changes at the senior management level
and within the teaching force.
Opting out: The government hopes all schools will eventually become
grant-maintained - self-governing establishments with control of their
entire budget - and the white paper sets out a range of proposals to
encourage and hasten that development. Expenditure on publicity by local
authorities hostile to schools in their area becoming grant-maintained will
be limited, and the government will be able to provide prospective
grant-maintained schools with equivalent funds to produce their own leaflet
for parents.
The Education Assets Board - the government-appointed body that handles the
financial aspects of transferring schools out of local-authority control -
will be given greater powers to resolve disputes over assets when a school
becomes grant-maintained. The white paper says that the education secretary
will not hesitate to use his powers to ensure that 'unpopular or less
effective schools' which remain in the local-authority-maintained sector are
closed to ensure better use of resources.
Funding Agency: A statutory Funding Agency will take over from the
government the allocation of funds to grant-maintained schools, with the
gradual introduction of a new financing formula from 1994-95.
The Funding Agency will share with local authorities responsibility for
ensuring that there are adequate school places in a particular area, and
take over those powers in districts where more than 75 per cent of pupils
are in grant-maintained schools. The government will have powers to direct
the Funding Agency and local authorities to produce plans to reduce surplus
school places. It says money should be spent on children rather than
maintaining empty buildings.
Clusters: Small primary schools, which might be daunted by becoming
grant-maintained alone, will be able to apply for self-governing status as
part of a cluster. That would enable groups of smaller grant-maintained
schools to operate with a single governing body and budget.
Specialisation: Although all schools will have to teach the full range of
National Curriculum subjects, the government wants many to develop expertise
in particular areas. Specialisation may take place in a range of subjects -
such as languages and music - but many of the schools will specialise in
technology, with a drive to encourage business and industry to sponsor their
activities.
A new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority will replace the two
existing bodies responsible for examinations, assessment and the operation
of the national curriculum.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Panel rules on racist remarks in workplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RACIST REMARKS by an employer to an employee can constitute unlawful
discrimination at work, an industrial tribunal has ruled.
The ruling by the south London tribunal followed evidence that Mr Mark Perl,
a manager of National Leisure Catering at London's South Bank Centre, said
of five black workers: 'I am going to see my black slaves.' He is also said
to have told a white worker not to resign, as management was 'only after the
blacks'. He denied the remarks, but the tribunal found against him.
The company was ordered to pay the five Pounds 2,000 compensation each for
injury to feelings. Such remarks would have affected working conditions, the
tribunal found, adding that the five 'must have suspected their jobs were
under fire'.
Mr Perl's alleged remarks followed the company's attempt to demote the men
to counter-hands. The five were dismissed when they refused.
The company said an earlier tribunal had cleared it of unfair dismissal.
The Commission for Racial Equality said yesterday this was the first such
ruling. It extends the definition of unfair treatment and is likely to
influence future tribunals, although it does not bind them.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Union is recognised at Law Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in its 170-year history, the Law Society, the solicitors'
governing body, has granted union recognition to its employees.
An agreement signed yesterday will give sole recognition to MSF, the general
technical union. It will negotiate on pay and conditions for the 600 Law
Society staff.
Those covered by the agreement include lawyers and other professionals as
well as administrative workers.
Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, said Law Society personnel worked for
'an employer whose very business is professional advice and representation.
Staff need an equivalent level of representation.'
Ms Jean Thomason, the society's head of personnel and training, said it was
the first time there had been a union claim for recognition. The move was
part of 'good constructive industrial relations'.
Last year the society suffered a Pounds 3m shortfall in budgeted revenue -
equivalent to about 8 per cent of planned net expenditure. The shortfall was
largely accounted for by a fall in the number of solicitors taking out
practising certificates for the following year. A package of cuts included
about 35 redundancies.
The union said yesterday that the move to recognition was not linked to the
cuts.
Ms Karen MacKay, who chairs the newly recognised union branch, said staff
had until now been represented by a staff association. The association had
gradually fallen into disuse because it was no longer an appropriate
structure - the number of staff employed by the society had increased
greatly over the past five or six years and the organisation had become more
complex, she said.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Barclays must face US court hearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank began to reduce its exposure to companies in the Maxwell group
more than three months before Robert Maxwell's death because it had noticed
'some alarming signals', a High Court judge said yesterday.
Maxwell Communication Corporation defaulted on a foreign exchange debt in
July last year and the bank demanded repayment of Dollars 30m due from the
company under an overdraft facility in October 1991, said Mr Justice
Hoffmann.
The money was paid after Barclays threatened Mr Kevin Maxwell, a son of
Robert Maxwell, with a writ against MCC and withdrawal of future
co-operation.
On November 24 last year, Mr Richard Pelly, Barclays' corporate finance
director, wrote to Mr Maxwell: 'This letter will serve as a warning that the
non-payment of the Dollars 30m will result in a breach of the facility and
Barclays will take whatever action is required to recover its money . . . We
believe the co-operation of this bank will be important to you over the days
and weeks to come, both on the private side and in discussions regarding the
financing of MCC, to which we will continue to provide significant
facilities after the repayment of the Dollars 30m. However, we will not be
inclined to 'standstill', thereby improving the position of other banks, if
the Dollars 30m remains outstanding.'
The judge rejected Barclays' plea for an injunction barring Price
Waterhouse, MCC's administrators, from suing it in the US for return of the
Dollars 30m, which the administrators contend was an unlawful preference.
He said the bank was confident that it could resist a claim for the Dollars
30m in the UK but thought it might be vulnerable to a claim in the US, where
MCC is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Although MCC was an English company, it had assets estimated at between
Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn in the US. Its assets elsewhere, which had
largely been realised, were estimated to be worth less than Pounds 100m.
The Dollars 30m had been paid to Barclays out of the proceeds of the sale of
Que, the computer publishing division of Macmillan, MCC's principal US
subsidiary, to Prentice-Hall for Dollars 157.5m.
The judge said the English court had no control over what was done in the
name of MCC in New York and an injunction 'could serve no purpose except to
antagonise the US court and prejudice the co-operation which has thus far
prevailed between the Chapter 11 and the English administration'.
Barclays had argued that the English court was the natural forum for trial
of the dispute because the overdraft facility had been an English commercial
transaction, governed by English law, to provide working capital for an
English company and its UK subsidiaries.
The administrators had contended that they had the right to choose where
they sued for the money.
Barclays later said it might appeal against the ruling.
Price Waterhouse, administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, has
been granted access to Pergamon Holdings (US), the company at the centre of
the Maxwell private empire, in its efforts to trace money that circulated
within the group.
The firm was granted the right under US bankruptcy legislation to examine
the books of PH (US) and to interview its directors and executives.
The firm is hoping to use the information to help it trace movements of
funds and the companies to which money was passed from PH (US), which is
ultimately owned by the Maxwell Foundation, a Liechtenstein trust.
A similar request for access to PH (US) documents from Arthur Andersen,
administrators to the private Maxwell empire, has so far been stalled by
legal action.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Directors jailed for 'massive frauds'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO DIRECTORS of a computer company have been jailed for what a judge
described yesterday as 'frauds on a massive scale' against finance houses.
Mr Terence Harvey and Mr John King, directors of Computer Investment
Leasing, were sentenced to 18 months and 12 months respectively and
disqualified from being company directors for two years. They admitted
obtaining property by deception.
Judge Watts said at Southwark Crown Court, London, that well over Pounds 1m
had been extracted from finance houses, more than Pounds 700,000 of which
had been lost.
The prosecution said the company had once been a success, but with the
downturn in the leasing market in 1987 had faced substantial overheads. To
keep the company afloat Mr Harvey, of Hulcote, Milton Keynes, and Mr King,
of Putnoe Street, Bedford, had raised capital by making bogus leasing
agreements for new equipment, but had defaulted on repayments to finance
houses.

FT  29 JUL 92 / CBI expects drop in output and cut in jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output will continue to fall over the next four months, more
jobs will be cut and demand will remain flat as an end to the recession
remains firmly out of sight.
That was the gloomy message from the Confederation of British Industry
yesterday as it presented the results of its quarterly industrial trends
survey.
The CBI's latest results overturned the optimism of the previous survey in
April, when UK manufacturers said they expected orders and output to
improve. In fact, both fell in the four months to July.
The survey, which covers 1,291 manufacturers and was conducted from the
middle of June to the middle of this month, found that optimism among
manufacturers had fallen back sharply since April. The balance expressing
optimism about the business situation was minus 9 per cent, compared with a
positive balance of 8 per cent in the April survey.
'The post-election boost to confidence has clearly run its course,' said Mr
David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's economic situation committee.
Although the fall in demand over the past four months was at the slowest
rate since 1990, it confounded expectations of a small rise in new orders
expressed during the previous survey. Expectations of a significant increase
in export orders were also disappointed.
Overall, manufacturers expect total new orders to remain flat in the next
four months, but are expecting a slight rise in new export orders.
The survey points out that, in spite of sterling's increased strength
against the dollar since April, there was little change in the proportion of
companies regarding relative prices as a likely constraint on exports.
The fall in output since April was at a slightly faster rate than in the
previous four months. According to the CBI's own data, taken from the
results of the industrial trends surveys, manufacturing output in the second
quarter fell by 1 per cent compared with the previous quarter. The CBI is
forecasting that output will fall by a further 0.9 per cent in the third
quarter of 1992.
With deliveries falling, stocks of finished goods were reduced by less than
planned. They are now higher, relative to expected demand, than in April.
Mr Wigglesworth said one of the most worrying aspects of the survey's
results was the continuing decline in manufacturing investment, which the
CBI now expects to fall by over 10 per cent this year.
'While we have clearly been winning the battle against inflation, investment
has been a major casualty of the recession. This is a deeply worrying
situation that poses major threats to UK competitiveness,' he said.
According to the survey, only 5 per cent of manufacturers view their present
fixed capacity as less than adequate to meet demand in the year ahead.
Overall, investment intentions were little changed from the previous survey,
with more than half the respondents citing uncertainty over demand as the
biggest constraint on investment. However, most manufacturers do not intend
to cut spending on product innovation and training.
Although employment in manufacturing was cut further in the four months to
July, which corresponded with April's expectations, the rate of shedding was
slower than at any time since October 1990. It is expected to continue at a
similar rate over the next four months, with cuts most severe among big
firms.
In spite of a slowdown in productivity growth over the past four months,
average unit costs rose only slightly and are now running at their lowest
level since 1958, when the survey began.
With the downward pressure on prices even more severe than in the four
months to April, more manufacturers cut the prices of goods at the factory
gates than raised them for the fifth successive survey.
Taken together, the results for unit costs and prices suggest that domestic
profit margins were squeezed a little more over the past four months than
during the previous four-month period.
The CBI said a number of factors would continue to hinder a recovery. They
included consumer uncertainty in the face of a weak housing market,
household indebtedness and a renewed build-up in stocks, suggesting that a
rundown is in prospect. Slow world demand and government spending cuts added
to the depressed outlook.
'We don't know when the recession is going to end, but it has to be through
increased demand,' Mr Wigglesworth said. 'World demand doesn't appear to be
sufficient to enable our exports to grow, and in the home markets demand is
weak.'

FOR PEOPLE who do not get enough of accountants during the working day,
television is to bring the profession into their homes late at night in the
autumn.
BBC Television's Select service, which offers programmes by subscription
using existing channels after hours, will broadcast one-hour slots once a
week to be called Business Account.
The programmes, produced by a company called Accountancy Television with the
backing of seven sponsors including BBC Select itself, will concentrate on
training for accountants in industry, commerce and smaller firms.
They will cover news, technical updates and training issues in the
profession, and will be accompanied by a weekly glossy magazine containing
programme details and training materials.
Subscribers will pay a basic Pounds 750 in the first year, which includes
the decoding device for unscrambling broadcasts. The venture will need at
least 10,000 subscribers to recover the initial Pounds 1.5m investment.
Insomniac number lovers who subscribe can watch the broadcasts at 2.15am on
Thursdays. Others can record the programmes and watch them at more
conventional times.
An introductory programme on September 17 and the first two full programmes
on October 1 and 8 will be unscrambled to try to tempt potential
subscribers.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Building ex-chief faces Pounds 1m theft trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR GERALD SMITH, former chief executive of Farr, the failed west country
construction company, has been committed for trial at Southwark Crown Court,
London, charged with stealing cash and securities worth more than Pounds
1.2m from the Farr Group pension fund.
Dr Smith, of Islington, north London, was remanded on bail of Pounds
100,000.
He faces 14 charges of theft between September 11 1989 and February 23 1990.
The charges include the alleged theft of shares in British Airports
Authority, Barclays Bank, J. Sainsbury, Ladbroke Group and Hanson, belonging
to the pension fund.
He is also accused of stealing a cheque for almost Pounds 1m owed to the
fund.
Ernst &amp; Young, which has been appointed trustee to the pension fund, hopes
it will be able to inform pension members that the fund is back in positive
balance when it meets them in the autumn.
The construction arm of Farr Group, one of the UK's largest privately owned
building and civil engineering companies, went into receivership in December
1990.
The construction businesses, based in Westbury, Wiltshire, had a combined

FT  29 JUL 92 / Bond's paintings sold for Pounds 2.23m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
THE reputation of Mr Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur, may be in the
doldrums but his art collection remains in demand.
In Sydney yesterday Christie's sold 52 Australian paintings on behalf of the
receivers of his liquidated company Dallhood Investments, and raised
ADollars 5.7m (Pounds 2.23m). All but two of the works found buyers.
Christie's placed low reserves on the paintings that Mr Bond had acquired in
the 1980s, when he formed one of the finest holdings of 19th-century
Australian art. Prices were above estimate in the main, and the total
exceeded Christie's highest forecast.
A view of Sydney harbour in 1866 by Eugene von Guerard sold for ADollars
715,000, a record for the artist, while another artist record was the
ADollars 660,000 that secured 'The Camp' by Sir George Drysdale. 'Feeding
Time' by Frederick McCubbin sold for ADollars 462,000. Most of the works
went to private buyers.
Mr Bond also bought Impressionist paintings. His most spectacular purchase
was Van Gogh's 'Irises', which he acquired for Dollars 53.9m from Sotheby's
in 1987. Sotheby's loaned him half the purchase price, but when he failed to
repay the debt it arranged for the painting to be sold to the Getty Museum.
Bond's other significant Impressionists were sold off long ago.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Tourist board failure 'a one-off'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of the Thames and Chilterns Tourist Board was blamed yesterday
on special circumstances and was not expected to be repeated among the other
11 regional boards.
The English Tourist Board said it regarded the appointment of liquidators at
Thames and Chilterns as a one-off event caused by a combination of
circumstances that were not relevant elsewhere. It added: 'All the boards
have their accounts audited regularly and there have been no murmurs of
trouble anywhere else.'
Mr Michael O'Dwyer, the Thames board chairman, said factors leading to the
collapse included a 'substantial' write-down of assets, including the
board's headquarters building in Witney, Oxfordshire, the writing off of
Pounds 40,000 in bad debts, the loss of an expensive legal case, and
overspending.
A financial inquiry by the English board, which oversees the regional boards
found a deficiency of Pounds 111,000.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Creditors to meet on future of firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS to Hook Harris, a small accountancy firm based in the south of
England, will meet on Friday to determine the future of the practice, which
entered an individual voluntary arrangement under insolvency law this month,
Andrew Jack writes.
The firm, which employs 60 staff in Southampton, Salisbury and the Isle of
Wight, is the latest of a growing number of professional practices to file
for protection from creditors because of the recession.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales estimates that
two or three practices have been entering voluntary arrangements each month
over the past 18 months, and that one practice a month has become bankrupt.
Hook Harris is believed to have liabilities exceeding Pounds 1m and was
forced to seek protection under the individual voluntary arrangement after
National Westminster, its banker, refused to continue supporting it.
The firm's costs rose sharply after it moved into new offices in Newport,
Isle of Wight, in 1990. It has run into cashflow difficulties recently
because many clients have not paid their bills.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Cleared defendant attacks prosecution: In his first
interview since his conviction was quashed, Jonathan Cohen concedes that
behind the fraud trial lay a serious error of judgment but not a criminal
one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JONATHAN COHEN, the former County NatWest chief executive who is now out
of work, is strongly critical of the way the Blue Arrow case was brought by
the prosecution. He described his arrest at 7am in front of his wife and
young daughter as shattering and humiliating. Being placed in a police cell
and relieved of his wallet, belt and shoelaces, he found scarcely
believable.
He said: 'From there on it was a matter of trying to keep one's head up
whatever happened. In the early days that was not easy. A QC friend told me
it would be like being told you had a terminal illness, with friends unsure
how to react and your life taken out of your control. That's how it turned
out.'
The trial, he agreed, demonstrated that institutional investors felt they
had been misled by County and Phillips &amp; Drew buying their own shares in the
issue to increase the take-up level announced to the markets and so to
enhance the issue's chances of success.
'At the heart of the Blue Arrow transaction there was a very serious error
of judgment, but it was an error of judgment based on honest motives and
intent,' he said.
That error was a failure to think through the consequences of 'late take-up'
of shares and the reliance the markets would place upon the announcements
then made.
Even today, he claimed, many people in the City were still not clear about
what was proper and right over Blue Arrow and what areas were covered by
questionable judgment.
'If you ask people now what went wrong with Blue Arrow, how many would say
the judgment on late take-up, or the use of the market maker's exemption in
not disclosing shares? What is it they actually point their fingers at?'
Mr Cohen does not accept that the City should never be subject to criminal
law or that misdemeanours should be left to the traditional disciplinary
sanctions of the old City 'club'. However, he pointed out that strong
measures, resulting in people losing their jobs, had already been taken by
the Bank of England in the case before the trial began.
He said: 'Obviously, where there is clear evidence of criminal activity, the
criminal law should apply. I don't want to say this was all a nonsense.
There was an issue, but I don't think it was ever a criminal one.'
Mr Cohen criticises the prosecution for failing to 'do its homework'. Its
decision not to interview the defendants before their arrests rankles.
He said: 'I would have been more than happy to be interviewed, without the
compulsion of the Section 2 powers, to give background information on the
transaction.' Had the Serious Fraud Office conducted those inquiries, many
of its allegations, such as misleading Blue Arrow, NatWest Bank and the Bank
of England, would never have been made.
He claimed that the trial showed that the SFO's argument that it could,
instead, rely on evidence given to the DTI was misconceived, as defendants
were acquitted and allegations fell by the wayside.
During the trial, some of the prosecution's assumptions about market
practice had been 'gobbledegook', he said. They included suggestions that
market makers did not take large amounts of stock or that advisers could not
buy shares in the placing after a rights issue.
Mr Cohen, who is trying to find work in the City, has found sympathy in many
parts of it but that has yet to translate into job offers.
His mood is rueful. 'Looking back over the last three years, I found the
experience by turns terrifying and bemusing, at times uplifting and, when it
came to the jury's verdict, truly devastating,' he said.
'I don't argue with the SFO having draconian powers to root out fraud, but
the corollary is that they must take the utmost care before enmeshing people
in the legal process. They really do risk destituting people and crushing
their lives.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / Judges decry overloads on scales of justice / A look at why
the Appeal Court dislikes the complexity and length of the Blue Arrow trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office received a clear warning yesterday from the Court
of Appeal not to overload indictments in future serious fraud cases.
Giving reasons for quashing the convictions of four defendants in the
year-long Blue Arrow trial, the court said: 'We have no doubt that the
length and complexity of this trial were directly attributable to the length
and complexity of the indictment.'
Much of the court's criticism was aimed at Mr Justice McKinnon, the trial
judge, and Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, the senior prosecuting counsel. But the
judges' comments will not make comfortable reading for Mr George Staple, the
new director of the SFO, as he frames indictments in cases arising out of
the Polly Peck and Maxwell affairs.
Mr Staple has said he sees no need for the SFO to abandon its present
approach of throwing the book at defendants rather than concentrating on its
best six or 10 counts.
'We can't be put in a straitjacket,' he said. 'These cases are big and they
are complex. Justice often requires a number of defendants and a number of
charges.'
Yesterday, while accepting the SFO had to ensure an indictment was not
overloaded and directed against too many defendants, he reiterated that the
prosecution still had 'to convey the full sense of criminality to the jury'.
Throwing the book at the defendants in Blue Arrow was unnecessary, the court
said. The late take-up of the rights issue provided a central issue
involving eight defendants that could have been tried manageably and fairly.
The prosecution's 'persistent adherence' to the notion that the case should
be tried as a whole had caused it to lose sight of the effect that would
have 'on the mechanics of and the limitations imposed by a jury trial'.
Without laying down firm guidelines, the court made clear where the limits
of acceptability will lie in future.
Any indictment charging conspiracy to defraud must give particulars in
support of that charge. Yet they must not be more than is necessary, bearing
in mind the limitations of jury trial. To add more than is necessary amounts
to overloading the indictment, even though particulars added are regarded as
relevant by the prosecution.
The prosecution must also exercise restraint in presenting evidence so that
only 'essential evidence is produced and inessential but relevant evidence
is not'. It is up to trial judges to indicate when they think inessential
evidence is threatening the manageability and fairness of a trial.
Lord Justice Mann said the SFO should 'always and anxiously consider'
whether the offence, in spite of their interrelationships, 'threaten a trial
of greater length and complexity than is an ineluctable necessity. If they
do, then the prosecution must reduce the number.'
The court said that in the Blue Arrow case, Mr Justice McKinnon should have
used his powers to reduce the first trial to the central issue of the late
take-up involving eight defendants - something he tried to do too far into
the trial by summing up only on the late take-up, an action that had
constituted a material irregularity in the trial.
Lord Justice Mann said trial judges should use preparatory hearings in
serious fraud cases to express views about parts of the prosecution case
they regard as inessential.
The trial of Mr Asil Nadir, scheduled to begin next March, will provide the
first test of Mr Staple's resolve not to be placed in a straitjacket.
The former Polly Peck chairman originally faced 66 charges of theft and
false accounting. Mr Justice Tucker, the appointed trial judge, has declared
that he expects to see no more than 10 counts on the indictment when the
case comes to court.
Last month, he dismissed 46 of the 66 charges faced by Mr Nadir. The SFO
appealed against that decision, and the Appeal Court's judgment is expected
shortly. Mr Staple has indicated that, if the SFO wins, it will reinstate
the charges before paring the indictment down to 16 specimen charges.
To guarantee that there is never another trial such as Blue Arrow may,
however, require more fundamental change than mere restraint by the
prosecution and a more robust attitude by trial judges.
When the second Guinness trial collapsed in February, the government
promised an urgent review of serious fraud cases. Five months later, the
momentum for change appears to have stalled.
Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the new attorney general, appears happy to leave the
issue to the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, not expected to report
until next summer, and to the Law Commission, the government's law reform
body, which has since 1987 been looking at replacing the offence of
conspiracy to defraud with a general fraud offence.
Any fundamental change to the present system will require primary
legislation. If the government waits until both commissions have reported
before taking action, it will be 1994 before reforms can come in. By then,
the next round of big fraud trials will be well under way, if not completed.
Mr Justice Henry, the Guinness trial judge, said recently: 'Without
legislative changes, I do not believe that things will get better, in fact I
am certain that they will get worse.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / Funds 'back equities over gilts': Pension survey shows bonds
switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION FUND managers have increased their exposure to equities over the
past five years, while equities have been performing less well than gilts,
according to a survey of the fund management industry.
'Much has been made of the attractions of bonds vis-a-vis equities in the
current economic climate. Thus far, pension funds have only paid lip service
to this,' according to consulting actuaries Hymans Robertson in their 1992
Pension Fund Investment Manager Survey.
The survey included 98 managers with over Pounds 180bn of segregated pension
money under management and over Pounds 500bn of total funds under
management. The total UK pension fund market is estimated at roughly Pounds
300bn.
Mr George Henshilwood, partner and consulting actuary, said that in the five
years to June 30 this year equities produced 6 per cent a year, markedly
lower than UK government gilts, which produced 9.5 per cent annually.
While pension fund managers predicted an increase in fixed-interest returns
relative to equities, the average UK fund actually increased equities
weightings to 60 per cent of holdings from 55 per cent at the end of 1986.
The category seeing the greatest inflow of funds was overseas equities,
which have produced negative annual returns of 0.3 per cent.
'It may be that UK fund managers cannot pick overseas equities as well as
they can pick domestic ones,' Mr Henshilwood said. While poor returns in
Japanese equities might be explained by market conditions, UK managers
consistently underperformed key US indices with stock selection in that
market, he said.
The 1992 survey also disclosed a sharp increase in fee scales for balanced
funds of about 15 per cent on average. Fees have been increased despite
rising competition for fund management mandates. Mr Henshilwood said the
rises have been led by the larger, sought-after fund managers whose track
records have allowed them to be more selective in accepting clients.
The survey found the five largest pension fund managers unchanged, although
there have been significant shifts in their market shares. The five are
Mercury Asset Management (19 per cent market share), Phillips and Drew Fund
Managers (11 per cent), Schroder (9 per cent), BZW Investment Management (5
per cent) and Robert Fleming Asset Management (5 per cent). Of those, BZWIM
and Fleming fail to appear in the list of the top 10 most consistent
performers among UK balanced segregated fund managers over the past five
years. Both also lost market share over the past year.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Ulster talks adjourn for summer on upbeat note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON the political future of Northern Ireland adjourned for the summer
on a positive note in Dublin yesterday with British and Irish ministers
optimistic about their progress.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said, after a four-hour
meeting between the two sides: 'The great thing is that this process of
talks is now continuing.'
He added: 'It is hope that is at the top of our agenda - and hopes have been
fulfilled.'
The meeting marked the beginning of 'strand three' of the complex talks
process, which brings together the British and Irish govern-ments as well as
leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland.
Last week the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, warned that the
talks would fail if the Republic did not drop its territorial claims to the
province.
Yesterday Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister, said he had listened to
Mr Paisley 'more in sorrow than in anger'. Mr Andrews added: 'I look forward
to seeing him on September 2 for 'strand two' of the talks.'
An official statement on yesterday's meeting said that the two sides had
agreed an approach to arrangements for liaison on bilateral 'strand three'
issues with the other participants in the talks. 'Initial consideration' was
given to the 'interaction' of 'strand three' with the other two strands in
the light of progress to date.
British and Irish officials are also examining ways of opening up the
public-sector purchasing process between Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic to make it more accessible to companies throughout the island, as
part of a fresh initiative to bolster cross-border trade.
Mr Robert Atkins, a junior Northern Ireland minister, said yesterday that
officials were 'exploring the possibilities' for a joint tender information
system that would 'give comprehensive information on forthcoming tenders
rapidly and cheaply to interested firms'.
Opening up public purchasing fully to companies from all parts of Ireland
would be a 'major stimulus' to trade between the two jurisdictions, he said.
He added: 'Industry also needs to be confident that markets are genuinely
open and accessible and that commercial decisions will be taken on purely
commercial grounds.'
In 1991, Northern Ireland provided just 4 per cent of the Republic's
imports, with its largest share in the food, drink and tobacco sector.

FT  29 JUL 92 / C4 chief 'asked for police help'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, asked for Special Branch
help because of fears for the safety of those making a controversial
programme on Northern Ireland.
Staff of Box Productions, which made Committee, a documentary claiming to
expose collusion between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and loyalist death
squads, were all re-housed because of the danger they faced, Lord Williams
QC said yesterday.
He was defending Channel 4 and Box in a contempt-of-court action under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act for refusing to disclose the identity of the
main source for the death squad allegations.
Lord Williams said the fear was not just for the safety of the source: there
was also 'responsible and proper' fear for the safety of the company's
staff.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, for the Department of Public Prosecutions, said that
no journalist could give a complete undertaking to any source that he would
in no circumstances disclose his identity.
He added that the allegations made in the programme 'may be complete rubbish
 -and probably are'. Nevertheless it was essential for them to be properly
investigated because if there was any truth in them a very serious situation
had been disclosed.
Mr Collins added that to make sure that Channel 4 and Box were in no doubt
that the court order should be obeyed, the DPP was suggesting the
sequestration of their assets.
No fines were being sought against the company directors at the moment,
although that situation might change. The judges reserved judgment but said
they hoped to give their decision later this week.

FT  29 JUL 92 / US on collision course with Iraq: Congressional leaders give
Bush their backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURE confrontations with Iraq's President Saddam Hussein are almost
certain, US administration and congressional leaders said yesterday, even
though immediate military action is unlikely after the return of a United
Nations inspection team to Baghdad.
Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, said after a meeting
with President George Bush: 'I think it's pretty predictable that it's going
to happen. We just don't know when it's going to happen.'
Democratic congressional leaders, who were also at the White House meeting,
pledged full support for the president in any future confrontation.
The US has been preparing for a showdown by shifting its focus away from the
latest dispute, over UN access to the Baghdad agriculture ministry, and
towards the issue of President Saddam's attacks on the Shia population in
southern Iraq.
US officials are reported to have urged the UN Security Council to test the
degree to which Mr Saddam is now willing to offer full access to UN
inspectors by speeding up planned checks. Meanwhile, Mr James Baker,
secretary of state, is due to meet Iraqi opposition leaders in Washington
this week in the administration's most overt show of support for anti-Saddam
groups.
White House officials have also emphasised the plight of the Iraqi
population, especially in the southern marshes. They say Mr Saddam's forces
have been razing villages, damming up waterways which feed the marshes, and
may have used biological and chemical toxins to poison water.
State Department spokesmen have warned that Iraqi aircraft attacking Shias
are violating terms of the Gulf war ceasefire. These aircraft would offer a
tempting target for military action against the Baghdad regime, as the US
could claim concrete results by stopping bombardment of the Shias.
While other air strikes might hit their immediate targets, such as weapons
factories or electrical plants, the odds would remain high that Mr Saddam
could shrug off their impact and continue, in effect, to thumb his nose at
the allies.
The threat of force was amplified on Monday by reports that the Pentagon had
sent an additional battery of Patriot anti-missile defences to Kuwait and
ordered an extra aircraft carrier to be ready to sail to the Mediterranean.
But the US yesterday played down the military threat. Defence officials said
the extra carrier now was conducting 'normal exercises' in the western
Atlantic and would not go to the Mediterranean as US-Iraqi tension had
eased.
Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, said: 'I sense people are ratcheting
this up more than it deserves. I think we'll have to wait and see.'
For Mr Bush, his policy towards Iraq carries risks on both sides: he remains
vulnerable to charges that his administration was unnecessarily cosy with Mr
Saddam before the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and also to popular, if
arguably unjust perceptions, that he failed to finish the job by following
up Desert Storm with a march on Baghdad.
Failure to act carries the risk of appearing impotent in the face of the man
Mr Bush calls 'the Baghdad bully'.
The support pledged by congressional leaders yesterday will not immunise Mr
Bush from criticism if Mr Saddam is as successful in future showdowns as he
was in the latest crisis over the agriculture ministry inspection.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Clifford facing BCCI indictment

MR Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary and presidential adviser,
is expected to be indicted today in connection with the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI).
Mr Robert Altman, Mr Clifford's protege and law partner, is also expected to
face a BCCI-related indictment.
The men resigned last August as chairman and president of Washington's First
American Bank, which the Federal Reserve has said was illegally controlled
by frontmen acting for BCCI.
The likely indictment of the 85-year-old Mr Clifford, a power broker in the
Democratic party for the past two generations, had been rumoured in New York
and Washington. The Justice Department and Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New
York district attorney who is expected to bring the charges, both declined
to comment.
Investigators have been focusing on whether the two former executives lied
to US bank regulators more than a decade ago when they promised that BCCI
would have no ownership interest or other involvement in First American.
Mr Clifford has argued he was duped by BCCI, although he has a reputation as
a shrewd Washington insider.
He and Mr Altman have insisted repeatedly that they are innocent, with Mr
Clifford telling a congressional committee last year: 'Our consciences are
clear.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / UN team begins inspection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS weapons inspectors searched Baghdad's agriculture ministry
for more than six hours yesterday after the weekend agreement to allow the
UN access to the building.
'There's still work to be done,' Mr Achim Biermann, the German leader of the
team, said after his first tour of the building. 'So we'll have to go back
tomorrow.'
As the inspection began, columns of demonstrators marched through the Iraqi
capital, carrying anti-American and anti-UN banners but they were kept well
away from the agriculture ministry.
Mr Biermann and six other UN experts entered the building just a few hours
after arriving in Baghdad.
Under the compromise agreement reached with Iraq, two American members of
the UN team stayed outside the building.
A previous UN team was barred from the ministry for three weeks, sparking
off a tense confrontation between Iraq and the western powers. UN officials
believed the agriculture ministry building housed documents and other
materials suspected to be linked to Iraq's chemical, nuclear and ballistic
weapons programmes.
A UN official said inspection of the building might take another day or two.
'So far the team has not had the chance to get all members together to put
together all the many observations and the notes they have made in the
building,' he added.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, said earlier that much of what UN inspectors suspected had been
hidden in the building might have been removed.
Mr Douglas Hogg, British Foreign Office minister, meanwhile sought yesterday
to keep alive the threat of military action against Iraq, telling BBC Radio
that Britain would take 'whatever steps may be necessary' to force Iraqi
compliance with UN resolutions. 'That may very well involve the need to use
military force.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / Stronger exports prompt rise in Japanese output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONGER export demand caused Japanese industrial production to rise 2.1 per
cent in June, compared with a month earlier, but the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti) said there was no sign of domestic
economic recovery.
Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) released an annual white paper
on the economy in which it predicted that a recovery was likely late this
year or early next year, but warned that the upturn would be 'modest'.
The EPA is officially forecasting 3.5 per cent economic growth for the year
to the end of March 1993, but has unofficially accepted that this is out of
reach and that 2.5 per cent growth is more likely. Private forecasts suggest
growth will be 2 per cent or less.
In arguing that Japanese banks do not face a crisis in covering problem
loans estimated modestly at Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn (Pounds 28.6bn-Pounds
32.7bn), the EPA admitted that 'it is likely that the settlement of these
bad loans may take several years in the medium-run' and, meanwhile, 'profits
may be somewhat depressed'.
The EPA also released a monthly report in which it said personal consumption
growth was slowing, contradicting the white paper in which it said
consumption would remain steady, if not expand.
Miti said the seasonally-adjusted production index in June for the mining
and manufacturing sectors was at 120.9, compared to a 1985 base of 100,
while the shipment index rose 1.9 per cent to 123.2 and the inventory index
increased 0.8 per cent to 123.5
Confirmation that Japanese manufacturers are increasing their exports to
compensate for a slow domestic market came from the Japan Foreign Trade
Council, which said the 19 largest trading houses reported a 26.2 per cent
increase in June export contracts, com-pared to a year earlier.
The surge in export contracts suggests that Japan's trade surplus, a record
Dollars 49bn (Pounds 25.6bn) in the first half, will continue to expand,
exacerbating friction with the US and the European Community.
Meanwhile, Japanese government officials were relieved that Tokyo stock
prices rose slightly yesterday.
The Nikkei index was up about a further 150 points in initial trading early
today.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said a supplementary budget due to be
finalised early next month should be enough to turn the stock market around.
However, Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister, said companies should be
allowed to buy their own shares to bolster Tokyo prices. As a means of
supporting the ailing property market, he suggested local governments should
increase their land purchases and land taxes be cut.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UN's harsh dilemma in Somalia: Millions may die unless the
UN deploys guards to protect relief convoys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council has approved an emergency relief airlift
for millions of starving Somalis cut off by civil war from food and
medicine.
The Security Council resolution, passed late on Monday, suggests that the UN
might have to deploy at least 500 UN guards in Somalia without the agreement
of the country's dissolute and obstructive warring factions in order to
ensure the success of a long-term relief effort.
Both measures are vital to saving 4.5m hungry people and trying to bring
some order to a country which has descended into a desperate spiral of
anarchy, looting, famine and self-destruction. Aid workers in Mogadishu, the
shell-blasted Somali capital, say at least a third of those in need of help
are badly malnourished.
The UN resolution marks a turning point in a disaster which has so far
received little attention from an international community obsessed by
Yugoslavia. Efforts by the UN, Red Cross and other agencies to distribute
food have become bogged down in the nightmare of Somalia's civil war.
Lengthy negotiations between rival Somali warlords have to be undertaken
before food shipments are distributed to the various fiefdoms they control.
Each shipment has to be accompanied by scores of ragtag gunmen in macabre
'Mad-Max' vehicles employed by aid agencies. But, in a starving country
where almost everybody, even six year-olds, carry machine guns, bazookas and
rocket-propelled grenades, food convoys are often diverted or ransacked.
Aid workers say they are in a Catch-22 situation. It is impossible to ease
the security situation without much greater distribution of food. However it
is difficult to distribute food in the trigger-happy situation. Two weeks
ago a UN food convoy was machine-gunned outside UN headquarters in
Mogadishu, and a guard was killed.
In such an appalling security situation UN officials in Mogadishu say it
will be impossible to distribute sufficient food without the 500 UN guards.
Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, the intransigent, power-hungry warlord who
controls south Mogadishu, including the international airport and port, has
thus far refused to allow the 500 UN guards into the rubble-strewn city. But
talks were taking place yesterday between UN officials and Gen Aideed on the
possible deployment of an international guard force.
A team of 50 blue-bereted military observers who arrived last week to
monitor the shaky ceasefire have also yet to be deployed due to logistical
problems and obstruction from Gen Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed who
controls the north of the city.
Furthermore, support for the UN military force from the world community has
so far been negligible. Even limited military intervention, to secure
Mogadishu's international airport for relief flights, has failed to
materialise. The UN is using a private dirt airstrip 50kms south of the
city.
The UN resolution is a victory for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary
general, and his special representative in Somalia, Ambassador Mohamed
Sahnoun. They pressed the Security Council for urgent action and implied
that the world's failure to respond to Somalia's plight was rooted in
racism.
Western support for UN military intervention now appears to be developing.
On Monday the White House urged the UN to move quickly to deploy guards and
offered to contribute generously to fund these efforts.
US Senator Nancy Kassenbaum has also called for the UN force to be deployed
urgently without waiting for Gen Aideed's approval.
However, according to Mr David Bassiouni, UN co-ordinator for humanitarian
assistance to Somalia, military intervention without agreement between the
two sides could be dangerous. 'We might find ourselves trying to take over
the country and fight our way through and then the humanitarian operation
would become secondary,' he said.
The UN thus faces a dilemma. Easing the situation is Mogadishu is critical
to the humanitarian effort because the city must become the base for food
distribution by road, the only really viable long-term means of getting
food, medicine, seeds and tools across the country. Mogadishu has also
become the home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people arriving in the
city searching for food.
Furthermore, resolving the war between Ali Mahdi and Gen Aideed and the two
sub-clans fighting in the city is a necessary first step to nationwide
political reconciliation between the numerous armed factions and clans which
control other parts of the country.
However, negotiations between the two sides in Mogadishu are not making any
headway in the face of entrenched positions, caused not by politics,
religion or ethnicity but by hunger for power and mutual mistrust. The
current ceasefire between the two sides is observed more in the breach.
Although Mogadishu is quieter than it has been in the past 20 months,
sporadic gunfire continues to echo throughout the city.
After months of inaction when medical and food relief to Somalia depended on
valiant efforts by agencies such as the Red Cross, the UN has now
established a substantial, if precarious, operation in Somalia. Its presence
has helped to ease both the humanitarian and the security situation.
However, the UN operation remains fragile and without the UN guards talk of
evacuation is common. Rumours continue to sweep Mogadishu that the warring
factions are stockpiling fuel, food and ammunition in preparation for
another round of full-scale fighting. A fresh eruption would almost
certainly force the UN to leave Mogadishu and that would spell disaster for
millions.

FT  29 JUL 92 / South Korea finds solace in slowdown: Recent statistics
indicate the heat is off the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT officials in Seoul have greeted a recent raft of statistics with
ostensible relief as the figures indicate that the overheated economy is
cooling down.
The GNP growth rate during the first half of 1992 slowed to 7.3 per cent
against 9.3 per cent a year ago, according to the Economic Planning Board
(EPB), the main economic policy agency. Inflation was almost halved to 3.8
per cent from 6.2 per cent and the current account deficit shrank to Dollars
4.1bn (Pounds 2.1bn) from Dollars 5.5bn.
The improvement is mainly the result of a strict monetary policy which has
reined in domestic demand, reduced imports and narrowed the trade deficit.
Massive public construction projects, which fueled inflationary pressure
over the last three years, have also been curbed and spending on public
construction next year will be frozen at this year's level.
Moreover, the government has achieved unexpected success in persuading trade
unions to lower their pay demands. Wage growth could slow to around 10 per
cent this year against the annual rate of 20 per cent over the past five
years.
The government is hoping that the good economic news will bolster the
fortunes of the ruling Democratic Liberal party in December's presidential
elections where the economy is expected to be an issue.
But unfortunately, public attention has focused on many negative
consequences of its monetary policy. Bankruptcies jumped 66 per cent in the
first half of 1992, reaching a record high. The figures include the failure
of 18 listed companies, which undermined investor confidence and depressed
the stock market.
None the less, the government appears determined to curb money supply during
the second half of the year and to implement an austerity programme to
include a review of defence spending, despite the potential military threat
from North Korea.
The planning board has committed itself to limit this year's growth in the
broad M2 measure of money supply to 18.5 per cent against 18.6 per cent in
1991. This follows an average growth rate of 19 per cent in the second half
of the 1980s.
The Bank of Korea, the country's central bank and a strong advocate of the
tight monetary policy, recently stated that the government is progressing
toward its target of a 'triple seven' economy: a 7 per cent GNP growth rate,
7 per cent inflation and a Dollars 7bn current account deficit.
The conservative bank predicts that the economy will grow 7.3 per cent
against 8.4 per cent in 1991 and that inflation will slow to 8 per cent from
9.3 per cent last year.
The current account deficit is projected to shrink to Dollars 6.7bn from
Dollars 8.7bn in 1991 as the trade deficit narrows to Dollars 4.3bn. Exports
will rise by 9 per cent, reflecting a recovery in overseas markets and the
depreciation of the won. Imports are forecast to grow by 5.6 per cent,
although rising oil prices remain a source of concern.
Officials continue to claim that the economy will stabilise within two
years. The prospect of lower inflation and falling interest rates will
accelerate liberalisation of the antiquated financial system, which is
hampering performance by keeping interest rates high.
The government has promised to implement financial liberalisation measures,
including interest rate deregulation and the free flow of capital, once the
economy improves. In one sign of increased confidence, the Ministry of
Finance recently announced that some of these steps scheduled to take effect
after 1994 would be introduced ahead of schedule.
Business leaders, including the Federation of Korean Industries, are warning
that the economy is heading for a crash landing and are clamouring for
easier credit.
Corporate bond rates are almost 17 per cent, although they have gradually
fallen in recent months. Small and medium-sized businesses have to pay even
higher rates on the secondary market since they have difficulty in getting
bank loans. The credit squeeze, combined with sluggish sales demand, is
causing the wave of bankruptcies.
The government plans to adopt measures to funnel more credit to smaller
companies to save them from bankruptcy. Banks will be required to direct 45
per cent of their lending volume to small concerns, an increase of 5 per
cent. Moreover, the government will help guarantee loans made to small
companies by short-term finance companies.
Meanwhile, steps to reduce loans to the country's industrial conglomerates
are being taken. The government claims that borrowing by the conglomerates,
or chaebol, are depriving the small business sector of capital. A freeze has
been imposed on cross loan guarantees among chaebol subsidiaries.
Many securities analysts believe that the corporate sector is exaggerating
the extent of its problems. They predict that earnings for most of the big
business groups will increase next year as interest rates fall.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Amato to seek confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S month-old government is to put its emergency economic package and
outline structural reform programme to a vote of confidence.
Mr Giuliano Amato's four-party government, backed by the Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, could fall if its 16
seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies is whittled away by desertions when
the vote is taken today. However, last night government ministers appeared
confident they would win approval. The Senate will vote next week.
The vote of confidence has always been on the cards, but Mr Amato decided to
resort to this device both to emphasise the urgency of the measures and to
avoid lengthy filibustering by opposition deputies. It was disclosed
yesterday that 651 amendments and changes had been tabled.
Mr Giovanni Goria, finance minister, yesterday told parliament: 'This is a
financial package which must be put behind us as soon as possible because
the problems we have ahead of us are even more serious.'
The package is seeking to raise an extra L30,000bn (Pounds 13.67bn) in
revenues and spending cuts in order to contain the budget deficit to
L150,000bn, equivalent to nearly 11 per cent of GDP.
Also as part of the package are outline proposals for privatisation. The
reform of pensions, public health and local government finance, as well as a
shake-up of the civil service, will be debated separately. Parliament is
being asked to approve these latter measures as a special decree which will
then permit the government to work out details on its own.
The government insists speed is essential because it has to prepare the 1993
budget in September. Uncertainties about the state of the current year's
budget would make this exercise impossible. Equally, if the government were
to fail to obtain a vote of confidence, the government would fall
precipitating early elections - a prospect no party relishes.
Also yesterday, Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, announced to parliament
that the government would revalue the assets of IRI, the main state holding
company which has just been converted into a joint stock company. IRI
currently has a temporary capital of L1,873bn which represented its previous
endowment fund, against debts of more than L60,000bn. Revaluation of its
assets would enable it to comply with legislation on the ratio of debts to
capital.
'We will revalue the subsidiaries of IRI,' he said, 'and we will reassure
creditors, national and foreign, on the nature of the joint stock company
which will be 100 per cent in the hands of the Treasury.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / EC members prove out of tune on VAT harmony: Numerous
disputes could yet derail five years of talks on bringing indirect tax rates
into line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUZO manufacturers have had a reprieve, angostura bitters are safe and the
black beer drinkers of Yorkshire can sleep easily in their beds.
They would be among the myriad beneficiaries of Monday's provisional EC
agreement on indirect taxation, which would impose a legally-binding minimum
standard rate of value added tax across the Community.
A standard VAT rate - 15 per cent for four years from January 1993 - is the
simplest and most prominent of the measures as the agreement is hedged with
a series of exemptions and delays, some so tiny as to appear absurd.
Ouzo, for example, would be allowed to retain a reduced VAT rate. Such
exemptions are the most obvious symptom of the political wheeling and
dealing which has been a feature of indirect tax discussions over the last
five years. The horse-trading is not over. Member states are still trying to
resolve a number of disputes, any one of which could derail the entire
package.
As always in Community affairs, the idea was simple at the outset - to
encourage members to harmonise their indirect tax rates as a pre-condition
for removing frontier controls on January 1, 1993.
The European Commission figured that if VAT and duties were not brought
broadly into line, member governments might maintain controls to prevent
shoppers taking advantage of lower rates in neighbouring countries.
In 1987, Lord Cockfield, then internal market commissioner, proposed two
rates - a standard rate of 14 to 20 per cent and a lower rate of four to
nine per cent. Six categories of goods, including food, water and books,
would be eligible for the lower rate.
Indirect tax purists insisted the simplest system would be the best system.
Federalists within the Commission saw it as a chance to extend central
executive powers over national fiscal sovereignty - one of EC governments'
most jealously guarded rights.
Five years on, the provisional agreement would feature a minimum rate within
the Commission range, but no maximum and a series of reduced (5 to 15 per
cent), 'super-reduced' (1 to 4 per cent) and zero rates - applied to 17
categories of goods.
In fact, the purists and federalists were always bound to compromise because
Commission proposals on fiscal matters, however trivial, have to be approved
unanimously. While that condition remains, it will be difficult to argue
that 'Brussels' has real power over national fiscal policy.
That is one reason why the provisional agreement leaves the existing system
of VAT rates and excise duty in Europe almost unchanged. Many member states
had acted or promised to act on a non-binding rates agreement reached in
June 1991.
As a result, ministers have been able to set in stone what had already been
achieved. Only Germany and Spain will have to raise standard VAT rates, as
they had promised; a handful of countries, including Spain, Italy and the
Netherlands, will have to increase the price of cigarettes to meet the new
harmonised 57 per cent duty; no country will be forced to change its duty on
spirits.
Much still remains to be done. Agreement on another VAT directive, which
would cover second-hand cars and artworks among other items, has been
separated out from the eight-directive package, as has an accord on the
rating of gold. Both will involve long and difficult negotiations.
EC companies, meanwhile, are less concerned about the political agreement on
rates, than about the earlier, almost unnoticed accord on a transitional
system for the collection of VAT, which would last from 1993 to 1997. They
say it will greatly add to the administrative burden on businesses.
The priority, however, is to achieve formal unanimous approval of Monday's
deal. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor who presided over Monday's
meeting, described the package as a 'house of cards'.
Ironically, until recently, he was thought most likely to bring it tumbling
down with British objections to a legally-binding rate.
But the UK's acceptance of that principle now means that other member
states, in particular France, could hold the British presidency of the EC to
ransom over their particular concerns.
Ministers have given themselves until midnight tomorrow to find a solution
allowing all eight directives to be approved unanimously. Only then will the
ouzo-makers be able to relax.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Plea to nations for temporary retreats: UN conference on
Yugoslav refugee crisis opens today in Geneva

<TEXT>
THE 31 countries attending a United Nations conference in Geneva on refugees
from the former Yugoslavia will be urged today to offer 'temporary
protection' to those fleeing to neighbouring states.
Refugees needed to be given temporary refuge and ought not to be put through
the normal political asylum interrogation procedure, Mrs Sadako Ogata, high
commissioner for refugees, said in an interview with the Financial Times.
Germany was continuing to urge other EC states yesterday to agree on refugee
quotas, in order to share the burden of supporting those trying to flee the
fighting. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said every effort
had to be made to house refugees in more countries across Europe, not simply
in those closest to the fighting.
However, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and his French counterpart,
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, backed a local solution to the crisis, saying the 'best
answer' was to deal with the problem on Yugoslav soil.
UN officials are hoping that EC wrangling over burden-sharing will not
detract from the main aims of the one-day Geneva conference, to be attended
by ministers and top officials. These are to mobilise international support
for the humanitarian effort and prod governments towards finding a lasting
political settlement.
In addition to aiding those forced to leave their homes, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees is trying to get relief supplies to more than
850,000 people in Sarajevo and three other Bosnian towns - Bihac, Tuzla and
Gorazde - under siege by Serbian irregulars.
Talks continued in London yesterday between leaders of Bosnia's warring
factions. But hopes of a breakthrough were fading, diplomats said, as
Bosnia's foreign minister declared he would not negotiate while the streets
of his republic were littered with unburied corpses.
At a meeting in Downing Street today, Mr Major is to discuss the whole
Yugoslav crisis with Mr Milan Panic, the new federal prime minister of the
rump Yugoslav federation.
The Serbian government is trying to push through a package of laws to
tighten President Slobodan Milosevic's grip on the republic, writes Laura
Silber in Belgrade.
Parliament yesterday debated a public order bill, under which, opposition
deputies say, a citizen could be sentenced to 20 days in prison for arguing
in public. The other laws aimed at clamping down on opposition range from
the government's planned takeover of Politika, the Belgrade daily, to a ban
on rallies.

Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, is to recommend that Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB), the engineering company, should repay Pta35.9bn (Pounds
197m) in state aid to the Spanish government, write Andrew Hill and Reuter
in Brussels. Sir Leon will put his proposal to fellow commissioners on
Friday.
A court battle with ABB - which denies it received the aid - and possibly
also with Madrid, is likely to follow any repayment order. The Commission
claims the aid was in the form of forgiveness by Spanish public authorities
of debts owed by an ailing electrical capital goods group, CCC, when ABB
took it over in 1990.

THE International Monetary Fund expects the Maastricht treaty on European
union to help, not hurt, the economies of the 12-nation European Community
in the long run, IMF officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
This is one of the conclusions of a draft IMF report expected to be released
in September, they said. The report discounts worries that criteria for
monetary union, such as low budget deficits and reduced inflation, will hurt
European economic growth and affect the world economy.
The officials denied a report in the French newspaper Liberation that the
IMF had concluded the Maastricht treaty would depress EC economic growth by
0.4-0.8 per cent over the next 2-4 years. Although the treaty would reduce
growth by 0.75 per cent in 1993, growth in each of the following three years
would be more than a quarter point higher than otherwise, they said.

DENMARK is to offer this autumn its solution to the crisis in the European
Community resulting from its failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty on
European union, Prime Minister Poul Schluter said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Copenhagen.
'We shall work for a new basis for the Maastricht treaty so that Denmark can
sign the European co-operation pact,' he said after a meeting of
parliament's EC committee.
Mr Schluter, a conservative leading a minority two-party coalition, said the
government would publish a white paper on Denmark's future role in the EC
shortly after the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20.
It would serve as the basis for a proposal to the British presidency of the
EC Council of Ministers in October or November, he said. If Denmark reached
an agreement with the EC, it might then be possible to hold a new Danish
referendum.
EC monetary union, defence and European citizenship were controversial
issues in the Danish referendum campaign.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Ogata tries to persuade world to face the facts

<TEXT>
MRS SADAKO OGATA, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will today
preside over one of the most important conferences in a life largely devoted
to the promotion of human rights.
The aim of the conference, to be attended by 31 nations, is to tackle the
problem of the rapidly growing number of refugees from the former
Yugoslavia, now totalling nearly 3.2m including those trapped in Bosnia.
At a time when the military situation on the ground is daily making their
situation worse and many neighbouring countries are already claiming they
are saturated with Bosnian refugees, Mrs Ogata, a 64-year-old Japanese
professor of international relations who has held her current post for less
than two years, is the first to admit the task is momentous.
She is nothing if not realistic. No, Mrs Ogata is not proposing any specific
solutions to the refugee crisis. 'In general, when you call a conference you
spend several months or even a year to prepare it and a solution.
So this is more of an emergency conference to alert the world about what is
happening. What I am proposing is not a solution, but a follow-up mechanism
to assess needs and how to deal with them.'
Stressing that neither funds nor emergency supplies could provide a
long-term solution to the refugee crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the High
Commissioner says it is up to the participating governments to find
political solutions. 'I would hope that the magnitude of the humanitarian
solutions and some information on the implication of what is happening might
provide governments with the urgent desire to overcome the problem.'
Mrs Ogata is decidedly unenthusiastic about proposals that countries should
agree to a refugee quota system to answer the complaints of those, like
Germany, who have criticised their European Community partners for not
accepting their fair share of Yugoslav, and particularly Bosnian refugees.
The view of the UNHCR, the organisation which she directs, is that those
fleeing the region to 'adjacent countries', such as Austria and Hungary,
should be offered 'temporary protection' by the host country, instead of
being put through the normal political asylum interrogation procedure. 'What
the refugees want is to be taken into a safe area temporarily. There may be
people who are seeking permanent asylum, but what we are asking for is for
the countries to give them authorisation for a temporary stay.'
This, Mrs Ogata points out, is completely different from a quota system,
which never offers protection to anything like the number of people who are
seeking it. 'If you end up taking 100,000, what happens to the rest of the
people?'
Though recognising fully that most refugees want to remain either in their
own country or somewhere close to home, Mrs Ogata is sceptical about the
feasibility of creating 'safe havens' on the Iraqi Kurdish model. That would
be complicated in a country where the ethnic communities are so widely
dispersed and it might encourage, rather than prevent, the 'ethnic
cleansing' process employed by the Bosnian Serbs.
Moreover, who would protect the safe areas? Already overstretched, the UN
would end up having to expand its peace-keeping forces even more.
'I would hope that the increased presence of international humanitarian
workers like our own would be one way of ensuring a certain safety (for the
population in a region). In the past, though we do not have very many people
 -about 60 including local staff in Yugoslavia as a whole - the fact that
they have moved around has, in certain instances, prevented expulsions. An
enhanced activity of that sort is very fragile, but nevertheless something
of a safe area infrastructure.'
Mrs Ogata admits that the crisis in Yugoslavia is going to cost 'an enormous
amount of money'. But she does not think there is a funding crisis. Part of
the money needed will be provided through contributions to the UNHCR, via
the UN system. But a substantial proportion of the requirements would have
to be supplied through bilateral arrangements between governments and the
refugee organisation.
The High Commissioner justified her sanguine view of funding by pointing to
last year's Kurdish crisis. 'We appealed and we were almost fully funded. We
received and spent some Dollars 220m for bringing back and providing winter
accommodation for 1.7m Kurds.'
Since the UNHCR's latest appeal in May, the organisation has already
received a little more than Dollars 107m out of an estimated requirement for
Dollars 142m. A good part of the amount received - Dollars 70m - came from
the European Community. 'It shows that the issues are European. Europe has
to take the initiative in this. It took a little while, but it is coming
now.'
Mrs Ogata hoped today's conference would lead to the setting up of a good
system of assessing the needs arising out of the Yugoslav refugee crisis, as
well as an examination of possible solutions such as the proposals for
refugee quotas and 'safe havens'.
Her own idea is to send an assessment mission to the region and she hopes
governments attending today's meeting will join this project. 'In three to
four weeks we should be able to come up with a pretty good paper on what the
needs are, while we carry on day-to-day operations. I hope that we might
even be able to come up with some kind of proposal for a solution of the
refugee crisis in that time span.'
But ever realistically cautious, she adds: 'That's my hope. There can be no
assurance.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / SFO and judge blamed for Blue Arrow 'disaster'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Blue Arrow fraud trial was a 'costly disaster' for which the trial judge
and the Serious Fraud Office were responsible, the Court of Appeal said
yesterday.
The total costs of the year-long trial, estimated at Pounds 35m, must be met
by the taxpayer, three appeal court judges also ruled.
The court issued warnings to judges and prosecutors in future fraud trials
that legal proceedings should be simplified as much as possible to prevent
any recurrence of the debacle.
The judges, headed by Lord Justice Mann, were giving reasons for their
overturning earlier this month of the convictions returned by the jury in
February against four City advisers found guilty of conspiracy to defraud.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed and Mr Nicholas Wells, all former County
NatWest executives, and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former Phillips &amp; Drew director,
had all been convicted of conspiring to mislead the markets over the result
of the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue.
Their convictions had been quashed because the last-minute decision of the
judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, to cut the indictment down to one central issue
had been made too late for any convictions to be safe, Lord Justice Mann
said.
The length and complexity of the proceedings meant that by that stage - 11
months into the case - the trial should have been abandoned instead, he
said.
Criticising the SFO, the judges said it had presented its case in an
unnecessarily complex way. The multiplicity and size of the issues proved
'incapable of accommodation within the context of a jury trial'.
However, had the prosecution concentrated on the one central issue that
eventually went to the jury, eight of the original 10 defendants could have
been tried manageably and fairly.
'This was not an example of the unprosecutable allegation,' Lord Justice
Mann said.
Criticising Mr Justice McKinnon, he said judges had the ultimate
responsibility for ensuring the manageability of trials. Mr Justice McKinnon
should have used his powers much earlier.
'Judges must not be reluctant to exercise their power in order to secure
that end,' Lord Justice Mann said. 'But, and importantly, they will seldom
have occasion to do so if the prosecuting authorities frame indictments
which have due regard to the limitations of a jury trial.'
The director of the SFO, Mr George Staple, said later the SFO could not be
happy at the court's comments. However, it had learnt from the case.
'We have got to ensure that we do not overload indictments and charge too
many defendants while still presenting the full criminality of cases to the
jury,' he said.
Four other City advisers are still charged with fraud over the affair. The
SFO will announce on Monday whether it is continuing proceedings against Mr
Charles Villiers and Ms Elizabeth Brimelow, both formerly with County, and
Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown of Phillips &amp; Drew.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Task forces to be set up with power over schools: Radical
changes in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDUCATIONAL task forces with sweeping powers to shake up or even propose the
closure of failing schools will be set up under radical plans for reshaping
schools in England and Wales over the next decade.
Under the blueprint published by the government yesterday, elected local
education authorities, which control most of the 25,000 schools nation-wide,
will wither away.
In their place will be a government-appointed agency responsible for handing
out Treasury funds to grant-maintained schools and taking over planning the
future shape of the school system from local government.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said the proposals were 'radical,
sensible and in tune with what parents want'.
The Labour party, teachers' unions and local government organisations
condemned the plans. Ms Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, said it
was a 'recipe for chaos and further upheaval in our schools. There are no
new resources for our children's education'.
The white paper predicts that 4,000 schools, including a majority of
secondary schools, will have opted out of local authority control within
three years.
'Self-managing schools are the way for the future for primary as well as
secondary schools,' said Mr Patten. But he sounded a note of caution to the
Tory right, which favoured the outright abolition of local education
authorities, when he stressed that ballots would continue to be needed for
schools to opt out.
Mr Patten called for a partnership between local authorities and the
government in the long transitional period. However, he chose the launch of
the white paper to single out Birmingham as 'the worst education authority
in the country', a charge angrily rejected by the city's moderate Labour
leaders.
The financial regime for grant-maintained schools, the crux of the new
structure, will not be finalised until the autumn. But it appears likely
that the financial incentives for schools to opt out will be removed as the
number of grant-maintained schools rises above the present 250.
Among the most far-reaching proposals are those concerning failing schools
and surplus places. Mr Patten proposes that new task forces, which will be
called 'Education Associations', be sent into schools declared by the new
inspectorate to be 'at risk'. They will have broad powers to restructure a
school's staff and senior management.
Mr Patten also proposes to take powers to remove the estimated 1.5m surplus
places in schools in England and Wales. He will be able to direct local
authorities and the new Funding Agency for Schools to prepare schemes to
eliminate empty places, and also to impose his own schemes. These could lead
to the closure of grant-maintained schools.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the AMMA teachers' union, said the
white paper 'represents a muddled policy which hints strongly that local
accountability will be replaced by remote Whitehall-controlled quangos'.
Local authorities responded bitterly to the proposals to wind down their
educational responsibilities. Privately, however, some county council
leaders expressed relief that the government had not decided on outright
abolition of the local education authorities, a decision which would have
largely pre-empted the work of the Local Government Commission in
determining the future of the existing two-tier structure in most of England
and Wales.
The Grant-Maintained Schools Centre welcomed the white paper as providing
'stability of funding' for grant-maintained schools'. Mr Bob Balchin, the
centre's director, accused local authorities of spending 'thousands' on
attempting to dissuade parents from taking their schools out of the local
authority system, a practice curbed by proposals in the white paper.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Output decline may equal last recession, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MANUFACTURING faces a drop in output during the current recession which
could be as steep as the decline it suffered a decade ago, according to the
Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI's latest survey of industrial trends says manufacturing output fell
by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of the year compared with the previous
quarter.
Manufacturers, whose optimism about the economy has fallen sharply since
April, now expect output to continue declining over the next four months and
for demand to remain flat.
If, as the CBI's projections show, manufacturing output in the third quarter
falls by 0.9 per cent, the total drop in output, from a peak in the fourth
quarter of 1989, would be 14 per cent. During the 1980/81 recession,
government figures recorded the drop in output from peak to trough as 15 per
cent.
The latest results from the CBI dashed expectations expressed at the time of
the last survey that output and orders would pick up. In fact, orders and
output continued to fall over the past four months.
Official figures for manufacturing output in June and July from the Central
Statistical Office, have yet to be released. The May figure showed a small
month on month fall in output after a 0.4 per cent increase in the first
quarter when compared with the previous quarter.
Mr David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's economic situation committee,
said: 'We don't know when the recession will end and this uncertainty is
having a negative effect on all of us. The continuing cuts in investment
bode very ill for the medium and longer term competitiveness of Britain's
manufacturing industry.'
The survey also highlighted the pressure on manufacturers to cut prices.
Profit margins continued to be squeezed over the past four months as more
firms cut rather than raised prices at the factory gates.
Mr Wigglesworth said the only positive results from the survey were that
inflation was still falling and that companies were not planning to cut
investment in training and product innovation.
The survey indicated that many manufacturers will continue to cut their
staff and investment. But the rate of increase in unemployment has slowed
down and is not expected to worsen.
Despite the survey, UK equities enjoyed a widely expected rally yesterday.
An early gain on Wall Street helped produce a sharp rise in the second half
of the session in London and the FT-SE Index closed at 2,373.4, an increase
of 25.4. The trading volume, however, was not large enough to imply a
convincing change in the investment mood.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Stevens to step down as chief executive of Invesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD STEVENS is stepping down as chief executive of Invesco MIM, the fund
management group, after pressure from its non-executive directors.
However, he will stay on as chairman until the group's annual meeting next
April. In the meantime, the group, which manages more than Pounds 30bn of
funds, will search for a new chairman from candidates outside the group.
The departure of Lord Stevens, who for 20 years has been a prominent figure
in the City, was approved by a board meeting on Monday. It was under
negotiation for the previous 'week or two', according to a board member, and
was first discussed three or four months ago.
Lord Stevens is also chairman of United Newspapers, owners of the Daily
Express, and of Alexander Proudfoot, the management consultant.
An Invesco director said there were three main reasons for Lord Stevens'
resignation:
The poor performance of Drayton Consolidated, an investment trust managed by
Invesco and chaired by Lord Stevens;
The board's view that the role of chairman and chief executive at Invesco
should be split;
The adverse publicity which the group had attracted for its role as a
manager of Maxwell pension funds. This publicity may have been damaging
Invesco's relationship with clients, the director said.
Imro, the self-regulatory organisation of pension fund managers, is
investigating Invesco's role as a manager of Maxwell funds. The director
said there was 'no hint of impropriety with regard to Maxwell'.
Lord Stevens is staying on as chairman of Invesco as a demonstration of the
board's confidence that it has nothing to fear from the Imro investigation.
But the poor performance of Drayton, and in particular parts of its unquoted
investments portfolio, was regarded by the non-executive directors as 'the
final straw', the director said. The value of its net assets has fallen
sharply.
Invesco's non-executives include Mr Vittorio Serafino, representative of its
biggest shareholder, IMI, the Italian investment group; Mr Anthony Solomons,
chairman of merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander; Lord Rippon, a former Tory
cabinet minister, and Sir David Nicholson, former chairman of BTR, the
conglomerate.
Lord Stevens is being replaced as chief executive by Mr Charles Brady, who
runs the North American operations. He is stepping down as a joint deputy
chairman, as is Mr Nicholas Brady, who will continue to run the European and
Pacific division. Mr Wendell Starke takes over the North America role.
Lord Stevens was not available for comment.

FT  29 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET day's trading in stock index futures was enlivened by a late burst
of buying activity which left the market at a premium, writes Christopher
Price.
The September contract opened brightly with buyers deciding Monday's falls
had been overdone, and within minutes it had climbed to 2,370. But the
momentum was short-lived as independent traders sent September tumbling, and
by 9.30am the contract was trading at 2,361, its lowest point of the day.
Support was triggered at this level and September began a slow climb,
although buyers remained scarce. A firm Wall Street helped confidence, and
as on Monday, September finished with a flourish as the last hour's trading
saw a squeeze, County NatWest and BZW being prominent among the buyers.
September ended at 2,387, up 32 points from the previous close and at a
premium of 8 points to its estimated fair value of 12. Volume was a poor
5,298.
Business in the traded options market was similarly quiet, with 19,696
contracts dealt, some 4,200 below Monday's level. The FT-SE option had
nearly 7,000 lots traded. BTR was the busiest stock option on 1,284
contracts.

FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Firmer futures market
helps Nikkei recover
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY buying in the futures market helped the Nikkei average register its
first gain in three days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 53.30 better at 15,426.64. The index fell to
15,200.82 in the early morning, following Monday's decline to another
six-year low, but covering of short positions in the futures market prompted
support in the afternoon, taking the Nikkei to the day's high of 15,510.54.
Volume shrank, however, from 227m shares to 170m as investors failed to
participate and the overall market remained weak. Declines still led rises
at the close by 667 to 283, with 143 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks ended 3.53 easier at 1,190.41, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 1.54 to 936.18.
Traders said the improvement in the Nikkei was technical, and institutional
investors cited the risk of a further fall in share prices as their reason
for remaining on the sidelines.
Mr Chris Newton at James Capel commented: 'Investors feel that the (discount
rate) cut was too little, too late. Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto at Nikko Research
Institute said institutional investors would have to see a substantial rise
in share prices before deciding to participate. He added that since Japanese
individuals tended to place funds in bank savings during an economic
downturn, the rate cut had added to worries about a delay in an economic
rebound.
Dealers traded in speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, the most
active issue of the day, dipped Y2 to Y892 and Taiyo Fishery lost Y3 to
Y431.
Banks firmed on bargain hunting. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y20 to
Y1,620 and Fuji Bank also Y20 to Y1,260. High-technology blue chips were
narrowly mixed: Fujitsu firmed Y1 to Y581 on bargain hunting.
Nippon Housing Loan, facing an increasing number of bad loans, improved Y9
to Y174 as rumours that the Finance Ministry would work out a restructuring
programme sparked short-covering. The issue had suffered its eighth
consecutive fall on Monday, due to worries about its dispute with tax
officials.
In Osaka, the OSE average regained 155.65 to 17,576.68 in volume of 19m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO'S mild improvement had little effect on most markets in the Pacific
Basin, where Hong Kong was an isolated bright feature.
HONG KONG jumped 2.1 per cent largely on a technical rebound, ending at the
day's highs and recouping Monday's losses. The Hang Seng index finished
118.24 ahead at 5,782.63 after selling around midday had temporarily pared
strong early gains. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.61bn from HKDollars 3.43bn.
Buying centred on blue chips but with some interest in second line
industrial stocks. Hong Kong Land advanced 40 cents to HKDollars 13.70 and
Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1.35 to HKDollars 31.25. Playmates
International put on 20 cents to HKDollars 3.45 and Wong's International
7.50 cents to HKDollars 2.15.
SEOUL rose briefly in the morning on speculation that the central bank would
grant a loan to three ailing investment trusts, but retreated to close lower
for a third consecutive session. The index lost a net 3.03 to 514.45 in
turnover of Won129.9bn (Won121.14bn).
KARACHI recorded further losses after an announcement by opposition parties
of a series of anti-government demonstrations, beginning tomorrow, added to
the political uncertainty, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The KSE-100 index weakened 23.99 to 1,360.95.
SINGAPORE rallied from intraday lows on selective bargain hunting but still
closed down on the day. The Straits Times Industrial index was finally off
9.81 at 1,412.53.
TAIWAN extended early losses and the weighted index finished at an 18-month
low. The index fell 49.12 to 3,959.10 in moderate turnover of TDollars
22.1bn, against TDollars 23.94bn.
The heavily weighted financial sector declined 1.4 per cent on reports that
the government had set a low offer price of TDollars 40 for its planned
sales of shares in Chiao Tung Bank and Farmers Bank later this year.
AUSTRALIA was only marginally easier after trading dominated by Pasminco, as
CRA and North Broken Peko's after-hours' sale on Monday was passed on to
other buyers. The All Ordinaries index closed 0.9 down at 1,605.4.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index fell 1.2 per cent, mainly as a result of
sharp falls in Telecom, Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey. The index
slid 19.08 to 1,531.42 in volume of just NZDollars 16m.
BANGKOK's SET index slipped 2.37 to 732.57 in moderate turnover of Bt5.24bn.
Thai Airways receded Bt2 to Bt53.50 on institutional selling.

FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz and Daimler drag
Frankfurt lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD news from the corporate sector dealt a blow to Frankfurt's recovery
hopes, writes our markets staff.
FRANKFURT weakened after the insurer Allianz reported disappointing 1991
earnings, due to its first ever underwriting losses, mainly at its US
subsidiary.
Shares in Allianz lost more than DM50 in the pre-bourse, fell steadily
during the session and closed down DM62, or 3 per cent, at DM1,955, just off
an intraday year's low of DM1,951.
The news depressed sentiment, with the FAZ index 2.6 lower at 640.96 by
midsession and the DAX index losing 7.45 to 1,610.64. Turnover rose to
DM4.5bn from DM4.2bn.
The market sank further into gloom following the publication of June German
new car sales. Lower sales of Mercedes cars pulled Daimler down by DM11.50
to DM689.50.
The data reaffirmed Volkswagen's grip on the domestic car market although
its shares followed the day's downward trend, shedding DM2.20 to 352.30.
Porsche lost DM12 to DM500.
The banking sector was helped by some good first half figures from
Bayerische Hypobank, up DM3 to DM373, as the market awaited today's results
from Commerzbank, which was DM2.20 stronger at DM239.20.
AMSTERDAM rose as the chemical sector climbed in technical trading ahead of
tomorrow's half-year results from DSM. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.5 to
115.1.
DSM advanced Fl 1.70 to Fl 99.40 while Akzo performed even better, rising Fl
4.60 to Fl 138 but in low volume.
Fokker sank further, losing Fl 1.60 to Fl 25.90 as minority shareholders
continued to sell the stock following Dasa's takeover of the aircraft
manufacturer. There were reports that Dasa would offer the Dutch government
up to Fl 40 per share for its 32 per cent stake.
A report that Elsevier's newspaper publishing division was failing to meet
profit targets took its shares to a year's low, down Fl 2.20 or 2 per cent
to Fl 103.50.
PARIS rose for a second day but trading remained thin and there was little
corporate news for the market to chew on. The CAC-40 index finished 13.65
higher at 1,769.00 in turnover of just FFr1.6bn.
Among the most active stocks, Alcatel Alsthom jumped FFr11 to FFr620 while
BSN continued to fall, losing FFr14 to FFr1,019. Euro Disney fell a further
FFr1.55 to FFr93.20.
Remy Cointreau, the drinks company, jumped FFr10 or 6.3 per cent to FFr168
but the rise came in low volume of 11,750 shares.
MILAN underwent a technical rebound as dealers covered their short positions
but dealers said that the market remained on a downward path. The Comit
index rose 1.63 to 400.01 in turnover estimated at L80bn after L77bn.
Fiat was fixed just L1 lower at L4,408 but rose to L4,460 on short-covering
after hours.
STOCKHOLM continued to recover but turnover remained thin at SKr161m after
SKr159m as the summer holiday season progressed. The Affarsvarlden General
index rose 12.9 to 854.7. Skandia rose SKr2 to SKr93.5 on hopes that a
solution was in sight to the battle between Skandia and UNI Storebrand of
Norway for control of the Swedish group.
ZURICH rose in quiet trading. The SMI index improved 15.5 to 1,777.4. Banks
and insurers were again the day's most active issues with UBS bearers up
SFr11 at SFr698 and Winterthur bearers and registered shares adding SFr80
and SFr60 respectively to SFr2,960 and SFr2,760.
OSLO was lifted by a recovery in Norsk Hydro, up NKr2.5 to NKr149, as the
all-share index rose 6.22 to 386.52 in turnover worth NKr190.3m. Hafslund,
due to report first half figures today, saw its A shares close NKr2 higher
at NKr156.
VIENNA recovered slightly as the ATX index gained 7.75 or 1 per cent to
773.52 in low volume. Austrian Airlines went against the trend, losing Sch70
to Sch1,730.
ISTANBUL took profits as banks announced lower deposit rates. The 75-share
index closed down 44.05 at 4,166.00.

FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Crab-like Malaysia dispirits investors
 -The excitement surrounding the recent flotations has evaporated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's stockbrokers are a shade dispirited. The excitement of recent big
privatisations has evaporated. There appears to be a shortage of liquidity
in the market. Speculative investors have been heading for the more
interesting money-making grounds of Hong Kong.
'The KL (Kuala Lumpur) Stock Exchange is like a crab,' says one broker.
'Plenty of sideways movement but not much else.'
The KLSE composite index closed at 585.77 yesterday, up 5.7 per cent since
the start of the year, but it has lost 3.3 per cent over a 12-month period.
This performance is far from bad, especially compared with Tokyo or, closer
to home, Singapore, which the KLSE has now supplanted as the biggest bourse
in south-east Asia with the exception of Hong Kong.
Kuala Lumpur's ascent in the region has been brought about by the heady
activity arising from the government's privatisation programme. In November
1990, the government floated a 22 per cent stake in Telekom Malaysia.
In March this year, Perusahaan Otomobil, the Malaysian-Japanese joint
venture automobile company - manufacturers of Malaysia's Proton car - came
to the market. In May, a 22 per cent slice of Tenaga Nasional, the state
electricity utility, was thrown into the arms of eager investors.
The privatisations have transformed the KLSE. Tenaga, capitalised at
MDollars 28.8bn (Dollars 11.5bn), is now the largest company on the
exchange, accounting for more than 14 per cent of total market
capitalisation. Together, Tenaga and Telekom account for just under 30 per
cent of total market weighting and are larger than the next 15 stocks
combined.
Meanwhile, the influence of commodity-associated companies, once the giants
of the KLSE, has declined. In 1980, plantations constituted 20 per cent of
the market, compared to 7 per cent at present.
The change reflects Malaysia's transformation from a primarily
commodity-based to a manufacturing economy. In 1980, commodities accounted
for more than 70 per cent of exports. By 1991, manufactured goods, mainly
electronics and associated equipment, made up 60 per cent of exports.
The partial privatisation of Tenaga, Telekom and the Proton company came at
an opportune time: Telekom and Tenaga have been placed on the market as the
Malaysian economy has been recording 8 per cent-plus growth rates in each of
the last five years.
Other companies have taken advantage of favourable market conditions to go
private. Mergers and acquisitions have produced powerful new corporate
groups, some with important political connections.
While privatisations gave new life and confidence to the KLSE, the index has
become top heavy: the 10 largest companies on the market account for about
70 per cent of total market capitalisation.
Mr Lum Ming Jang of brokerage concern K &amp; N Kenanga says: 'Tenaga and, to a
lesser extent, Telekom tended to soak up the funds that were available.
Institutional investors - both here and from overseas - felt they had to
have Tenaga as part of their portfolios. In many cases that has meant that
holdings in other stocks have been reduced.'
The KLSE is heavily dependent on foreign investors: funds from abroad made a
substantial contribution to the MDollars 8.6bn raised on the market in 1990,
MDollars 3.9bn in 1991 and MDollars 5bn in the first half of this year. But
not only is the buoyancy of Hong Kong attracting foreign funds away, some
investors are concerned about continuing signs of overheating in the
Malaysian economy.
A growing balance of payments deficit and high domestic interest rates have
meant that many smaller investors have banked funds rather than risk the
stock market. The ringgit has continued to strengthen, particularly against
the US dollar, harming export competitiveness.
The market hopes to raise MDollars 5bn in the second half of this year: this
includes a MDollars 1.7bn rights issue by the partially privatised Malaysian
airline MAS. While it is unlikely that the government would allow such a
cash call to fail, smaller companies could suffer as remaining market
liquidity is soaked up.
But all is not lost for the market's small fry. In recent days, more funds
have been flowing into the less well-known stocks, in part due to market
sentiment that the blue chips are slightly overvalued. Perhaps the crab is
beginning to move slowly forward.

A SECOND set of negotiations on a new market-stabilising international
coffee agreement, being held this week in London, should serve to clear the
ground for the September council of the International Coffee Organisation,
delegates said, reports Reuter. 'I believe the fact people are prepared to
come here is very meaningful. It would be cynical to attend if we do nothing
at all,' said Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao, a spokesman for coffee producers
and Brazil's London ICO representative.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices fall as warm
Brazil chills the market

COFFEE PRICES fell again on the London Futures and Options Exchange
yesterday as the absence of frost in Brazilian growing areas continued to
chill market sentiment.
The September position, which on Monday had added Dollars 23 to last week's
Dollars 29 fall, dipped another Dollars 25 to Dollars 705 a tonne shortly
after the opening. But it rallied later to end the day only Dollars 7 down
at Dollars 723 a tonne.
At New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, the prompt September coffee
price, which had tumbled four cents a lb on Monday, slipped another 10 cents
in early trading to 56 cents a lb. It then managed a small recovery to 56.60
cents late in the morning before edging back to 56.10 cents a lb in
mid-afternoon.
New York traders had expected a large sell-off in London, in response to the
overnight sell-off in their own market. When that did not occur it helped
steady the CSCE market.
Also, the trade came back in with a little support. But analysts did not
expect prices to recover much and some thought they would soon move lower.
With too much production and too little demand 'nothing fundamental is
supporting this market', according to Ms Melissa Trout, coffee analyst with
Cargill Investor Services.
Ms Trout said that unless production was curbed the picture would continue
to be bleak.
The general drift lower for coffee had been held off last week in the New
York market because some traders hoped that cold weather in Brazil might
hurt some of the crop there. But when the cold snap did not materialise
prices fell.
The prospect of some crop damage in Brazil 'encouraged traders not to sell
as much as they should have,' according to Ms Judith Ganes, coffee analyst
at Merrill Lynch. She believes prices could dip to 50 cents per pound and
foresees 'no bounce, not in the short term'.
Contributing to the market's sourness is the lack of progress on a new
International Coffee Agreement.

A SHARPISH fall in ALUMINIUM prices was the main feature of a quiet day the
London Metal Exchange. The cash price reversed the uptrend of the two
preceding trading days to close Dollars 17.50 down at Dollars 1,327.50 a
tonne in a follow-through to a technically weak close on Monday. Dealers
said chart patterns remained a bearish influence on the market. Another rise
in LME warehouse stocks of aluminium came as no surprise and had little
influence, but in the NICKEL market a 2,274-tonne stocks rise was a major
factor pushing prices lower. At the close the three months price was Dollars
82.50 down at Dollars 7,560 a tonne. COPPER prices were also lower in
sterling terms but that was entirely due to the currency factor. The cash
position's Pounds 7 fall to Pounds 1,320.50 a tonne translated into a
Dollars 2 rise in terms of the weakening US currency. The retreat of the
PLATINUM price continued following news of a wage settlement being agreed at
Impala of South Africa. The price fell Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 375 a troy
ounce, taking the fall over the last three trading days to Dollars 8.40 an
ounce. Profit-taking ended COCOA'S rally and the September futures price
closed Pounds 11 down at Pounds 599 a tonne.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC wheat stock now exceeds that
of US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has overtaken the US to become the world's 'residual'
wheat supplier this year, according to the US Department of Agriculture.
For the first time in recent memory, wheat stocks held by the community
exceed those held by the US government. Traders attribute the reversal to
reduced US crops in the past few years because of poor weather and continued
bountiful harvests in the EC.
Community wheat production for 1992-93 has expanded, in terms of both
acreage planted and yields, according to the USDA. Output is projected at
90.1m tonnes, slightly above last year's. US wheat production is running
well ahead of last year's poor crop - 59.5m tonnes is projected - but it is
still below earlier expectations.
While the US has been steadily subsiding wheat exports through the Export
Enhancement Program, EC export restitutions have been reduced. USDA
officials say they do not know why the EC has slowed its export subsidies,
but believe it to be related to world trade talks.
Even while American traders are taking note of slower EC exports, US sales
overseas have been brisk. Some of this has been attributed to election-year
assistance. US Wheat Associates, a market promotion group, recently noted in
its newsletter that congressmen and senators are preparing to face their
farmer constituents in the autumn campaign.
'Administration and other government agencies involved in export decisions
may be getting added pressure from legislators regarding the past months'
wheat export initiatives,' it said.
There is widespread speculation that the administration may have other good
news for US farmers before the election. According to Ms Kai Mander, of the
Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minnesota, these actions could
include: retaliation against the EC over disagreements surrounding US maize
gluten feed shipments to Europe; USDA plans to spend Dollars 1bn of Export
Enhancement Program (export subsidy) funds in October to 'empty the bins'
and drive up cash farm prices; a delay in the Uruguay Round talks until next
year and a proposal to agree a two year extension of the Multi-Fibre
Agreement.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: German take-over of Izok Lake
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METALL Mining, a 67 per cent-Canadian subsidiary of Germany's
Metallgesellschaft, is buying control of Minnova, one of the Noranda group's
mining units, for CDollars 136.6m (Dollars 113.80m) cash.
Metall's main objective is Minnova's Izok Lake high-grade base metals-silver
property in the Northwest Territories.
Development is estimated to cost about CDollars 350m at current prices and
the mine is scheduled to be on stream in 1997.
'Izok Lake would be one of Canada's biggest base metals mines if it were
operating today,' said Klaus Zeitler, Metall president.
'We have increased the reserve significantly this year. The 4,000-mile
shipping route to Europe is open five months a year and the western route to
Japan is more encouraging than we thought.'
Metall already owns 40 per cent of Izok Lake with Minnova owning the rest.
Metall is buying the 50.4 per cent interest held in Minnova by Kerr Addison
Mines, a Noranda unit.
Izok Lake lies 360 km (225 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the Northwest
Territories' capital, and 240 km south of Coppermines on the Arctic coast,
where a port will be built.
The ore body lies under the lake, which would be pumped out, allowing an
open-pit mine to be developed with a mill. The concentrates will be shipped
to the port by winter road and then moved out to Europe or Japan by
ice-strengthened ships during the five-month season.
In April, Minnova reported 13.4m tonnes of ore with average grade of 3.2 per
cent copper, 14.47 per cent zinc, 1.3 per cent lead, and 74 grammes of
silver per tonne.
Mr Zeitler said that open drilling has increased reserves by 2m tonnes. Only
about one-third of the anomaly has been drilled. The full feasibility study
will be done next year for a low-cost long-term mining project.
'Once we get the infrastructure in place, we can help develop 23 other
smaller potential base metals and gold properties in the area,' he added.
'Environmental studies are underway and two existing Canadian Arctic mines
have shown that underwater tailings disposal is feasible.'
Metall owns 14 per cent of Teck and 14 per cent of MIM Holdings of
Australia, which together control Cominco.

production estimated

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUGAR PRODUCTION looks set to rise this year in both eastern and western
Europe, FO Licht, the influential German sugar statistics agency, said in
comments accompanying its third estimate of 1992 European sugar beet
plantings, reports Reuter from Ratzeburg.
It increased its estimate for the eastern European sugar area to 3.99m
hectares (9.8m acres) from a previous forecast of 3.73m ha. The area remains
slightly below last year's 4.08m ha, however.
'When it is recalled that last season yields were extremely low it can be
appreciated that sugar output could substantially exceed last season's
figures and lead to an eastern European output more than 1m tonnes higher,'
Licht said.
On the basis of average yields for the last five seasons Licht projected
that western European output would rise by about 2m tonnes. But weather
conditions suggested, however, that the projection could well be exceed.
The area under sugar in western Europe was put at 2.66m ha, unchanged from
the last estimate issued in April and only marginally below 1991 plantings
on 2.67m ha.
The total 1992 European area was put at 6.65m ha, up from a previous
forecast of 6.39m ha but down from 6.75m ha in 1991.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a new policy requiring
foreign investment advisers to comply with US securities laws only when they
deal with clients based in the US, Reuter reports from Washington.
The plan was approved in a 4-0 vote by the agency's commissioners. It will
make it easier for US investors to get advice from foreign advisers.
Under the new approach, foreign advisers registered with the SEC will be
subject to their home country law, rather than US law, when giving advice to
clients in their home country. The policy will apply as long as a foreign
adviser's conduct does not affect US clients or US markets.
The SEC also agreed to permit foreign advisers not registered with the SEC
greater flexibility to organise subsidiaries that are registered advisers.

<TEXT>
THE Italian Treasury yesterday approved a credit line of L200bn (Dollars
178.1m) for Efim, the debt-ridden state holding company which was put into
voluntary liquidation on July 17.
The credit is intended to allow Mr Alberto Predieri, the administrator of
the liquidation, funds to cover operating needs of the holding with its
37,000 employees spread among over 80 subsidiaries. Efim's L8,500bn debt to
the banks has been frozen for up to two years. It is understood the credit
line will be used to pay wages and supplies.
This is the second measure introduced by the government to help Efim. Last
Friday, the Ministry of Industry agreed to halve the cost of energy charged
to Alumix, Efim's aluminium subsidiary.
Alumix has been the biggest single burden on Efim, largely due to high
energy costs. Augusta, Efim's aerospace unit, last week received a lift with
a L1,000bn helicopter sale to Canada.

STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, has raised its credit
rating on The Equitable, the large US life insurer, from A to A+. The
upgrade follows the insurer's conversion from mutual status, where it was
controlled by its policyholders, to a conventional shareholder-owned
company.
During the process, the insurer sold shares to investors - about Dollars
110m will be added to capital as a result - and received a further Dollars
1bn capital infusion from Axa, the large French insurer.
As a result Axa now holds a 49 per cent stake in The Equitable.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Fokker prepared for legal
action on bond redemptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, is prepared to go to court to
prevent some of its bondholders redeeming their bonds early following last
week's agreement that Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) should take control of the
company.
Holders of two classes of domestic bond - Fl 150m (Dollars 89.7m) of 4 3/4
per cent convertible bonds maturing in five equal annual amounts from 1995,
and Fl 150m at 7 3/4 per cent maturing in 1994 - can invoke a clause that
allows for early redemption if the company changes hands.
Mr Henni Olde Loohuis, Fokker's corporate vice-president of finance, said
that bondholders could only try to redeem if they believed the takeover
meant there was a chance redemption could not take place at maturity.
'In the case of the convertible bonds, the clause is supposed to apply if
the conversion rate itself is hurt,' he said. 'Most probably we could go to
court and say that this does not apply.'
He said a further obstacle faced bondholders who wanted to dispose of the
bonds early. They would also have to hold a meeting and persuade the bond
trustee to invoke the clause.
If the bondholders succeeded, Fokker would not have problems refinancing the
bonds, said Mr Loohuis. The source of the new funds would not necessarily be
the bond market.
One Dutch banker was doubtful yesterday over the ease of refinancing for
Fokker. 'It would be rare to see an early redemption,' he said. 'But it is
very difficult for me to be positive about the question of refinancing.'
The issue of whether holders would call for an early repayment of the bonds
arose this week after the Dutch government agreed on Friday on the
preconditions for a proposed transaction that would give Dasa 51 per cent of
Fokker.
Fokker wants to join forces with Dasa partly because it lacks the capital to
develop new models of the Fokker 100, its popular short-range aircraft.

ADVANCE Bank Australia, building society turned bank, yesterday announced a
31 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 45m (Dollars 33.5m) for the
year to May.
The board declared a final dividend of 24 cents, taking the total dividend
to 38 cents, compared with 29 cents in the previous year. The shares rose by
29 cents after the announcement to close at ADollars 5.20.
Mr James Service, chairman, said the 'highly satisfactory' outcome was
caused by strong residential lending and continuing efforts to reduce
operating costs.
He said expenses rose by only 4 per cent, in spite of expanding the
Sydney-based bank's branch network into Brisbane and other parts of
south-east Queensland.
Non-performing loans fell to ADollars 116m from ADollars 189m, equivalent to
2 per cent of total advances. This compared with 2.6 per cent in the
previous year.
ASB Bank, New Zealand's largest home loan lender, yesterday reported a fall
in net profits to NZDollars 35.4m (Dollars 19.3m) for the year to June 30,
from NZDollars 37.5m a year earlier, in spite of a record second-half
performance, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The directors said growth in business and a tight rein on overheads led to a
75 per cent improvement in operating profits to NZDollars 21.8m in the
second half.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Traders lack interest as activity slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurobond market was subdued yesterday, as depressed European markets and
the summer holiday period slowed activity. Although traders were again
dealing in Ecu bonds in calmer market conditions, after last week's selling
and Friday's suspension of market-making, the market lacked buying interest.
It is likely to remain dormant until the French referendum on European union
in September.
Any activity over the next week or so is likely to be concentrated in the
dollar sector, where historically low interest rates are again tempting US
companies to lock in fixed-rate funding, but many will continue to prefer
the US corporate market to the Eurobond market. Because swap opportunities
are few, most dollar offerings are likely to be for US borrowers prepared to
raise fixed-rate funds.
Investor appetite for dollar paper is not strong, partly due to continuing
nervousness about the weakness of the dollar relative to other currencies.
Once the currency turns, European investors are expected to become
enthusiastic buyers of the sector.
The only substantial issue launched yesterday was a Dollars 510m
three-tranche offering of subordinated debt for Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, which had been pre-placed in Asia Pacific. The bank will use the
proceeds to shore up its capital base, in order to ensure it meets Basle
capital adequacy guidelines.
Abbey National, the UK financial services company, has become the latest
borrower to add a D-Mark option to its Dollars 10bn Euro medium-term note
programme, with Merrill Lynch Bank as arranger.
At least a dozen more companies active in the market, including a number of
UK building societies, are expected to add D-Marks to the range of
currencies which can be used under existing programmes. On August 1, new
Bundesbank rules to liberalise the issuance of D-Mark paper come into force,
providing a lift for the booming Euro MTN market. Last week, Nationwide
Building Society added a D-Mark option to its programme.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will sign the first new
programme to incorporate a D-Mark option on Friday. The signing of the
Ecu1bn programme was delayed to allow the D-Mark option to be included.

TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's monopoly telecommunications company,
yesterday reported net profits of 3,638bn pesos (Dollars 1.16bn) for the
first half to June, up 5.4 per cent on the same period last year.
Operating income advanced to 4,297bn pesos, representing a 12.7 per cent
increase in real terms.
This was struck after extraordinary losses in the second quarter of about
192bn pesos covering pension fund contributions and provisions for obsolete
inventory. If the extraordinary losses are excluded, the underlying increase
in operating income was 22.5 per cent, said Mr Robert Morris of Goldman
Sachs, San Francisco.
Second-quarter earnings per American depositary receipt (ADR) were Dollars
1.03. But excluding the extraordinary losses, and an estimated Dollars 70m
loss on Telmex's non-dollar debt in the second quarter, earnings per ADR
rose to Dollars 1.24, according to Mr Morris.
Telmex added 326,000 new telephone lines in the first half. Lines in service
in the second quarter were up 14.6 per cent, while margins, at 43.9 per
cent, were flat. Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, reported
net profits of 339,000m pesos (Dollars 108m) in the first half, practically
unchanged from the same period last year.
Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, blamed the poor results on the US
recession, the strong peso, and low international prices on glass goods.

CANADA'S two major airlines are resuming merger talks with federal
government approval.
Both Air Canada, privatised two years ago, and Canadian Airlines
International, owned by PWA Corporation of Calgary, took heavy losses in the
first half this year and both are staggering under big debt loads.
They broke off merger talks late last year with acrimony, each saying it
would do better linking up with American carriers to achieve greater access
to the US market.
However, PWA says its lengthy talks with AMR, parent of American Airlines
for an alliance have been terminated. British Airways' acquisition of 21 per
cent of USAir for USDollars 750m last week effectively ended Air Canada's
flirtation with the American carrier.
Air Canada chairman, Mr Claude Taylor, said: 'Powerful market forces compel
carriers to consider all their options and the existing structure of the
Canadian airline industry is not viable.'
He said the merger talks with PWA would resume this week, and Ottawa 'will
be monitoring them closely'.

IMASCO, the Canadian tobacco, financial services, fastfood and retailing

persistent North American recession.
Imasco, 40 per cent owned by BAT Industries of the UK, reported net profits
for the June quarter of CDollars 94.6m (USDollars 78.8m) or 73 cents a
share, up 11 per cent from CDollars 85.5m or 66 cents a year earlier.
Revenues advanced 2 per cent to CDollars 2bn.
First-half earnings rose 15 per cent to CDollars 158.2m or CDollars 1.21 a
share, from CDollars 137.4m or CDollars 1.04 a share, on little-changed
revenues of CDollars 3.9bn.
The biggest gain came in tobacco products. Imperial Tobacco lifted its
domestic cigarette market share to 64.2 per cent, up 3.7 percentage points.
Canada Trust, the financial services arm, increased net profits by 3 per
cent in the second quarter and 11 per cent in the first half. Drug stores
raised profits by 10 per cent in both periods, despite Canada's weak retail
environment.
Hardee's, the US fast-food subsidiary, suffered an 18 per cent fall in
first-half profits, but new marketing efforts were 'encouraging.'

<TEXT>
WEAK international and domestic markets prevented AECI, South Africa's
largest chemical group, from improving earnings in the six months to
end-June, despite the low 1991 base when earnings fell 56 per cent for the
same period.
Turnover rose 1 per cent to R2.52bn (Dollars 91.3m) from R2.5bn and net
trading income gained 9 per cent, to R148m from R136m. But higher finance
costs left attributable income unchanged at R50m. The interim dividend was
maintained at 18 cents a share on unchanged earnings of 32 cents a share.
A feature of the results was the 46 per cent increase in export revenues,
which rose to R296m from R203m. Exports were higher across the range of
group products including plastics, fibres and fertilisers, with a large
portion of the increased sales being to the east, South America and Africa.
The improved export performance reflected, in part, AECI's drive to develop
internationally competitive export businesses. A more important factor,
however, was the exceptionally weak demand across the whole range of AECI's
domestic markets. Export margins are generally lower than in domestic
markets.
Mr Neale Axelson, financial director, said the results were worse than
expected because of the slower than anticipated US economic recovery, the
severe drought in South Africa, and ongoing weakness in world commodity
prices.
These factors, which show little sign of an early correction, have led the
group to revise downward its forecast of a 'moderate improvement in
earnings' for the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express has reported that after-tax operating income fell 30 per
cent to Dollars 269m during the second quarter following a sharp rise in the
cost of promoting and marketing travel services and charge card products.
A series of extraordinary gains and charges, however, meant that Amex's net
consolidated income in the April-to-June period totalled Dollars 310m, or 63
cents a share.
The special items during the quarter were a Dollars 425m gain from a public
offering of First Data Corporation shares in April, a Dollars 300m after-tax
addition to reserves at Balcor, and a previously announced Dollars 84m
after-tax charge at securities subsidiary Shearson Lehman Brothers in
connection with a reduction in the carrying value of its loan to Prime
Computers.
In the second quarter a year ago, Amex's net consolidated income was Dollars
256m, or 53 cents a share. Those figures also reflected a special item - an
after-tax charge of Dollars 130m at Shearson related to the write-down of an
investment in First Capital Holdings and the scaling down of Boston
Company's international lending operations.
The notable feature of Amex's second quarter was the sharp decline in the
contribution to group earnings from its travel services division, where net
income fell almost 50 per cent to Dollars 124m.
Although revenues were slightly higher, due to a rise in charge card
billings and growth in the travel business, marketing and promotion expenses
rose, as did provisions for losses on lending products.
General operating expenses were also up, reflecting the growth in the travel
business, the cost of card member loyalty programmes and other initiatives
designed to strengthen the group's worldwide franchise. Amex warned that its
quarterly marketing and promotion expenses for the rest of the year would
continue at the high levels of the second quarter.
Shearson reported after-tax operating income of Dollars 88m, down slightly
on the Dollars 93m the securities house earned before special charges last
year, while IDS Financial Services posted record quarterly profits of
Dollars 73m, First Data earned Dollars 31m, and American Express Bank
Dollars 19m, all after tax.

TENNECO, the Houston-based conglomerate in the throes of restructuring,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in second-quarter profitability and a
return to the black by its long-struggling JI Case agricultural equipment
business.
However, Tenneco warned that poor market conditions would return Case to the
red in the third quarter, albeit with lower losses than last year, while the
outlook for the fourth quarter was too uncertain to predict.
On Monday Deere &amp; Co, another leading manufacturer of agricultural
equipment, said weak retail markets both in the US and abroad meant its
equipment operations would incur a net loss for the final six months.
Tenneco, which has been cutting costs sharply since the arrival of Mr Mike
Walsh, its new chief executive, reported net income of Dollars 178m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 14m, or 15 cents, in
the second quarter last year. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 3.4bn.
Some 71 cents of the earnings per share came from continuing operations and
52 cents from discontinued ones - mainly a gain from the sale of the
company's mineral operations.
Mr Walsh said despite the problems at Case, the group's outlook for the rest
of the year was for continued favourable comparisons with 1991.
Case reported an operating profit of Dollars 11m - its first profit in six
quarters - compared with a loss of Dollars 123m a year ago. This was despite
a 10 per cent drop in sales revenue.
The company said about 40 per cent of the Dollars 134m positive swing came
from cost reduction, 40 per cent from price increases and 20 per cent from
other factors. Operating expenses had been reduced by Dollars 45m. Much was
due to job cuts which by the end of the year will have lowered Case's
headcount to 19,000, from 30,000 at the end of 1990.
However, Tenneco warned that Case's production cuts had not been sufficient
to keep up with a year-on-year drop of about 20 per cent in demand, both in
the construction and agricultural equipment markets. As a result, production
would now be cut by an additional 9 per cent and this, coupled with earlier
production, would mean 1992 production about 20 per cent below 1991.
Tenneco's other businesses also reported improved results: Packaging
Corporation of America had operating income of Dollars 59m, up from Dollars
25m; chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson made Dollars 19m, against Dollars 7m;
Tenneco Gas made Dollars 73m, against Dollars 67m; automotive made Dollars
73m, up from Dollars 66m; and the Newport News shipyard was Dollars 1m ahead
at Dollars 67m
In the first half the group made net income of Dollars 211m, or Dollars 1.43
a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 13m, or 18 cents, a year ago.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF leaves Loral as sole
buyer of LTV unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group,
yesterday pulled out of a planned deal to buy a stake in the missiles
division of LTV of the US.
Loral, a New York-based defence electronics manufacturer which last week
announced plans to buy the LTV missiles unit with Thomson as a minority
partner, said yesterday it planned to go ahead with the purchase on its own
at a price of not more than Dollars 240m.
Thomson had originally planned to acquire the whole missiles division from
LTV, with Carlyle Group, a Washington DC investment bank, taking the
aircraft unit. The French group had to back down in the face of a hostile
reception in the US Congress and defence department, and a restructured deal
was announced last week in which Loral would take control of the division
with Thomson taking a minority stake.
Thomson yesterday refused to comment on its withdrawal, except to say it
regarded its original deal with LTV, which is under the supervision of a
bankruptcy court, as 'having been terminated'.
Loral, however, said it had been unable to satisfy Thomson's demands for a
greater participation, including a seat on the board. It added that it
expected the deal to boost its earnings by 40 cents a share.
Thomson's hopes of entering the US missiles market through the purchase ran
into the opposition of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two leading US defence
companies, which together had hoped to buy the LTV operations.
In repeated congressional hearings Thomson was lambasted as the tool of a
sinister French conspiracy to take over the world defence industry. Senators
complained that US defence secrets would be siphoned overseas, and US
defence companies damaged by unfair competition from a state-owned rival.
The initial Thomson offer was withdrawn when it became plain that it would
be rejected by the committee on foreign investment in the US, a body chaired
by the US Treasury which rules on foreign acquisitions of companies in
sensitive technology areas.
Loral yesterday reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 29m, or 85
cents a share, against Dollars 22.4m, or 83 cents a year earlier, Karen
Zagor reports from New York. Sales were slightly higher, at Dollars 681m
compared with Dollars 677m.
Operating income for the three months to June 31 rose 7 per cent to Dollars
68.8m from Dollars 64.1m. Bookings stood at Dollars 502m in the latest
quarter against Dollars 492m last year, while Loral's backlog slipped 5 per
cent to Dollars 2.73bn from Dollars 2.88bn.
Mr Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said the company
expected 'income, bookings, sales and margins to accelerate as the year
progresses, with double digit per share earnings increase for the year,
without acquisitions'.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Income leaps at USX thanks to
tax refund
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USX yesterday reported a return to profit by its US Steel subsidiary, the
largest steel manufacturer in the US, as the metals and energy group
reported a jump in consolidated second-quarter net income from Dollars 25m
to Dollars 232m, helped by a big tax refund.
US Steel made operating income of Dollars 45m, and net income of Dollars 6m,
or 10 cents a share, compared with losses of Dollars 32m, Dollars 39m and 79
cents respectively in the second quarter of last year. The figures were
broadly in line with analysts' expectations.
US Steel is the first major US steel manufacturer to report a return to
profit since the recession of 1991, but few, if any of its rivals, are
expected to follow suit until later this year.
A downturn in US demand and global over-capacity have kept steel prices
extremely weak while many US manufacturers are still carrying out costly
modernisations.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX, said its steel operat-ions were
benefiting from modernisation, and cost reductions, but prices remained
severely depressed, mainly due to subsidised and dumped imports.
Second-quarter shipments were up 7 per cent from a year ago, but were only
modestly above the first quarter. Shipments were expected to remain flat in
the third quarter.
USX, which last year split its shares into two units, one for its steel
business and one for its energy side, reports the two divisions' results
separately.
Its USX-Marathon energy business recorded second-quarter net income of
Dollars 226m, or 79 cents, compared with Dollars 64m, or 25 cents, in the
second quarter last year. Sales dipped from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.2bn.
The Marathon group's operating income was Dollars 191m, just Dollars 10m
higher than a year before. The figures included a Dollars 119m tax refund, a
Dollars 98m non-cash revaluation reserve adjustment and a Dollars 115m
restructuring charge.
The bottom line jump was due mainly to Dollars 109m in net financial income,
against an Dollars 83m outflow a year ago. This was primarily the result of
interest on the tax refund.
For the six months, USX as a whole reported net income of Dollars 254m,
against a Dollars 212m loss.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bull registers FFr1.68bn loss on
high debt charges
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BULL, the French state-owned computer maker, yesterday reported a slightly
worse than expected FFr1.68bn (Dollars 336m) loss for the first half of the
year, burdened by high debt charges and the continued decline in its main
markets.
The loss compares with the FFr1.5bn forecast given by former chairman Mr
Francis Lorentz last month, half of which was financing charges. However,
this is a 13.4 per cent improvement on the FFr1.94bn net deficit in the same
period of 1991.
The operating loss decreased in the second quarter, for the sixth
consecutive three monthly period, said a Bull official. Operating losses
were FFr857m in the first six months of this year, a FFr435m improvement on
the FFr1.29bn operating loss in the first half of 1991. Sales fell by 9.2
per cent from FFr15.2bn to FFr13.8bn over the period.
Bull attributed the improvement to the reduction in costs through its
restructuring plan, under which it has announced a 20 per cent cut in its
workforce and the closure of seven of its 13 plants. It is on track to meet
its target of breaking even at the operating level by the end of this year,
said an official.
The company's interest charges are also likely to fall, thanks to a FFr4bn
injection of capital from the French government, recently approved by the
European Commission, to the irritation of the UK Government which believes
this will distort free competition.
The results place Bull roughly in the lower middle range of leading computer
companies' recent performance. Digital Equipment last week revealed a
first-quarter loss of Dollars 1.85bn, most of which was restructuring
charges, while IBM revealed disappointing profits, sending its share price
into a decline. Compaq, by contrast, reported a 43 per cent jump in
second-quarter earnings, after slashing its prices.

BAYERISCHE Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank) yesterday said group
operating profits rose nearly 12.7 per cent to DM769m (Dollars 513m) in the
first half of this year.
Higher lending volume and improved margins had enabled the bank to lift net
interest income by 16.4 per cent to DM1.6bn, while net fee income was 6.6
per cent up at DM266m.
The bank said it was still following a cautious risk policy and ensuring
that credit volume in eastern Germany did not grow excessively.
Hypo-Bank was optimistic about prospects for the rest of the year, based on
lively credit demand.
Total group lending, including mortgage business, rose by 6.8 per cent to
DM161bn between December 31 1991 and the end of June.
The bank said group partial operating profits were 23 per cent higher at
DM759m.
This was after a drop of 84 per cent to DM10m in profits on own account
trading. All comparisons are with half of the figure for the whole of 1991.

car accord

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT and Peugeot, the French carmakers, yesterday announced a
co-operation accord to help the development of electric cars over the next
three years.
They have agreed to set up battery recharging points, servicing and
maintenance for electric cars in at least 10 French cities, with the help of
a FFr500m (Dollars 98.03m) government research grant, of which FFr300m is
set aside for this project.
Electric cars, produced in very small numbers in France, have a future as
second cars for short journeys, said Mrs Segolene Royal, environment
minister.
Around half of every car journey made in France is less than 3km and second
cars travel on average less than 40km per week, the ideal range for electric
vehicles, she said.
France's plentiful supplies of low-cost nuclear generated electricity
provided a good environment for electric cars, said Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, industry minister.
The aim is to build a compatible infrastructure to support Peugeot's and
Renault's separate ranges of electric cars by the time they come into
commercial production. Peugeot estimates there will be a European market for
at least 200,000 electric cars a year by the end of the decade.
Peugeot and its sister company Citroen over the past three years have sold
300 small commercial vans, conventional models converted to electric power,
mostly to local authorities. It plans to launch an adapted electric Peugeot
106 hatchback and a Citroen AX in 1995, 50 of which will go on trial at La
Rochelle.
Renault also has a pilot range of electric vans, based on a six-year test by
local authority services in Chatelleraut, south-west France. These are due
for commercial sale next year and Renault is planning to sell an adapted
electric Clio hatchback from 1994.
Further ahead, it is working on two purpose designed electric cars, as
distinct from converted models. These are the Elegie, designed for
short-range city use, for possible sale from 1995, and the Vert, with both
petrol and electric engines for longer journeys, for possible sale at the
end of the decade.

FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: EC to seek Ecu500m in syndicated
loans market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is poised to tap the international syndicated loans
market for the first time in nearly a decade with a three-year Ecu500m
(Dollars 675m) facility. The proceeds will finance imports of agricultural
and medical products by the republics which formerly made up the Soviet
Union.
The EC is expected to award the mandate to a European bank this week.
Deutsche Bank and National Westminster Bank are among those which have bid
for the position of lead manager, although Banque Nationale de Paris and
Societe Generale have been mentioned as contenders.
The EC traditionally prefers to borrow in the international bond markets -
where it can fund at below the London interbank offered rate (Libor) -
rather than the international syndicated loans market where pricing is much
higher.
An EC official stressed that in the case of funding exports to former Soviet
republics, the EC had chosen a syndicated loan 'because it gives us
flexibility to choose the date of drawing the funds.
'In this case we will need a lengthy draw-down period which would be
difficult to arrange with a bond where we would have to take the funds and
then be exposed to an interest rate risk.'
The EC last tapped the international syndicated loans market in 1983 with a
Dollars 1.24bn term loan. Last November it provided a guarantee for 98 per
cent of an Ecu500m loan to the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the
USSR, arranged by Deutsche Bank.
The financing covered food exports from the EC to Russia and the margin was
50 basis points over Libor, with 'generous fees,' Deutsche Bank said.
However, bankers say the latest loan will be much more tightly priced given
that the actual borrower is the EC, a triple-A rated name which is zero-risk
weighted for capital adequacy purposes.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Capita advances 28% to Pounds 1.77m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITA GROUP, which supplies computer and management services to the public
sector, said it was poised to benefit from the prime minister's declared
policy of subjecting more central government activities to the discipline of
the market.
The group reported a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 1.77m in pre-tax profits
for the six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 13.7m, a rise of 24 per
cent. About two thirds of the profits growth came from acquisitions, with
the rest organic.
Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman and chief executive, said the best performance
came from the facilities management division, which supplies computer,
managed and property services, but the consultancy and marketing services
divisions both showed a downturn in difficult trading conditions.
The facilities management division increased trading profits from Pounds
586,000 to Pounds 1.07m on turnover of Pounds 7.08m (Pounds 3.91m). At June
30 the division's forward projected income stood at Pounds 64m (Pounds 38m).
Mr Aldridge said Telecom Capita, its computer services subsidiary, had
invested heavily to become a market leader in providing computer services to
local government over the next 24 months.
The division's managed service companies secured 27 contracts for its
computerised revenue collection service. Capita has also become the first
company to take responsibility for managing the entire revenue function of a
local authority - East Cambridgeshire District Council. The group believes
this contract, worth Pounds 3.5m over five years, will be the first of many.
The consultancy division saw trading profits fall from Pounds 544,000 to
Pounds 466,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 4.93m). Capita Corporate
Finance performed strongly, advising on local authority buy-outs, and the
result of the election had further enhanced its prospects.
Management consultancy had performed below expectations, but Mr Aldridge
said he was confident a thriving business could be developed and the senior
management team would be strengthened following the recent appointment of a
new managing director.
Trading profits of the marketing division fell to Pounds 237,000 (Pounds
252,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 2.27m). The group said that
while the market continued to be rough, it had secured several new clients.
Capita had bank balances of Pounds 7.6m, despite outgoings of Pounds 1.6m on
acquisitions and capital expenditure. The group said its strong balance
sheet was a useful selling point with local authorities, since it provided
reassurance that it would be able to complete long-term contracts.
Earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to 7.6p. The interim dividend is
raised to 2.1p (1.8p) and a final dividend of 4.2p (3.6p) is forecast giving
a total for the year of 6.3p, a rise of 17 per cent.

The year was marked by a reduction in exposure to North America and profit

increased and the Pacific region remains the main investment area.
Net revenue was Pounds 2.57m (Pounds 2.93m) for earnings of 4.62p (5.27p) or
4.59p (5.23p) allowing for full conversion of B shares. The proposed final
dividend is 2.75p for a total of 4p (3.75p). An interim of 1.35p (1.2p) is
declared for the present year.

red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hadleigh Industries Group, the USM-quoted industrial holding company, ended
the year to March 31 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.15m.
This compares with a profit of Pounds 1.77m last time and comes from
turnover down from Pounds 34.4m to Pounds 29.5m.
The result reflected an unsettled year for the company - the accounts for
the first half were restated and some principal board members were replaced.
Of this year's loss some Pounds 400,000 represented property revaluations,
exceptional items and provisions for reorganisation costs.
The company said gearing had been reduced from 85 per cent to 70 per cent
during the year and steps had been taken to dispose of all investment
properties.
Losses per share came out at 8.7p (17.2p earnings). There is no final
dividend so the total for the year is 1.25p (6.5p).

<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 510,000 were reported by Eliza Tinsley
Group, the USM-quoted hardware products company, for the year to March 31.
Profits last time were Pounds 830,000.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 15.3m), generating operating
profits of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 970,000).
The pre-tax result was after exceptional reorganisation and redundancy costs
of Pounds 342,000 as a result of integrating the distribution activities of
Griffin with those of Eliza Tinsley and transferring the manufacturing
activities carried out at Reddal Hill Road to JT Parkes.
Mr Edward Jeynes, chairman, said he expected benefits of the reorganisation
to start coming through in the current year.
An unchanged final dividend of 3.4p is proposed for a maintained 5.2p total.
Earnings per share dropped to 4.72p (8.02p).

A higher tax charge of Pounds 637,000 (Pounds 275,000) meant that earnings

BROWN &amp; JACKSON, which operates the Poundstretcher discount stores, returned
to profits at the interim stage after suffering losses of Pounds 14.9m for
the previous nine month period.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 1.75m on
sales of Pounds 106.3m. The dividend is passed, as indicated at the time of
the capital reconstruction. Earnings per share were 0.5p.
The result was not comparable with the last year's interim because the the
financial year has been changed to December 31.
The group will next announce results for the nine months to June 30. The
year end figures will be for the 15 months to December 31.
Mr Ian Grey, chief executive, warned against reading too much into the
current results. Historically, three out of the four quarters produce a
loss.
Poundstretcher's March quarter sales represented a like for like decline of
8 per cent over the previous period.
Earlier this year the group raised Pounds 15.6m through a placing and open
offer and disposed of both Advanced Technology Industries and A &amp; G Imports.

WITHIN THE context of the declining construction market, Ashtead Group saw
pre-tax profits shrink from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 2.27m in the year to

However, the equipment rental company maintained its final dividend at

necessary to 'adopt a short-term siege mentality'.
The shares, however, dropped 18p to 120p.
Both Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, and Mr George Burnett, managing director,
said they were proud of the strength of the balance sheet.
At the same time they were aware of the need to avoid complacency in a
sector which has seen more than 200 plant hire outlets close in the year.
Pricing, said Mr Burnett, had fallen by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent
in the past three years, especially in the hard hit south-east of England.
Volumes had held up and there had been some gain in market share as other
companies had gone to the wall.
Mr Lewis said, however, that the company had avoided the pursuit of turnover
for its own sake.
'This year we've walked away from more business than we've ever done,' said
Mr Burnett.
Ashtead had withdrawn, at the end of 1991, from an acquisition which would
have made it 'the largest player at one bound'. Having stalked the
loss-making target, 'a significant subsidiary of a larger parent', for three
years, it was put off the deal simply by external economic conditions.
'We needed some help from the market place and there wasn't any,' said Mr
Lewis.
He added that none of Ashtead's quoted rivals have made substantial
acquisitions. The due diligence costs of Pounds 65,000 were taken as an
exceptional charge.
As a result, proceeds of April 1991's Pounds 5.8m rights issue reduced
borrowings to Pounds 8.51m (Pounds 14.1m) giving gearing of 43 per cent (72
per cent).
The strength of the balance sheet allowed the company to spend Pounds 7.8m
(Pounds 8.5m) on capital expenditure.
Group turnover slipped to Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 31.4m) and operating profits
to Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 5.91m). The interest charge fell to Pounds 1.12m
(Pounds 1.9m).
Earnings declined to 7.2p (13.9p) per share.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis wins Olympics deal with airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the music publishing, communications and media group, has won its
first in-flight entertainment contract - providing highlights of the
Barcelona Olympics to airlines.
Fifteen leading airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Singapore
and Qantas, are taking a daily 15-minute highlights package delivered by
satellite.
Chrysalis, which has been attempting to build up its television interests,
bought the in-flight rights outside the US from the International Olympic
Committee.
Coverage is provided by TVE, the host broadcaster, by 1am and is then edited
and scripted by 5am.
The completed package is distributed to airline offices by the Eutelsat
organisation, in most cases in time to be carried on early morning flights.
Airlines pay a flat Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,150) for the coverage but most
of the revenue comes from advertising and sponsorship by Olympic sponsors
such as Coca Cola or Panasonic.
Mr Niall McBain, head of special projects at Chrysalis Television, hoped
that the deal would lead to in-flight coverage of other events.
Chrysalis is also hoping to enter the larger market of operating and
packaging programmes for the new six-channel choice television systems being
installed by airlines.
The company, which is developing plans for a games channel on cable
television, also has bought the UK home video rights for the Barcelona
Olympics.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fitch shares suspended as refinancing talks
begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Fitch, the loss-making design consultant which expanded rapidly in
the image conscious 1980s, were suspended at 41p yesterday as the group
announced it was in talks with its bankers on a refinancing.
The company, which in April reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 417,000 for
1991, said its shares had been temporarily suspended 'pending clarification
of the company's financial position'.
Mr Rodney Fitch, chairman, said the group was not in breach of its banking
convenants. Fitch hoped to make an announcement about a capital
restructuring within the next few weeks, he added.
A possible deal would include a capital injection from a third party, which
was not a financial institution. The final form of a refinancing and the
amount of cash injected depended on how the company's two London properties
were treated, he said.
Fitch carries some Pounds 7.5m of debt and gearing of about 260 per cent,
largely due to the move to its King's Cross headquarters. The building cost
Pounds 13.6m to build, but is valued in Fitch's books at just Pounds 6.75m.
The company has also had difficulty in shedding its former base in Soho,
which remained largely unlet, said Mr Fitch. A capital injection could come
in exchange for the sale of a building, while another possibility was a
debt-for-equity swap.
Mr Fitch said the refinancing had been an 'internally generated
reconstruction' to deal with the dual pressures of the economic downturn and
the properties' drain on resources.
'We are talking about a financial restructuring,' he said. 'We are not
talking about a reconstruction of Fitch.' The chairman said that business
remained difficult. It was not likely that the company would resume dividend
payments in the immediate future, he added.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Competition hits YRM and Aukett Associates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Aukett Associates yesterday fell from 9 1/2 p to 4p after
the architect announced that it had incurred a loss of Pounds 1.16m during
the six months to the end of March.
This compared with a profit of Pounds 740,000 during the corresponding
period last year.
The company said it would not be paying an interim dividend, against 1.25p.
YRM, another quoted architect, also saw its share price slip yesterday -
from 55p to 53p - after revealing a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.37m over the year to the end of April.
Turnover fell by 16.9 per cent, from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 19.6m.
The final dividend is cut to 2.35p (3.35p) making a total of 4p (5p),
covered 1.4 times by earnings per share, which fell from 9.35p to 5.78p.
YRM and Aukett both said increased competition for work in the recession-hit
UK construction market had led to a sharp reduction in fees, only partially
offset by increased earnings from continental Europe.
Aukett's turnover during the first half of its financial year fell by 36 per
cent to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 8.35m).
Mr Gerry Deighton, chairman, said fees had fallen faster than the company
could cut overheads, resulting in losses.
Aukett also made an exceptional provision of Pounds 788,000 to cover
redundancy costs and property write-downs, which increased the pre-tax
deficit.
At the operating level it made a loss of Pounds 369,000 (Pounds 770,000
profit).
Mr Deighton expected a return to operating profit for the final three months
of the financial year, although the company would make a loss for the year
overall as the effects of cutbacks and redundancies began to work through.
Losses per share at halfway were 7.31p (3.42p profit).
The group's most pressing problem is to reduce borrowings. Net debt of
Pounds 2.9m at the end of the previous financial year had risen to Pounds
3.2m - more than double shareholders funds of Pounds 1.25m.
Mr Richard Warner, finance director, stressed that the company was operating
within its loan covenants and had the full support of its bankers.
With gearing of only 9 per cent, YRM is in a much stronger position.
Mr Tim Poulson, chief executive, said that despite difficult trading
conditions in the UK the company had recently won some important
commissions.
By the end of the year it expected to be generating about 20 per cent of its
work in continental Europe, where it had established offices in Paris and
Berlin.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: A more compact product in a crowded market
/ A look at the future direction of Amstrad in the wake of a difficult week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESSION of disturbing news last week from Amstrad, the UK computer
and electronics group, left the distinct impression of a company in turmoil.
On Wednesday, Mr Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's corporate finance director,
resigned from the group's board to join Betacom, a telephone equipment
distributor 71 per cent owned by Amstrad.
That news was followed by a profits warning on Thursday and the sudden
resignation of Mr Peter Thoms, group finance director, the next day.
Amstrad's share price has duly fallen to 26p against cash balances which
equate to 20p a share. 'It really puts a derisory value on the business,'
says Mr Evan Miller at Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities.
The sudden departure of two finance directors within days would have been
alarming news from any company at any time. But coming from a company that
faces the challenges Amstrad does it could not have failed to raise serious
questions about the future of the UK group.
There is no question yet about whether Amstrad has a future.
While the group now expects the loss for the year to June 30 to be Pounds
65m, or Pounds 25m more than previously estimated, and the outlook for its
markets in electronic products does not look particularly bright, Mr Alan
Sugar, its founder and chairman, has managed the balance sheet effectively,
and raised the group's cash from about Pounds 60m a year ago to Pounds 100m.
Amstrad has also managed to win markets with its lower-priced fax machines
and double decker video cassette recorders and has an established reputation
in the satellite dish market.
It has a number of new products lined up, based on the bright market ideas
that are its hallmark, such as a user friendly personal organiser/word
processor, a combined but compact telephone/fax machine and a consumer
videophone.
But the question that keeps cropping up, as Amstrad has found its revenue
bases eroded one by one by slow demand, tumbling prices and intensified
competition from larger concerns, is where the group is going from here.
One suggestion is that Amstrad is shrinking to a size more appropriate to
the role it can play in the industry.
The recent resignations seen against the fall in the company's sales base
from a peak of about Pounds 625m three years ago to about Pounds 300m, has
prompted Mr Paul Norris at BZW to ask whether Mr Sugar is not already
'restructuring the infrastructure of the business to smaller proportions, to
a size similar to what it was when he was younger.'
It would not be surprising if that were the case.
Amstrad has grown by providing markets with consumer products based on
bright ideas at low prices.
That strategy is now under question as the sharp fall in prices in its main
market and the slump in others have hurt.
Doubt is mounting about whether a group that has grown by bringing
low-priced but quality products to fill a gap in the market has a place in
the rapidly-changing electronics world of today.
For example, it is increasingly difficult to see Amstrad succeeding in the
PC market, which contributed 54 per cent of turnover last year, on the basis
of low prices when prices are falling in the market virtually across the
board and market leaders such as IBM and Compaq have been affected enough to
launch their own lower-priced PCs.
'Trying to be a low-cost supplier in this market is suicidal,' says Mr
Miller. 'They are a gnat in the PC market compared to the elephants that are
the Japanese and US players which are becoming increasingly aggressive in
the European market. The nature of the competition is such that it is
difficult to be optimistic.'
Meanwhile, the bright product ideas that Amstrad has come up with to attract
consumer demand, are not considered innovative enough to produce the large
consumer hits that it desperately needs.
The Notepad, a new user-friendly portable PC that performs the functions of
a personal organiser, calculator and word processor may address an untapped
market of computer-illiterate consumers but it is a concept that has been
seen on the market before.
The videophone, which is another potential hit, given that price will be a
decisive factor for the home market, is dogged by the lack of an
international standard for the kind of videophones based on analogue
technology that Amstrad is launching.
Amstrad could soon find itself in the middle of a standards war, or worse
yet, on the losing side.
Another pitfall in its bright ideas strategy is perhaps the fact that any
feature added to a product soon becomes taken for granted by consumers and
loses its added-value appeal.
But the greatest problem may be that Amstrad's markets are simply
overcrowded.
Even the telecoms market, which the group is targeting, is not likely to be
as smooth going as Amstrad would like.
Mr Sugar, who has bright visions for Amstrad's telecoms business, expects
telecommunications-related businesses to comprise as much as 30 to 40 per
cent of total sales in two to three years' time.
Amstrad is not, however, alone in identifying the telecoms market as a
growth business. 'If the PC market is crowded the telephone equipment market
is inundated,' says Mr Miller.
If Mr Sugar is indeed slimming down the business it may be that several
years from now Amstrad will be a smaller but profitable business.
But judging from the recent performance of Amstrad's share price few people
it seems are as yet willing to bet on that.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Shandwick in the black but omits pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANDWICK, one of the world's biggest public relations companies, is passing
its interim dividend in spite of returning to the black in the six months to
April 30.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.54m were well down on the Pounds 8.12m made in
the six months to January 1991, the nearest comparable period after a change
in year-end.
However, they are a considerable improvement on the plunge into losses of
Pounds 1.44m for the 15 months to last October.
When those losses were flagged in December, Shandwick's share price dropped
from 125p to 52 1/2 p. Yesterday they closed 1p lower at 11p, valuing the
group at less than Pounds 10m.
Turnover was Pounds 79.1m (Pounds 75.6m). Profits were struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 309,000, relating to part of the costs of
refinancing earlier this year, and interest payments of Pounds 2.81m (Pounds
2m). The full refinancing costs of Pounds 1.7m will be taken as an
exceptional charge at the end of the current year.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The economic
conditions in which our clients trade throughout the world remain extremely
poor and show little or no sign of improvement.'
The group has negotiated banking facilities totalling Pounds 65m until next
March, which it said were sufficient for forecasted needs. At April 30 net
debt stood at Pounds 58.3m, an increase of Pounds 9m in the half-year. Net
debt is expected to peak at Pounds 60m by the year-end, and to decrease
thereafter.
The group has a Pounds 987,000 loan outstanding to its Employee Share
Ownership Plan, secured by shares which are currently worth only Pounds
109,000. The board said it would review the need for any write-down on this
loan at the year-end.
Shandwick, which grew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s, made
acquisition-related payments of Pounds 6.2m in the half-year, with a further
Pounds 2m payable in the second half.
Staff numbers have been reduced by 15 per cent from more than 2,200 in
January last year to 1,870 at present.
The group said it had been profitable, after central costs and interest,
every month since last December.
Although, for the first time in its history, operating income declined
slightly, the resilience of the income stream was in large part because some
70 per cent of fees came from existing clients.
Earnings for the period were 0.9p (6.4p) per share.

ML LABORATORIES, the USM-quoted company which is researching treatments for
Aids and kidney patients, is raising Pounds 15.8m through a 1-for-10 rights
issue of 2.49m shares at 650p apiece.
Proceeds will be used to fund construction of a manufacturing plant to

The shares yesterday fell by 28p to 735p.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by Hoare Govett Corporate Finance who

ML's losses trebled to Pounds 460,000 in the year to September 30 compared
with a deficit of Pounds 116,000 last time.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Auditors to resist ADT writ strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BINDER HAMLYN, the accountancy firm, yesterday vigorously defended itself
against a writ issued by ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction
company, in connection with the company's Pounds 110m takeover of Britannia
Security Group.
Mr John Norton, Binder's managing partner, who said he had not yet seen the
writ but knew it had been issued, said: 'We will be resisting it very
strongly.'
The writ accuses Binders of negligent misrepresentation in its role as
auditors to Britannia prior to the takeover of the company by ADT in January
1990.
Binders approved the company's accounts, and is also believed to have held a
meeting with ADT as part of the due diligence which took place before the
acquisition was agreed.
When a more detailed statement of claims is issued to back up the writ, it
is likely to press for damages of up to Dollars 278m (Pounds 146m). This
represents the total value of goodwill written off after the acquisition, as
shown in ADT's 1991 annual accounts.
The report showed that a review of Britannia's businesses showed certain
assets, particularly subscriber systems installed at customer premises had
been included in the accounts 'at values materially in excess of their net
realisable value'.
Mr David Hammond, ADT's deputy chairman, said the company is continuing to
take professional advice on all aspects of the acquis-ition.
He did not rule out legal action against others who were involved, but said
it would not cover the company's own advisers at the time of the takeover.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King declines slightly to Pounds
21.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIMON REDMAN, chairman of Greene King, the Suffolk-based brewer,
yesterday spelt out the costly legacy of its Pounds 104m bid for Morland,
its Oxfordshire rival, which failed last week. He was speaking after
reporting a slight fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 21.9m in the year to
May 3.
Greene King launched its bid for Morland in June and holds a 29.3 per cent
stake, bought at a cost of Pounds 28m or 450p a share. Morland shares closed
unchanged at 418p, and Greene King's fell 1p to 474p.
Mr Redman said the yield on Morland shares at 450p was 2.5 per cent and the
annual carrying cost of the stake would be Pounds 2.25m. The costs of the
bid would be reflected in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3m in the
current year's accounts.
The cost of buying the Morland shares lifted the group's debt to Pounds 75m
and its gearing to about 33 per cent against 27 per cent at the previous
year end.
Mr Redman said another bid for Morland did not appear attractive, but would
depend on conditions in a year's time when the group would be free under
takeover rules to rebid.
Analysts said it was unlikely Greene King could sell its stake in Morland,
except at a large loss, as other companies would be unlikely to try a bid
where Greene King had failed.
Mr Redman said he was now looking to expand the business organically. The
company has 825 pubs giving it plenty of headroom to expand.
The announcement of the group's results had been delayed until the Morland
bid closed. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 21.9m from Pounds 22.1m in the
previous 53 week period.
Mr Redman said trading conditions had been 'extremely tough', but Greene
King's beer sales by volume fell only 2 per cent compared to a 10 per cent
fall in the market in the south-east as a whole.
Group sales improved 1.8 per cent to Pounds 128.6m, and trading profits rose
9.6 per cent to Pounds 25.3m, despite an increase in bad debts from Pounds
1m to Pounds 1.9m. The group's properties were revalued and showed an Pounds
11.6m surplus over the valuation five years earlier.
The net interest charge was Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.9m). Property profits fell
from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.3m. Earnings per share were 40.1p, up 5 per cent,
while a final dividend of 8.1p takes the total to 11.6p.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Bio-technology loss doubles to
Pounds 11.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Bio-technology, the recently floated pharmaceuticals group,
yesterday reported losses before tax for the year ended April 30 almost
doubled from Pounds 6.13m to Pounds 11.6m.
Mr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, said the results were in line with
expectations. Product research and development expenditure was likely to
increase from about Pounds 11.5m in 1991 to about Pounds 15m this year, he
said. This would lead to losses about 50 per cent higher for the current
year.
Losses per share increased from 34.9p to 44.9p. The company is not paying a
dividend.
Net cash outflow was Pounds 12m (Pounds 10m), partly because of increased
spending. However, revenues fell from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.1m.
Mr McCullagh said this followed a decision to push through more research to
the development stage, allowing the company to generate more substantial
revenues at a later date.
The balance sheet remained strong with cash reserves of more than Pounds 37m
at the year end, he said. This had been increased to Pounds 60m following
the flotation, and would allow the group to extend its clinical trial
programme.
Mr McCullagh said the group's strategy was to sell the marketing rights for
medicines that would be prescribed by general practitioners, but keep the UK
and possibly European rights for products to be sold into hospitals. These
drugs required smaller, less expensive, sales forces.
British Bio-technology would be looking to sign a co-development and
marketing deal, late this year or early next year, with a significant
pharmaceuticals company for its Aids vaccine. The drug has completed phase I
safety trials on healthy volunteers and the group is hoping to establish its
efficacy with further trials.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Allied Textile outperforms sector with
Pounds 5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Allied Textile Companies, the Yorkshire-based wool group,
slipped to Pounds 5.21m in the six months to March 31.
Last time's reported result was Pounds 5.31m but was restated to Pounds
6.51m to comply with new accounting policies adopted on current and fixed
asset investments valued at market value rather than at cost.
Mr Gerald Wightman, finance director, said textile profits were 'down
marginally in the half', though he pointed out that competitors in the
sector had been reporting losses or sharp downturns.
He ascribed Allied's relative immunity to the sector malaise to 'the more
realistic approach of our management' and the fact that 'we have a wider
spread than most'.
Carpets, he said, did less well than last time.
The domestic market, tied to housing and construction, was poor and the
Blackburn factory was closed.
On the contract side, pub and club refurbishment was stalled by monopoly
deliberations, he said, but bespoke carpets - for the likes of the
Dorchester Hotel in London and luxury liners Cunard Princess and Sea
Countess - had done well.
Nylon fabrics, boosted last year by Ministry of Defence orders for
sand-coloured camouflage netting, had returned to the levels of two years'
ago, but materials for uniforms and corporate clothing did well, especially
in the export market.
Fully fashioned knitwear had seen an upturn, as competitors had gone under
and knitwear became more fashionable.
The company derives about one third of its profits from investments.
It has maintained its cash pile at about Pounds 17m and Mr Wightman expected
that to remain the case until the year-end, by which time the company would
have incurred about Pounds 5m capital expenditure.
The sale of properties has slowed to a crawl - in 1990 disposals earned some
Pounds 4m, in 1991 a mere Pounds 71,000, and in the period under review
'just a few thousand'.
Turnover rose to Pounds 63m (Pounds 59m). Earnings per share slipped to
12.38p (12.81p as reported and 15.71p restated).
The interim dividend is lifted from 4.4p to 4.5p.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon acts to reassure shareholders

<TEXT>
HARLAND SIMON, the loss-making controls systems group, yesterday acted to
reassure nervous investors who have seen the share price plunge from 585p in
February to last night's 15p.
The company said recent press comment had prompted clarification of its
trading status. 'The core businesses . . . are fundamentally sound and
capable of trading profitably', it said. Progress was being made on the
disposals of peripheral businesses, Vickerys, Contraves, Pro-Aqua and NEF.
The company also responded to reports of investor unrest over Harland's
relationship with PIL, a loss-making information network company. Harland's
pension fund has come under fire for a Pounds 500,000 investment in PIL.
Harland has repaid the money to the pension fund.
Harland stressed that shares held by Sandford Etablissements in PIL had at
no time been held for the benefit of a director of Harland, or a company in
the group.
The company said it had tried to obtain information about the beneficial
ownership of the shares, but without success. 'The board has always believed
that beneficial ownership was with Oerlikon Buhrle,' the statement said. The
group added that its investment in PIL would not be long-term. Harland holds
63 per cent of of the information network company.
Earlier this month, Harland announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m for the
year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds 9.88m.

FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Coal ready to sell smokeless fuel
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is preparing to sell Coal Products, its smokeless fuel
business, to a single trade buyer.
The planned sale of the wholly owned subsidiary is a commercial decision by
BC, independent of the government, before the run-up to privatisation of the
corporation.
Coal Products Limited made operating profit of Pounds 2m for the year ended
March 28. Last year it had debt of Pounds 50m; it has not yet filed its
separate accounts for this year.
Anglo United, owner of Coalite smokeless fuel, is likely to be the main
contender to buy CPL.
Although Mr David McErlain, Anglo's chairman, was unavailable for comment
yesterday, he recently expressed interest in buying the business.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, BC's former commercial director who now runs his own
energy business, said: 'The price for CPL should be related to its realistic
earnings capacity and not to its inherited debt.'
BC has decided first to shut CPL's loss-making Avenue Coke and Chemical
plant near Chesterfield, which produces Sunbright fuel for the domestic
closed fire market. BC said it would be meeting with the employees on
Monday.
Anglo is likely to become an immediate beneficiary of the decision. Last
year it introduced its Blasebright product, for the domestic closed fire
market, in the expectation that BC's Chesterfield plant would close.
Anglo currently produces 20,000 tonnes of Blasebright a year, compared to
Sunbright's 320,000 tonnes.
Anglo is interested in buying CPL for two reasons. First, because it would
like to take over Phurnacite, BC's other smokeless fuel for the domestic
closed fire market, which is produced at Immingham.
Second, CPL's Coventry plant, producing Homefire fuel for the open fire
market, would make an ideal fit with Coalite.
Anglo currently produces about 400,000 tonnes of smokeless fuel for the open
fire market, about 50 per cent of its total capacity, because it believes
there is already too much capacity in the market.
The mild winter and continuing recession dented Anglo's pre-tax profits
which fell to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 15.7m) in the year to end-March.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Dismissal was unlawful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONNIE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The damages awarded against Nissan UK in court proceedings last week
were not for unfair dismissal ('Ex-executive wins Pounds 804,860 for unfair
dismissal', July 25) but for unlawful dismissal; that is, for breach of Mr
Stan Cholaj's contract of employment.
The distinction is important. Usually, the highest award which an industrial
tribunal has jurisdiction to make following an unfair dismissal - that is,
dismissal contrary to the employment legislation - is only Pounds 16,150.
The amount awarded to Mr Cholaj is said to be the largest in an employment
action. Employees who have not gone to court have often received much larger
sums as part of an amicable settlement. The terms of the settlement
invariably include an undertaking to keep the details confidential.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Initiative offers focus on value of training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALLEN SHEPPARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, An article in the FT ('Employers consider seeking approval from
Investors in People', July 22) rightly points to the growing employer
involvement in Investors in People - an initiative supported by business as
well as government and delivered through the Training and Enterprise
Councils, and about improving training investment and performance of people
at work.
I have led the National Training Task Force steering group on Investors in
People.
The first Investors in People were announced last October. Today, there are
68 with more than 1,100 employers involved. As your article points out,
those involved include Unilever, Shell, Boots and J Sainsbury. But
involvement goes far wider - it embraces small businesses, schools, local
authorities and hospital trusts.
This initiative has the capacity to transform the performance of people and
the organisations for which they work. At Grand Metropolitan we regard it as
a key initiative which offers a new and clearer focus on the contribution
training can make to our business, both in the UK and overseas. Investors in
People challenges us to review and improve what we do.
Because it is challenging and adds real value it takes time to become an
Investor in People. The real measure of achievement is in the 1,100
employers involved, taking action and improving their performance. The 68
Investors in People show what can be achieved and how the rest of us can
follow and benefit.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Teamwork that creates urban renewal and strong local
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASTAIR G BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your editorial on urban agencies (July 22). A mythology
about different models of approach to this subject is rapidly establishing
itself, drawn largely on a perception of London Docklands. The impression is
growing that the development corporation method of renewal offers a gung ho,
bricks-and-mortar approach, contrasting sharply with a more sensitive and
strategically planned community development approach which emphasises real
employment and living conditions. In practice this need not be so, and it
seldom is.
Newcastle Business Park, featured on the cover of the Urban Regeneration
Agency consultation document, is the product of teamwork combining the
development corporation, the City Council, the Tec training agents and the
private sector. It is universally reckoned in the north-east to add strength
to the local economy.
The Royal Quays development in North Tyneside, together with an adjacent
City Challenge scheme in a troubled housing estate, is about the Development
Corporation, the local authority and local community groups working together
to bring investment and through this better jobs, training and housing to
the local people.
The St Peter's Riverside scheme in Sunderland, on an old shipyard next to
Bede's Monkwearmouth Church, is being drawn together by the new University,
the City Council, the Development Corporation and again community groups. It
will provide sheltered housing for rent, new homes for sale, new commercial
premises, community recreational facilities, and a new business-based
University Campus. Just a short way upstream, a major new business park -
with sites for traditional heavy industry as well as high-tech manufacturing
 -is also being developed as a partnership project.
The debate about agencies should not focus on stereotypes. Those of us who
are practitioners know that structures do not determine the quality of the
outcome but the willingness of the many parties and individuals necessarily
involved in urban areas to work as a team towards an agreed goal. This
cannot be legislated for.
The real significance of the URA is that the task of managing the major
urban regeneration grant regimes is being transferred from civil servants,
who are required to act as auditors rather than initiators, to a body which
will be action and results orientated. This is helpful, but its success will
depend on the quality of the relationships it can forge with other local
bodies. Alastair G Balls,

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Sir, It was with a strong feeling of deja vu that I read your article about
Companies House which stated that 'supporters of civil service privatisation
have long argued that Companies House is an ideal candidate for
privatisation . . .' ('Companies House review is ordered', July 25).
Nearly 10 years ago the government announced that it planned to privatise
the Companies Registration Office Office (as Companies House was then
called). The proposal did not succeed because, under the First Companies
Directive (EEC Directive 68/151), the information which is held by Companies
House has to be made available to inquirers by post 'at a price not
exceeding the administrative cost thereof'.

Sir, Ms Balsom (Letters, July 20) is absolutely right about rip-off prices
for products in Britain. However, this only touches the surface. The cost of
so-called professional services such as the law and accountancy is nothing
less than a scandal.
This problem derives from attitudes at the very heart of the City of London.
My UK bank recently wrote to me explaining that charges would rise in 'order
to contain rising costs'. Am I losing my facility in British English - or
just my sense of humour?

FT  29 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Reshuffling education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S white paper on education promises a reform of the management of
state-financed schools that, it says, will lead to 'the pursuit of
excellence for all pupils'. This is a noble purpose. It can only be
applauded. What is not clear is how much of what is in the paper is likely
to lead to the fulfilment of so grand a mission.
The national curriculum itself is a step in the right direction. Established
in 1988, it is still bedding itself down. Many will think the same of the
assessment and examination process. The proposal to merge the relevant
governing committees into a single School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority will give the secretary of state, Mr John Patten, an opportunity
to place known believers in his strict, moralistic code in charge of what is
taught and how it is assessed. This is likely to be popular and may even be
beneficial. The powerful new chief inspector of schools will ensure
compliance; where there is failure an ad hoc 'Education Association' will be
sent in, rather as a company doctor, to improve or close the recalcitrant
institution.
Some of Mr Patten's personal thoughts, as expressed in the introductory
essay, will strike a chord with those who wish to see a more rigorous
approach to education. 'Schools should not be, and generally are not,
value-free zones,' he writes in one passage. 'Pupils need to be told when
they are doing badly just as much as they need to be told when they are
doing well,' he says in another. Nor does he ignore weak performers: schools
will be obliged to take children with special educational needs.
So far, so closely in tune with what is becoming the new educational
orthodoxy. The difficulty arises in the central thrust of Mr Patten's
proposals, which is to detach the school education system in England and
Wales from local authority control. The programme of local management of
schools within local government might have been made to work, but this
choice has not been made.
Before a decade is out most schools will be independently governed. Their
income will be provided by a new Funding Agency for Schools (FAS). Local
education authorities will gradually wither away. Their remaining functions,
such as identifying children with special needs, providing tuition for
difficult children, and looking after educational psychology services, may
be transferred to social services.
The government will gain from this. It completes the transfer of the
education budget from local control, where it hits local taxation, to the
Treasury, where it can be cash-limited. It finally liquidates local
education authorities it regards as ideologically undesirable. It
establishes a national voucher system, with the money following the child to
the school of its parents' choice. In the early years this evolutionary
change may present few difficulties. But as the new system gathers pace the
light bureaucracy implicit in the FAS will inevitably gather weight. It will
need to make local decisions about closures and the establishment of new
schools. Future ministers will inevitably add responsibilities to this at
present seemingly innocent little quango.
In short, schools are in for a huge, generation-long bureaucratic reshuffle.
The connection between this upheaval and the theory of parental choice is
evident. The connection with the improvement of what goes on in the
classroom is not.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Leading Article: VAT compromise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPROMISE IS an inescapable consequence of membership in the European
Community. Those who belabour Mr Norman Lamont over his acceptance of
legally binding minima in EC indirect taxation should recognise that fact or
call for the UK to leave the EC.
Criticism needs to focus not on the fact of compromise, but on whether this
particular compromise - painful, beyond a doubt - was worth making. It was.
The gain, the abolition of customs frontiers from the beginning of next
year, is worth the pain.
Nevertheless, the pain is not negligible. The US example demonstrates that
minimum rates of indirect tax are not needed for a single market. Loss of
autonomy is particularly painful in the case of taxation, the heart of
parliamentary sovereignty. This is also a disturbing precedent, since
extension of fiscal harmonisation to direct taxation could undermine the
ability of EC governments to set competitive tax rates.
Nonetheless, the agreement is worthwhile. By accepting the 15 per cent
minimum rate on VAT, as well as the minima on excise duties, Mr Lamont has
ensured that customs barriers will be dismantled. He has achieved this
without changing any of the UK's tax rates; he has avoided discriminatory
increases in excise duties on whisky elsewhere in the EC; and he has ensured
that agreement on the minimum rate to be applied from 1996 will require
unanimous consent.
Achievement of the single market, a longstanding ambition of the UK, is
worth the price. But one cannot ignore the lesson. Member states are loath
to accept actions by others that compromise their ability to pursue
traditional goals. In an EC whose member states are strongly committed to
high levels of public spending, subsidiarity is subject to severe
limitations. The agreement on indirect taxation provides a cogent example.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Personal View: From debt to deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTER ELTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's current account was in deficit by Pounds 16bn in 1990, Pounds 5.2bn
in 1991 and Pounds 2.6bn in the first quarter of 1992. It has been argued
that, with deficits such as these during a recession, serious problems will
arise after the economy recovers, because imports will rise sharply. A
surprising number of economic commentators have suggested that the
persistent deficits indicate that Britain is in underlying structural
deficit which only a large devaluation can cure.
The idea that devaluation can correct Britain's payments deficit is, on the
face of it, odd. British wage costs are now below those of east Germany.
According to the German Auto Industry Federation, hourly labour costs in
west Germany exceed those in the British car industry by 70 per cent, and
workers in east Germany receive two-thirds as much as west Germans. A
devaluation would cut Britain's employment costs still further and make
British labour still cheaper relative to workers in eastern Germany. Is that
what we need?
In the first half of 1992, the volume of British non-oil exports grew by 3.5
per cent compared with the same period of 1991. OECD exports of manufactured
goods grew less than this in 1991, so the UK's share may be rising slightly.
That hardly suggests that sterling is overvalued. If our exports can grow
3.5 per cent when world growth is depressed, we should do far better when
the world economy picks up.
But our trade is likely to remain in substantial deficit for reasons
entirely unconnected with the competitiveness of British manufacturers. If
any economy has an excess of investment over savings, its trade will be in
automatic deficit. Investment that it is unable to finance with domestic
savings will be financed by foreign savings, and such a country will
inevitably borrow from overseas and have a corresponding current account
deficit.
Britain has been in this position for several years. We used to have one of
the lowest personal savings ratios of any leading economy. This year
personal savings have grown to 11 1/2 per cent of GDP, but the budget is
moving sharply into deficit. On balance when taken together, there is net
borrowing by the personal sector, companies and government, which is why our
trade is in deficit. As the economy recovers, companies will raise
investment and personal savings will fall.
The savings rate was as little as 4 per cent at the height of the Lawson
boom. It will not fall to 4 per cent again, but neither is it likely to
remain as high as 11 per cent. If economic recovery is accompanied by
increased borrowing by companies and families, while government continues to
borrow as much as it does today, the UK's aggregate borrowing is bound to
grow and our balance of payments deteriorate, whatever happens in industry.
A devaluation would be irrelevant to curing that deficit - indeed, it might
lead to increased borrowing as families and companies try to spend before
prices rise.
Current account deficits can be due essentially to excessive macroeconomic
borrowing or to a lack of microeconomic competitiveness.
A propensity to borrow has been at the root of Britain's deficits. First, it
was the Lawson boom and its aftermath, with heavy borrowing by companies.
Now it is the increasing willingness of government to borrow, to which Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, is attending. The
devaluers appear oblivious of the possibility that a persistent trade
deficit can be macroeconomic in origin, so that only reductions in net
borrowing by the private sector or government can cure it.
Improvements in the competitiveness of individual industries should be
constantly sought. Any company that improves competitiveness and
consequently raises exports or cuts imports creates extra profits or
employment, and probably both.
The National Economic Development Council's industrial sector groups brought
together 80 chairmen and chief executives, 300 directors and senior
executives of UK companies, as well as senior trade unionists. One of their
tasks was to make the weaker companies in an industry aware of what the best
ones were doing, and aware that what was being imported could readily be
produced in Britain.
The competitiveness of several UK industries is being transformed by the
presence of Japanese, German and French companies in the UK. They are
showing the smaller UK manufacturers how their own operations need to be
transformed.
Our export growth rate of 3.5 per cent reflects such developments. But trade
is bound to remain in deficit as long as the UK remains a net borrower in
the world's capital markets.

and director-general of the National Economic Development Office

FT  29 JUL 92 / Arts: Don Giovanni - Festival d'Aix-en-Provence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW productions and a revival provide the operatic fare at
Aix-en-Provence this summer, all three cast with singers of the first rank.
I will report later on Alfredo Arias' staging of The Rake's Progress as well
as on Robert Carsen's much lauded A Midsummer's Night Dream, brought back
from last year. The third offering is a Don Giovanni conducted by Armin
Jordan and expensively produced by Giorgio Marini, with Andreas Schmidt in
the title role.
An Aix regular assured me that there is always one safe production in the
repertory each year, something calculated not to shock or outrage any of the
local patrons; this year that is reckoned to be the Giovanni. To me it seems
not entirely inoffensive; but those with a low tolerance of dramatic boredom
or a dislike of bland musical superficiality would certainly have an
uncomfortable experience. Marini's direction plays the action absolutely
straight, with glossy 18th-century costumes and a minimum of extraneous
stage business.
The sets by Arduino Cantafora are the central interest: elaborately painted
flats of the buildings and grounds of a country estate ascend and descend
not only between scenes but regularly during them. There is much play with
beautifully detailed trompe l'oeil, a succession of false prosceniums and
with mysteriously divisive half-curtains, providing plentiful opportunities
for irrelevant peekaboo. The graveyard scene is presented behind a gauze
framed like a canvas on which is emblazoned a Magritte-style clockface,
which then retreats upstage for the final drama and its painfully tame
climax.
It is all innocuous enough, and in the end perfectly unobtrusive; there is
no imperative to worry at what it all means. But neither is there anything
in the direction of the singers that illuminates or informs. Certainly the
performances give no impression of detailed interpretation or a hint of
cogent dramatic planning - most of the protagonists could well have imported
their stock performances - and in the process the opera's strongest flavours
have been leached away.
First and foremost it is a determinedly unsexy Giovanni, so much so that
wonders what on earth he was doing with all those women listed in
Leporello's book - playing whist with them, perhaps? - and what he could
possibly have done to deserve his ultimate fate. Also it is a version of the
opera in which the element of class distinction has been totally obscured.
Zerlina and Masetto seem all of a piece with the others; even if he has some
oddly dressed friends, she appears all elegance and grace, at least the
social equal of the Anna and Elvira.
In part that all is a consequence of the casting, for though it is sung with
firm, solid tone and technique, Schmidt's Giovanni at the opera's heart is a
woefully uncharismatic figure, lacking humour, charm and even a flicker of
sensual appeal. The character exudes no qualities at all, even negative
ones, and against that utterly neutral background a Leporello as engaging as
Anton Scharinger's emerges all the sharper, providing the wit and quick
intelligence his master appears to lack. With the Anna (Hillevi Martinpelto)
and Ottavio (Herbet Lippert) costumed and bewigged like a rococo Tweedledum
and Tweedledee, and an Elvira (Patricia Schuman) much given to scarlet gowns
and obsessional wandering across the stage, the Zerlina of Marianne Roerholm
has much more chance to carve her own niche. She does it beautifully; though
the others sing with care and precision she is the only one to invest her
lines with any meaning, to synthesise personality and music point.
But none of the singers could have been helped by the conducting. Though
Jordan was very careful to make the English Chamber Orchestra in the pit
articulate every phrase with great precision, he did so at the expense of
any forward momentum or variation in dynamics. Some arias (Ottavio's pair
especially) almost ground to a halt; others were drilled out when they
should have at least hinted at sweet persuasion. It epitomised the whole
approach to the opera, a Don Giovanni lacking light and shade, any genuine
feeling of perspective rather than the succession of false ones paraded on
the stage.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Arts: Die gluckliche Hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOENBERG'S 1913 'drama with music' Die gluckliche Hand added on Monday
another brilliantly polished item to the schedule of operas-in-concert at
this year's Proms. It calls for a baritone protagonist, two mimes, chorus,
enormous orchestra and offstage band, and was intended to be mounted with a
paraphernalia of stagecraft so complicated that long stage directions
accompany almost every bar of the score.
A key factor in the genesis was the elopement in 1908 of Schoenberg's first
wife with the painter Gerstl: how typical of the composer's ruthless honesty
in self-analysis to discover in his own wounded psyche the raw material for
music-drama of this kind, and then to clothe the experience in sonorities of
many-layered texture. In many ways it remains the musico-dramatic
Expressionist Handbook, a vision of several arts uniting in the depiction of
extreme states of mind.
Twenty or so minutes of its passage seems like anyone else's 60. At various
times attempts have been made to bring it to the stage (recently, for
instance, by the Netherlands Opera) - but these, I submit, are doomed to
prove unfaithful to the letter of Schoenberg's text, if not the spirit.
During this superbly achieved and finished concert realisation by the BBC
Symphony Orchestra and Singers under Oliver Knussen, with David
Wilson-Johnson as The Man, I felt once again that the mind's eye, aided and
informed by the ear, is probably the ideal location for any production.
That way, at least, concentration on Schoenberg's tantalisingly tight-packed
musical matter can build up without distraction. Knussen's gifts of
sympathetic elucidation are now all but unequalled among conductors of
20th-century scores; with masterly confidence he led the orchestra, and the
listener, through the labyrinth of motivic relationships, the closely worked
developments and cross-references, the webs of luminous, icily glittering
sound.
I have seldom been so gripped, fascinated, deeply stirred. This Gluckliche
Hand came at the end of a 'difficult' - but in fact wildly pleasurable -
20th-century concert, of a kind only the BBC would now dare promote.
Stravinsky's Four Studies, Colin Matthews's rhythmically complex and
coruscating, rawly energetic Broken Symmetry (first performed at the
Barbican last March) and Elliott Carter's austerely exhilarating Three
Occasions were its other parts, all delivered with magnificent authority.
                        *      *      *
At Sunday's Prom the Glyndebourne Festival Opera scored its annual triumph,
this time with Chaikovsky's The Queen of Spades. With minimal props,
Caroline Sharman contrived the 'semi-staging' resourcefully. A surprising
amount of the gambling-house action was crammed on to the modest sloping
platform; in other scenes the chorus were represented there by a few token
figures, while their colleagues sang from the choir-stalls at either side.
The London Philharmonic played in front of them, and Andrew Davis drew
brilliant work from them without threatening his singers.
Very little of the drama was lost, thanks above all to Yuri Marusin's
wonderfully louche, haunted hero, prowling the platform and its borders like
a driven predator. The principal ladies, Nancy Gustafson and Felicity
Palmer, again made striking impressions; Sergei Leiferkus and Dimitri
Kharitonov sang the male aristocrats nobly; Marie-Ange Todorovitch lent her
lovely, penetrating mezzo to Pauline, and as 'Daphnis' also partnered Anne
Dawson's charming 'Chloe' in the Pastorale. With all the lesser roles firmly
cast, the performance was wholly rewarding, and tumultuously received.

ALVIN AILEY believed that 'dance should primarily be entertainment'. His
mission was to show the themes and styles of black American dancing to the
widest possible public, and it was on the terms of theatre at its most
direct, most instantly appealing, that he chose to work.
The reactions of audiences during the present season by the Ailey company at
the Coliseum - shouting, yipping, wildly applauding after each number -
indicate how immediate is the effect of Ailey's troupe upon a public which
is not, I suspect, prepared to rise with such open enthusiasm to other large
dance companies. It is a response that is given otherwise only to concert
performances by the Bolshoy Ballet, where every pirouette and ardent leap
wins a cheer. The link lies in the performers' vividly communicated sense of
involvement in their roles, and even in the exuberance of their dancing as
an expression of identity.
Ailey's sharp sense of theatre - confirmed by his years performing on
Broadway - always seemed more sure than his ability to create choreography
valid in terms of movement. As we saw on Monday night, when an all-Ailey
programme became the second and final offering of this Coliseum season, his
theatricality constantly rescues his dances.
His early Blues Suite is yet another display of strutting bucks and saucy
girls flaunting their charms in that stiff-legged walk that makes them look
like exotic birds. The dances are cliches, the characters are stereotypes,
but the piece wins its cheers because of the rhythmic bravura of its cast.
They preen or slouch, and their steps have an electric speed and a
self-mocking wit - are they sending themselves up, or merely the characters
they play? - which transcend the predictabilities of what they do. So, when
Nasha Thomas teases and provokes Don Bellamy in Backwater Blues, or Dudley
Williams and Raquelle Chavis (mistress of an acutely crutch-sprung walk)
stalk each other, we are held, not by the power of the choreography, but by
the performers' verve. And, pace W B Yeats, we can know the dancer from the
dance.
Ailey as commentator upon serious social and racial themes - with
Revelations this is probably his most celebrated work - speaks truly in Cry.
Designed as a tribute to 'Black women everywhere', it is a solo whose patent
sincerity outweighs its expressionistic naivete. Created for Judith Jamison,
who now directs the Ailey company, it was danced by Renee Robinson with
absolute conviction, and with an eloquence that avoided bombast or emotional
wallowing. Miss Robinson was very fine.
I thought The River, the major piece in the evening, perfectly dreadful when
it was given by American Ballet Theatre, for whom Ailey made it in 1970. It
had a commissioned score from Duke Ellington, and a choreographic style that
veered between awkward academic writing and the loose-hipped demotic of
popular dance. As performed by the Ailey dancers, it looks even less
appealing, since they do not offer the classic securities with which such
ABT artists as Natalya Makarova and Erik Bruhn redeemed choreographic
blatancies. Eight numbers chart the course of a river. The mood is by turns
soulful or vivacious, and mostly veers towards the cute. The dancers are
tremendously energetic - they look as if they are in deep water. Happily,
the evening ends with Revelations.
The Alvin Ailey American Dance company continues with this programme at The
Coliseum, London, until August 1.

SOPPY though it may seem, the week's most enjoyable viewing for me was The
Peruvian Paso Horse (Saturday, C4). A paso is native to Peru, a chunky
little horse which throws its front legs out like a swimmer doing butterfly.
Unfortunately, this beautifully filmed documentary was shown at tea-time,
which was nice for younger members of the Pony Club but meant that most
adult horse-lovers - not a small constituency - missed a treat.
Prime-time animal programmes tend to be grittier and altogether worthier.
They harrow us over the imminent extinction of a species, or confront us
with shots of humans doing beastly things to animals - poachers sawing off
elephants' feet, abattoirs, vivisection, etc. Alternatively, wild-life films
show animals doing ghastly things to each other, to maintain what an older
generation of film-maker used to call the 'balance of nature'.
In contrast, the hymn to the paso appeared distinctly effete; an hour-long
rhapsody about a thriving and wholly artificial breed designed to give the
Peruvian land-owning class an even smoother ride through life. The paso
descends from bloodstock brought to Peru by Pizarro in 1531, and thence from
the famed Spanish jennets of the middle ages. Centuries of breeding have
produced a sweet-tempered horse like an equine mattress and easily capable
of 40 miles a day around the hacienda. So smooth is a paso that a
poncho-clad chap was shown riding at speed with a full champagne glass in
his hand. Very useful at a Boxing Day meet . . .
Horses give the best performances in The Riders of the Dawn (Thursday on
C4), the terrible yet mildly addictive Spanish drama series set in a health
spa in Civil War Spain. Black thoroughbreds pound across the set in slow
motion every time terminal wilt threatens the story-line. They symbolise raw
nature plus the untamed recesses of the Spanish soul.
Every human member of the cast belongs to the jamon school of acting
although to be charitable, the poor dears are hindered by a farcical plot, a
Spanish version of Cold Comfort Farm crossed with Gone With the Wind. It is
served with liberal dollops of sex, for one and two players. Subtitles make
the staccato script quite ludicrous. An old gentleman puffs into the Spa.
'It's getting hot out there', he opines. The weather? query the inmates 'No,
the political situation.'
I have stuck with this amusing tosh, curious to find out what happens to the
web-fingered daughter they chained up in the cellar. But interest has
flagged since the Republicans shot her hermit dad in the balls. He was
wonderful, a prophesying nutcase who answered the prayers of barren ladies
without recourse to the supernatural.
Franco, Behind the Myth (Thursday, BBC1) was disappointing, almost
inevitably given that producer Anthony Geffen compressed Franco's entire
life into one hour. Surely Franco's importance merits the fuller treatment
recently, and memorably, accorded to Stalin? Jonathan Dimbleby suavely
presented an interesting portrait of El Caudillo thanks to archive film and
interviewees who included Franco's daughter, his niece, and Eisenhower's
interpreter, who recalled how entranced the President was in Madrid in 1959
by well-staged mass expressions of love for their leader.
But by the standards of the best television histories, Franco failed. Its
premise was that in contemporary Spain, Franco's memory has been wiped out
by an act of collective amnesia. Several times, Dimbleby made this striking
assertion - but the evidence to back it up was missing. It is one thing to
detect a 'web of myth' around a historical figure but it is quite another -
and indeed something of a contradiction - to assert that he has been
forgotten or expunged. If this is the case with Franco within Spain, who
then is responsible for unearthing the new material which gave this
documentary its particular interest?
Take the film of Franco's speech of loyalty to the Axis in late 1940. Found
'very recently', it argues powerfully against the Francoist view that the
General strove to keep Germany at arm's length. Who found the film, and is
its significance really ignored in Spain? A second hour and some academic
talking heads would have given this ambitious film vastly more 'bottom'.
The excellent documentary series, Invisible Enemies (Sunday, C4) provided
the most alarming information of the week. Do not eat oysters in Alabama, or
you could catch cholera. Do not sleep on the ground in California, or you
may catch bubonic plague. Far from dying out, the Black Death is on the
loose in the US and the more our lifestyles change, even for the better, the
greater the risk from disease.
Few tropes are more enraging than the journalist on a voyage of
self-discovery. Searching for a Killer got the latest run of Video Diaries
(BBC2, Saturday) off to a teeth-grinding start. Innocent Geoffrey Smith
clearly has trouble with the concept of military dictatorship. In 1987, he
was unlucky enough to get shot in the leg during a horrendous massacre at a
polling-station in Haiti. The experience gave Mr Smith bad dreams, so he
decided to go back to confront his would-be killer.
How strange, no one in Port-au-Prince was anxious to help with nice Mr
Smith's enquiries. But did he really think Haiti is like Clacton-on-Sea?
Presumably he was working as a newsman in 1987, or how else did he come to
be surveying the freshly killed bodies with the international press corps
and then cop it in the leg when the gunman returned?
The film dwelt at quite unnecessary length on CBS footage of the corpses in
the school. A brave dissident provided Smith with film of bodies executed by
the police and dumped on waste-ground, which sent the intrepid Mr Smith off
looking for the corpses. Damn it, someone had moved them.
Cheap thrills and a grotesque level of disingenuity made this one of the
most nauseating programmes I have seen. Smith played out his emotions for
the camera, being frightened for his own skin as gunfire echoed through the
night, being ever so sorry for two burglars executed for robbing his
apartment.
As he complained to his friend, the wise voodoo priest, he never got his
Walkman back. But at least he got those precious videotapes home - film
which presumably will earn him as much as the average Haitian earns in
years. So it was all worth it. Mr Smith's bad dreams have stopped and he can
rebuild his new life. Meanwhile, how are his unfortunate friends and
contacts doing, back in Port-au-Prince?

FT  29 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Mosquito Coast bites
developers back - How secrecy and lack of guarantees sabotaged a Honduran
forest project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN WALKER

<TEXT>
Want a lesson on how not to manage an environmentally sensitive investment
in the American tropics? Take a leaf out of Stone Container's Honduras
casebook.
At the end of February, the head of the Honduran Forestry Corporation,
Porfirio Lobo, abandoned a controversial plan to cede 216,000 hectares of
pine forest bordering the River Platano Reserve in La Mosquitia (of
'Mosquito Coast' fame) to the big Chicago-based paper company.
For Gustavo Morales, Stone's Honduran representative, formerly a senior
adviser to Lobo, the cancellation brought a mixture of disappointment and
relief. 'It saddens me, because the opposition told a lot of lies, and it
was a good deal for Honduras.' On the other hand, after he appeared on
television supporting the proposal, he received death threats from a
guerrilla group, and had to have his children escorted to school by armed
guards.
The architects of the deal - originally conceived in mid-1991 with the
personal support of Honduran president, Rafael Callejas - had been taken by
surprise by the passion and scope of local opposition to it.
The opposition was led by environmentalists, who were concerned about the
deforestation and erosion linked to logging. They were worried too about the
future of the River Platano Reserve, an area of broad-leaved forest defined
as a site of world importance. They had support from US and European
campaigners, who picketed Stone's offices, aiming to mar the company's
promotion of a clean image which was largely based on its recycling activity
in the US.
Although no industrial plant was planned for La Mosquitia, reports that
Stone's Florida paper plants had been fined for effluent violations set
heads nodding in Honduras, where plans to dispose of toxic waste from the US
have made the headlines several times in the last year.
Local opponents also included the Association of Sawmill Operators, which
said that the agreement flouted a 1974 law requiring 51 per cent local
participation in forest enterprises. The opposition, however, extended far
beyond the usual range of interest groups and lobbyists, providing a rare
victory for popular activism in Honduran government decision-making.
The company launched a publicity campaign in January, but it came too late
to save a project that was seen as a vehicle to dig the company out of debt
problems. Stone had negotiated too good a deal. As it carried a presidential
imprimatur, a quick deal was seen by Honduran officials as likely to yield
more favours at the top than an agreement more fiercely negotiated.
The proposed 40-year term of the agreement, though chosen essentially as the
period needed to regenerate the pine forest, was particularly damaging,
because it evoked timber concessions ceded by corrupt military governments
early in the century.
Amid the furore, the details of the proposal were easily lost from sight:
the more so, because the government never authorised the publication of a
Master Agreement signed in September. A clumsy draft version which suggested
incorrectly that the government would itself undertake most of the
infrastructure work associated with the project was widely leaked. Most of
this was already built and the company itself was financing what extra
infrastructure was needed.
By the agreement, Stone was to supervise local sawmills, applying
sustainable exploitation techniques developed in the US. Stone would buy the
residues unsuitable for board production and ship them to a new chip-mill to
be built at the northern port of Puerto Castilla. The proposal did not
involve logging in the hardwood forest.
The company, which needs woodchip to supply its US paper plants, was to
invest Dollars 25m in the chip mill and a barge port. The plan involved the
creation of 3,000 jobs, mainly waste collection and firewatching.
Unemployment in the region is estimated at 80 per cent, and most Mosquitians
welcomed the deal.
The agreement also proposed that Stone buy wood unsuitable for board
production throughout Honduras. An estimated 40 per cent of the potential of
the forest is wasted at present. Finally, Stone was to give technical advice
to private landowners throughout the country on reforestation for commercial
harvesting in areas destroyed by marginal agriculture and ranching.
'Honduras has tremendous forestry potential,' says Morales, 'but if it isn't
used it will be destroyed.' The country has seen its forest area decline
from 7.4m hectares in 1974 to 4.5m in the late 1980s, largely as the result
of 'slash and burn' agriculture on the forest margins.
In the Mosquitia, Nicaraguan migrants fleeing the Contra war in the 1980s
added to the pressure. Also, the national logging industry has a poor record
on reforestation. In parallel with the decline in the forest stock, wood
exports (almost entirely pine) have declined from 114,000 board feet in 1980
to 31,250 board feet in 1991.
Many Honduran ecologists accept the principle of sustainable economic
exploitation of the forest. Their opposition to Stone was based on the
suspicion, fuelled by the secrecy surrounding the agreement, that it was
badly negotiated and lacked adequate environmental guarantees.

FT  29 JUL 92 / People: Hue Williams moves to Guinness Mahon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Hue Williams, who resigned from Kleinwort Benson Securities in
October 1990 after one of his 'bought' deals went terribly wrong, has
resurfaced at Guinness Mahon, the Japanese-owned merchant banking group.
He has joined the board of Guinness Mahon's agency broking business,
Henderson Crosthwaite Institutional Brokers. A former partner of jobbers
Wedd Durlacher and joint managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities,
Hue Williams, 49, is well known in the City and used to be regarded as one
of the big players in the oil share market.
Unlike the big integrated securities houses, Hue Williams' new employer does
not make markets in shares so he will have to content himself with
concentrating on developing Henderson Crosthwaite's institutional research,
broking and corporate finance activities in the energy sector.
The hope is that with Hue Williams' connections, Henderson Crosthwaite will
be able to make the same sort of mark in the energy sector as it has in
areas such as food manufacturing where its research team is highly regarded.
Hue Williams is the second high profile appointment made by David Potter,
who took over as chief executive of the loss-making Guinness Mahon in
October 1990.
A few weeks ago he recruited Kevin Kenny, a former chief executive of
Tyndall Holdings, to be director of international private banking. Potter
believes that if small merchant banks are to succeed in this climate they
need a dozen or so good people, like Hue Williams, at the top.
Hue Williams has been absent from the City since Kleinwort Benson lost
Pounds 35m on a 29.7 per cent stake in Premier Consolidated Oilfields. Hue
Williams' team bought the shares at 99p and had hoped to sell them on at a
premium. Unfortunately, the market started falling and after several months
the shares were placed at 78p.
They are now trading at 15p. 'Everyone makes mistakes,' says Potter who
admires Hue Williams' decision to accept the blame and resign from
Kleinwort. Hue Williams, he says, is a 'man of absolute integrity'.
However, he has no fears that Guinness Mahon might be hurt by a repeat of
the Premier debacle. 'We are not a market-maker, we have set our face
against it.'

Ken Young, deputy chairman of the Post Office, was yesterday named
non-executive chairman of the Student Loans Company, which administers the
government's student loan programme. He replaces Malcolm Hurlston who
resigned unexpectedly last month, after less than a year in the position.
Young has been on the Post Office Board since 1972, during which time he
served variously as chairman of Girobank, of Post Office Counters and of
Post Office Subscription Services. He is currently chairman of the
Roehampton Institute. Before joining the Post Office he had been group
personnel manager at General Electric. Education secretary John Patten said
yesterday 'we are confident that under his guidance the company will go from
strength to strength'.
Hurlston, who resigned 'because of the pressure of his other business
commitments', is an independent corporate consultant specialising in
consumer credit and public affairs.

Total quality management may not be a phrase which Network SouthEast
commuters readily associate with British Rail, but it is something that has
been going on within the corporation for four years now; and from September,
it is to have a new director in Iain Livingston, 42.
Livingston, presently managing director of the US-owned Butler Service Group
international division, a company providing contract technical services, was
previously with Rank Xerox (UK), a pioneer in total quality management.
He takes charge of BR's TQM programme as its second phase gets under way. A
quality process programme is in place, with pilot projects throughout the
railway aiming to improve performance. Each of the rail businesses has a TQM
directorate responsible for quality audits, the creation of quality systems,
and training. The ultimate aim is to improve the service to customers, both
passenger and freight.
Livingston replaces Brian Burdsall, who moved to become director of the East
Coast Main Line in an earlier round of changes.
*****
The change of emphasis at McKechnie, away from metal components and towards
plastics, has led to John Kembery resigning from the board with effect from
July 31. He is replaced by Derry Hanratty, who is being promoted internally.
McKechnie saw through the disposal of the metals business some 18 months
ago. But Kembery, a metallurgist by training whose experience with the
company has largely been on that side, stayed on to help smooth the
transition, according to chief executive Michael Ost. Kembery has been at
McKechnie since 1981.
Hanratty, who counts 20 years with the company, had been managing director
of Harrison Drape, the window furnishings operation within the group, before
heading the consumer products division. With his forthcoming promotion he
takes on the specialist engineering business.

FT  29 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Lloyd's review is set aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGINA v LLOYD'S AND OTHERS, EX PARTE BRIGGS AND OTHERS Queen's Bench
Division (Divisional Court): Lord Justice Leggatt and Mr Justice Popplewell:
July 17 1992
LEAVE TO apply for judicial review will be set aside if the application for
leave was out of time and counsel failed to apply to extend time, and if
leave would not in any event have been granted had counsel disclosed that
the parties and issues overlapped with those of earlier parallel
proceedings.
The Divisional Court so held when granting an application by the Corporation
of Lloyd's and others to set aside leave granted ex parte by Mr Justice
Potts to six Lloyd's Names, Mr FC Briggs and others, to apply for judicial
review to quash cash call statements and auditors' reports issued by
Lloyd's.
LORD JUSTICE Leggatt said that on May 19 1992 the six Lloyd's Names
including Mr Briggs obtained ex parte from Mr Justice Potts leave to apply
for judicial review against Lloyd's, its committee, chairman, deputy
chairman and a company called GW Run-Off Ltd.
In earlier parallel proceedings by representatives of 800 Lloyd's Names
against members' agents, Mr Justice Saville had refused applications for
interlocutory injunctions to restrain the agents from drawing down on the
applicants' deposits. He took the view that on the material before him there
was no legal basis for restraint.
Lloyd's now applied to set aside the leave granted by Mr Justice Potts.
Rules of Court required that an application for leave must be made within
three months.
The application was to quash cash call statements and auditors' reports, all
issued more than three months before May 19. The Names were out of time and
no application was made to extend time.
The first main ground for applying to set aside was that the Names did not
make full and frank disclosure of the overlap between the present
proceedings and those that had been before Mr Justice Saville.
At the beginning of the hearing Mr Justice Potts asked counsel for the Names
about the earlier proceedings, of which he had learned from newspaper
reports.
Counsel asserted that the applicants were wholly different and that there
could be no overlap of issues because the proceedings before Mr Justice
Saville concerned private law rights, whereas the present proceedings
concerned public law.
He did not know that any of the present Names were parties to the earlier
action. Because no hint of overlap was given he took it as implicit that
there was no overlap.
He failed sufficiently to comply with his duty to the court.
With regard to private and public law wrongs, he 'considered that the issues
raised could not directly overlap'.
But that proceeded on a superficial comparison between the two actions, and
a failure to analyse the issues properly.
Three of the Names were plaintiffs before Mr Justice Saville.
Counsel made no enquiry to ascertain, as was an obvious possibility, whether
there was any overlap of parties.
His assumption that there was no overlap was wholly unjustified.
On the present application to set aside, Mr Colman for the Names was obliged
to accept that there was non-disclosure or misrepresentation to Mr Justice
Potts in three respects: duplication of identity of three plaintiffs in the
earlier action and three Names in the present proceedings; overlap of
issues; and participation by Mr Briggs, before the hearing, in the voluntary
draw-down procedure.
In relation to each, however, he contended that the misrepresentation was
immaterial.
Where an extension of time was necessary in which to apply for judicial
review there was an obligation on counsel to apply for it. If a judge gave
leave, he was not to be taken by implication to have extended time.
The relevance of the fact that three of the Names had been plaintiffs in the
other action was that if Mr Justice Potts had realised they were common to
both sets of proceedings he would obviously have considered carefully the
content of Mr Justice Saville's judgment.
If he had read the judgment, he would have realised the issues were kindred,
and that the remedies sought were similar in effect.
In those circumstances it was unlikely he would have given leave, especially
when he realised that Mr Briggs had already submitted voluntarily to the
draw-down system.
The second main ground for the application to set aside was Mr Colman's
abandonment of the essential case by which the Names had been successful.
Before Mr Justice Potts, counsel had argued that the Lloyd's regulators had
used their discretionary powers contrary to the policy and objects of the
private Act which vested them with their statutory powers, in particular the
Lloyd's Act 1871, section 10.
Mr Colman sought to have the application treated as though founded on a
wholly new case not hitherto considered.
He contended that although there was no overriding duty owed by Lloyd's to
the Names, it owed different duties to different groups - policyholders,
brokers, agents and names - and that it was its responsibility to strike a
balance between the duties owed so as to protect the interests of each
group.
But it was unclear why and in what respects the cash call system
demonstrated such failure to look out for the interests of Names as to
attract judicial review.
No bad faith was imputed; there had been no failure to exercise statutory
power fairly; Lloyd's had not paid regard to irrelevant considerations or
failed to pay regard to relevant considerations; its decision had not been
made with manifest unreasonableness; and there had been no failure to
observe proportionality.
Since the main ground on which leave was obtained had been abandoned, unless
the court were to exercise its discretion with untoward beneficence, the
leave thus obtained must be set aside.
The third ground for applying to set aside was that the names' motion was
doomed to failure or was not seriously arguable.
Mr Colman argued that Lloyd's had by its conduct under its 'old system'
given rise to a legitimate expectation in the minds of Names that the same
specificity in the sums of money required by cash call statements and the
same 30-day notice to draw-down, as opposed to the revised practice of
accelerated draw-down, would continue to be given.
None of the Names was shown to have conducted himself in consequence of his
knowledge of the old practice, or on an assumption that it would continue.
Styling the Names' complaints as 'legitimate expectations' did not so alter
their character as to permit the invocation of public law remedies by way of
judicial review.
The fourth ground for applying to set aside was that, because the rights
relied on and the remedies invoked were not in truth matters of public law,
Lloyd's was not in this context amenable to judicial review.
Even if Lloyd's did perform public functions - for example, for the
protection of policyholders - the rights relied on in the present
proceedings related exclusively to the contract governing the relationship
between Names and their members' agents, and in some instances their
managing agents.
That had nothing to do with public law.
Lloyd's operated within one section of the market. Its powers were derived
from a private Act which did not extend to any persons in the insurance
business other than those who wished to operate in the section of the market
governed by Lloyd's, and who committed themselves by contract.
Neither the evidence nor the submissions suggested that there was such a
public element about the relationship between Lloyd's and the Names as to
place it within the public domain and render it susceptible to judicial
review.
Most of the submissions made by Lloyd's in seeking to set aside, led to the
same conclusion - for a variety of reasons Mr Justice Potts would not have
granted leave had he been told what he should have been told about the
earlier proceedings.
Leave to apply for judicial review was set aside.
For Lloyd's: Gordon Pollock QC, Mark Havelock-Allan and Alison Foster
(Lloyd's solicitors)
For the names: Anthony Colman QC (who did not appear in the court below) and
Richard Gordon (Bentleys Stokes &amp; Lowless)

Two months later, the Rio Summit is already becoming a distant memory,
confirming the cynics' view that it was largely a waste of time.
That is probably mistaken, though it is hard to argue the contrary because
virtually nothing has happened in the meantime to prove that it was
worthwhile.
Indeed, from the businessman's point of view, it is difficult to see what
relevance the summit has at all. Most of it consisted of wrangles about
environmental aid to the Third World and the ins and outs of bio-diversity,
something few people had even heard of before Rio.
Yet the presumption must be that Rio will have some sort of impact. There
were, after all, more than 100 heads of state or government there. They put
their names to several documents, two of which will become international
treaties with legal force. So what should the prudent business person
prepare for?
Broadly, Rio should give a higher prominence to environmental matters on the
political agenda, though that is hard to imagine at the moment. The
recessionary facts of life in most economies and the growing resistance to
regulation make environmental concerns something of a luxury. If one
assumes, however, that the industrial world will eventually emerge from
recession, the cost of Rio will begin to seem affordable. The resumption of
growth will also rekindle anxieties about pollution and waste. Eventually,
greenery may loom very large indeed.
The UK, in its role as president of the EC, is already trying to chivvy
other industrial countries into giving Rio decisions a 'prompt start' with
an eight-point action plan to ratify agreements and to organise further
implementation.
Rio may not have supplied many answers, but it certainly clarified the
questions. Policymakers, government officials, the green lobby and the media
are much better informed about the issues than only a year ago, and they
have become much more receptive to the case for international action. All
the signatories to the treaties implicitly yielded some sovereignty to the
rest of the world. That means that the UK may be forced by its treaty
obligations to introduce pollution controls or to grant aid to support the
global environmental cause.
Looking at the specific commitments made in Rio, many were merely
restatements of worthy goals, but several may have a business impact. Among
the more noteworthy are the following:
The polluter pays. This was recognised as the guiding principle in
allocating clean-up costs.
Countries committed themselves to discouraging or preventing the relocation
of environmentally hazardous activities to other countries.
The 'precautionary approach'. Lack of full scientific certainty should not
be a reason for delaying environmental action.
More information to be made available to the public about hazardous
materials and activities.
Closer integration of environmental considerations into government
decision-making.
Tighter controls on international traffic in hazardous wastes.
Promotion of environmentally sound waste disposal and re-use.
Promotion of scientific and technological work, and of codes of practice.
Potentially the most significant result from Rio is the international treaty
on climate change. That imposes an obligation on signatories to draw up
plans to limit emissions of greenhouse gases which are believed to damage
the climate.
Although it took a watered down form, the fact that a treaty was agreed at
all underlines the strength of global concern. The treaty may lead to much
tougher controls on energy use, carbon emissions and dirty industries. Its
potential impact concerns not only industry but the whole transport sector
and the home.
The effect is only potential because the treaty contains no deadlines or
targets. However, it has already prompted many countries, including all EC
members, to say in Rio that they intended to do much better than that. Being
a nitty gritty measure, its results should be easier to gauge.
The second treaty - on bio-diversity - is much more specialised. It is of
great interest to businesses such as pharmaceuticals or biotechnology, and
to the research industry as it contains legal measures to protect plant and
animal life, and it also lays down rights to commercial exploitation.
The Rio summit produced another much-bandied phrase: 'sustainable
development'. That is the principle whereby economic growth should not
impair the world's resources for future generations. In theory this sounds
very worthy, and if carried through to its logical conclusion it could have
a major effect on business. For example, it could lead to the introduction
of 'eco-accounting' and oblige companies to account for the full
environmental cost of their activities.
Sustainable development, however, may be a flawed concept, if not an actual
contradiction in terms, since economic growth has to consume resources., It
therefore seems highly unlikely that this will mean an early shift to
eco-accounting. Certainly none of the industrial countries at Rio was
proposing any of the legal moves that would be necessary precursors.
Few businesses will notice any immediate changes. The summit may make itself
felt over time. The regulatory screw will be steadily tightened, government
policy will acquire a greener tinge, and actions will begin to be taken for
global, rather than purely national, causes.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Management: Back to school for companies - Why business is
taking more than a passing interest in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The telephone call came out of the blue for John Wells, works engineer at
William Blythe, the Lancashire chemical company. It was Hapton Primary
School, asking whether his company could help with a history project.
That casual call five years ago has taken Wells deep into the education
system. He has built up contacts with other schools, helped establish a
formal partnership between the business community and local schools, become
involved in the local training and enterprise council, has drawn the
Chemical Industry Association into contact with primary schools.
It was no simple act of charity. Wells goes so far as to claim that links
with education will 'enable us to carry on as an industry'. Chemical
companies, he reckons, have to have friends, and must keep an eye on the
environmental issues surrounding their business.
Wells and others like him on both sides of the Atlantic are twisting back to
front the old maxim, 'Before a company can do good, it must do well'. What
once was deemed philanthropy is gradually becoming an integral part of
business. Hesitantly, companies are becoming involved in education. They
feel forced to act by the twin pressures of heightened demand for
technological skills and the perception that the education system is
faltering. They are conscious that their case for commercial freedom goes by
default if they do not articulate it. To do well a company needs to do good.
'Coping effectively with resource needs and tensions introduced by
technological and educational change . . . will require partnership between
education, business, government and the wider community', wrote Michael
Heron, director of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch household products and foods
group.
However, the immediate motives of companies are varied. This became clear at
a recent conference, organised in Birmingham by the Warwick University
centre for education and industry and the School Curriculum Industry
Partnership, two of the many organisations seeking to link the worlds of
business and education.
In the US, said Chris Marsden, British Petroleum's head of educational
affairs, 'the emphasis is on combating inner city deprivation and on school
improvement programmes'.
Indeed, according to David Goodman, vice-president corporate affairs at
Clorox, the Oakland chemical group, 'US companies spend Dollars 40bn on
remedial programmes for employees' - money which is siphoned off from other
investments.
The emphasis in continental Europe is different. It is 'on initial
vocational education and transition between education and work', Marsden
suggested. More particularly, in Sweden, observed Bjorn Grunewald, director
of the Federation of Swedish Industry, the approach is altruistic and
practical: 'Companies which are active get recruits more easily - and they
find it cheaper to recruit.'
The focus in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, said Marsden, 'has been on
reversing an anti-industry culture and introducing more vocational relevance
to the school curriculum'.
Oddly, though, UK schools may well be more active in this than UK companies:
it is estimated that while 90 per cent of the schools have established links
with industry, just 10 per cent of companies are involved with a school.
To be effective, a company's education initiatives must come from the top.
Thus large companies such as BP, Rover, the cars group, Whitbread, the
brewer, and Kingfisher, the retailing group, all have carefully drawn up and
publicised policy statements which set out what they want to achieve.
Indeed, Kingfisher, for example, recruited Ms Carol Kay, the former
headmistress of Haberdashers Askes Girls' School in south-east London, to
draw up a policy and clarify the group's activities.
The policies cover myriad activities. Ms Angie Rodriguez-Diaz, program
manager of the Digital Equipment Corporation, the computer group, has an
office in a school at Chelsea, Massachusetts. Here DEC volunteers help with
teaching English to ethnic minority youngsters or adopt a pupil, in a scheme
called mentoring, to create an individual relationship which can act as a
partial substitute for the absence of family support.
Clorox, working with the local chamber of commerce, carried out a survey of
the library needs of the 100 schools in Oakland, California, and then
devised a programme which meant that each school could refurbish its library
at a cost of Dollars 6,000.
In the UK, support for schools has tended to take a different form. The aim
generally has been to support and embellish the national curriculum rather
than to prop up the school system as such.
Thus, Rover has centres at its plants where school pupils can come with
their teachers to work on projects which contribute to their classroom work
on the curriculum.
And the British paper industry, with the School Curriculum Industry
Partnership, has devised material for classroom use that adds an industrial
dimension to the syllabus.
At the same time, increasing emphasis is laid on work experience - giving
students a taste of industrial training and commercial life. Sometimes work
experience and training become part of formal contracts, called compacts,
between employers and educational institutions.
North-west London is an example where a compact started with five schools
and supported by around 80 companies as diverse as Boots, the chemist,
Midland Bank, Bovis Construction and United Biscuits.
What is in it for the companies?
For BP, acknowledged Marsden, it is 'the licence to operate', calling up the
example of a chemical plant in a west Glamorgan housing estate, where there
is 'a level of community understanding' about the activities of the plant.
'Links to the school fed back to the community,' he said.
There can also be direct commercial benefits. Ms Rodriguez-Diaz noted that
DEC's activities in Chelsea were started as a pilot scheme. Now, she added,
'we think we have a model which we could package and sell'.
She also believed that the DEC employees who took part would emerge as
better managers. That is, if the DEC employees can succeed in bringing
skills back into the workforce, they can manage better within the
corporation.
'Our direct payback,' said Goodman, 'takes the form of making our own
employees feel closer to the company.' This is achieved by the company
supporting financially the organisations to which Clorox employees give
their time - in other words, everybody is in this together. Employees who
feel good about their company are better employees, Goodman observed.
Wells believed, too, that activity in the community helped managers develop.
'It helps me to understand the young people we might employ.'
At the same time it keeps him in touch with the turmoil in the British
education and training system - the complexities of national vocational
qualifications, for example.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Management: Cool it and save your skin - Dr Michael McGannon
warns holidaymakers about seeking a place in the sun - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If your definition of a proper holiday includes sunburn, complete with sandy
sheets and blisters, you should think again to save your skin.
Without an intact healthy epidermis your hours would be numbered. Whether in
the Mediterranean or in the back garden in Wimbledon, you should confine the
roasted meat to the barbecue.
Your skin comprises three layers: the epidermis (the outermost waterproofing
which prevents fluid loss and toxin entry), the dermis (a mixture of nerve
cells, tissue, glands and blood and lymph channels), and the subcutaneous
tissue (which cushions the outer layers from the underlying bone and
muscle).
It is the body's largest organ, and is a breathing first-line defence
against infection. Any rupture attracts a ferocious immunologic response. If
the invader penetrates beyond the skin, the battle is half over. It also
helps cool the body by dilating the vessels to cool the surface blood and by
excreting sweat. When exposed to mild radiation, it can produce the
precursor to Vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium.
There are two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays; the first, UV-A, the alleged
'safe' UV, can pass through eyelids, and penetrates into the dermal layer,
hair follicles and underlying subcutaneous tissue, causing ageing of these
tissues (wrinkles, freckles, ageing spots). The tan obtained this way will
not protect you from the burning effects of the sun.
The other ultraviolet rays, UV-B, penetrate the layers of the epidermis and
upper dermis, stimulating the production of a hard protective substance,
keratin, which thickens the skin. These are the rays believed to cause
cancer and burning.
You can take advantage of the sun this summer by knowing when the sun's UV
rays will be most intense and protecting yourself and your children
accordingly.
Because UV rays are filtered by the atmosphere, their strength depends on
the location and the time of day. Your skin will absorb less intense UV rays
in the morning and in the evening (more atmospheric gases to pass through),
and in the winter. According to Dr John Reeves, professor of dermatology at
San Francisco School of Medicine, about 65 per cent of burning rays strike
the ground during the four hours around noon.
The rays also intensify with altitude: for every 330 metres, there is a 5
per cent increase, and snow can reflect up to 100 per cent more (sand and
water reflect up to 20 per cent more UV).
As for your children, watch them carefully. Dr Reeves believes 75 per cent
of lifetime sun exposure occurs before the age of 22.
Sunscreens are de rigueur on beaches and boats this summer, as are hats, UV
protective eyeglasses, and clothing. But which Sun Protective Factor (SPF)?
SPF2 will protect against about 50 per cent UV-B, SPF4 against 75 per cent
and SPF15 against 94 per cent. All sunscreens protect primarily against
UV-B, so that the rays causing premature ageing, UV-A, are unimpeded.
The sunscreen manufacturers are researching some effective UV-A blockers.
The UV Warning Badge - one of the most promising recent innovations - is
applied to the skin and changes colour to warn that it is time to cover up.
Once the the skin is red and painful it comes down to damage control. Cool
compresses and aspirin might help a little; better still, learn to enjoy the
sun without getting cooked.

FT  29 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Board-sailing for gold Penny's way /
A looks at the prospects for British success in a new women's event despite
injury problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENNY WAY suffers from acute tennis elbow. The odd thing about it is that
Penny is one of the world's top board-sailors, not a serve, volley and
strawberries person at all.
'It's an over-use injury. As the sport becomes more intense and you spend
longer on the water training and racing, these things are going to happen to
sailors,' said Rob Andrews, national racing coach to Britain's yachtsmen and
also married to Penny Way.
Since the image of sailboards is one of sun, sand and sea, the notion of
gaining an injury on one through sheer repetitive hard work seems a bit
unlikely.
Penny Way would tell it differently. For the last three years there has
seldom been a day where she has not sailed - competing or training -
somewhere in the world.
Her consistent ranking at world No 1 led to her being pre-selected for the
British team ahead of any other athlete in any discipline. On the start
line, other women sailors were automatically working out who was going to
come second.
Way first became world champion in 1986 and four years later won the Olympic
class world championship in Argentina. That title came her way again last
year. She has won over 300 titles in virtually every country where a board
has been known to float.
It was only two years ago that the International Yacht Racing Union
announced that there would be a board-sailing class for women. Previously
there was one class for both sexes, which left women at too great a weight
disadvantage if the wind blew up at all.
Way knew instantly that her years of dedication were going to be focused on
this one event at Barcelona.
Last year went well but since the winter months, Way has begun to look a
little vulnerable.
The tennis elbow needed minor surgery to remove local scar tissue; then a
virus infection hampered her performance in the world championship in
Singapore early this year. Her world ranking has recently dropped to sixth,
with French sisters Maud and Anne Herbert looking strong ahead of Way in the
rankings.
However, sitting on the harbour wall at Barcelona's splendid Port Olimpic,
she seems calm and confident. 'For me this year the world ranking list is
not important. Only the Olympics counts.' Penny Way is 6ft tall but lightly
built, with the sailor's tan that comes from year-round travel.
Four years ago her build counted her out of the Seoul Olympics. With just
one board-sailing contest for both sexes, Penny Way beat all male rivals for
a place at the Games but was forced to withdraw when sail harnesses were
disallowed. Without that extra leverage a woman weighing, say, 18kg less
than her male opponents could not have held a board upright in the strong
winds off South Korea.
It was a disappointment that turned her resolve to steel. Yet each location
has its own special problems. Barcelona, ironically, has such light breezes
that some of the male board-sailors, such as Barrie Edgington, have been
fasting to bring their weight down to the class minimum. Keeping the board
moving is expected to be more of a problem than keeping it upright in the
likely winds of under 10 knots.
But the real demon of Port Olimpic is a course that starts and finishes
within 100 metres of the massive harbour wall. Even in average winds, this
creates a unique 1 metre-high wave, a chop in which vital starting and
finishing manoeuvres have to be made.
During acclimatisation sailing in June, the board sailors likened it to
performing a ballet on a bucking narrow beam.
The reason for the daunting lay-out is that television wants to be able to
cover the board-sailing, with the starts and finishes held closer to the
cameras than some of the track and field events. The harbour wall will also
accommodate up to 11,000 spectators, plus hundreds of athletes watching from
balconies at the adjacent Olympic village.
A total of 10 races are held for the board-sailors with one discard
permitted. There is a gruelling schedule of two contests a day for the first
four days, which will involve over 20 miles of racing. The final race is on
Sunday. The first day's racing was postponed due to lack of wind.
Way is using a special carbohydrate replacement product to help keep energy
levels up while out on the water in temperatures that have consistently been
over 30C.
Dehydration is also a real worry. Normally at international board events,
coach boats are allowed on to the course to provide water. At the Olympics
they are not.
Barcelona sounds tough, but compared with most of what Way has already
experienced on her route to the Olympics - sharks under the board in
Florida, a mugging in Brazil - she ought to be able to handle it.
'I don't want to turn round after 1992 and have any regrets,' she told me.
'Whatever the result it's essential that I know afterwards that I gave it
everything I had.'

FT  29 JUL 92 / GPMU backs collective deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG preference for traditional UK collective bargaining in contrast with
the continental European system of works councils has been expressed by the
print union GPMU in a motion for this year's TUC Congress.
The GPMU motion also speaks out against European-level negotiations between
the European TUC and Unice, the European employers body. It says that if
European collective bargaining is developed, it should be done at sectoral
level.
Mr Tony Dubbins, leader of the GPMU, said: 'We don't want to end up with the
ETUC or the TUC starting to assume a collective bargaining role on behalf of
print workers.'
The motion challenges the increasingly Europhile consensus of several larger
unions, such as the GMB general union, and of the TUC itself. At last year's
Congress, a motion was passed praising the continental model of statutory
employee consultation and calling for an examination of how such practices
can be adapted to UK traditions.
In spite of the GPMU's assertion of 'traditional values' in UK industrial
relations - which is certain to fail at the Congress - the union has been
developing a very close working relationship with IG Druck, the German print
union.
Several GPMU officials have been on courses in Germany lasting five weeks
and a less numerous group is soon to embark on a four-month course,
including learning German.
The relationship between the unions is probably closer than the more
publicised alliance between the British AEU engineering union and the German
IG Metall, and Mr Dubbins said it was likely to become increasingly close.
The union has also benefitted from a Pounds 1.5m European Community grant to
the European Graphical Federation, the European grouping of print unions,
for a series of seminars to examine the strategies of Europe's printing
multinationals.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS must pay proper regard to the nation's Christian heritage and
traditions, the white paper says.
The white paper, which includes a chapter on spiritual and moral
development, says 'education cannot and must not be value-free'.
The government's 1988 Education Reform Act required the curriculum to
promote the spiritual, moral and cultural development of pupils as well as
their mental and physical development. About a third of local authorities
have since reviewed the teaching of religious education. That review, the
white paper says, was a 'major impetus for curriculum development in
religious education' and the government is to require all local authorities
to review religious education.
Grant-maintained schools will be allowed to use any agreed religious
education syllabus, rather than the one adopted by the local authority.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Shephard promises spotlight for NVQs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government must do more to increase awareness of National Vocational
Qualifications, the new national system of assessment based on workplace
competence, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday.
NVQs, intended to give employers quality-assured and cost-effective ways of
meeting their skill needs, are being developed to end the under-use and
undervaluing of vocational qualifications in the UK.
Mr Michael Howard, Mrs Shephard's predecessor, said this year that NVQs
would provide the best, most comprehensive, flexible and directly relevant
system of vocational qualifications in the world.
Mrs Shephard said she was dissatisfied with awareness of NVQs. 'I'm very
satisfied with employer take-up but I'm not satisfied with the profile of
NVQs,' she said at Teesside Training and Enterprise Council, where she
launched a Pounds 500,000 Tec-funded scheme to promote NVQ training among
Cleveland companies.
Mrs Shephard said a 'big boost' to NVQs might coincide with the training
event the government was planning in September for the European Community
presidency.
Since the first NVQs became available in 1988, 150,000 certificates have
been awarded.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Anger over delay to Lloyd's loss report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES have reacted angrily to news of a further delay in the
publication of a report into losses of at least Pounds 450m by the Feltrim
syndicates.
Sir Patrick Neill, who has been investigating the losses of two syndicates
formerly managed by the Feltrim agency, had been expected to present his
conclusions to Lloyd's Council, the insurance market's governing body, next
week.
However, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, has indicated that Sir
Patrick's report, which is being conducted in accordance with the market's
loss review procedures, will not be available until September.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, said: 'I was
appalled to learn of the delay. Frankly, I would like to have seen the
report out six months ago.'
Feltrim syndicates 540 and 847 specialised in catastrophe reinsurance
business and have been overwhelmed by claims from hurricane Hugo and other
disasters. More than 1,500 Names - the individuals whose assets back
underwriting at Lloyd's - are affected by losses.
Possible legal action by Names to recover losses has been held up, pending
publication of the report. Mr Hook said a number of his association's
members were already facing bankruptcy.
The Feltrim review is the first of a number launched by Lloyd's. Loss
reviews are triggered when a syndicate's losses exceed its capital base or
'stamp capacity'.
There is widespread speculation that the report is taking longer than
expected because several individuals at Lloyd's are being offered the chance
to respond to criticism.
AUA7, the agency that has been appointed to manage the two syndicates,
expects to provide further figures on the extent of the losses early next
month.

FOREIGN involvement in the Cuban economy is growing significantly, according
to British businessmen recently returned from a trade mission to Cuba.
Their conclusions, described in a restricted circulation report, are that
the government is trying to move towards a state that is 'managed rather
than intimately controlled' by the Communist Party.
The report, 'Cuba opens its doors to British business', says a kind of
'creeping privatisation' - with the notable exception of land ownership - is
under way in a bid to re-orient the economy following the collapse of trade
with the former Soviet Union and east Europe.
Competition is being encouraged between autonomous and older state
enterprises, as is profit, and the retention of hard currency earnings is
allowable through an independent banking system.
The Cubans are seeking to re-orient export production, obtain new markets
and find new sources of convertible currency. The report suggests companies
from Spain, Italy, France, Canada, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are taking
the lead in investment in Cuba.
The report points to two main growth areas: biotechnology and tourism. In
biotechnology, the aim is to link laboratories to the production and
commercialisation of advanced research finished or nearing completion.
Biotechnological research is likely to be marketed in the EC through joint
ventures with Spanish, Dutch and Hungarian companies.
In tourism, already the country's largest foreign exchange earner, the
development of new facilities has become the highest priority. In 1991, Cuba
received more than 400,000 visitors and expects to receive more than 500,000
this year, projected to reach 1m by 1995 of which 80 per cent will come from
Europe.
Cuba plans to build a further 3,000-4,000 rooms a year to 1995. Based on
projects already implemented and other feasibility studies, foreign partners
can recover investment in three years.
Spain has been the most aggressive investor in tourism, while Austrian,
Italian, German, Swiss and Mexican companies have also shown interest.
Projects are being discussed with Ramada, Inter-Continental, Camino Real,
Lonhro Metropole Group, Club Med and other companies, including some from
the US.
A recent decision to encourage joint ventures and commercial arrangements in
other sectors may in reality be somewhat limited. The report notes that the
government is not interested in joint ventures in the production of sugar,
health care, education, tobacco or in infrastructure outside Havana.
Cuba has, however, proposed to the Russian government a joint venture in
Russia to refine sugar. Cuba is also looking at the possibilities of
providing health care, hospital clinics and other social services to
republics of the former Soviet Union.
The report suggests changes made thus far are likely to be followed by yet
more dramatic changes and innovation in developing new commercial
relationships and towards acquiring more advanced technology.
'Almost every aspect of traditional Cuban central planning has been
abandoned in the autonomous sector and for joint ventures and there are
signs that this process is now spreading to the internal sector,' the report
says.
Already all enterprises and government agencies are meant to cover
expenditure from income. Even the sports ministry now has to earn its hard
currency requirements from its training and other activities in third
countries.
The State Committee for Economic Co-operation, whose historical role was as
co-ordinator of government-to-government negotiations and with which the
predominant responsibility for joint ventures now lies, says some 50-60
joint venture agreements or other forms of economic association have been
signed, and about 200 are under discussion.
However, the report says Cuban ministers acknowledge that most investment
opportunities will be through economic association since a true joint
venture is difficult to structure.
There are other difficulties too, not mentioned in the report. Some British
businessmen considering business with Cuba say they have received hints that
it might have adverse consequences on their regulatory treatment in the US.
The Administration has already tightened regulations on shipping goods to
Cuba.
Congressional proposals to tighten the economic noose around Cuba are
causing concern as they could trigger a row with the British and other
governments over the extraterritorial ambitions of US law. 'It is for the
British government not the US Congress to determine the UK's policy on trade
with Cuba,' one UK official warned.
Companies have also experienced not-so-subtle pressure from Cuban exile
groups, which sometimes have significant knowledge about companies'
investment proposals in Cuba.

opposition

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush yesterday defended the planned North American free trade
agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico, saying he would not
'back down' in face of widespread public opposition and Democratic demands
for changes in the proposed draft.
'Trust me to do what is right for America and what's right for the future,'
he said. Speaking at the White House before a group of Hispanic businessmen,
who are expected to support Nafta, Mr Bush said agreement was very close,
but 'nobody is going to turn this one into a political football'.
Clearly, that is what is happening. On Monday, the Democrats began a
co-ordinated assault on the proposed pact on grounds the current draft did
not protect workers and environment enough.
Congressman Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, warned the
administration to write strong protective clauses into the pact and set up a
specific funding mechanism (he proposed a cross-border tax) for worker
retraining. Otherwise Congress would write it into the implementing
legislation.
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee who portrays
himself as 'an agent of change', supported Mr Gephardt's position, urging 'a
new course' in trade agreements, rejecting 'the outdated rhetoric' of both
free traders and protectionists.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, called on the
administration to slow the pace of the talks to ensure adequate
environmental protections were included. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, influential
chairman of the Senate finance committee, yesterday said any agreement 'must
be accompanied by a firm commitment to take appropriate steps to deal with
 .worker retraining, environment protection and border infrastructure'.
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, defended the agreement but
acknowledged 'we'll have a heck of a sell' in explaining Nafta's merits to
the US people at a time of high unemployment. But she strongly opposed as
'bad economic policy' a cross-border tax. The trilateral talks restart in
Washington today.
Progress had been made in cars and agriculture, she said, but 'gaps'
remained in both areas and in the investment, services and market access
sectors. Mexico is reported to have withdrawn its insistence on continued
protection for its car and car parts industries beyond 10 years. Mrs Hills
said a final deal could come in the next 10 days. But getting a
notification, including private sector reports, to Congress, would take some
time.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Gambling industry hits jackpot: A casino on an Indian
reservation signals change
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
only the Indian motifs and some Hiawatha-styled waitresses suggest that this
is a casino with a difference.
Welcome to Foxwoods, a complex in eastern Connecticut which opened its doors
in April and packs in more than 20,000 gamblers a day at weekends. What
makes the casino unusual is that it stands on Indian reservation land and is
operated by the Pequot Tribe. It is a perfect example of why the
traditionally restricted gaming industry in the US is suddenly hitting the
jackpot.
Until recently only two US cities offered legalised casino facilities:
glitzy Las Vegas in Nevada and New Jersey's depressed Atlantic City. Slowly,
in the late 1980s, this began to change.
South Dakotans voted to permit casino gambling in a depressed 'Old West'
town called Deadwood. The result has been tagged 'one of the most successful
gambling ventures in modern times,' with revenues topping Dollars 400m
(Pounds 209m) in the first two years.
The Deadwood example is now spreading to larger conurbations. A few months
ago the Louisiana legislature approved construction of casino facilities on
6.5 acres near the French Quarter in New Orleans. Hotel and casino
operators, from ITT Sheraton to Carnival Cruise Lines, are queueing up for
the licence.
In Chicago a joint plan by three big US gaming operators - Hilton, Caesar's
World and Circus Circus - envisages a Dollars 2bn gaming and entertainment
centre. The ciy's Mayor Richard Daly is supportive, even if Illinois'
governor is not. And on the nation's waterways, Iowa and Illinois have
recently introduced riverboat gaming while similar operations are expected
to start soon in Mississippi and Louisiana.
The reasons behind this new permissiveness - which runs counter to the
deep-rooted disenchantment with gambling stemming from the scandals of the
last century - are mainly financial. Recession has squeezed state budgets
and gambling promises a speedy palliative - both in jobs and tax revenues.
In New Orleans Governor Edwin Edwards has estimated the new casino could
generate 25,000 jobs. The state, meanwhile, is demanding 18.5 per cent of
the property's revenues or Dollars 100m a year - whichever is greater.
But it is pressure from Indian reservations which many industry observers
view as the more immediate force for change. Foxwoods illustrates why.
The Pequots won their right to operate a casino under a 1988 federal law
which permits Indians to engage in any form legal in a particular state.
Connecticut's constitution outlaws 'normal' casino operations, but allows
charities to hold 'Las Vegas nights' with 'casino-style' gaming.
Using the loophole, the Pequots fought a long legal battle against
opposition from the likes of Connecticut's Governor Lowell Weicker. The
arguments only ended when the Supreme Court declined to hear the issue.
No sooner was Foxwoods off the drawing-board than Mr Steve Wynn, one of the
boldest Las Vegas impresarios, proposed building a Dollars 350m gaming and
conference centre in Hartford, Connecticut's depressed state capital. As
with New Orleans, such a scheme would require approval by the state
legislature, and opposition has again been voiced.
Nevertheless, many observers think it is only a matter of time before Mr
Wynn - or someone like him - prevails.
The reasoning is simple; if on-shore gaming exists in the state anyway, why
should the law not be changed to allow taxpayers to get some benefit?
Foxwoods pumps considerable sums into the state's economy, via secondary
spending and the like - some estimates have suggested Dollars 40m a year.
But the state cannot impose any direct taxes on the resort's table gaming
revenues.
The potential losers are Las Vegas and Atlantic City. The latter is about a
three-hour drive from New York City, and Foxwoods can be reached in similar
time. Already New Jersey has retaliated by extending permitted casino hours
 -and allowing round-the-clock gaming at weekends. Las Vegas, which has
weathered recession far better than its East Coast counterpart, faces a less
immediate threat. Nevertheless, about a third of its 20m annual visitors
come from California, and expansion of Indian gaming centres there could
pose competition.
The other potential loser is the punter - or, if fears of mob infiltration
and prostitution prove correct, society at large. So far there has been no
sign of anything so sinister at Foxwoods.

FT  29 JUL 92 / World Trade News: HK group to invest in Chinese entrepot
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHARF Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, is to invest about 20 per
cent of its net assets in a project that could transform the central Chinese
city of Wuhan, and reinforce Hong Kong's preeminence as South China's
leading port.
The focus of the project will be a containerisation centre where
manufacturers would load containers and clear customs before 'exporting'
goods directly along a 1,200km modernised railway line to Hong Kong,
according to Mr John Hung, Wharf's executive director.
The multi-billion-dollar project had won strong backing from Beijing, with
letters of intent signed in June. As well as the containerisation centre,
trains, tunnels, power plants, hotels and industrial complexes could be
built under the plan, which would take at least 10 years to complete.
Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, astride the Yangtze River about 800km
inland from Shanghai, has long been a critical transport hub in central
China. Its road and rail bridge provides an important land crossing of the
Yangtze.
Freight from China's interior is often shipped to Wuhan, to be forwarded
north or south on the country's railway system.
From this commanding communications position, Wuhan has grown to be central
China's main industrial city. It is already a critical entrepot for goods
exported through Hong Kong, and is an important supplier of food to the
territory.
It is estimated that transforming Wuhan into a modern inland cargo
distribution centre will cost at least Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 780m). Mr Hung
said yesterday that Wharf would now progress to a detailed feasibility
study. The company has nominated consultants and already has staff in Wuhan.
The project offers powerful attractions to both Hong Kong and Wuhan. For
Hong Kong, anxious to build close economic links deep into the Chinese
mainland, it would ensure the colony's pivotal importance to south China
even after 1997, when Beijing regains sovereign control.
Shanghai's ambitious Pudong project has been seen by some as a potential
threat to the territory in the 21st century.
Leaders in Wuhan and its hinterland see the investment as a potential
catalyst for foreign investment, which has been hard to attract because of
difficulties in overcoming the problems of using China's rudimentary
infrastructure.
The city has also been pinpointed by Mr Gordon Wu, head of Hopewell Holdings
in Hong Kong, who has built roads and power stations in Guangdong.
He plans to build a 500km arterial road through Hunan Province, which will
link with Xiang River barges to Wuhan.

FT  29 JUL 92 / Clinton's critics score an own goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A White House assault on Governor Bill Clinton's lack of experience in
foreign affairs appeared to have backfired yesterday.
A senior administration official said he had been discussing with allies the
course of action that President George Bush's spokesman had the previous day
cited as an example of the Democratic candidate's 'reckless' approach to
foreign policy.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, spent much of Monday saying that
a statement by Mr Clinton on US policy in Bosnia-Hercegovina showed he
needed to 'do some more homework on foreign policy'.
Mr Fitzwater suggested that Mr Clinton wanted to bombard Bosnia - a somewhat
loose interpretation of the Democratic candidate's suggestion that the US
should seek authorisation from the UN Security Council for air strikes
against those attacking UN and non-governmental relief convoys in the
battered former Yugoslav republic.
Yesterday, however, Mr John Bolton, assistant secretary of state for
international organisations, said in Geneva that the US was consulting with
other powers on possible military action to protect the delivery of relief
aid to Bosnia.
Mr Bolton said the Bush administration did not favour military action 'at
this point,' but 'would support a Security Council resolution to authorise
the use of all necessary means to assure the delivery of humanitarian
assistance'.
While foreign affairs are clearly considered to be Mr Bush's strongest suit
in the November presidential election, Mr Clinton has carefully avoided any
faux pas on the subject.
His speeches at Georgetown University outlining his approach to foreign
policy were well received by diplomats and specialists.
Neither the speeches, nor the international plank of the Democratic party
platform agreed in New York this month, deviate significantly from
mainstream US foreign policy.

<TEXT>
WAGE demands by unions at the Huta Warszawa steel mill threaten to delay a
planned joint venture with Lucchini, the Italian steelmaker, in what
promises to be the biggest foreign investment to date in Poland's steel
industry.
A preliminary agreement signed last December commits Lucchini to an Ecu100m
(Pounds 70.7m) modernisation programme for the Warsaw plant. Further
contributions amounting to Ecu27m in cash, equipment and know-how will
eventually give the Italians a 51 per cent share.
But wage talks planned for today come amid continuing industrial unrest as
week-long strikes continue in the Lubin copper-mining combine and at the FSM
car factory in Tychy.
Fiat of Italy is to make an investment of around Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) in
FSM through a deal signed with the Polish government. The factory should be
in the Italian company's hands by the autumn.
Meanwhile, the strikers are demanding that in time their wages should amount
to one-tenth of the revenues from sales of the Cinquecento car produced
there or a proportion similar to that earned by Fiat workers elsewhere.
At Huta Warszawa, the unions want a 100 per cent wage rise for the 4,700
workers earning an average 2.7m zloty (Pounds 103) a month. Management is
offering only 10 per cent. Built in the 1950s, it is Poland's only quality
steel producer. Output capacity is 700,000 tonnes a year, but sales last
year amounted to 230,000 tonnes. Lucchini aims to raise output to 600,000
tonnes.
The accord should result in a partial debt-for-equity swap with Polish banks
taking a 7.8 per cent share in the new company. At the moment the
steelwork's net debt amounts to 500bn zloty.

<TEXT>
MR Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, flies to Rabat, the Moroccan
capital, today for talks on the growing problem of African immigrants
entering Spain through Morocco.
He is the second Spanish minister to travel to Morocco in less than a week
to discuss the sharp increase in Africans using Morocco as a staging post
for illegal entry into Europe.
Mr Solana's trip follows a Spanish decision to take back 72 Africans
expelled from the Spanish-held enclave of Melilla on Morocco's Mediterranean
coast and refused entry by Morocco.
The refugees spent two weeks camping in no-man's land between the enclave
and the Moroccan frontier.
The decision, described as a humanitarian gesture by Spain, followed a
fruitless attempt by Madrid's interior minister at the weekend to persuade
Morocco to accept the refugees.
Under an existing agreement, the Rabat government will take back its own
nationals expelled from Spain but not illegal emigrants from other countries
unless police can prove that they attempted entry from Morocco.
A group of 50 people recently arrested after landing in a fishing boat in
southern Spain included Nigerians, Senegalese, Ethiopians, several who had
destroyed their personal documents and refused to reveal their nationality,
and only seven Moroccans.
So far this year about 500 illegal immigrants, the majority Moroccans, have
been picked up by coastguards as they reached Spain across the 30 mile-wide
Straits of Gibraltar.
As many as 50 are estimated to have drowned as they attempted the crossing.
Madrid has issued 60,000 work permits to Moroccans in Spain over the past 18
months and opened a soft credit line for Spanish companies investing in
Morocco.

<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, yesterday toned
down the stridency of recent ANC statements while confirming that the
organisation would not return to constitutional negotiations until the
government had met its demands.
These include a curb on political violence, an unambiguous commitment to
majority rule and an interim government of national unity.
In an appearance notable for its conciliatory tone, Mr Mandela said the ANC
was 'keen' that negotiations should resume, but this could happen only when
its demands were addressed.
Speaking on his return from a visit to the Olympic games in Barcelona, a
trip to the Middle East and last week's special United Nations debate on
South Africa, Mr Mandela said next week's general strike, called by the ANC
and its trade union ally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(Cosatu), as part of their mass action campaign, would go ahead.
He stressed that every effort would be made to keep it peaceful and said the
ANC was taking precautions against 'agent provocateurs' who might incite
violence. He expressed the fear that attacks would come from worker hostels
in urban townships.
Mr Mandela sharply rebuked senior ANC and Cosatu officials who have said the
purpose of mass action was to drive the government from power.
'There is no question of the object of mass action being insurrection,' he
said. 'The aim of mass action is the immediate transfer of political power
to the people of South Africa.' This would take the form of an interim
government of national unity and free and fair elections to a
constitution-making body. He defended mass action as a channel to prevent
voteless and angry people from resorting to violence.
Mr Mandela also distanced the ANC from calls by civic associations for a
black boycott of mortgage repayments. He stressed the need for houses to be
built and said such a boycott would clearly cause finance to dry up.
Church leaders were yesterday involved in efforts to break the political
deadlock, but there appeared little prospect of their heading off the
strike.

A SENIOR Egyptian official, responding to allegations that Egyptian police
tortured prisoners, said yesterday that a small number violated human rights
but they were tried and jailed if found guilty, Reuter reports from Cairo.
Major-General Bahaeddin Ibrahim, assistant to Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa,
interior minister, was responding to accusations by the US-based Middle East
Watch. It accused Egypt's State Security Investigation (SSI), which is part
of the Interior Ministry, of systematically torturing political detainees.
Gen Ibrahim said that some of Egypt's 100,000-strong police force were not
wholly innocent.
'But we have very limited cases where some policemen went beyond the law.
They were put on trial,' he said, adding that four police officers and about
11 policemen were in prison.
The cases of another eight officers and 16 policemen were before
disciplinary courts for 'acts which went beyond the code of treatment of
civilians'.
Gen Ibrahim urged human rights activists to visit them in prison and see for
themselves and said torture charges were based on biased testimonies of
defendants, detainees or their lawyers.

HOPES for a breakthrough in Bosnian peace talks in London were fading
yesterday, diplomats said, as Bosnia's foreign minister declared he would
not negotiate while the streets of his republic were littered with unburied
corpses, Reuter reports.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, a Moslem, also effectively rejected the latest EC peace
plan, saying the proposed division of the republic would produce ethnic
splits 'drawn in blood'.
EC negotiator Jose Cutileiro was canvassing views at separate meetings with
Bosnia's three factions about a constitutional blueprint splitting the
republic which is acceptable to Serbs and Croats but not to Moslems. After
meeting the mediator, Bosnia's Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic backed the
initiative, accused Moslems of breaking a ceasefire and called for
face-to-face talks.
Mr Cutileiro, chairing the second day of talks, has put together a formula
which includes a tribunal to monitor human rights but the Moslems reject at
any carve-up.

GERMAN engineers, retailers and economists warned yesterday that recovery
would be delayed - and placed most of the blame on the Bundesbank's high
interest rates policy.
Domestic orders for plant and machinery in June were 22 per cent lower than
a year earlier, according to the VDMA engineering industry association.
Revising a forecast made in March from real growth this year of up to 1 per
cent, to a fall of 2 per cent, it said 'the worldwide recovery simply has
not happened'.
The long spell of high interest rates had worsened the domestic situation,
it added. Total order intake in the first six months had fallen 2 per cent.
Foreign business was up 1 per cent and domestic trade down 6 per cent.
Retailers also reported a 5.6 per cent slump in sales during May and raised
doubts about the expected recovery in the second half of the year.
The RWI economics institute in Essen said it expected German economic growth
next year of only 2 per cent, trailing average west European growth of 2.7
per cent and the 3.75 per cent expected in the US. While US interest rate
cuts had stimulated US economic activity, the institute said, the
Bundesbank's strict policy had reduced the room for manouevre in Germany and
elsewhere in Europe.
Waning consumer confidence and the public services strike at the start of
the month reduced west German retail sales in May by DM1.3bn (Pounds 440m)
or 2 per cent, according to the HDE retailers' association. Adjusted to take
account of 3.3 per cent inflation in retail goods prices, this translated
into a 5.6 per cent real decline.
Turnover in the first five months had fallen by 2.6 per cent, and hopes for
an upturn in the second half were retreating further into the future.
The consumer confidence index during May was 12 points lower than a year
earlier. 'The public's frustration seems to stem more from unhappiness with
politics than the economic situation,' it said. The association complained
that shoppers were unsettled by almost weekly reports of new charges
threatening their disposable income.
The only sectors showing a real improvement in May were textiles and
clothing and drug stores. Car and parts retailers reported a 9.8 per cent
real drop, while turnover in TV and audio fell 14.6 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE Serbian government is trying to push through a package of laws to
tighten President Slobodan Milosevic's grip on the republic.
The Socialist-controlled parliament yesterday debated a public order bill,
one of many written in secret and proposed to be passed 'urgently'.
Opposition deputies say under this law a Serbian citizen could be sentenced
to 20 days in prison for arguing in public. The other laws aimed at clamping
down on opposition range from the government's planned takeover of Politika,
the Belgrade daily, to a ban on rallies.
In a tactical manoeuvre to head off more unrest, the government said it
would amend its proposal to seize control of Politika. Several prominent
Socialists have joined opposition deputies in protest. Some 4,000 of the
company's workers have also threatened to strike. An important element in Mr
Milosevic's rise to power in 1987, Politika has become more independent in
recent months.
The government has also proposed a law which would give it effective control
over the universities. After most professors and rectors joined student
protests in Belgrade earlier this month, the government now claims the right
to appoint all university deans and rectors.
Mr Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, told
journalists the laws were a government attempt to take revenge for mass
public protests earlier this summer.
Opposition in Serbia has mounted after the UN imposed sanctions against
Yugoslavia, consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro, for backing Serb
fighters in Bosnia.

Despite government's efforts to encourage industry to spread holidays more

August is still the most popular holiday period with 50.4 per cent of

About 5,000 workers at the state bus company marched through central Athens

The transport ministry used hundreds of army trucks to help the city's

FT  28 JUL 92 / Algiers blast linked to fundamentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists
continued to smolder yesterday as a home-made bomb exploded near a police
station in the Algiers neighbourhood of Belcourt, AP reports.
Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, it bore the hallmarks
of a wave of attacks by fundamentalists on police and troops in retaliation
for a harsh crackdown on their movement.
No one was injured in the blast, which occurred in one of the capital's
fundamentalist strongholds. The attack followed a bombing early on Saturday
in el-Khroub, eastern Algeria, which left three people dead and several
others injured. Bombs also exploded last week at a cinema in an Algiers
suburb and at the capital's main post office.
The Front for Socialist Forces, a democratic opposition party, said
yesterday the attacks showed that the campaign to crush the fundamentalists
had failed. 'Repression is incapable, by itself, of resolving a problem that
is eminently political,' it said.
State radio reported that 26 people were detained on Sunday on unspecified
charges in Djelfa 125 miles south of Algiers, after clashes between
fundamentalists and police on Friday left one person dead and two injured.
The latest bombing followed the arrest of commanders of Algeria's
presidential guard and special forces and eight others in connection with
last month's assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf, head of the ruling High State
Committee.

<TEXT>
INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's dominant cement producer, yesterday announced net
profits of Rp138bn (Dollars 67.8m) for the first half to June, up 23 per
cent on the year-earlier period.
Sales tonnage for the six months to June reached 4.37m, up 31 per cent.
Indocement has a total capacity of 9.4m tonnes per year, equivalent to 52
per cent of national capacity.
The company, which achieved operating margins of 43.3 per cent in the
period, forecasts net profits for the year of Rp326bn, including
contributions from acquisitions announced last month of food and property
interests totalling Rp1,720bn.
Indocement is to hold an extraordinary meeting today to approve the
purchases. Some brokers are concerned that the acquisitions are non-quoted
companies from the Salim Group. The group, of which Indocement is part, is a
loose collection of companies in which Mr Soedono Salim, reputedly
Indonesia's richest person, is a leading shareholder.
Morgan Grenfell (Asia), in a letter supporting the proposed acquisitions and
contained in a circular to shareholders, has expressed its preference 'for a
more prudent financing structure' for the acquisitions.
The acquisitions are to be financed from Rp400bn of Indocement's cash,
Dollars 300m in promissory notes and up to Rp800bn from a Bank Central Asia
(BCA) facility. BCA is also part of the Salim Group.
Indocement's net gearing will rise from 11 per cent prior to the
acquisitions to 127 per cent. Brokers are concerned that the company, which
is trading at 24 times earnings, may make a rights issue, although
Indocement denies plans to issue new equity.
Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the leading Indonesian-Chinese businessman, has been
appointed deputy chairman and director of Singapore Land, one of Singapore's
main property companies, Kieran Cooke reports. It is believed to be the
first time Mr Liem has agreed to any public management role in Singapore.
Last year Mr Liem's Singapore registered KMP private company bought a
controlling stake in United Industrial Corp (UIC), Singapore Land's parent
company. The United Overseas Bank, one of Singapore's four big banks, is
also a shareholder in UIC.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Boeing warns on income as
aircraft deliveries slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, yesterday
reported flat second-quarter earnings and predicted lower income in the
second half of 1992, due to a drop in aircraft deliveries and high
development spending on its new 777 airliner.
The Seattle-based company reported earnings of Dollars 453m, or Dollars 1.33
a share, compared with Dollars 454m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, in the same
period of last year.
Sales totalled Dollars 7.82bn, compared with Dollars 7.81bn, while R&amp;D
spending was Dollars 455m, up from Dollars 338m. Both these results and the
full-year forecasts were broadly in line with market expectations.
The company noted that although the second-quarter figures were little
changed from last year, the latest period included a significantly higher
level of R&amp;D expense, offset by improved cost performance.
Boeing's forecast second-half dip in earnings is due in part to the soft
aircraft market, which means it is cutting its production of 737 jets from
21 to 14 a month. In addition, 34 of the 61 747 jumbo jets due for delivery
this year were handed over to customers in the first half.
Yet despite warnings from aircraft industry pessimists, Boeing's firm
backlog of orders has been holding up and totalled Dollars 91.9bn at the end
of June, compared with Dollars 92.8bn at the end of December.
The company said reduced second-half deliveries, together with high R&amp;D
expenses, would result in lower second-half sales and earnings, although it
was still forecasting 1992 revenues of Dollars 29.5bn and R&amp;D spending for
the year of around Dollars 1.8bn. Cash flow would be negative for the
balance of the year.
For the first six months, Boeing reported net earnings of Dollars 894m, or
Dollars 2.62 a share, on sales of Dollars 15.8bn, compared with earnings of
Dollars 763m, or Dollars 2.22 a share, on sales of Dollars 13.9bn in the
same period of last year.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Australian mines cut holdings in
Pasminco

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH Broken Hill Peko (North) and CRA, the Australian mining groups,
yesterday announced the partial unwinding of their aggregate 80.6 per cent
shareholding in Pasminco, the lead and zinc group.
Pasminco also warned its net loss for the year to end-June will be higher
than the 1990/91 net loss of ADollars 47m (USDollars 35.3m), in spite of
significant cost savings.
North and CRA said they would reduce their 40.3 per cent shareholdings in
Pasminco to 20 per cent and 31 per cent respectively. Both said they would
maintain shareholdings of at least 19.9 per cent for two years.
The shares were placed with brokers in London and Australia at ADollars 1.33
a share, compared with Friday's closing price of ADollars 1.56. The sales
will yield a book profit of ADollars 195m for North and ADollars 89m for
CRA.
North and CRA said they would jointly provide a subordinated shareholder
loan facility of ADollars 100m to relieve pressure on Pasminco to strengthen
its balance sheet by disposing of assets. The share sales signal the end of
the joint commitment to Pasminco by North and CRA, which formed the company
in 1988 by merging their lead and zinc mining and smelting interests.
However, CRA indicated it may move to take control of Pasminco at a later
date. The group said it had reduced its shareholding to 31 per cent only to
avoid being required to consolidate Pasminco into its group accounts.
Pasminco's profit warning follows a net loss of ADollars 34m for the six
months to December, which increased to ADollars 118m after redundancy costs
of more than ADollars 2m and a write off of ADollars 81m on the Elura mine
in New South Wales.
In its fourth-quarter production report, Pasminco said it continued to
operate at a loss in the second half, although the loss was primarily caused
by depressed metals prices in the first three quarters.
The group said the bottom line loss for the full year would include a
ADollars 12.5m settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, which will be
treated as an abnormal item.
Pasminco said production of refined lead and zinc rose 3 per cent over the
year, exceeding the record production achieved in 1990/91. But mine
production was lower, largely on a fall in activity at Elura.
The group said it was still trying to sell Elura and its smelter and
alloying plant in the UK, as part of a debt reduction programme. But it said
the sales would be deferred if 'the present difficult market conditions'
made it impossible to achieve sales at acceptable prices.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: US aims to beat the credit
crunch - Measures to help small companies raise capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to rubber stamp proposals
today making it easier and less expensive for small US companies to raise
equity and debt capital.
The agency is keen to see the proposals, which were unveiled in March,
introduced quickly because it is concerned about the credit crunch facing
small companies in need of capital.
Although the US economy is officially out of recession, business activity is
advancing at a snail's pace, and the country's lenders have remained
cautious about extending credit to high-risk borrowers. So cautious, in
fact, that small companies have found their regular sources of capital -
banks, insurance companies, venture capitalists and regional securities
firms - all but drying up in the past year.
The banks have been reluctant to lend because the recession and problem
loans have forced them to tighten their credit standards, leaving many young
companies, which have not got an earnings track record, out in the cold.
There has been a similar retrenchment by insurance companies and venture
capitalists which are shying away from high-risk lending. Regional
securities firms, which were regular underwriters of small businesses, have
raised fees to levels many young companies cannot afford.
Against this background, the SEC decided it had to help - the result was the
measures due to be approved today.
The most interesting proposal will allow small companies to gauge the
market's mood before committing themselves to the cost and time of
registering and launching a stock or bond issue.
At the moment, companies of any size cannot solicit general interest in
their securities without registering their plans with the SEC. Under the
proposal, a small company will be able to get lists of likely investors and
send them - and the SEC - letters or brochures introducing the company and
outlining its plans.
If the company receives enough of a response, it can begin registering and
eventually issuing the securities. If the response from investors is tepid,
the company can drop the offering, without having incurred too many
unnecessary costs.
The SEC also plans to increase the limits on how much small companies can
raise in the markets without being liable for full reporting requirements.
To ease those reporting burdens, the SEC will allow small companies to file
less detailed, and thus less costly, quarterly and annual reports.
Finally, the SEC will make it easier for mutual funds to invest more money
in small companies.
The SEC's initiative has been applauded by advocacy groups for small
companies. They see the measures as welcome support in a system where their
interests are often overlooked by a regulatory community and government that
focus their attention on the needs of big business.
While the SEC plans to ease the burdens on seeking new capital, small
companies have found another ally from an unlikely source: the American
Stock Exchange (Amex). It now allows small companies to list their shares on
its auction-based stock market.
In April the Amex launched its Emerging Company Marketplace (ECM), an
'incubator market' for companies with market values of less than Dollars
2.5m and therefore too small to meet listing standards.
The ECM not only gives small companies access to equity capital, but also
confers upon them, via the Amex listing and regulatory cover, a legitimacy
that raises their profile in the financial community. For Amex, the ECM
allows it to compete for new listings against other markets and compensates
for stocks lost to bigger rivals like the New York Stock Exchange.
For many small companies, the only alternative to the ECM is either the
electronic Nasdaq market or the 'pink sheets', where stocks are traded
over-the-counter (OTC). However, in these markets investors are sometimes
deterred by wide spreads and, in the case of the pink sheets, by inadequate
regulatory protection.
By enabling small companies to list on the ECM, Amex believes it provides
them with a more efficient place to trade and a broader following among
investors.
Many of the 25 companies listed on the ECM are exactly the type that would
have difficulty raising funds elsewhere - innovative companies in
high-technology businesses which must invest in research and development
before producing a regular stream of revenues.
Amex says ECM listed companies have fared well so far. It claims that during
its first three months ECM stocks performed on average 17 per cent better
than the main Nasdaq index, and spreads narrowed dramatically compared with
Nasdaq, because there were no market makers taking a chunk out of the
difference between the buy and sell prices.
However, these SEC and Amex initiatives have not escaped criticism. Investor
groups and some state regulators are concerned that investor protection may
have been sacrificed for easier capital formation.
There have been many examples over the years of investors being defrauded
when investing in small, new companies which do not disclose full details of
their businesses. Critics worry that the SEC proposals and Amex's incubator
market leave investors exposed to unscrupulous or badly run companies.
Countering such criticism, the SEC says the proposed measures will not
undermine high standards of investor protection, while the Amex points out
that ECM listed companies are closely watched and some of its supervision -
of big shareholders in ECM stocks, for example - has been tightened.

FT  28 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor start to the new trading account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DAY which had dawned hopefully for UK investors yesterday ended unhappily
with the FT-SE Index down nearly 30 points to below the important 2,350 mark
for the first time in 17 months.
The Wellcome share sale, on which so much market confidence had been
focused, disappointed many traders, although they felt obliged to admit that
Wellcome Trust had been successful in its sale of 270m shares at its
stipulated price of 800p.
Stock prices opened the first day of the new trading account steadily,
reflecting the easing in Middle East tensions as Iraq acceded to United
Nations' requests. Also encouraging was the Bank of Japan's reduction in its
discount rate in order to stimulate the economy. With the Wellcome sale
negotiations apparently concluded successfully over the weekend, equities
held around Friday's levels in the first half-hour of dealing.
This early confidence was undermined when dealing in the newly offered
Wellcome shares started at 8.30am. The first trades showed Wellcome at
825-830p but the price crumbled as the stock was 'kicked straight out', to
quote the head trader at one large non-UK securities house. Wellcome traded
below the 800p sale price on several occasions during the session, scraping
home to finish the session at 800 1/2 p, about 3 per cent down from Friday's
price.
The rest of the stock market then began to react to more pessimistic
developments, either announced or believed to be in the pipeline. A
Financial Times survey of the building contractor industry, indicating the
worst recession for half a century, dealt a fresh blow to confidence. There
was widespread belief that the latest survey of industrial opinion from the
Confederation of British Industry, due this morning, will also emphasise the
negative mood.
The cut in Japanese discount rate failed to stimulate the Tokyo market,
where the Nikkei Average shed a further 124 points.
The London market continued to fall virtually thoughout the session, and an
attempted rally was thwarted when an early gain in sterling was trimmed in
late dealings.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,348, down 29.2 and effectively at
the day's low point. Some dealers described themselves as 'bemused' to see
the Wellcome share price struggling to hold on to the 800p mark and spoke of
a 'very disappointing performance'.
However, other strategists suggested that the gloom might have been overdone
yesterday and that, with the Wellcome sale now safely out of the way, the
stock market could stage a recovery if global developments turned more
positive.
Seaq volume was swollen by the offer from BZW, the UK investment bank and
marketmaker, to accept other UK stocks as payment for the new Wellcome
shares.
Errors in reporting some of these trades caused temporary confusion, but the
Stock Exchange said that the day's final Seaq total of 563.9m shares was
correct; the total compared with 495m on Friday, worth Pounds 977.5m in
terms of retail, or customer, business.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR of disappointment pervaded the Wellcome share sale yesterday as the
syndicate of backers to the issue struggled to hold the stock above the 800p
strike price in busy trading of 23.7m shares.
At first, German, and then some Japanese institutions were said to be
unloading stock, although US activity later in the day was said to have
brought some stability.
Wellcome opened at 826p, before the 270m shares sold by Wellcome Trust came
to the market at 800p. The share price went into freefall, being marked down
to 807p within 15 minutes, and finally ending the day languishing
fractionally above the issue price, at 800 1/2 p.
Observers remained divided over how the price will fair over the coming
days. Robert Fleming, Wellcome's broker and administrator of the issue, is
operating a stabilisation operation. However, further weakness in the equity
market could stretch Fleming's nerve and force the price down.
One helpful note about the drugs sector came from Kleinwort Benson, which
yesterday turned positive on the prescription drugs groups, believing them
to have reached a level where they offer 'fundamental value' to investors.
Glaxo firmed a penny to 706p and SmithKline Beecham 7 to 456p.
Lasmo sceptics
A suggestion in the weekend press that Shell may be lining up a bid for
Lasmo, the troubled oil and gas exploration and production group, saw the
shares race ahead in spite of general scepticism by analysts.
Specialists said a bid from Shell was unlikely and that the shares had
responded more to a growing feeling that Lasmo may maintain its interim
dividend when reporting half-year figures tomorrow. They also pointed to two
encouraging drilling reports announced last week.
Assessing the chances of a Shell bid, one analyst said such a move would not
tie in with the group's culture and noted that Shell is already committed to
a Dollars 65bn capital expenditure programme over the next five years.
British Gas, which launched an unsuccessful 'dawn raid' on Lasmo in the late
1980s, was viewed as much more likely to make a bid. Lasmo touched 135p
before closing 15 up at 132p, leaving the stock as the market's best
individual performer of the day.
Allied-Lyons dipped 9 to 605p as the company declined to comment on
speculation that it is discussing a takeover or joint venture involving
Martini &amp; Rossi, via the vermouth group's Luxembourg-based private holding
company, The General Beverage Company.
Analysts pointed out, however, that Allied has debts of about Pounds 1.9bn
and that a rights issue might be required to make an acquisition on this
scale. Martini &amp; Rossi is estimated to be worth about Pounds 1bn and a joint
venture is, therefore, considered more likely.
Dealers reported very heavy trading in BTR, down 11 at 412p. One securities
house was said to have bought a block of 4.2m shares at 405p and placed them
in the market at a 5p premium. Turnover totalled 10m shares.
Trafalgar House, the conglomerate, suffered from stories suggesting that the
group may cut its dividend because of sharply reduced profits. The shares,
heavily sold last week, closed 6 weaker at 57p after turnover of 3m.
Stakebuilding stories continued to circulate around Mirror Group Newspapers
shares, which maintained their record of progressing on every trading
session since the relisting last Friday week. The price ended 2 higher at
74p, having touched 74 1/2 p. Turnover remained heavy, reaching 5.8m shares.
Dealers eagerly await responses to a series of Section 212 notices,
regarding share ownership, served on a number of broking firms in recent
days.
Several other media stocks fell sharply, with dealers blaming the sector's
depression on a dismal UK economic outlook. Pearson finished 11 lower at
337p, after 334p, on relatively high turnover of 2.7m shares. United
Newspapers slipped 6 to 376p and Telegraph 2 to 275p. Reuters dropped a
further 25 to 986p on 1.8m traded, while Reed International weakened 19 to
478p.
The takeover rumours surrounding Lasmo prompted support for Enterprise Oil,
2 firmer at 329p. The oil leaders, however, continued to decline, BP easing
2 to 205p and Shell, still weakened by the County NatWest profits downgrade
last week, losing 7 to 451p.
Utilities, traditional beneficiaries of a falling equity market, were also
under pressure, dealers reporting a general lack of confidence and a number
of unusually large long positions. More unravelling of the Electricity
Package, which ceases to be traded in the autumn, left it 78 off at Pounds
2995.
TSB initially moved ahead to 142p after reports that a predator could be
stalking the bank, but it later slipped to close unchanged at 138p.
Specialists said a bid was by no means unlikely but could well be some time
away.
Weakness ahead of this Thursday's results undermined ICI, which receded 30
to 1068p. Hoare Govett said it would consider turning a buyer of the stock
if it reached the 1050p level, believing the 7 per cent yield would
represent a good opportunity to institutions to buy on income and security
considerations.
Milk was a big factor weighing on the shares of Clifford Foods and Northern
Foods yesterday. Clifford ordinary shed 48 to 410p and the 'A' shares 25 to
123p in spite of a statement from the company that it expects to pay an
unchanged dividend of 11.5p for the current year. The shares reacted badly
to news that a delay until July in raising selling prices for milk to major
retailers will cut first-half profits to just above Pounds 1m, from Pounds
2.54m for the same period last year.
Northern fell 13 to 567p as County NatWest trimmed its 1992/93 profits
forecast to Pounds 161m from Pounds 165m. County said it was concerned about
how the increase in milk prices to manufacturers will affect profits, and
was also worried by a squeeze on suppliers by Marks and Spencer, one of
Northern's biggest customers.
Fyffes added 4 at 80p on news that it is to take a 50 per cent stake in Saba
Trading, a subsidiary of Axel Johnson, a leading Swedish distributor of
fresh fruit and vegetables.
A line of stock in regional hotel group Friendly Hotels sent the shares into
retreat to end 23 off at 120p.
Bullough, the engineering group, plummeted 21 to 114p after an 18 per cent
decline in interim profits.

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Poor building data outweigh
positive news

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices finished slightly lower in light trading yesterday after
some disappointing news from the housing and construction markets had
outweighed good news elsewhere, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.51 at 3,282.20. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended a touch easier, off 0.06 at 411.54, and the Nasdaq
composite softened 0.88 to 564.73. New York SE turnover was only 165m
shares.
The day's only economic news was broadly negative. The National Association
of Realtors announced a 2.9 per cent fall in June existing home sales, while
the Commerce Department revised its June building estimates down to 2.1 per
cent from 1.3 per cent.
The figures proved to be rather more of an influence on sentiment than the
good news of the apparent resolution of a confrontation between Iraq and the
UN, lower Japanese interest rates, and some selected strong second quarter
corporate results.
Among the stocks buoyed early on by good earnings figures was Goodyear,
which rose more than Dollars 1 at the start, but receded later with the
market to end down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 after news of second
quarter net income of Dollars 1.54 a share, up sharply from last year,
although the figures were partly boosted by special items.
Stanhome advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 on second quarter earnings
of 57 cents a share, up from 47 cents a year ago and slightly higher than
the average of analysts' forecasts.
ADRs in Wellcome, the UK drugs group, made their debut, finishing at Dollars
15 1/4 in turnover of 14.2m, making the stock the day's leading active. Drug
issues were generally firmer in the wake of the Wellcome issue. Merck
advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 in turnover of 1.8m shares, Johnson
&amp; Johnson Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 1/8 and Pfizer Dollars 1 to Dollars 76 3/8
.
IMC Fertiliser climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 after Dean Witter
Reynolds, the Wall Street brokerage, upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to an
'aggressive buy'.
Varian Associates shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 on news of a sharp
decline in fiscal third quarter income that came in below market estimates.
On the Nasdaq market, Novell fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 after Dean Witter
downgraded its investment rating from a 'buy' to a 'hold', citing domestic
business worries.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed on a mixed note after quiet trading. The TSE 300 index
lost 4.4 to 3,396.5, but advances narrowly led declines by 254 to 249 on
volume of 19.2m shares.
Inco, off CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 36 1/2 , reported a second-quarter loss
of 3 US cents a share, against a year-earlier profit of 28 cents.

Mexico continued its down-ward path, a closing fall of 56 points, or 3.7 per

Telmex L shares lost 2.6 per cent ahead of this week's results. Alfa
weakened 3.8 per cent on reporting a 53 per cent drop in first-half profits.
The market has been hurt by revelations that stockbrokers lost around
Dollars 500m in May and June as higher interest rates eroded the value of
government bonds they had bought.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Bearish mood stays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT in both the ster-ling cash and futures markets remained bearish
yesterday as the Bank of England forecast a large shortage in the morning
and the economic picture in Britain continued to be grey.
The pound's slightly more encouraging performance on the foreign exchanges
in the morning, up to a high of DM2.8539, softened period rates. However,
the currency's performance tailed off in the afternoon, sterling falling
back to a finish of DM2.8430, and rates remained at roughly the same levels
that they had been at on Friday night.
Dealers continued to be bearish about the prospects for the UK economy,
heavily influenced by press reports that today's quarterly industrial trends
survey from the Confederation of British Industry will show a sharp drop in
business confidence. This, and fears of a Lombard rate rise in Germany, make
a base rate cut unlikely in the immediate future.
One-month money was slightly softer at 10 1/16 per cent, against 10 3/16 per
cent on Friday night, and three-month money was at 10 1/4 per cent, down
from 10 5/16 per cent. Six-month money continued to underline the market's
bearishness, offered at 10 5/16 per cent.
Dealers said the softer rates reflected the Bank of England's accommodating
position in the discount market, where an early round of offers was invited,
and the Bank regularly made repurchase agreements (repos) repayable on
August 13 and 14 at 9 15/16 per cent.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 12m in the repo, Pounds 23m of
Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 200m again in the repo.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 267m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds
68m of Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 54m in the repo. The Bank provided late
assistance of Pounds 515m.
Futures trading was quietly bearish. The September short sterling contract
closed at 89.70, five basis points down from its previous close.
In Germany, the Bundesbank, keeping a tight rein on German money market
rates, again injected emergency funds into the banking system to prevent
call money rising above its key 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. The Bundesbank
added funds at 9.70 per cent after call money had risen to 9.70-9.75 per
cent.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips after BoJ rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR slipped about two pfennigs on the foreign exchanges yesterday as
the D-Mark was boosted by Japan's latest cut in interest rates and
continuing strong sentiment for the German currency, writes James Blitz.
Analysts said the dollar had lost ground in a wave of trading that followed
another fall in the Japanese stock market and the Bank of Japan's  1/2
percentage point reduction in its discount rate. This gave a significant
boost to the German currency, pushing it up from Y85.09 to Y86.00 by the
close of European trading.
In turn, the rush to buy D-Marks fed through to D-Mark/dollar rates, pushing
the dollar down to a close of DM1.4840 in London from Friday's DM1.5000
finish. In spite of the discount rate cut, the dollar ended unchanged
against the yen at Y127.60. In New York the dollar finished easier at
DM1.4808 and Y127.45.
Analysts said the Japanese rate cut had emphasised the huge yield advantages
of the D-Mark against both the yen and the dollar. The US currency's fall
may have defined the effective limits of last Monday's central bank
intervention aimed at keeping the dollar off its lows.
For most of last week, dealers believed that the intervention had turned the
market, creating a two-way trade in the dollar once again. Now they are less
sure. 'It is a reminder to the central banks that intervention can never
reverse a trend, just slow it down a little,' said one US bank trader.
Two other factors pushed the dollar down yesterday. One was the inability of
dollar bulls to break an important technical barrier at DM1.5050 last
Friday, which led to a downturn. The other was the spate of poor economic
data that is expected this week, starting with today's consumer confidence
figures which the market believes will be poor.
Sterling was the victim of these movements in cross trading. After rising in
the morning to DM2.8539, it retreated with the dollar to a close of
DM2.8430, more than  1/2 pfennig below its previous close. There were no
intrinsic factors pulling the pound down yesterday, but an analyst said the
market still had no positive catalyst to buy the British currency.
Trading in the European Monetary System was otherwise quiet. The lira picked
up slightly, ending at L756.2 against the D-Mark, compared with L757.5
previously. Dealers said its upside potential would be limited until the
market sees in what shape the government's budget deficit reduction package
emerges from the current parliamentary debate.
At the other end of the grid, the Portuguese escudo was close to its ceiling
against sterling, with a 6.22 percentage points differential between the two
currencies at the close.

THE Midwest Stock Exchange, the third largest US stock market, is planning
to trade a new basket of securities based on the Major Market Index stock
index futures which is traded at the Chicago Board of Trade, the world
largest futures exchange.
The Midwest Stock Exchange, which has filed for approval from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to trade the new product, hopes that it will lure
traders with a highly correlated hedge for the Major Market Index futures
contract.
The new product, called the Midwest Basket, is the first time that the
Midwest Stock Exchange has ventured into baskets of securities.
It will comprise the 20 stocks included in the MMI futures contract in
quantities that approximate one-fifth of the settlement value of the MMI.
The MSE hopes to begin trading the Midwest Basket in this year's fourth
quarter.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Resumption of market-making in Ecu
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKET-making in Ecu bonds resumed yesterday, after a temporary suspension
on Friday, but confidence in the market's liquidity remained at a low ebb,
according to some traders and fund managers.
Although the suspension, forced by a further wave of selling last week,
helped calm the market, the fundamental imbalance of buyers and sellers is
expected to persist at least until the French referendum on the Maastricht
Treaty on September 20.
Market-makers are still holding long positions which they have been unable
to offload, and many have been accumulating further paper.
Dealers said that in the wake of the suspension, and the widening of
bid/offer spreads quoted by market-makers, the Ecu bond market has ceased to
be viewed as a government or semi-government bond market, and has taken a
step back towards the Eurobond market.
Friday's close was 'very damaging to the market', according to one fixed
income fund manager, who declined to be named. But he said that he would
continue to steer clear of the Ecu bond market 'because it is unattractive
for investment reasons', rather than for liquidity concerns.
Another fund manager said it was 'worrying that the liquidity of the Ecu
bond market was worsening'.
Like many fund managers - following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
Treaty on June 2 which sent Ecu bond prices tumbling - he is now focusing on
Europe's 'hard-core' markets including The Netherlands, France and the UK,
as well as Germany.
Even though Ecu bonds are now offering a yield pick-up of 30 basis points
above their theoretical value, few buyers have materialised.
The French government's Ecu OATs have generally outperformed other issues,
partly due to a statement by the Specialistes en Valeurs du Tresor, the OAT
assigned market-makers, that they will continue to make markets under the
same terms as before.
Eurobond market makers widened the bid/offer spread to 20 basis points in a
minimum size of Ecu5m for the most liquid deals, when they resumed market
making yesterday.
While the International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the market's
regulatory body, currently recognises 44 market makers, it is widely agreed
only a portion of market makers deserve the name.
Some of the market's problem's have stemmed from the burden on leading
market makers, some of which have taken on a huge volume of paper which they
are now unable to sell, even at lower prices. 'The core of the market
consists of 12-15 houses, which do 95 per cent of the business,' observed Mr
David Ovenden, who chairs ISMA's Ecu committee.
Although the need to cut the number of designated market-makers is widely
recognised, a firm's commitment to market-making may be hard to verify, as
some traders can obey the letter of the rules but not the spirit of the
obligation.
Elsewhere, only a handful of new Eurobond issues emerged.
In the German market, Deutsche Finance launched a DM500m five-year deal via
Deutsche Bank, while another German bank, DSL Bank, launched a Pounds 100m
issue of 10-year subordinated bonds, via S. G Warburg. Interest was fuelled
by the lack of high quality debt trading at around par. The subordination of
the debt is not a deterrent for investors, since the legal support of the
German government is insensitive to the subordination.
The European Investment Bank launched a further ADollars 350m issue of bonds
under its increased ADollars 1.5bn global bond programme, arranged by
Hambros Bank.

profit-taking

JAPANESE government bonds rallied after the Bank of Japan cut the official
discount rate by half a percentage point to 3.25 per cent yesterday morning,
with the futures contract reaching its highest level since October 1989.
However, both the cash and the futures markets slipped later, to close
slightly lower on the day as investors took profits.
Dealers expressed some disappointment that the Bank of Japan had not
announced a larger cut in the official discount rate (ODR).
'The bond market had already discounted a 75 basis point cut in the ODR,'
said one dealer, adding that the market expected to see a further easing in
interest rates, possibly around the time of the autumn supplementary budget
or possibly even sooner.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, warned that in spite
of yesterday's interest rate cut the Japanese economy was likely to remain
weak, leading to pressure for a further easing in interest rates. 'The
combination of the weakness of the economy and the prospect of a further
interest rate cut means yields on Japanese government bonds should fall
further,' he said.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB, which opened at 4.97 per cent, moved
to 4.96 per cent after the interest rate cut. However, the benchmark bond
ended the day yielding 4.985 per cent, corresponding to a lower price on the
day but still higher than Friday's closing price. The September yen bond
futures ended the session at 104.60, up from Friday's close of 104.45, but
shy of the day's high of 104.70.
Short-term money market rates fell back sharply yesterday with the call rate
dropping to 4 1/8 per cent from Friday's level of 4 19/32 per cent. The rate
on three-month certificates of deposit fell from 4.31 per cent to 4.04 per
cent.
US Treasury prices firmed at the long end yesterday, but business was slight
ahead of today's Dollars 15bn auction of two-year notes and tomorrow's sale
of Dollars 20.5bn in five-year notes.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  5/8 higher at
105 19/32 , yielding 7.518 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities, failed to
match those gains, with the two-year issue  1/16 lower at 101 3/8 , for a
yield of 4.229 per cent.
Treasuries firmed initially on news of the Japanese discount rate cut this
weekend, and the 2.9 per cent decline in US home sales for June that was
reported yesterday. All the gains were concentrated on the intermediate to
long end of the market, while the shorter-dated maturities languished amid a
feeling that they have been overbought in recent weeks.
Aside from the economic news, the market's attention was focused on the new
supply, and a good deal of yesterday's business was related to positioning
of portfolios ahead of the week's auctions.
GERMAN government bond prices nudged higher in dull trade with the bund
market paying little heed to favourable inflation figures.
The market shrugged off news that inflation in the state of Bavaria was
unchanged in the month to mid-July, giving a year-on-year rise of 3.8 per
cent against 4.7 per cent in June. Bavaria is the last of the four states to
report favourable inflation figures, leading to expectations of a sharply
lower inflation figure for Germany.
'The market is not responding to the inflation data - it is waiting for news
on money supply now,' said one dealer. The Liffe bund futures contract
opened at 87.27 and edged up to 87.38 by late afternoon.
UK government bonds ended the day mixed with longer-dated issues closing
lower while short-dated gilts were barely changed.
Volumes in the futures market were well below average at around 10,000
contracts. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003-07 opened at 116 7/8 and
slipped to 116 by late afternoon.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico finance groups hit by
rates increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S newly-formed financial groups are estimated to have lost at least
Dollars 500m after a sharp rise in interest rates in May and June.
Long-term real interest rates in Mexico rose about 3 percentage points over
the period. This caused many of Mexico's banks and brokerages to suffer
large losses on the so-called ajustabonos, the long-term bonds which offer a
fixed rate of interest over inflation.
Mr Roberto Barrera of brokers Invermexico put the total loss of financial
groups at Dollars 500m, although other reports estimated losses to be as
high as Dollars 1.3bn. Two stockbrokers said Banamex-Accival, the largest
financial group, lost Dollars 145m while GF Probursa, another broker, lost
Dollars 80m.
Mexican newspapers and some brokers have suggested part of the losses have
been passed on to clients, but the Comision Nacional de Valores said there
was no evidence of this.
The losses are likely to hurt financial groups that depend heavily on
earnings from money market trading, and which had profited handsomely from
steady falls in Mexico's interest rates over past years.
On average, 37 per cent of Mexican stockbrokers' profits came from money
market operations last year. Some financial groups such as GF Probursa and
GF GBM Atlantico depend for more than half their profits on their
stockbrokerage arms.
'This is evidence of the high volatility of earnings on some of Mexico's
financial groups, whose income is overly dependent on brokerage operations,'
said Baring Research in Mexico City.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Wako Securities considers
sale of some shareholdings

WAKO Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, is considering selling some
of its stock portfolio, including bank cross-shareholdings.
The slump in the Tokyo market is severly hurting Japanese brokers. Several
brokerage houses, including Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities have announced cost-cutting programmes.
Wako is the first to admit it would sell cross-shareholdings, mainly of
banks.
A loosening of cross-shareholding relationships among Japanese companies
became apparent last April, when bank shares plunged on the Tokyo stock
market.
Wako said it would try to avoid releasing shares in a way that would depress
prices further.
Second-tier brokers expanded aggressively at the height of the bull market
in the late 1980s but they face losses as commission revenue has fallen due
to low market turnover.
Mr Brian Waterhouse, financial analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, said the
sale of cross-held shares was one of several painful options for brokers,
though he doubted this would have much impact as the volume of shares
involved was relatively small.
NKK Corp, Japan's second largest steel manufacturer, is to issue Y60bn
(Dollars 480m) in Eurobonds through public placements, Reuter reports.
Yamaichi International (Europe) will lead manage a Y20bn issue due in
November 1999. The issue will carry a 6.1 per cent coupon priced at
Y101.845. Signing is on August 4 and payment date is August 14. The other
Y40bn of bonds are due in November 2002 and carry a 6.2 per cent coupon
priced at Y101.825. Nikko Europe is lead manager.

WEAK prices for nickel and precious metals and lower deliveries depressed
Inco's results for the second quarter and first half of 1992.
These two factors outweighed higher prices realised for cobalt and Inco's
continuing cost reduction programme.
The second quarter showed a loss, after preferred dividends of USDollars
2.7m, or 3 cents a share, against a profit of Dollars 29m, or 28 cents, a
year earlier.
Net metal sales were Dollars 666m against Dollars 803m. These included
primary metal sales of Dollars 510m against Dollars 617m. Total revenues
were Dollars 681m against Dollars 820m.
Operating earnings before taxes, interest, corporate expense and exchange
adjustments were Dollars 47m against Dollars 104m.
For the first half, there was a loss of Dollars 1.7m, or 2 cents a share,
against a profit of Dollars 81.3m, or 78 cents, a year earlier. Net metal
sales were Dollars 1.34bn against Dollars 1.64bn, and total revenues Dollars
1.38bn against Dollars 1.67bn. Operating earnings were Dollars 88m against
Dollars 249m.
Inco said its average realised nickel price in the second quarter was
Dollars 3.48 a pound and in the first half Dollars 3.53 a pound, down from
Dollars 3.97 and Dollars 3.96, respectively, a year earlier.
The copper price received averaged little more than Dollars 1 a pound in the
first half.
Second-quarter nickel deliveries were 118m lb, against 133m lb, and in the
first half 239m lb, against 269m lb. Copper deliveries were slightly higher
in the second quarter, but in the first half were down to 130m lb from 144m
lb.
First-half deliveries of platinum, gold, and silver fell but cobalt gained
slightly.

<TEXT>
MOBIL and Chevron, the second and fourth biggest US oil and gas groups
respectively, yesterday reported second quarter results that reflected the
squeezed margins and reorganisation charges that have been rampant in the
industry.
Mobil's net income dropped 43 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars
255m, or 60 cents a share, from Dollars 445m, or Dollars 1.08, a year
earlier. Stripping out special items in both years, operating profits fell
36 per cent to Dollars 255m from Dollars 401m.
Revenues rose 5 per cent to Dollars 15.19bn from Dollars 14.45bn in the
quarter.
The company earlier this month said it had slashed its capital appropriation
budget for the year an additional Dollars 800m to Dollars 4bn, compared with
Dollars 5.4bn the previous year.
Mobil's US marketing and refining business turned in a loss of Dollars 45m
in the quarter compared with earnings of Dollars 65m last year.
Overall marketing and refining operations brought in earnings of Dollars 25m
against Dollars 279m a year ago. The company's chemical earnings tumbled to
Dollars 18m from Dollars 61m.
For the first half, Mobil earned Dollars 382m compared with Dollars 1.16bn
last year. Stripping out extraordinary items in both years, first-half
operating earnings tumbled to Dollars 468m from Dollars 1.11bn.
Chevron, which is in the throes of a two-year restructuring effort, posted a
9 per cent decline in reported net income to Dollars 350m on revenues of
Dollars 10.6bn, compared with income of Dollars 384m on revenues of Dollars
9.7bn the previous year.
Earnings were muddied by special items which cut income by Dollars 39m in
the latest quarter. A year earlier, extraordinary gains were Dollars 120m.
Earnings per share eased to Dollars 1.03 from Dollars 1.09.
Chevron benefited from foreign exchange gains in the latest quarter, which
brought in Dollars 64m, compared with a loss of Dollars 16m a year earlier.
First half net income fell 30 per cent to Dollars 654m, or Dollars 1.91 a
share, from Dollars 941m, or Dollars 2.68, last year on revenues which eased
to Dollars 20.3bn from Dollars 20.5bn.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Canadian airlines again consider
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S two major airlines are resuming merger talks with federal
government approval.
Both Air Canada, privatised two years ago, and Canadian Airlines
International, owned by PWA Corporation of Calgary, took heavy losses in the
first half this year, and both are staggering under big debt loads.
They broke off merger talks late last year with acrimony, each saying it
would do better linking up with American carriers to achieve greater access
to the US market.
However, PWA says its lengthy talks with AMR, parent of American Airlines
for an alliance have been terminated. British Airways' acquisition of 21 per
cent of USAir for USDollars 750m last week effectively ended Air Canada's
flirtation with the American carrier.
Last night Air Canada chairman, Mr Claude Taylor, said: 'Powerful market
forces compel carriers to consider all their options and the existing
structure of the Canadian airline industry is not viable.'
He said the merger talks with PWA would resume this week, and Ottawa 'will
be monitoring them closely'.
A merger between the two could pose a dilemma for the government since it
would create a monopoly on Canadian routes and raise anti-trust concerns.
Air Canada reiterated its position that the existing structure of the
Canadian airline industry was not viable, and that 'survival is at stake'.
PWA also said last night that it has asked for and received the resignations
of all directors of wholly-owned subsidiary companies. The directors will
remain on the board of the parent company, PWA Corporation.
PWA said the reorganisation was to address directors' liability concerns.

<TEXT>
THE two rival offers for The Daily News, the New York tabloid acquired in
March 1991 by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, will be the subject of a fresh
round of discussions this week, amid signs that the battle is intensifying.
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher who owns The Daily Telegraph in
London, will be in New York today for negotiations with trade union leaders,
creditors and the newspaper's management.
Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the New York-based owner of US News and World Report
magazine and The Atlantic Monthly, will also hold talks today with members
of The Daily News creditors' committee. Mr Zuckerman has met previously with
union leaders as well as members of the newspaper's management.
A New York bankruptcy court recently extended until the end of this month
the deadline by which The Daily News must file a reorganisation plan under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The newspaper filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors last December.
The July 31 court deadline could be extended once more, if, as expected, the
complex negotiations drag on.
Although no clear favourite has emerged from the talks, Mr Zuckerman is
understood to have presented himself to union leaders as the more New
York-oriented and hands-on of the two prospective bidders. Securing the
support of the 12 unions involved will be crucial in winning control of the
newspaper.
'We are continuing our negotiations and we intend to meet the creditors,' Mr
Zuckerman said yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express yesterday reported that after tax operating income fell 30
per cent to Dollars 269m during the second quarter following a sharp rise in
the cost of promoting and marketing travel services and charge card
products.
A series of extraordinary gains and charges, however, meant that Amex's net
consolidated income in the April-to-June period totalled Dollars 310m, or 63
cents a share.
The special items during the quarter were a Dollars 425m gain from a public
offering of First Data Corporation shares in April, a Dollars 300m after-tax
addition to reserves at Balcor, and a previously announced Dollars 84m
after-tax charge at securities subsidiary Shearson Lehman Brothers in
connection with a reduction in the carrying value of its loan to Prime
Computers.
In the second quarter a year ago Amex's net consolidated income was Dollars
256m, or 53 cents a share. Those figures also reflected a special item - an
after-tax charge of Dollars 130m at Shearson related to the write-down of an
investment in First Capital Holdings and the scaling down of Boston
Company's international lending operations.
The notable feature of Amex's second quarter was the sharp decline in the
contribution to group earnings from its travel services division, where net
income fell almost 50 per cent to Dollars 124m.
Although revenues were slightly higher during the period, thanks to a rise
in charge card billings and growth in the travel business, marketing and
promotion expenses rose, as did provisions for losses on lending products.
General operating expenses were also up, reflecting the growth in the travel
business, the cost of cardmember loyalty programmes and other initiatives
designed to strengthen the group's worldwide franchise. Amex warned that its
quarterly marketing and promotion expenses for the rest of the year would
continue at the high levels of the second quarter.
Shearson reported after tax operating income of Dollars 88m, down slightly
on the Dollars 93m the securities house earned before special charges last
year, while IDS Financial Services posted record quarterly profits of
Dollars 73m, First Data earned Dollars 31m, and American Express Bank
Dollars 19m, all after tax.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Richmond Oil's underwriting queried -
Accountants' report sparked Serious Fraud Office inquiry into share dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PRICE Waterhouse report, which has sparked a Serious Fraud Office inquiry
into share dealings in Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, raises serious questions about
arrangements for the underwriting of the company's flotation, which flopped
badly in July 1989.
Price Waterhouse is concerned about the involvement of a number of companies
which, as sub-underwriters, agreed to take a proportion of the unsubscribed
shares. The report believes there are grounds for investigating whether a
financing scheme involving some of the sub-underwriters misled investors in
Richmond shares in the weeks after the flotation.
Richmond, a US-based exploration and development company keen to profit from
the popularity in the UK of oil and gas plays, offered 20m shares at 105p in
July 1989. The offer valued the whole company at Pounds 68m.
Only 12.2 per cent of the shares were taken up, however, and they closed at
62p on the first day of trading. Two weeks later, the shares began a steady
climb to 173p on June 28 1990. They then began a virtually unbroken fall to
close last night at 6p.
Richmond's flotation was underwritten by its broker, the now-defunct
Corporate Broking Services. A small part was sub-underwritten by several
major stockbroking or investment fund groups, such as BZW. However, a
further 12 companies were responsible for 72 per cent of the
sub-underwriting commitment, and are the focus of Price Waterhouse's
concern.
Some of the 12 were managed or controlled by Mr Kelvin Myles, a former
manager of Bryant &amp; Co, a Jersey accountant raided by local police in April.
The report was compiled at the request of Jersey authorities investigating
the disappearance of about Pounds 150,000 lodged with Bryant &amp; Co. Police
commissioned Price Waterhouse to analyse documents found at Bryant. The
authorities subsequently passed the report to the SFO last month.
The report says the preliminary evidence indicates that Mr Myles acted as a
'nominee (holding and using powers of attorney and executing necessary
payments) in a scheme to mislead investors'.
Mr Myles, who is now living in the Republic of Ireland, said he had no
comment on the subject.
In the course of its investigation, Price Waterhouse discovered what appears
to be evidence of a 'circle of funds', which it suggests was used to give
the impression that Richmond's underwritten offer was fully financed.
With one exception, accounting records for the 12 underwriting companies
have not been seen by Price Waterhouse. The firm 'consequently cannot
conclude whether they had resources capable of funding their underwriting
commitment'.
The circle appears to have been 'kick-started' with funds from Bryant &amp; Co
client accounts.
According to Price Waterhouse, various amounts of money were pumped
repeatedly around the circle via three bank accounts in the 10 days after
the July 10 closing date for the flotation. The transactions totalled Pounds
16m.
Documents show that money flowed from Bryant's account at Royal Trust in
Jersey to Richmond's underwriting account at Barclays in London. Richmond
then lent a similar sum to Jersey-based Oakwood Management Enterprises,
which transferred funds back to Bryant.
Richmond lent a total of Pounds 15.8m to Oakwood. The report alleges that
Oakwood partly paid the company back by bank loans raised through some of Mr
Myles' sub-underwriters and secured against the stock.
Thus Sabre Trust, which Mr Myles administered, raised Pounds 1m, later
increased to Pounds 2m, from Bankers Trust in Jersey. Bankers Trust was
forced to sell some of the shares to secure repayment of the loan.
The Price Waterhouse report is based entirely on information gathered from
Bryant &amp; Co's premises. In a discussion paper, it set out its recommended
further investigations and stressed that its inquiry was a preliminary one.
As a director of Oakwood, Mr Myles signed documents including the agreement
to borrow money from Richmond. When asked if he knew Oakwood, Mr Myles said
he had 'heard of it'. When asked why he appeared as a signatory for the
company, Mr Myles refused to comment.
Mr David Wilkinson, Richmond's then-chairman, said he was unaware of any
cash circle. He said the flotation receipts from the sub-underwriters had
been put on deposit with Oakwood at the suggestion of Corporate Broking
Services. Mr Wilkinson was a director of CBS at the time.
'They recommended that they could gain a better rate of interest from a
source and the company agreed to do that,' he said.
Mr Wilkinson, who is currently Richmond's joint managing director, said he
had been unaware that Mr Myles had been a director of Oakwood, although he
knew that Mr Myles had dealt with underwriting matters. He could not recall
the letter sent to him by Mr Myles on March 14 1990, terminating the
relationship with Richmond.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Wellcome share sale a windfall for research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wellcome Trust will double its spending on medical research by
reinvesting the Pounds 2.16bn raised from the Wellcome share sale in higher
yielding securities. The extra income could support up to 2,000 additional
scientists and support staff, working mainly in the UK. The trust's
projected income for next year - Pounds 220m - will match that of the
government-funded Medical Research Council.
'The Wellcome Trust intends to fund more scientists for the long term,
including whole careers,' said Dr Bridget Ogilvie, its director. 'It will
offer better working conditions, with support for new centres of scientific
excellence and funding for whole teams of researchers and technicians
together with the latest equipment.'
To celebrate the success of the sale, the trust announced a series of
spending initiatives yesterday. They include a Pounds 50m contribution over
five years to a new genetic research institute. It will house 300 scientists
and technicians, working under the direction of Dr John Sulston as part of
an international effort to decode all 100,000 human genes. (The institute's
name has been decided - it will be called the Sanger Centre after Dr Fred
Sanger, winner of two Nobel Prizes - but its location is still under
discussion.)
The trust also showed that, with its new financial strength, it will be able
occasionally to reverse the brain drain. It announced a Pounds 3m grant to
bring a leading US immunology research team to the UK. Prof Douglas Fearon
and six colleagues will move from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to
Cambridge University.
Dr Ogilvie said the trust was spending Pounds 50m to renovate its
headquarters, originally built in the 1930s, on London's Euston Road. Trust
officials were previously reluctant to disclose the cost of the
refurbishment for fear of provoking calls from scientists that the money
would be spent better on research.
The building, which is due to reopen early next year, will contain a new
Centre for Medical Science and History including a public exhibition called
Science for Life. Dr Ogilvie said Sir Henry Wellcome (1853-1936), the
trust's founder, 'was the showman of his age. He would have been thrilled to
bits to see his building used in the way he had intended.'
In the autumn the trust will hold meetings with universities and medical
charities to plan its expansion in more detail.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Goodyear reports record net income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the only surviving large US-owned tyre company,
signalled an end to the recession that has gripped the industry for the past
two years by reporting record second quarter net income of Dollars 109.7m
(Pounds 57m), or Dollars 1.54 per share, on sales of Dollars 3.1bn.
The figure for Goodyear compares with net income of Dollars 22.5m, or 38
cents per share in the 1991 period. It lifted profits for the first half of
the year to another record Dollars 176m, or Dollars 2.48 per share, on sales
of Dollars 5.6bn.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, attributed the improved results to new marketing
strategies, production efficiencies, improved cost controls and lower raw
material costs. The former GEC senior executive, who has just completed his
first year in office, is himself widely credited with masterminding a
'cultural revolution' by transforming work practices.
Mr Gault said Goodyear had increased its share of the US replacement tyre
market, while benefiting from a slow but steady increase in US vehicle
production.
The tyre industry - which has a Dollars 53bn annual turnover - made Dollars
1bn collective losses in the past two years but could earn profits exceeding
Dollars 1.5bn next year, according to a study by the Economist Intelligence
Unit.
Excluding sale proceeds and charges associated with continuing restructuring
of Goodyear's global operations - it employs 97,000 worldwide - the
company's operating margin improved to 10.1 per cent in the second quarter
from 7.2 per cent a year earlier, and to 9.2 per cent in the half-year, up
from 6.2 in the year-ago period.
Consolidated debt has fallen to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 3.7bn in the
first quarter of last year, reducing Goodyear's debt to debt-plus-equity
ratio to 46.4 per cent from 66.1 per cent a year earlier.
The second quarter figures include an after-tax gain of Dollars 8.3m, or 12
cents a share, from restructuring. Tyre and related sales rose to Dollars
2.5bn in the quarter from Dollars 2.3bn a year ago, and to Dollars 4.8bn for
the half year, up from Dollars 4.3bn. Operating income was Dollars 231m
(Dollars 157.7m) for the quarter and Dollars 417.6m (Dollars 220.5m) for the
first six half. Worldwide unit tyre sales rose 13.3 per cent in the half.
In New York, Goodyear shares rose in early trading but closed at Dollars 62
5/8, down Dollars 3/8.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Regulator to probe electricity price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, has written to
National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, asking them to
explain why electricity prices have risen sharply since May.
The move could lead to a full investigation of electricity prices, and might
end with the generators being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Prof Littlechild's move comes after large electricity consumers from the
Major Energy Users Council, a lobbying group, complained in May that
electricity prices were too high.
Prices in the electricity pool, or wholesale market, rose from around 1.9p
per unit in March to around 2.3p in May, June and July, large users
complained. They alleged that the increase occured because the two
generators were bidding the price up.
'The bid prices were going up when the coal price was dropping,' said Mr
John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group. 'They bore no
relation to the underlying costs. Our impression was they were winding the
price up.'
Prof Littlechild, who last investigated pool prices in September, will now
give the generators time to explain the increase.
If they do this successfully, the issue may go no further. But if the
regulator is not satisfied, he will order a full inquiry into the pool,
similar to the review he published last December.
At that stage, he said it was too early to say if the pool price was too
high or too low. But he is likely to make a clear decision this time, and if
he decides it is too high, he would not rule out a referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The council said it would welcome this outcome. Both generators acknowledged
that they had received a letter from Prof Littlechild, but said they
believed a full inquiry was unlikely.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Japanese enterprise bursts into flowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER CARS and consumer electronics, Japanese enterprise has turned to a new
international business - growing chrysanthemums.
Japan's national flower - symbol of the country's most exclusive order
founded by Emperor Musto Hiti in 1877 - has been chosen for aggressive
worldwide development.
Kirin, Japan's leading brewer, yesterday announced that it had bought
Britain's biggest breeder and grower of chrysanthemums, Southern Glasshouse
Produce (SGP), for Pounds 3.6m.
The brewer diversified into biotechnology about 10 years ago, and its
researchers have been developing new varieties of vegetables and flowers as
well as new pharmaceuticals.
Kirin is already established in Japan's flower markets, and since 1986 has
been SGP's partner in a venture to breed new varieties of chrysanthemum.
The SGP group, a family-owned company based in Fareham, Hampshire and
founded in 1958 by Mr Emrys Lloyd, a horticulturist, sells more than Pounds
4m of chrysanthemum cuttings and blooms a year.
It produces cuttings in the Canary Islands and the UK for chrysanthemum
growers around the world, notably in Colombia, which grows a billion blooms
a year for the US market, Japan, the Netherlands, Israel and New Zealand.
Blooms for the UK chrysanthemum market, worth an estimated Pounds 130m in
retail sales, are grown under 100 acres of glass in Hampshire and Sussex.
Mr Barrie Machin, one of the world's leading chrysanthemum breeders, heads
the group's research team. Its aim is to produce plants resistant to disease
and low temperatures, and blooms of varied colours and petal arrangements.
Among its successes have been the spray chrysanthemum, known to the Japanese
as edasaki kiku, which has five to 10 flowers on one stem.
Kirin's and SGP's breeding technologies will be combined to develop new

FT  28 JUL 92 / More building jobs under threat: Share prices fall again as
concern mounts over depth of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, IVO DAWNAY and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S handling of the economy was severely criticised yesterday
as leaders of Britain's hard-hit building industry warned that a further
40,000 jobs could be lost by Christmas.
Share prices on the London stock exchange fell again as concern continued to
mount about the effect of the recession on a large number of industrial and
commercial companies.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares dropped 29.2 to 2,348.0. Since April
8, the day before the election, the index has fallen by 45.2. Since peaking
on May 11, it has fallen by 389.8 or 14.2 per cent. On the foreign exchanges
in London yesterday, the pound closed at DM2.8430, more than half a pfennig
below the previous close but above last week's lows. In late New York
trading it was quoted at DM2.8422.
A survey of 600 construction companies by the Building Employers
Confederation, the industry's biggest trade association, revealed that
almost a fifth of those questioned were working at less than half capacity.
Two thirds of companies expected workloads to shrink in the next 12 months.
Almost half expected to shed jobs in the next three months.
Sir Brian Hill, the federation president, said the building industry had
already lost 260,000 jobs since the middle of 1989. He added: 'We are in
favour of strong medicine to beat inflation, but it is no use if the patient
dies in the process.' He warned that recovery in the construction industry
would not occur until late next year, and probably not until 1994.
More gloomy economic news is expected today when the Confederation of
British Industry publishes its industrial trends survey. The government is
also likely to face further criticism when the Council of Mortgage Lenders
is expected to announce tomorrow that more than 30,000 homes were
repossessed during the first six months of this year.
Mr Gordon Brown, the new shadow chancellor, yesterday accused the government
of 'a fundamental neglect of duty' in failing to take steps to end the
recession.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, reminded the prime
minister in an open letter that he had claimed in January that home
repossessions had ceased.
Downing Street brushed aside the attacks, pointing out that two large
building societies were reported to be planning mortgage rescue schemes.
Meanwhile, Mr David Kern, the chief economist at the National Westminster
Bank, forecast that unemployment in south-east England would rise by 18 per
cent to almost 1m by next June.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Time runs out for the patience principle: Yesterday's
interest rate cut in Japan has failed to dispel the gloom surrounding its
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reduction in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate on Monday fits
into a well established, but unfortunate, pattern. The central bank has cut
the official discount rate five times since last July. Each time the cut has
convinced investors that the Japanese economy has a serious ailment; but has
not done enough to convince them that the authorities know a remedy.
Once again, a cut combined this time with a convincing election win by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has failed to inspire the Tokyo stock
market, which closed at a six-year low yesterday and looks ready to plumb
new depths.
Meanwhile, the LDP, having called an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss
the ailing market, has begun to ask what more can be done to stimulate the
economy and the stock market. Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary,
merely explained yesterday that Japanese 'must have patience'.
Japanese economic policy over the past two years has been based on the
patience principle. There was a general recognition that the speculative
financial bubble of the late 1980s should be punctured, but a vague hope
among industrial companies and financial institutions that the adjustment
would be swift and its effects on the real economy minor. Neither assumption
looks plausible.
Recovery was to have come this summer, according to government officials,
and then it was the autumn. But Japanese industry and, more significantly,
the Bank of Japan, are conceding that an upturn may not arrive until early
next year. Of more concern to the stock market is the growing fear that a
true recession may be starting.
Japanese companies had presumed that profits this year would increase after
a tough 1991. While some companies, such as Brother Industries, the office
equipment maker, have announced plans to cut product lines, and securities
houses are reducing their staff intake, most companies expected they could
avoid sacking staff and scaling down their businesses.
Behind the new-found weakness in the stock market - and the Bank of Japan's
recent response - is the realisation by companies that they will have to
downgrade profit forecasts. There is also a sense within Japanese industry
that profits next year may also be weak, a feeling that prompted the Japan
Employers Federation to demand yesterday that the central bank cut the ODR
again, and quickly.
In addition to belated recognition of the weakness of the corporate sector,
the Bank of Japan has also taken time to recognise the nature of the
timebomb left by the the excesses of the 1980s. The banking system is
carrying problem loans unofficially estimated to be between Y42,000bn
(Pounds 173bn) and Y56,000bn, while bankruptcies doubled last year.
These figures do not convey the scale of the problem faced by banks forced
to support leading clients who invested unwisely in property development or
played and lost on the stock market. Banks have propped up clients in the
hope that they would soon benefit from economic recovery and be able to
trade themselves out of trouble.
However, the recovery has not yet arrived. Several large companies are
straining the banks' patience. Tobishima Corporation, for example, the
contractor turned developer, which owes about Dollars 7bn, has negotiated a
restructuring packaged with its main bank, Fuji Bank.
But each time the stock market falls a notch lower, Japanese banks' reserves
of unrealised gains, an important cushion against bad debts, are eroded. Mr
Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central bank, has now said that financial
institutions must assess on a 'case-by-case basis' whether a company should
be assisted, implying for the first time that large failures would be
tolerated.
The central bank also quietly admitted last week that it had made a second
miscalculation. Japanese consumers were to have provided an engine to revive
the economy, by generating increased demand.
But in a quarterly report released last week, the bank noted that the 'tempo
of personal consumption growth is decelerating'. The result of this
unexpected trend is that 'it is difficult to find any strong leading sector
which could boost the economy'.
As if to emphasise this point, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry yesterday released figures showing sales at large retail stores in
June were down 4.3 per cent on the same month last year.
The net result is that Japan's economic growth will not meet the target of
3.5 per cent for the year to the end of March 1993 and, if most private
forcasts are correct, will grow by only 2 per cent this year and not much
more next year. Meanwhile, Japanese companies, facing slow domestic sales,
are increasingly under pressure to increase exports, a trend that will add
to the record Dollars 49bn trade surplus in the first half this year.
These ever gloomier prospects mean that stock market prices are likely to
remain under pressure. Mrs Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at Credit
Suisse Japan, said that, bearing in mind the downward revisions, the market
'could overshoot' to 14,000 and recover to 14,500: 'People who believe in
international convergence of price to earnings ratios say it will fall to
12,000 or even 9,000, but I don't think this is the case.'
The likelihood of a continuing drop in stock prices, and the certainty of a
decline in corporate earnings mean that the Bank of Japan's work is far from
done. Mr Mieno suggested yet again yesterday that the ODR had been cut for
the last time, but before the end of the year the bank may be forced to move
again.
Lingering faith in a recovery of stock prices has itself slowed the
government and corporate response to the market's continuing decline. Albeit
belatedly, the government is now front-loading public works spending this
fiscal year and, in the next month, will finalise a supplementary budget
that will increase public works spending by between an estimated Y5,000bn
and Y8,000bn.
The precise size of the package will be determined by austerity-minded
bureaucrats at the finance ministry, who are leaning towards a Y5,000bn
package, while the LDP wants Y8,000bn. Having comfortably won an election in
the upper house of the Diet, the LDP has an opportunity to convince the
finance ministry to finalise quickly the supplementary budget soon.
Apart from the budget, however, the LDP is at a loss. At an emergency
meeting on Friday night, party and government leaders suggested that
insurance companies increase their stock purchases or that the government
establish a new stock purchase fund. Neither option looks particularly
effective.
Japan's economy is adrift. Policy-makers seem unable to reverse the tide of
pessimism. For this their previous mistakes bear most of the blame. The
financial markets' reaction to the latest monetary manoeuvre not only
confirms the depth of the pessimism, but will also tend to increase it.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Saddam's wriggle explodes UN myth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cloud of self-deception is obscuring the United Nations tower in New York.
It allows the famous building's inhabitants to imagine that their
organisation is an effective force. The hard truth is that it is nothing
without the United States - and this summer the US is likely to withdraw its
hand from the glove puppet.
President Bush will pounce, either alone or through the UN, if he sees a
chance to score a victory somewhere on the face of the globe - perhaps even
in the Gulf - that might ensure his re-election. In real life such
opportunities are rare. The risk usually outweighs the potential reward.
Washington's foreign policy is therefore gradually being put on hold until
after November 3. That means the UN may have little more to offer the world
this year.
Take the latest myth, generated over the weekend. Its proponents would have
us believe that President Saddam Hussein has once again been obliged to bow
to UN pressure. The world's peacekeepers will after all be allowed to enter
the ministry of agriculture building in Baghdad, where they may search for
information on Iraq's missile programme. It is supposed to be a famous
victory. Piffle. Consider what Mr Saddam has achieved. First, he kept the UN
inspectors hanging around for 18 days in a camp outside the ministry. Then
he waved them goodbye as they went back to base. Then he failed to register
the slightest sign of concern at threats of renewed military action.
Finally he did a last-minute deal that suited him more than it suited the US
or the UN. If there was useful evidence in the agriculture ministry before,
there is unlikely to be more than shreds and ashes left behind now. Mr Rolf
Ekeus, the UN official in charge of the dismantling of Iraq's weapons, has
acknowledged that the building has probably been 'effectively cleaned out'.
That is bad enough. Far more damaging is the fact that Mr Saddam has been
able to tell the UN who it may send in and who it may not. The team of
inspectors includes two Americans. The latter will not be allowed inside the
agriculture ministry, but may hover outside. There they may sift through
material brought to them by colleagues more acceptable to Baghdad. There is
nothing to find, and the Americans are not permitted to find it. Farce is
piled upon farce. Civilised diplomats see it as a small compromise. As
yesterday's Iraqi papers indicated, Mr Saddam regards it as a useful
precedent.
We have been here before. Last September the president of Iraq 'backed down'
twice, once over the UN inspectors who had bravely sat him out in a Baghdad
parking lot, and once over UN helicopter surveillance flights. 'There's been
a pattern of cheat and retreat all the way through this,' said the White
House press secretary, Mr Marlin Fitzwater. The word went out that the
Iraqis would not be allowed to get away with it again. Now, less than a year
later, Mr Saddam has tested the 'cheat and retreat' policy to its limits.
Worse, he has extended those limits. He has finessed the UN into accepting
that some of its inspectors are less unwelcome than others. This must give
him hope of a new formula - cheat and defeat. President Bush warned on
Sunday that 'behaviour along the lines we have just witnessed will not be
tolerated'. If you were Mr Saddam, would you believe him?
None of this means that there is an easy solution. The Gulf ceasefire was
negotiated before the allies' implicit war aim, the toppling of the Iraqi
president, had been achieved. It was thought that since he had brought such
disaster upon his own people they would overthrow him. That was a US
miscalculation. The world now has to live with the consequences. The UN
believes it has succeeded in blowing up many of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, although nobody can be sure about replacements. It may be that
renewed bombing would be effective, although the experts doubt it. Perhaps
air power should be used to protect the Kurds in the north and the Shia
Moslems in the south. Perhaps a political settlement should be sought.
I make no judgment about these and other possible strategies for ensuring
that Iraq does not again threaten the peace. What is clear is that until
either Mr Bush is re-elected or Governor Bill Clinton enters the White House
the new world order is suspended.
This affects other areas of UN activity. When Yugoslavia first began to fall
apart the US decided to regard it as a regional problem for Europeans to
handle. Europe failed. National follies destroyed its unity. The Germans
insisted on the recognition of Croatia. The Greeks would not accept the name
'Macedonia'. President Mitterrand parachuted himself into Sarajevo. Now Lord
Carrington is being undermined.
Washington could not ignore the chaos. The US secretary of state, Mr James
Baker, decided that his country's interest lay in demonstrating that no
borders may be altered by force. The alternative was that a terrible example
would be set, leading to strife in eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. In US eyes the former Yugoslavia is therefore no longer a regional
problem, but a global one. Solving it has become part of building the new
world order. The question remains: will Washington provide the necessary
finance and military support? The Serbs seem unlikely to take notice of any
power on earth other than the US. So far, there is little sign of this being
seriously deployed. President Bush, so brilliant at foreign affairs in 1990
and 1991, has become immobilised by his opinion polls.
There is a third area of UN concern. In Somalia, a far-away land that was of
strategic interest to the US when Ethiopia was regarded as a Soviet client
state, some 2,000 people are dying of starvation every day, according to a
reported assessment by an official of the US Agency for International
Development. A quarter of the 8m population is reckoned to be in imminent
danger of starvation. Assistance has been sent by a variety of donors,
including the UN world food programme, the Save The Children Fund and the
British government. The trouble is that the rival clans fighting a merciless
civil war either steal such food as it arrives or prevent its passage.
Last week, 47 unarmed UN observers arrived to monitor a ceasefire that seems
about as likely to be effective as any in ex-Yugoslavia. The difference is
that an outside military force would stand a good chance of bringing the
Somali civil war to an end, or at the least act as an effective guard for
the relief convoys. The argument against sending a force in is that the UN
should not interfere in the internal affairs of its member states. That did
not stop the allies from protecting the Iraqi Kurds. Unfortunately for the
dying Somalis, Uncle Sam is disinclined to be the world's policeman, the UN
is impotent, and there is no one else to turn to.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Leading Article: No-confidence vote in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLUM reaction in the Tokyo markets to the half-point cut in the official
discount rate is becoming something of a habit. Stocks have fallen sharply
after each of the five rate cuts made since July 1 last year. Such
consistent refusal to be cheered by monetary easing suggests a verdict: the
market now seems to believe that the Japanese malaise is beyond purely
monetary cure.
This looks plausible. Decades of rapid growth have left Japanese domestic
demand heavily dependent on industrial investment. It is difficult at the
best of times for such an economy to slow down in an orderly way, since
investment responds sharply to quite mild disappointments about domestic
growth. The official reliance on consumer demand to fill the hole this time
always did look like wishful thinking, even before consumer confidence was
undermined by the property and stock market collapses; it now looks absurd.
Although the consensus forecasts still speak of some growth in the Japanese
economy this year, there is now a clear danger that the consensus is as far
behind events as it has proved in the UK. The recent news is forbidding. In
May, Japan's seasonally adjusted industrial production (the most recent
figure) fell 1.9 per cent from April; yet inventories rose 0.4 per cent.
Retail sales in June fell 4.3 per cent from a year earlier - the third drop
in four months. The money supply grew by only 0.9 per cent in the year to
June. As a government spokesman modestly admitted, it is hard to see any
promising stimulus anywhere.
It is not hard to suggest a possible remedy. In an economy where private
investment is undermined by poor growth prospects, and consumer confidence
by financial losses and doubtful job prospects, a really large programme of
public sector investment virtually suggests itself. This is what the US has
been demanding, and what the market may have been hoping to hear announced
last Friday. In the event, they found a government still dithering over a
package whose details are still obscure, but which appears to contain more
window-dressing than substance. As one Tokyo broker sourly commented
yesterday: 'The market does not need more details, it needs the kind of
government that would have made the hard decisions on Friday.'
Some hesitation is understandable. The policies which the Japanese
authorities are now being asked to adopt - a combination of easy monetary
policy and a strong fiscal stimulus - are precisely those adopted, again
under US pressure, in 1986, and which led to the bubble economy.
However, that history is very unlikely to repeat itself, for two reasons.
First, the Japanese authorities allowed the boom to persist, against their
better judgment, in order to help Mr George Bush in his 1988 election
campaign. This time, there is no such reason to inhibit timely monetary
tightening. But above all, confidence is now so low that the dangers are on
the downside. Dithering is the most dangerous policy.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Reform in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MONTH after the assassination of the acting head of state, Mohammed
Boudiaf, the Algerian authorities have yet to provide any clues as to how
they plan to break the country's spiral of violence and economic decline.
Some of the appointments made since his death suggest that the five-member
collective presidency wishes to respect Mr Boudiaf's commitment to serious
reform. But the continuing crackdown on militants of the banned Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) has not stopped repeated acts of sabotage, and the
12-year prison sentence handed out to the two main FIS leaders, Mr Abassi
Madani and Mr Ali Benhadj, has done nothing to calm their more extreme
supporters. Unless the government sets out a convincing new political and
economic direction for Algeria, civil war is a real possibility.
The new prime minister, Mr Belaid Abdesslam, was a respected adviser to the
late President Boumediene in the 1970s. But he is also reputed to be an
obstinate man, still attached to the old dogmas of the state command
economy. He recently criticised the abolition of subsidies and the
devaluation of the dinar, suggesting that Algeria should live on a war
footing, on the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of its Dollars 12bn annual
foreign income left after foreign debt service.
Since the riots of 1988, Algeria has embarked on a programme of reform and
is currently negotiating a third standby credit with the IMF. Will Mr
Abdesslam follow the traditional 'Algerian' way of pushing blindly ahead in
the belief that he is right, or will he take the advice of the IMF and EC,
and accept that Algeria is not immune to global market forces?
Agreement with the IMF, which as recently as last month commended Algeria's
policy of refinancing rather than rescheduling its Dollars 25bn foreign
debt, is vital. Without it other loans, notably from the EC, will not be
forthcoming. Nor will Algeria be able to attract foreign investment outside
the field of hydrocarbons. More than 100 joint ventures have been signed,
often by private Algerian entrepreneurs, with foreign companies in sectors
such as pharmaceuticals, building materials and computers. The prime
minister will have to negotiate with France, which - unlike Italy and
international commercial banks - has refused to refinance its Dollars 6bn of
state-guaranteed export credits.
Dialogue with its foreign economic and financial partners would be in
Algeria's best interests, and a measure of support from western countries,
whose oil companies have signed exploration agreements following last year's
liberalisation, will be forthcoming. But obtaining greater sacrifices from a
population, part of which tacitly or overtly supports the FIS, may prove
impossible, unless the collegiate presidency can establish a dialogue with
the FIS and other opposition parties. In the absence of such a dialogue the
violence at home seems certain to worsen.

FT  28 JUL 92 / France sets sights across the Rhine: Germany is increasingly
the target for French industrial investment and exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate France is launching an unprecedented invasion across the Rhine,
attracted by the belated realisation that Germany is the key to its success
in the European market. The first French boarding parties have had mixed
success in a country in which resistance to foreign incursions is still a
factor, although the single European market is helping to erode such
barriers. However, the French can already claim a record number of takeovers
and some export success. French companies last year took over 70 west German
companies, more than three times as many as in 1990, says the Patronat, the
French employers' association. Since the collapse of the Berlin wall almost
three years ago and the ensuing privatisation of most east German industry,
France has emerged as the largest foreign investor in eastern Germany by
far, having spent FFr7.7bn (Pounds 770m) on buying 78 privatised companies,
covering everything from industrial gases to petrol stations. France's
nearest rival, the US, has invested the equivalent of FFr5.2bn over the same
period, according to the Treuhandanstalt privatisation agency. At the same
time, French exporters have increased their share of the German market from
11.8 per cent in 1990 to 12.2 per cent in 1991. In addition, France's trade
deficit with Germany, its largest trade partner, is slipping, to FFr7bn last
year from FFr42bn in 1990. Car makers are leading the charge, with a 54 per
cent rise in exports to Germany last year. Symbolically, Renault is now the
biggest-selling foreign marque in Germany. In the east, sales of the Renault
19 last year overtook those of that quintessentially German success, the VW
Golf, partly because of the French car's low price. On the takeover front,
French investments in Germany include: The majority state-owned oil company,
Elf Aquitaine, which has won an agreement to run the monopoly petrol station
chain in eastern Germany. The deal entails an estimated DM6bn (Pounds
2.11bn) investment by Elf and its local partners - the largest French
investment in Germany since the second world war.
L'Air Liquide, which has become the east's market leader in industrial gases
by taking over three privatised producers. 'Our first objective in Europe is
Germany,' says a L'Air Liquide executive.
In west Germany, Moulinex, the French domestic appliance maker, which last
year paid DM130m for Krups, the family-controlled maker of coffee machines
and blenders.
France's biggest state-owned bank, Banque National de Paris (BNP), which is
negotiating to exchange stakes with a leading German bank, Dresdner, which
is in turn partly controlled by Germany's largest insurer, Allianz.
All this marks a big change from a few years ago, when the French business
world shrank under the shadow of German competition. Where does this new
confidence come from?
Part of the answer lies at home. French companies are reaping the benefits
of a decade of German-style monetary and budgetary rigour. Successive Paris
governments have followed a policy of disinflation after the short and
unhappy experiment with interventionism and budgetary expansion in the early
1980s. For the first time, French business has a solid base from which to
expand across the Rhine.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister and former finance minister, has for the
past 13 months delivered inflation rates lower than in Germany. French
inflation is now at 3 per cent annually against Germany's 4.3 per cent. This
is the key to French price competitiveness.
There is also broad political support for Mr Beregovoy's monetary and
budgetary rigour. To help matters further, France's strike record has
improved substantially, despite the disruption of the recent truckers'
strike.
Germany has been in the sights of French government economists for the past
10 years, but it has only recently become the central interest of business
strategists. Initially, the French takeovers of recent years were
concentrated in the US, rather than in Europe. But French companies have
realised that they can no longer afford to neglect Germany, which they had
previously ruled out as being all but closed to foreigners.
'It's all due to the fact that French companies have just begun to define
European strategies for themselves and this cannot be complete without a
strong German strategy. . . . But we are only catching up, after having been
delayed by the economic policies of the French government at the start of
the 1980s, which held up foreign investment,' says Mr Ernest-Antoine
Seilliere, chairman of the Patronat's economic commission.
Mr Michael Ballhausen, the executive in charge of BNP's link with Dresdner
Bank - recently cleared in principle by the French government  - explains:
'There has been a lack of BNP investment in Germany in the past. Dresdner is
in a similar position in relation to France.' Both partners realise that
they need more agencies abroad, preferably with local partners, to reflect
the growing internationalisation of their customers and competitors.
Another factor in France's new wave of German investment is the east German
privatisation programme. France was the first to benefit from the inability
of west German industry to absorb all the privatisations on offer - one
reason the Treuhandanstalt is encouraging foreign investment - and from the
concern of east Germans to reduce domination by their western compatriots.
Even so, foreign investment in eastern Germany has fallen below the Bonn
government's hopes. So far, non-German companies have bought a mere 5 per
cent of east German privatisations.
L'Air Liquide is a prime example of a French company which has seized this
chance to plug a hole in its European market strategy. For years, the French
company had a derisory share of the west German market, blocked by Linde,
the powerful domestic supplier of industrial gases. The pair had an unspoken
agreement that they would stay out of each others' national markets, an
accord which became unworkable with the European Commission's application of
competition policy.
With unification, L'Air Liquide snapped up three privatised east German
companies, against competition from Linde. The acquisitions gave L'Air
Liquide 40 per cent of the eastern market for industrial gases and 12 per
cent of the overall German market. It is investing FFr1.4bn in a bid to
increase its overall German market share to 20 per cent.
Yet resistance to French and other foreign investment can still be a factor,
even in the east. It is evident in a whole range of sectors, but it comes
from the grass roots, rather than reflecting official policy. Take the
experience of Electricite de France (EdF), the state-owned power utility
which is Europe's largest exporter of electricity. Two years ago, it had
high hopes of being the lead foreign partner in a west German consortium to
supply and distribute electricity in the east. In the event, EdF has had to
settle for a much smaller project, a joint venture with the west Germans to
build and manage new power stations in the east.
The problem was partly the fault of the French government, which held up the
deal by not letting the German partners take a stake in EdF, as they wanted.
But the final block came when east German local authorities said they wanted
to manage their own power supply, as their west German counterparts do.
Another example of the problems facing potential investors is the difficulty
experienced by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, which wants to expand
into Germany as part of its strategy of turning itself into a pan-European
bank.
Last autumn, Credit Lyonnais broke off co-operation talks with Commerzbank,
Germany's third-largest bank, after four years. The two banks could not
agree on who would take the lead in their respective domestic markets, and
Credit Lyonnais is now seeking an alternative opening in Germany.
'Because Commerzbank was there as a potential partner, we were not as
aggressive in Germany as we might have been,' admits Mr Ad Nollen, Credit
Lyonnais's European general manager. As a result, it now has fewer branches
there than in Belgium, he points out.
Credit Lyonnais has now found an alternative entry to Germany thanks to
another state-owned group, Assurances Generales de France (AGF). The pair
struck a gentlemen's agreement earlier this year to help each other get
round local opposition to two difficult investments.
AGF wanted to strike a commercial accord with an unwilling Aachener und
Munchener (AMB), Germany's third-largest insurer, in which it has a slightly
more than 25 per cent stake. To weaken the resistance of AMB's management,
the French insurer persuaded Credit Lyonnais to consider buying a stake in
the German insurer's loss-making banking subsidiary, Bank fur
Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG). The strategy appears to have worked, in so far as
AMB has recently lifted its objections to letting AGF use its full voting
rights and accepted that Credit Lyonnais should start negotiations on taking
the problems of the banking unit off its hands.
The clear lesson from the French companies that have succeeded across the
Rhine is that a local partner helps.
This, at least, is how Elf Aquitaine accounts for the ease with which it
acquired Minol, the east German petrol station chain. The French company is
acting with Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, which will
build a refinery to supply Minol, and SB Kauf, a hypermarket chain which
will stock the filling station shops. Elf's unsuccessful rival was a group
led by British Petroleum, with French, Austrian, Norwegian and Italian
partners, but no Germans.
Where French companies have met resistance, they attribute it to cultural
and psychological factors. But they believe this will be weakened by the
Treuhandanstalt's encouragement of foreign investment and by the opening of
European markets. 'There is latent protectionism,' says Mr Claude Tagger,
AGF's director of international development. 'But it can't possibly survive
under the weight of market forces.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / Arts: Lessons drawn from history - Drawing in Bologna
1500-1600
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most extraordinary features of the Renaissance in Italy is the
emergence of distinctive regional styles of painting and drawing. Among
these local schools the Bolognese only achieved the highest distinction with
the rise of the great triumvirate of the Carracci - Annibale, his brother
Ludovico, and their cousin, Agostino. This loan exhibition, Drawing in
Bologna 1500 - 1600 at the Courtauld Institute Galleries in London, the
fourth in a series of drawings shows organised by Sotheby's, ends where most
would begin.
Its finale concerns the early years of the Carracci in Bologna, before
Annibale's move to Rome and the classical triumph of the Farnese Gallery.
The main event allows a number of little - known artists to take the
spotlight. However, its fascination comes not so much from what it can teach
us about a neglected period of art or about the forerunners of one of the
greatest of painters, but because it reveals quite how unexpected and
exciting drawings can be.
Again and again it demonstrates how indifferent painters can turn out to be
distinguished, even influential, draughtsmen. Moreover, it highlights how
the medium of drawing allows a far greater freedom and spontaneity than is
ever available to a painter. A case in point is the substantial sheet - on
the evidence of this exhibition at least, there was no shortage of paper in
16th century Bologna - by Girolamo da Carpi.
Although as a rule hardly the most inspired of artists, he shows the flight
of Daedalus and Icarus against a romantic landscape with a memorably evoked
expanse of water. He has washed the paper a pale sepia to create a mid -
tone, and then added darker brown as well as white heightening to broaden
the tonal range, giving depth to the foliage, the landscape and to the
portentous clouds above the doomed Icarus. Pen is employed sparingly for the
figures, but it is these fluid ink washes that create an effect of real
poetry.
The visual qualities and technical range of these sheets more than outweigh
the undeniably recondite function of this show. Groups of drawings by, say,
Francesco Primaticcio and Bartolomeo Cesi reveal their mastery of red chalk.
The former favours a pinkish prepared ground for his graceful draped male
figure, the latter chooses blue paper of the kind first found in Venice for
his delightful study of a boy playing a viola da gamba. Neither is
especially prolific or celebrated as a painter, but they are both wholly in
their element on paper.
The exhibition also highlights the unpredictibility of the relationship
between an artist's way of drawing and way of painting. While there are many
artists - and the Flemish - born Denys Calvaert is the prime example here -
whose artistic personality remains the same whatever the medium, there are
others who seem to undergo a sea change.
There is considerable disagreement concerning the authorship of the
paintings variously given to Pellegrino Tibaldi and Nosadella, for example,
yet their drawing styles are quite distinct. Bartolomeo Passerotti is
another of these split personalities. Most of his paintings are not that
dissimilar from other late-Mannerist productions by the likes of Samacchini
and Sabatini - not the comic double act their names imply - but his drawings
are radically different.
Executed in a boldly hatched pen and ink technique, they are inspired by the
work of the Florentine Baccio Bandinelli, but go much further in their
freedom of touch. Three are particularly fine. One from Christ Church,
Oxford, is a preparatory study for a painting of the Adoration of the Magi,
in which the normal sequence of execution has been inverted.
Renaissance art treatises from Alberti onwards invariably recommend that
figures be studied in the nude and only then draped; it is evident here that
the nude studies came second.
There is every reason to believe that the study of the human figure from
life, which was one of the great revolutions of the Carracci academy, was
needed. Yet the way in which they - and Agostino in particular - used the
pen is inconceivable without the example of Passerotti.
His other great appeal is an eccentric fascination with low life, which
anticipated the genre studies of the Carracci. Hideous kissing couples,
slavering in a manner worthy of late Picasso, exotic animals and peoples,
are among the quirkiest of the period.
By the mid century Bologna had become a centre of scientific study, and
Passerotti's scrutiny of the more grotesque aspects of the natural world was
prompted by the explorations of his friend, Ulisse Aldrovandi, the noted
naturalist.
Here a splendidly repellent pair of demons, one all but concealing the
other, and an enchantingly flamboyant heraldic dragon, represent this side
of his art.
With the latest drawings - at least in this inevitably selective showing -
the honours are fairly evenly divided. The Carracci are rivalled if not
surpassed by the extravagant black chalk male nudes and boldly washed sheets
by Pietro Faccini. He is a Second Eleven painter but an unforgettable
draughtsman. You only have to look ahead to Guercino - who makes the first
team but arguably also excels on paper - to witness the effect a minor
master like Faccini can have.
The exhibition continues at the Courtauld Institute Galleries, Somerset
House, until August 31

Apart from its frightful theme music, My Dead Dad (C4 at 8.00) is a rather
charming new comedy set in Glasgow - with comprehensible accents, for once,
and glimpses of super architecture.
It is not exactly side-splitting stuff to my ear, but nonetheless neatly
scripted and the revenant father and his would-be yuppy son are well played
by Roy Hanlon and Forbes Masson.
There are no laughs in Town Hall (BBC2, 9.45). The latest episode in this
impressive series about the London borough of Lewisham certainly brings home
the predicament facing local government in inner-city areas.
Carlo Levi's Christ Stopped at Eboli is a wonderful book and it made a not
half-bad film. But what of Levi's talents as a painter? Rear Window (C4 at
9.00) investigates Levi's art and in the process, contemplates yet again the
sorrows of the Italian south.
If you fancy the idea of crawling into bed in a state of deep gloom, then
the film to watch is The Fixer (C4 at 10.00), based on Bernard Malamud's
novel. The big plus, however, is fine performances by Alan Bates and Dirk
Bogarde.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Technology: Ideas from Indiana recast face of steel - A
low-cost, energy-efficient way of making sheet steel is taking the industry
by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flat farmland of Indiana, in the heart of the American midwest, may seem
an unlikely starting point for a fundamental technological innovation in the
way steel is made.
Yet it is in precisely these bucolic surroundings that Nucor, the largest of
the American 'mini-mill' steel manufacturers, has been pioneering a new
process for making sheet steel which promises to shake up the world industry
during the coming decade.
So fascinated is the industry by Nucor's success that fact-finding missions
from dozens of countries have visited the company's plant at Crawfordsville,
some 50 miles west of Indianapolis, in the past two years. This summer the
numbers have grown so great that the plant has starting restricting tours,
lest they interfere with production.
Flat rolled or sheet steel is one of the industry's most important and
valuable products, with applications as varied as making pipes for the oil
industry, water tanks, washing machines and the interior and exterior body
work of cars.
Traditionally, it has been made by manufacturing methods which require
immense capital investment. That is why the sheet market was in the past the
exclusive preserve of Big Steel - America's large, integrated steel
manufacturers - rather than the smaller 'mini-mills' which have sprung up
over three decades to exploit market niches.
In a traditional plant, sheet is made by pouring liquid steel into a mould,
shaping it into red hot slabs between 8 and 12 inches thick and 30 to 40
feet long. Those slabs are then allowed to cool and are transported to
another shop where they are heated up again to about 2,350 degrees F.
They are then flattened into thin bands by passing them through a series of
rollers. The end product is known as hot-rolled sheet, and it has to be
rolled again (this time cold) before it is ready for many applications.
Industry technicians had long dreamed of finding a more efficient way of
producing sheet steel. In the mid-1980s, a West German company, SMS
Schloemann-Siemag, thought it had finally found the answer. Nucor decided to
take a huge gamble and become the first steel company in the world to use
the SMS technology.
Critics in Big Steel immediately decried the project, saying that Nucor
would never build its proposed greenfield plant at Crawfordsville within the
company's modest Dollars 270m budget and that the output of the plant would
not pose any competitive threat. They were wrong on both counts
The SMS Schloemann-Siemag process involves making sheet steel in a single
production run. The steel emerges from the caster only two inches thick and
some 150 feet long, thanks to the innovation at the heart of the SMS
technique - a new design of funnel mould which is shaped like a convex lens.
The resulting thin slab is then passed on rollers through a furnace which
makes the temperature across its width consistent. It then goes straight
through rolling mills, finally emerging as finished coils of hot-rolled
sheet.
That, at any rate, was the theory. Until Nucor built its plant, no one knew
how the technique would operate in practice and whether it would deliver
acceptable steel.
The plant suffered some serious initial problems when it started up in late
1989, but that is hardly surprising, given the novel nature of the
technology. 'There were bound to be some weaknesses in the thinking, and
fortunately they were all very easily correctable,' says Keith Busse, who
heads the Crawfordsville plant.
Whereas the SMS process is mechanically simpler than traditional technology,
it also has much tighter process control parameters. For example, it
requires the hot steel to be kept within a 20 degree temperature window,
compared with 70 degrees traditionally. 'Learning how to live within these
super-sensitive parameters took time.'
It also brought quality problems, two of which were particularly serious in
the early days. One was longitudinal cracks on the surface of the slab, due
to non-uniform cooling of the steel, which was caused by a combination of
seven or eight factors.
One factor was unevenness in the thin layer of film formed on top of a slab
by powder used as a lubricating agent inside the casting mould. The plant is
still experimenting with powders.
The second problem was blemishes, caused partly by premature use of the
lubricating powder.
Busse says both problems have now been largely solved, with each now
affecting about 1 per cent of output. A somewhat larger issue remains that
of a 'tight, thin gummy scale' that forms on 2-4 per cent of production.
The plant will be experimenting this autumn with a new kind of descaling
process. 'We believe it will give us a surface cleanliness vastly superior
to that of the industry,' says Busse.
When production started, some 35 to 40 per cent of Nucor's output was
flawed. Busse says that today the hot-rolled mill has a rejection rate of
4-6 per cent. That is approaching, but still above, the industry norm.
He points out that Nucor steel does not suffer from the internal and
transverse cracks found in traditional steel plants, and adds: 'I think
we're going to find that this technology ultimately yields a superior
product (compared with traditional methods) in terms of ductility and
mechanical performance.'
For the moment, Nucor's steel is not sufficiently good to go into the most
demanding applications, such as the exterior of motor cars. Busse says that
the company is not aiming at this market yet in any case. The Crawfordsville
plant is only now constructing a galvanising line.
'I'm not telling you we're ready to be the fender on a Cadillac,' he says,
'but we're not that far off.'
Whatever quibbles remain about the quality of the product, Crawfordsville
has been very successful in meeting its output targets.
The plant was built with a theoretical design capacity of 800,000 tons a
year. In 1990, it produced slightly less than 600,000 tons. Last year, the
figure was 803,000 tons, and this year, if the mill continues at its current
rate, Crawfordsville will ship nearly 1m tons.
A principal reason is that the designers assumed that the entry nozzle,
which carries steel into the SMS casting mould, would take such a beating
that it would have to be replaced after casting four ladles of steel. In
practice, one nozzle lasts routinely for 10 to 12 'heats' of steel.
Nucor reckons that the SMS process gives it a Dollars 50 to Dollars 70 a ton
production cost advantage over Big Steel; a huge gap when sheet steel is
selling at about Dollars 300 a ton. Busse reckons the cost advantage will
increase. 'The gap is going to get substantially wider.'
So pleased is the company with the SMS process that it is about to start
production from a second plant (at Hickman, Arkansas) and is thinking about
two further mills, one on the American west coast and one on the east coast.
It is also likely to put a second casting machine into the Crawfordsville
plant, which would add 700,000 tons to capacity at a cost of only Dollars
35m.
Others in the steel industry are starting to follow its lead. SMS says it
has three other orders for the technology - one from Taiwan, one from the
US, and one from Italy - while many other big steel companies, including the
American integrateds, have shown curiosity in thin-slab casting.
Nucor knows its rivals will eventually catch up. For now, however, Busse
says: 'Our competitors are well behind us, and financially impaired. We may
have a unique, vacuum type opportunity - and we want to take maximum
advantage of it.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / Technology: Lack of vision leaves venture research at risk -
Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BY CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the past dec-ade's most imaginative corporate research programmes is
in danger of dying for lack of interest from industry.
Venture Research, as it is called, was set up and funded through the 1980s
by BP, the UK oil company. It tries to seek out the world's most creative
university scientists - and to support pioneering proposals that fall
outside the scope of the normal sources of research grants.
On a budget of less than Dollars 5m a year, the programme has supported 26
Venture Research fellows working in physics, chemistry, biology and
engineering. Their achievements include important new ways of carrying out
chemical reactions, streamlining mathematical arguments, and understanding
the way genetic material is arranged in cells.
In 1990, BP decided that it could no longer afford to support Venture
Research, though it is maintaining current grants until the last ones run
out next year. The company, however, helped Don Braben, the programme's
founder, to set up Venture Research International.
That was meant to be a consortium of half a dozen corporate sponsors, each
covering a different industrial sector: for example, electronics, food and
agriculture, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and engineering. Together they would
provide a 'ring of covered waggons' around Venture Research, to pick up
anything produced by the scientists that was worthy of commercial
exploitation.
Unfortunately, Braben has not yet persuaded enough companies of the merits
of venture research to get the consortium going. So far only Sony, the
Japanese electronics company, has made a clear commitment of support, but it
insists that at least two western companies must agree to join. The
recession has been a handicap, but Braben has also been hindered by BP's
short-sighted refusal to make any further commitment to the enterprise.
Time is now beginning to run out. If the programme is not re-established
soon, and moreover on a long-term basis, it will lose its sense of identity
and the community of venture researchers, which has so far shown strong
loyalty, will begin to fall apart.
Warning, Overset column There is still hope. Earlier this month, Courtaulds,
the UK industrial materials manufacturer, invited a group of venture
researchers to a conference at its Kenilworth training centre with a dozen
of the company's senior R&amp;D staff.
The experience demonstrated firstly that the academic scientists are keen to
explain their work and build up contacts with industry - and secondly that
their fresh approach can make a worthwhile contribution. The Courtaulds
staff said afterwards they had found the meeting highly stimulating and had
picked up several good practical ideas.
Braben is now lowering his sights in order to keep Venture Research alive.
Originally, he had been asking companies to subscribe Dollars 1m a year to
join. Now he is prepared to accept much smaller contributions  - as little
as Pounds 100,000 - to attract medium-sized European companies, such as
Courtaulds, as well as global giants like Sony and BP.
The track record of Venture Research so far suggests that companies buying
in would get a good direct return on their money, though the nature of the
enterprise makes the outcome completely unpredictable.
The spin-offs are already worth much more than BP's total investment; they
include a widely used enzyme-based diagnostic test and a new system for
making left-handed and right-handed forms of molecules that can exist as
mirror images. There are also the intangible benefits which industrial
researchers derive from contact with academics who are exploring beyond the
boundaries of conventional scientific thought.
Venture Research is cheap by the standards of contemporary science, because
projects are in new fields in which competitive work has not yet pushed up
costs. They tend to rely on the imagination of the scientists more than on
expensive equipment.
On the whole, UK companies contribute rather little to university science
compared with competitors based in other countries. Venture Research would
provide an excellent means for a few of them to do more. How about it,
British Aerospace, GEC, ICI, Unilever, Glaxo?

FT  28 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Soccer - the good, the bad, the ugly
/ Peter Berlin describes a contest between men and boys for gold, dollars -
and glory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first of the Olympic soccer matches played in Barcelona called to mind a
philosophical conundrum that has long baffled bar-room philosophers. When is
a soccer ground half full and when is it half empty?
A crowd of 18,000 went to the 120,000-capacity Nou Camp stadium to watch
Italy beat the US. To Italy's top young professionals, such as Renato Buso,
whose previous big-time match had been in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley in
the European Cup final, Nou Camp must have seemed almost empty. To the US
college students, the noisy fans who did come made the arena seem almost
full.
Italy and Spain are the two most talented of the 16 under-23 teams which are
contesting the Olympic soccer tournament. The Italian team is packed with
players from Juventus, Sampdoria and AC Milan. Many of the Spaniards play
for Real and Atletico Madrid, and Barcelona.
But here Spain and Italy have a problem.
Before the tournament, the Spanish squad threatened to strike. They wanted
more money. They knew that the Olympics needed a good home squad to fill
seats.
With games at the Nou Camp and three other 40,000-capacity grounds, the
soccer tournament accounts for half the Olympic tickets on sale to fans. The
Spanish players also argued that they might be injured in the Olympics.
Their professional careers, they claimed, were not worth sacrificing for a
mere gold medal. For them, the Olympics represent risk.
In the US, in contrast, there is almost no professional soccer. For the
American players, and for those from eastern Europe, Latin America and
Africa, the Olympics are a shop window. The Games give them a chance to gain
what the Italians and Spaniards have and fear losing. If Italy or Spain do
not win the Olympic gold, it will be because will has triumphed over skill.
It was no surprise, then, that against Spain last Friday the Colombians came
out kicking. But in front of their fans the home team held their nerve,
kicked back and made their talent count in a 4-0 Group B win. In Group C,
Tomas Brolin, a star in Italy, and Joachim Bjorklund both played with the
same ferocity they showed for Sweden in the recent European championships.
The Paraguayans clattered into Brolin but he clattered back.
This is not to say the game was dirty. Outside the UK, players today are
trained to use violence with discretion and the Swedes and Paraguayans are
above all else well trained. The Swedish team is made up of men who recently
followed a long league season by reaching the semi-finals of the European
championship and the final of the European Under-21 competition (they lost
to Italy). Perhaps they are jaded, but I doubt it. The short, round Brolin
apart, they are a collection of strapping young athletes, fit, strong,
brave, their every move drilled and safe and predictable.
The Paraguayans, meanwhile, adopted the underdog tactics encouraged by
tournaments with a group format: play for a draw and hope something will
turn up. The game's few sparks came from Brolin. That is why he is being
paid a fortune to play in Italy while his team-mates are merely well paid
and play in Scandinavia.
Mercifully, the Italian team has flair to spare. If they had played 90
minutes against the US as they did the first 21, they would have won by an
American football score. Instead, they stopped trying. They allowed the US
to regroup, conceded a goal and ended the game hanging on to a 2-1 win.
Even so, it was a contest between men and boys. The difference in the
stature of soccer in the two countries was clearly demonstrated by
differences in the stature of the players. The Italians, 1.6kg a man heavier
and 8cm taller, simply looked more adult alongside the shorter, chunkier
Americans. In Italy, professional soccer has first call on the nation's
athletes; in the US the big men traditionally play football or basketball.
On the other hand, everyone here is desperate for the US to do well so as to
kindle enthusiasm for the 1994 World Cup. They are unlikely to win a medal,
but there are encouraging signs. In the 1990 World Cup the US took on the
full Italian team with a squad of well-disciplined athletes. This team
contains players prepared to trust their soccer instincts, such as winger
Cobi Jones and midfielder Claudio Reyna.
Traditionally, developing nations offer first the flair of ghetto football
and graft on discipline and work-rate later. The US, which started by
pinching athletes who were not big enough for other sports, are developing
in reverse.
Against Italy, Jones, the smallest player on the field, took on and beat the
hulking Italian full backs Baggio and Matrecano.
Everywhere they look in Barcelona the American soccer players will see the
Olympic mascot and be reminded of the humiliation they received at the feet
of his equally cuddly namesake. But even in defeat, Jones did his prospects
of a lucrative contract far more good than any of the Swedes or Paraguayans
did in avoiding defeat.
Meantime, Fifa, soccer's governing body, has fiddled with the rules again.
It has decided that goalkeepers may not handle back passes. This, says Fifa,
will get rid of 'negative' football. The Olympics is the first big
competition to be played with the new rule.
How the rule will effect play is not crystal clear because the players have
not yet absorbed it. Indeed, the Swedes did not even know that the rule
covered back headers, too.
Certainly fewer defenders have turned, when in no danger, and passed 30
metres back to the 'keeper. But they will start to do so again when they
realise that if the goalie is unmarked he can still trap the ball with his
feet, jog out of the area and welly the ball down field.
In tight defensive situations, though, the new rule has transformed play. In
the first 20 minutes of their match, Buso and his Italian colleagues pressed
the US defenders relentlessly. Sometimes the US played the ball creatively
out of defence; more often they panicked and belted it anywhere - usually to
the Italians close to goal - or panicked and did not belt it anywhere.
Once they adjust to the new rule, players can worry again whether the
stadium is half full - or half empty.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Banks report increase in their mortgage lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK LENDING for house purchases increased modestly in the second quarter,
but the rise did not represent a real improvement in the housing market, the
British Bankers' Association said yesterday.
The latest quarterly figures from the association, the trade body for
Britain's nine biggest banking groups, showed that mortgage lending in the
second quarter totalled Pounds 4.2bn compared with Pounds 3.6bn in the first
quarter and Pounds 4.1bn in the second quarter of last year.
Lord Inchyra, the association's secretary-general, said: 'Considering the
situation in the domestic property market, this must be regarded as quite a
satisfactory outturn.' However the increase was unlikely to represent any
real improvement in the housing market. 'When figures are available for all
lenders, I suspect they will show that the banks have taken a larger share
of a smaller market,' he said.
Lending by banks for house purchases represent about a third of total
mortgage lending. Mr John Ecklin, head of the association's statistical
unit, said the banks may have increased their market share by offering more
attractive schemes. 'The banks are offering a lot of fixed-rate schemes at
the moment which are very popular with the public,' he said.
Some of the improvement could also be put down to seasonal factors,
reductions in mortgage rates and the temporary lifting of stamp duty.
There were 81,900 approvals for mortgages in the second quarter, a 23 per
cent increase on the first quarter. This restored the figure to the same
level as in the second quarter of last year. For the first time since the
series began in 1986, just over half of the approvals were for first-time
buyers.
The average value of new loans approved rose from Pounds 44,700 to Pounds
45,600, although this was still 4 per cent below the average value a year
ago.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Council house rents rise 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL HOUSE rents in England and Wales have risen by an average of 11 per
cent this year, taking the average increase since 1990 to 44 per cent,
according to a survey by local authority associations.
The survey of 282 councils shows average weekly rent levels up from Pounds
20.70 in 1989-90 to Pounds 29.81 this year, an increase of nearly a quarter
after inflation. Council rents are still lower than those in the private
rented sector in most areas.
The most significant force behind the steep increases is the government's
rule that local authorities must balance their housing revenue accounts
without subsidies from other sources. This is why some of the largest
increases are in Labour authorities: Camden in London has increased rents by
an average of 30 per cent this year and Hackney in London and Reading by 21
per cent.
Among Conservative councils, the largest increases this year are in Wycombe
(35 per cent), Bexley in London (34 per cent) and Hillingdon in London (28
per cent). Across England, the north-west has the lowest percentage rent
increase (7.4 per cent) and Greater London the highest (14.9 per cent). In
London the average weekly rent is more than Pounds 40.
Reduction in government subsidy is also a factor in the increases. This year
three-quarters of authorities will pay more in housing benefit than they
receive in housing revenue account subsidy, while expenditure on rent
rebates has risen from Pounds 2.8bn to Pounds 3.4bn in the past year.
The survey, by the Association of District Councils and the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, expects receipts from council house sales will
fall more than a third over the next year, from around Pounds 544m to Pounds
338m. It also expects local authority spending on repairs, improvement
grants and housing associations to decline sharply in cash terms.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Home rescue scheme shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY HOMEOWNERS in danger of eviction because of mortgage arrears are
refusing to take part in mortgage-into-rent rescue schemes, Abbey National
said yesterday.
The UK's second largest mortgage lender said about half of customers
approached with such an offer declined it.
Abbey National said: 'They fought hard to become owner-occupiers of their
homes and they do not want to become tenants again. Sometimes they tell us
that the rent they would pay after a rescue would be close to their mortgage
payments or they think their prospects might get brighter in the next couple
of months.'
About 24,400 Abbey National customers were more than six months behind with
payments at the start of the year, but only eight have been rescued by the
scheme launched in the spring.
Two other large lenders have confirmed that they are trying to design new
mortgage rescue schemes because their original ones have produced only a few
rescues.
Leeds Permanent said yesterday it is examining a scheme to speed up mortgage
rescues by allowing an outside company to buy up properties whose owners
have a severe payments backlog. They would then be allowed to stay as
tenants.
The society would be the minority shareholder in the company which would be
set up by a financial institution which it declined to name. The scheme has
yet to be approved by the Building Societies Commission.
Nationwide said yesterday it was considering possible new approaches to
mortgage rescue but refused to give details.
Later this week the Council of Mortgage Lenders will publish figures which
are expected to show a continuing rise in the number of homeowners at risk
of eviction.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Leader with 'first-class honours degree in Lloyd's'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MANY ways Mr David Rowland, the 59-year-old chief of Sedgwick, might have
seemed an obvious choice for the chairmanship of the Lloyd's of London
insurance market. But the succession was no foregone conclusion.
Mr Rowland has worked for more than 30 years in the London insurance market
and has been a Name at Lloyd's since 1973.
As head of the task force which carried out a root-and-branch investigation
of the Lloyd's market last year, Mr Rowland is an enthusiastic advocate of
reform and believes Lloyd's must cut its costs, secure its capital base and
improve its competitiveness.
And as the market moves to implement the 70 reforms recommended by the task
force, Mr Rowland seems a logical choice to an outsider.
However, Mr Rowland is coming to the end of his career and earlier this year
was unenthusiastic about taking on the stressful post.
Sedgwick, the UK's second biggest insurance broker, which Mr Rowland has
chaired since 1989, has recently completed an extensive internal
reorganisation. Mr Rowland, who remarried last year, might well have been
expected to spend more time at his Islington home.
As a broker Mr Rowland has had a 'semi-detached' relationship with the
market. His 36 years working on it have been entirely with insurance brokers
 -first, after medical school in Cambridge, with Matthews Wrightson, then
with Stewart Wrightson, one of the most successful brokers of the 1980s, and
finally, from 1988, with Sedgwick. During his period at Lloyd's brokers have
moved to diversify their dependence on Lloyd's. Mr Rowland himself has
argued forcefully that underwriters - rather than brokers - should take a
more active role in the market's management.
Although Mr Rowland also admits a passionate concern for Lloyd's, his most
recent experience in the senior ranks of the institution was not entirely a
happy one. Between 1986 and 1989 he was a working member of the council, the
market's governing body. One close colleague says: 'It was at a time when
nobody admitted there was very much wrong. David made himself very
unpopular. He could not understand why nobody wanted to change anything and
made himself very unpopular by refusing to attend lunches.'
Since then, though, the mood at Lloyd's has changed radically, as the market
has plunged into record losses and unprecedented political turmoil.
Mr Rowland's authorship of the task force report clearly proved decisive. It
gives him a 'first-class honours degree in Lloyd's. He's up to speed' - in
the words of Mr Robert Hiscox, a former chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting
Agents Association and a member of the task force.
Supporters argue that Rowland's personality also equips him to lead a market
full of divergent and sometimes conflicting interests. He has none of the
brashness and agression typical of the London insurance broker. 'He can work
with anybody, deal with anybody. That is his great strength,' says Mr
Michael Wade, chairman of brokers Holman Wade.
Above all, Mr Rowland's experience at the head of a large listed company is
seen as invaluable at Lloyd's, which is dominated by small underwriting
agencies. As the market looks to develop a more sophisticated approach to
its business and strengthens its links with corporate capital that
experience could prove to be vital.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Little property growth indicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESIDUAL land values, a sensitive measure of the property industry, are
still falling in most parts of the market, according to a new survey.
The report, by Hillier Parker, the firm of chartered surveyors, showed that
residual land values in central London are from 8 per cent to 17 per cent of
their peak in 1989. It underlines the depressed state of the market and
gives little sign of an upturn.
Residual land values, which are linked to the viability of property
development, are calculated by subtracting development costs from the
capital value of a potential development. According to Hillier Parker, they
are the most sensitive indicator available. The firm says that if the values
had been calculated in the late 1980s, they would have given an early
warning of the property downturn as they led the fall in rents by up to two
years.
The study counters an assumption which stems from the lack of development
activity that residual land values are generally negative. Industrial
property and northern office parks are the only sectors that have negative
residual land values.
Residual industrial land values have been negative for most of the past
seven years, as rents never reached the point where development was
profitable. As a result there is little stock to hold back rents when the
economy recovers.
Residual land values have started to increase in the industrial sector,
though rents have not yet improved.
In the retail warehouse sector, the only other part of the market to show an
increase in residual land values, rents have already increased.

Teesside's Transporter Bridge, a marvel of Edwardian engineering, reopened
yesterday after repairs which tested the ingenuity of today's engineers,
Chris Tighe writes.
The bridge was opened in 1911 to link the steelworks and shipyards which
then lined the north bank of the Tees to Middlesbrough on the south bank. It
carries vehicles and passengers on a deck suspended over the water at road
level. The deck is suspended on cables attached to the bridge's overhead
trolley mechanism and the trolley runs on girders supported by 225ft towers
on each bank.
The bridge was closed for the repairs In March 1990 after an axle pin
sheared, sending one of the trolley wheels crashing to the deck. The
repairs, which have cost about Pounds 150,000, proved unexpectedly
challenging. Although new parts were made to original tolerances, it was
discovered that settlement had caused the towers to sink on one side.
The costs were borne by a number of bodies, including Cleveland,
Middlesbrough and Stockton councils and the Teesside Development
Corporation.
The Transporter is one of 16 such bridges built in the late 19th and early
20th centuries and is the last fully operational transporter bridge in
Britain.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Retailers to press for changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY leading retailers are to press for changes to commercial rental
arrangements, arguing that current practices distort the free-market economy
to the detriment of consumers, John Thornhill writes.
Sir Desmond Pitcher, chief executive of Littlewoods, has written to most of
the UK's biggest retailers suggesting that they take action. A meeting will
take place this autumn to co-ordinate their approach.
Sir Desmond said he wanted to update the 25-year commercial property leases,
unique to Britain, which provide for upward-only rent reviews every five
years. 'In the real world prices go down as well as up,' he said. 'We think
that arbitration should take into account the economic factors now
prevailing.'
A recent report by the free-market Adam Smith Institute argued that 'the
rent review process constitutes an institutionalised, legally induced form
of cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces'.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Contempt case opens against Channel 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANNEL 4 programme at the centre of a contempt case which opened in the
High Court yesterday was 'long on accusation and short on evidence,' Mr
Andrew Collins, QC for the director of public prosecutions, alleged.
Channel 4 has been charged with contempt of court over its failure to comply
fully with an order to reveal sources for a programme on terrorism in
Northern Ireland.
Channel 4 and Box Productions, the makers of Committee, a programme on
alleged links between the security forces and Loyalist assassination squads
in Northern Ireland, face sequestration of their assets or unlimited fines.
The order has been made under the Prevention of Terrorism Act - the first
time the legislation has been used in an effort to compel journalists to
reveal sources.
Channel 4 says the order could lead to identification of a source who
appeared in the programme shown last October and put the life of the source
'in grave danger'.
Channel 4 has already handed over an 80-page dossier of material obtained
during the making of the programme but has refused to reveal information
about the source.
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said when the contempt
charges were first brought that the Channel 4 board had been placed in the
invidious position 'of having to choose between breaking the law and putting
individual lives in danger'.
Mr Collins told Lord Justice Woolf and Mr Justice Pill that the order
requiring disclosure of documents had been properly made.
Those who chose to investigate terrorism had to do so in the knowledge that
they would commit a serious offence if they did not hand over information
about those involved to the authorities, he said.
The source, identified in court only as Source A, alleged that there was a
group known as the Inner Force including high-ranking police officers which
was responsible for passing on information about suspected IRA members to
Loyalist terrorists so as to provide them with assassination targets.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Directors keep pay details secret
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW BRITISH companies disclose details of their directors' pay packages,
according to an analysis by Company Reporting, the accounts monitoring
service.
Only 10 per cent disclose the amount paid to directors in bonuses and just 3
per cent show how these bonuses are calculated in spite of recommendations
on greater disclosure from the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance.
The study, which examined 440 accounts published during the past nine
months, found that 28 per cent of companies provided some information on
directors' earnings and that the figure was rising.
Some 19 per cent disclosed contributions to pension schemes on behalf of
directors, 10 per cent performance-linked incentive payments and 2 per cent
some other form of payment.
Company Reporting says that no company published the actual formula or
calculation used to provide directors' bonuses, which have come under
increasing criticism during the recession.
It says that among companies providing the most extensive information of
directors' bonuses are the Economist, the airports operator BAA, Boots and
Reed International. Some 5 per cent of companies - including Midland Bank,
RTZ, British Airways, Lonrho and Forte - disclose the earnings waived by
directors.
Company Reporting says BAA discloses auditor fees separately from other
services provided by its accountants. This is in advance of the introduction
of Company Act requirements to do so.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Call for joint action on R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOINT EFFORT by the government, academics and industry is needed to boost
investment in engineering research and development, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers urges in a report today.
The proposal for a forum to co-ordinate action is one of 10 recommendations
by the institution in a report highlighting the lack of investment in UK
engineering R&amp;D compared with countries such as Germany and Japan.
The institution, which represents more than 78,000 engineers, says
investment in R&amp;D is of critical importance in the coming decade and beyond
for improving the inadequate performance of manufacturing industry.
It says the UK's R&amp;D total expenditure in the period leading to the 1989
Cabinet Office R&amp;D Review was about 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product.
Civil R&amp;D spending was only about 1.6 per cent of GDP, compared with about
2.8 per cent in Japan. This is compounded, says the report, by a falling
proportion of UK government funding available for civil R&amp;D from around 0.7
per cent of GDP in 1981 to about 0.5 per cent in 1989.
'These statistics all point to a reduction in the nation's R&amp;D effort,' says
the report. 'It is belived this has an ultimate relationship to the
commercial exploitation of technology and consequently is at least partially
responsible for the slippage of the UK in the international scene.'
Among other concerns raised by the report are the recent limitation of
funding for the Science and Engineering Research Council and lack of
substantive support for small and medium-sized companies in securing
European R&amp;D funds.
Apart from proposing an Engineering Research Forum to help develop coherent
R&amp;D funding policies and actions, the institution also wants industry to
make a commitment to increase R&amp;D funding.

FT  28 JUL 92 / VAT hope for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL businesses with cash flow problems may in future escape penalties for
not paying value added tax on time, if they themselves have been paid late
by customers, as a result of a Court of Appeal ruling yesterday .
Three judges ruled by a two-to-one majority that Customs and Excise had been
wrong to impose a surcharge of over Pounds 1,000 on Mr John Steptoe, an
Essex electrical contractor.
The judges accepted Mr Steptoe's argument that he could not have paid the
VAT due because he had been paid late by his principal customer, the London
Borough of Redbridge.
The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the ruling, saying that Customs
and Excise should allow late payment of invoices as a 'reasonable excuse'
for non-payment of VAT. Thousands of small businesses could be affected, it
added.
The decision was also well received by the Association of British Chambers
of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry, although the CBI
warned small companies 'to be very careful in delaying payment to any
statutory body'.
Mr Steptoe, who has represented himself in the case did 95 per cent of his
work during the relevant accounting periods in 1987 and 1988 for Redbridge
council.
A VAT tribunal had said it was 'one of those rare cases' where the taxpayer
might legitimately put forward as a reasonable excuse the unexpected and
continuing conduct of the person who caused his prolonged shortage of funds.
That decision was backed by the High Court.
Lord Donaldson, the Master of the Rolls, and Mr Justice Nolan dismissed an
appeal by the Customs and Excise. Lord Justice Scott said he would have
allowed it.
Customs and Excise were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords, but
can still apply direct to the law lords for leave.
Lord Justice Nolan said Customs and Excise argued that if its appeal failed,
all reasons for insufficient funds were capable of being advanced as
'reasonable excuses' for late payment.
He added that this concern was 'exaggerated'.  As a general rule the Customs
and Excise Commissioners and the VAT Tribunal could be trusted to determine
in any given case whether a reasonable excuse for non-payment existed.
He was unable to conclude that the tribunal was wrong in law in deciding
that Mr Steptoe ha a reasonable excuse.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Dock workers lose union recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED British Ports, one of Britain's largest docks employers, has
withdrawn recognition rights from the transport union RMT. The move is a
further step in the company's campaign to put all staff on to personal
contracts.
Although 650 of the company's 2,000 staff are nominally members of the
union, only 90 have refused to sign the personal contracts which require
them to give up all their rights to union representation.
Until now the union has continued to bargain on behalf of the 90 - who are
mainly manual workers in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, south Wales - but the
company has now written to the RMT saying that it will no longer be
recognised for collective bargaining or individual disciplinary issues.
Lawyers for the union believe that the company may have decided to go ahead
after the Employment Appeal Tribunal recently upheld an appeal by Associated
Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, against the National Union of
Journalists.

FT  28 JUL 92 / BR offshoot to oversee Channel link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL has created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Union Railways to
take responsibility for building the planned Pounds 4.5bn rail link between
London and the Channel tunnel.
Mr John Prideaux, formerly managing director of BR's new ventures division
and chairman of the new company, said the aim was to give people working on
the link more focus and motivation.
However, it is also likely to be seen as paving the way for the managers of
the project to bid for control of it under the government's proposals to
privatise BR.
Several attempts to start the link culminated last year in the government's
decision that BR should produce revised proposals for a route taking an
eastern approach to the capital through Stratford, east London.
The government said that once the route had been decided, the private sector
should take the project forward; but it is not yet clear whether the private
sector will be interested.
Mr Prideaux said he expected to set out the main options by the end of the
year, complete with economic appraisals and options for public-sector and
private-sector funding.
The government, he hoped, would safeguard the route in May or June next year
so a hybrid bill could go to parliament at the end of the year. If
construction started as soon as the bill had been passed, the line could be
ready by the turn of the century, he said.
Mr Prideaux added that he thought the private sector would only want to get
involved in the project after a bill had been passed, so Union Railways
should have a life of at least three years.
He said he had 'no idea' whether he or Union Railways would then bid for the
project. 'I would only be interested in bidding if it was going to be a
profitable proposition,' he said.'
Apart from Mr Prideaux, the board of Union Railways comprises Mr Gil
Howarth, project director; Mr James Jerram, British Railways Board director
with responsibility for finance; and Professor Sir Frederick Holliday, the
conservationist.
The white paper on rail privatisation emphasised that BR employees would be
encouraged to take a direct stake in the privatisation of the railway.
Advice would be available to help them put together bids, it said.

ABOUT 20 companies have expressed an interest in buying the customer
database of Land Travel, the Bath-based coach operator which collapsed last
week.
Mr Robert Buller of liquidator Grant Thornton said yesterday that most of
the potential purchasers were travel companies experiencing a difficult
season.
Sale of the database would not provide funds to compensate the estimated
50,000 people who booked holidays with Land Travel or the 2,500 who had
their holidays cut short, he said.
Any funds obtained from the sale would go towards paying the cost of the
liquidation.

<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Robert Gregory, director
of human resources, had been cleared of any 'improper conduct or
shortcomings' as a result of an internal inquiry, Raymond Snoddy writes.
It said the outcome of the inquiry was being published because a question
asked at the recent annual general meeting made shareholders aware of the
inquiry.
MGN did not say what the allegations against Mr Gregory had been, although
the company had always stressed he had never been accused of any illegality.
Mr Gregory, the company said, would continue in his post and the inquiry had
not interrupted his work.
The inquiry is believed to have looked at the transfer of Mr Gregory's
pension from Maxwell Communication Corporation to MGN. It was found to be in
order following a change in Mr Gregory's role.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Part-time working urged for rail staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL wants up to one third of its staff to work part time by the end
of the decade, according to Mr Paul Watkinson, personnel director.
Only about 5 per cent of BR staff are on part-time contracts. But Mr
Watkinson told the magazine Personnel Today: 'We have to change the shape of
our labour force. We're a service business and I would be looking for
between 25 and 30 per cent part-time staff.'
He said that the changes would occur regardless of whether staff worked for
BR or a franchise holder. He added that part-timers' pay and conditions
would match those of full-timers according to the hours they worked.
BR managers believe that they run a classic 'peaks and troughs' business
making part-time work appropriate. This applies to ticket sales but also to
train driving and signalling functions.
Mr Watkinson's comments appear to confirm several recent reports that it is
the public sector that is now more concerned with increasing the number of
part-timers than the private sector.
RMT, the main rail union, described the plan as 'really stupid' and said it
was inspired by the fact that part-time workers have fewer rights and are
less likely to join unions.
Nearly one third of British companies have asked people leaving their jobs
to repay the cost of their training.
Most managers believe job leavers should repay part or all the costs of
their training, according to the magazine Personnel Today. Some 28 per cent
of companies taking part in the survey conducted by the Industrial Society
had such policies, while a further 8 per cent were considering it. Overall
55 per cent of managers favoured the idea, and only 26 per cent ruled it
out.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Evangelist in industry's hottest seat: David Lascelles meets
the chief executive of Nuclear Electric, which posts its results today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME might describe it as the hottest seat in British industry: that of
chief executive of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power
generator. But if it is, Mr Robert Hawley does a good job of looking
unconcerned.
'Are these difficult times?' he asks with a shrug. 'All life is difficult.'
Only six weeks in the job, he comes to Nuclear Electric at a time when it
faces perhaps its biggest challenge - to persuade the government to give
nuclear power a chance rather than condemn it to a lingering death.
Nuclear Electric, formed in 1990 out of the former Central Electricity
Generating Board, owns and operates 12 nuclear power stations in England and
Wales.
Mr Hawley's first hurdle will come today when he and Mr John Collier, his
chairman, will present Nuclear Electric's latest results. Last year the
company reported a loss of Pounds 14m. What will it be this time? 'The
trends are all improving,' says Mr Hawley.
An upbeat message is essential if Nuclear Electric is to build any momentum.
Its target is 1994, the year when the government has said it will review
Nuclear Electric and, in effect, decide its future. By that date, Nuclear
Electric must be able to present a plausible case that it can produce
electricity profitably and safely.
If it succeeds, it should receive the go-ahead to build the Sizewell C
station on the Suffolk coast to complement Sizewell B which is now nearing
completion. If it fails, nuclear power will go into decline as ageing
stations are taken out of commission and not replaced.
As one might expect, Mr Hawley is something of an evangelist for nuclear
power. A tall 55-year-old with a good-humoured manner, he is a qualified
electrical and mechanical engineer who has spent his whole career in the
power business. Much of it was at Northern Engineering Industries which
later merged with Rolls-Royce.
He says he took the job at Nuclear Electric because he wanted a fresh
challenge. 'I feel very comfortable about it,' he adds. 'With my background
I can bring a great deal to Nuclear Electric.'
He argues the case for nuclear power on several grounds. First, he says, it
is clean - if Britain's nuclear capacity, which accounts for 20 per cent of
the total, were coal-fired, some 48m more tons of carbon dioxide would be
spewed into the atmosphere each year.
'Without us, the government hasn't got a cat in hell's chance of meeting its
carbon-dioxide reduction targets,' he says. He also stresses nuclear power's
safety record and the contribution it makes to fuel diversity and
employment. 'We're part of the solution, not part of the problem.'
Mr Hawley's greatest challenge will be to bring Nuclear Electric into a
condition in which it can justify its existence on commercial grounds.
Even if it reports a small profit today, this will not reflect the true
state of the business.
Nuclear Electric receives Pounds 1.2bn a year from the government to
compensate it for the heavy provisions it has to make to finance the
clean-up of reactors when they end their useful lives.
Mr Hawley's target is for Nuclear Electric to make a profit without that
money, and to do so by 1995. Government aid is due to be phased out anyway
in 1998.
This implies a needed profit improvement of about Pounds 250m a year between
now and then. This will be achieved by selling more electricity  - if
possible at a higher price - and by hammering down costs.
The workforce is to be reduced from 12,400 to 9,500 over the next three
years, and overheads are being pared back.
Mr Collier said recently that if Sizewell C were built it could produce
electricity at just under 3p a unit - considerably less than Sizewell B's
expected 4p to 5p, thanks to economies of scale. It would also be closer to
the 2.5p cost of conventional power stations.
At this level, the station would earn a rate of return of 8 per cent if it
could be made to run 85 per cent of the time. Although this rate is low by
commercial standards, it meets the government's requirements.
'This all means that we have got a competitive product,' Mr Hawley says.
'This is not a doomed industry. This is a growth industry.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / Reversal of fortune for Kevin Maxwell: FT writers on efforts
by liquidator Robson Rhodes to secure a bankruptcy declaration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, RAYMOND HUGHES and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN Maxwell, whose father, Robert Maxwell, was one of Britain's richest
men, is on the verge of becoming Britain's biggest bankrupt.
On August 17 Robson Rhodes, the liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, which recently obtained judgment against Mr Kevin Maxwell for
more than Pounds 400m, will ask the High Court to declare him bankrupt.
Robson Rhodes believes that will give the best chance of gathering in his
assets for his creditors, of which it is the largest. If it is successful,
Mr Maxwell will assume the mantle of record bankruptcy held for 18 years by
Mr William Stern, the former property millionaire made bankrupt in 1974 for
Pounds 118m after his business crashed with debts of nearly Pounds 143m.
The High Court granted the liquidator final judgment on the grounds that Mr
Maxwell had no defence to allegations of breaches of his fiduciary duty as a
director of BIM, from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell
companies pension funds are missing.
The liquidator is seeking final judgment on an identical claim against Mr
Maxwell's brother Ian. It intends, if that succeeds, to apply to have him
declared bankrupt also.
Robson Rhodes has wasted no time in moving against Mr Kevin Maxwell. The
judgment against him was obtained only on July 20. The liquidator then
served a statutory demand for payment of the judgment debt and issued an
expedited petition under section 270 of the 1986 Insolvency Act.
Normally three weeks are allowed for compliance with a statutory demand but
the section permits abridgement 'if there is a serious possibility that the
debtor's property or the value of any of his property will be significantly
diminished during that period'.
The liquidator hopes also to short-circuit the normal procedure of the
appointment of an interim receiver, followed by the official receiver, who
would take possession and control of the debtor's assets. It hopes to get
the immediate appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy, who would become the
legal owner of Mr Maxwell's assets.
In an affidavit sworn after his father's death, Mr Kevin Maxwell put his
assets at Pounds 1.6m. He admitted to debts of Pounds 1.75m. Less is known
about the assets of Mr Ian Maxwell, who lives in a Pounds 400,000 flat in
Belgravia registered in the name of his wife Laura.
Since news of the raids on the pension funds of Maxwell empire companies
emerged last year, the previously approachable brothers have retreated
behind a wall of silence.
Robson Rhodes is confident that the trustee's authority will be recognised
by courts worldwide and will achieve quicker access to information - and
assets - than the Serious Fraud Office or other government entities which
have to work through cumbersome diplomatic channels.
The trustee is likely to focus in particular on areas such as Liechtenstein,
where trusts are suspected of holding the key to a secret Maxwell 'pot of
gold', and the US, where companies in which members of the Maxwell family
had either directorships and or shares are suspected of having been used as
vehicles for transferring cash beyond the more visible parameters of the
Maxwell empire. Administrators of Maxwell companies have begun legal action
in the US, believing that transfers to Liechtenstein companies occurred both
before and after Robert Maxwell's death last November.
Although not named in court, two companies - PH(US) Inc, a US company
controlled by Swico Anstalt, a Liechtenstein company that is part of the
Maxwell Foundation, and Sphere Inc, a California computer-games business
also controlled from Liechtenstein - are the focus of this legal action.
The Maxwell family's Liechtenstein associates made clear last January that
they were eager to co-operate with British investigators. However local
lawyer Mr Werner Keicher, who is also a director of the Maxwell Foundation,
has said that a way had yet to be found under Liechtenstein law to release
assets.
The trustee will look closely at the assets of Mr Kevin Maxwell's wife
Pandora - including a Pounds 300,000 converted barn in Oxfordshire to which
her family has recently moved - to satisfy themselves that the purported
ownership is genuine. A bankruptcy trustee has the power to take back from a
wife anything given to her by the bankrupt within the previous two years.
After the trustee has gathered all the available assets he will distribute
them to creditors. Priority goes to preferential creditors such as the
Inland Revenue.
During his bankruptcy, which could last for years, Mr Maxwell would be
debarred from being a company director or involved, directly or indirectly,
in the management of any company. Any money he received would have to be
handed to his trustee, who would be empowered to allow him an amount to live
on.

   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
URENCO, the uranium enrichment consortium linking British Nuclear Fuels with
German and Dutch partners, has broken into the Japanese market. Tokyo
Electric Power Company (Tepco) has awarded Urenco a long-term contract
expected to be worth at least Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m) over 10 years.
Tepco said that because there were few international providers of enriched
uranium, it had decided to widen its sourcing in order to ensure that its
needs were met. As the country's biggest electric utility, Tepco's choice of
Urenco is thought likely to prompt other Japanese regional power companies
to follow suit.
Japan is now one of the few countries with a clear policy to expand nuclear
generating capacity. Its needs for enriched uranium are currently met by the
US, through the Energy Department in Washington, and by the French-led
Eurodif. Tepco said the contract, from 1995 to 1996, had passed all
approvals required by the Ministry for International Trade and Industry.
Urenco is to supply two boiling water reactors which Tepco is building in
Niigata Prefecture.
Mr JA Paleit, Urenco managing director, said the enrichment work would be
carried out by all three of the consortium's partners: British Nuclear
Fuels, Uranit of Germany and Ultra-Centrifuge of the Netherlands. It is
likely to add at least 10 per cent to Urenco's turnover in the late 1990s.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE planned North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) faced a new hurdle
yesterday as the majority leader in the US House of Representatives demanded
that negotiators write in strong protection for the environment and US jobs.
The call by Mr Richard Gephardt came after ministers from Canada, Mexico and
the US made progress on a number of fronts in weekend negotiations in Mexico
City. They appeared close to completing a final draft text.
Mr Gephardt's demands threatened to scupper one of the few vote-winning
initiatives left to President George Bush who, in opinion polls, is trailing
Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic rival in November's presidential election.
Mr Gephardt said Nafta negotiators 'can and must do better'. The pact could
become an 'engine of growth' but only if 'properly drafted'.
He said it should include:
A joint US-Mexico border commission to promote health and environment, offer
bonds, inspect facilities and enforce laws;
A cross-border transaction tax to raise funds for worker training,
infrastructure development and environmental protection;
Provisions to make failure to abide by environmental laws an unfair trade
practice and to allow US shareholders to sue companies doing business in
Mexico if they fail to abide by Mexican laws;
Creation of an industry Code of Conduct for the maquiladora industries on
the Mexican border.
Congress last year voted to give the Bush administration so-called
'fast-track' negotiating authority for Nafta. This means the pact cannot be
amended as it makes its way through the House and Senate. But Mr Gephardt
said the changes he wanted could be written into the implementation
legislation.
Defending Nafta, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said the pact
would 'meet or beat' every commitment Mr Bush made on environment and labour
goals.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Peru comes to terms with creeping civil war: Moves toward
martial law have met popular approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 12 years of violence which has cost 26,000 lives and Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 10.4bn) in damage, Peruvians seem ready for the first time to admit
they are witnessing a civil war.
President Alberto Fujimori's announcement last week that those accused of
terrorism are to be tried under martial law - with the prospect of the death
penalty for treason - has met popular approval.
In the run-up to today's Independence Day celebrations, Peru's
fundamentalist Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso spread panic among
the capital's still-affluent middle classes. Twelve days and nights of
bombing left 35 people dead, hundreds injured and buildings wrecked.
For the first time Sendero hit civilians, including schoolchildren,
indiscriminately.
The onslaught forced Mr Fujimori to cancel his trip to last week's
Ibero-American summit in Madrid. In a long-delayed and terse televised
message on Friday he vowed that 'those who are bleeding Peru to death,
killing our children, destroying what they did not create, will be
eliminated. Them and their poison.'
Sendero is thought to have brought up to 1,000 guerrillas into Lima for the
current campaign, which analysts predict will continue for a further two
weeks. Fifteen car bombs exploded while a similar number were disarmed. A
two-day 'armed strike', enforced with menaces and killings, paralysed the
capital's public transport system and led to substantial lost production.
The government's counter-subversive strategy has again prompted heavy
criticism. Despite some successes against subversion in recent weeks -
notably the capture of leaders of the Tupac Amaru revolutionary movement
(MRTA), Peru's second guerrilla group, and the dismantling of its extortion
racket - Sendero's strength has been little affected.
The recent meticulously-planned actions in Lima suggest the much-publicised
capture last month of Sendero's 'logistics chief' was less significant than
the government had claimed.
Mr Carlos Tapia, a sociologist and expert on Sendero, says: 'It is not true
that Sendero is entering Lima because it has been routed in the highlands.
The government thinks that by announcing imminent defeat and twisting the
truth, they really will make that defeat happen - but it's not so.'
Mr Fujimori has often said his counter-subversive strategy depends on
improved intelligence gathering. Yet analysts say there has never been such
a dearth of warnings on big attacks.
Once again they blame disarray in the intelligence services on Mr Vladimiro
Montesinos, the powerful presidential adviser. The former army captain has
given top military posts to friends, eliminating the normal armed forces'
promotion structure and causing deep resentment.
Also alarming is the threat of Sendero's influence spreading to the rest of
the continent. Recent Sendero-linked attacks have been reported in Chile,
Bolivia, Ecuador and Mexico.
Mr Enrique Bernales, the now-deposed senator responsible for the most
reliable statistics on violence and subversion in Peru, says: 'Of all
possible scenarios, this prospect of Peru being ringed by a
political/military cordon sanitaire is the worst.'
Sendero poses far more than the threat of brute violence. Now entering what
it calls its 'fourth campaign', the organisation is passing from 'strategic
equilibrium' to 'strategic offensive'. Unusually sophisticated leaflets
widely distributed before last week's armed strike offer a 22-point
political programme with broad popular appeal - amid familiar Marxist
rhetoric were calls for cuts in taxes, public service tariffs and fares,
higher wages and pensions, homes for the homeless, improved health and
education services and no privatisation.
'The Fujimori coup has done Sendero a favour,' says Mr Hernando de Soto,
former presidential adviser and think-tank chief. 'By destroying the
credibility and legitimacy of government, he's left a political vacuum which
Sendero is ready to fill. This requires a political, not a purely military,
response.'
Despite a second devastating bomb attack on his Lima institute, Mr de Soto
is continuing to visit a series of Lima universities - known to harbour
cells of Sendero sympathisers - to press his proposals for a return to
democracy in November.
But in the present climate of violence and uncertainty, electing a
constituent Congress to pave the way for a return to democracy is the last
thing on most Peruvians' minds.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Nasa battling to save space station plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) faces a critical
battle this week to save plans for a manned space station, when the House of
Representatives decides whether to continue financing the ambitious project.
Nasa wants to start launching components of the space station into orbit in
1995, and for it to have a permanent four-person crew from the end of 1999.
Opponents, however, want to end space station funding before so much has
been spent on its development that it cannot be halted.
As national concern spreads over the yawning federal budget deficit, the
space station is one in a number of prestigious but costly programmes to
become a target for congressman seeking to rein in government spending.
Like the superconducting supercollider - an Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.1bn)
scientific research project killed by the House in June but revived this
month by the Senate - and the Strategic Defence Initiative, known as Star
Wars, the space station's critics question both its cost and scientific
justification.
Nasa has already spent Dollars 7.8bn on the station's development, and is
estimated to need another Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn over the next six years.
Broader estimates of the cost of building, launching and operating the
station run as high as Dollars 180bn.
The agency wants to use the station to study effects of prolonged space
flight on humans and to conduct biomedical research in weightless
conditions.
Critics counter that Nasa could learn more about the effects of long space
flights by co-operating with Russia, which has accumulated considerable
experience with its space station. They argue that Nasa has grossly inflated
its claims for the space station's research value, and that its huge cost
will suck funding away from other more valuable research projects.
Two distinguished biochemists writing in the Washington Post newspaper
yesterday argued: 'We are many times more likely to achieve significant
knowledge here on the planet than in space, and to do so a lot more
cheaply.'
Congressman Bob Traxler, whose appropriations subcommittee controls Nasa's
purse strings, tried last year to kill the space station programme but was
overruled by the full House.
This year his committee has left the space station untouched. But Mr Traxler
plans, when the measure is debated by the full House this week, to propose
an amendment to strike out the Dollars 1.73bn pencilled in for the project
in 1993.
While Congress is showing a greater appetite for spending cuts this year,
the vote is still expected to go in favour of the space station, which is
fiercely backed by members whose states benefit from the 75,000
private-sector jobs the project will create.
According to Space News, a weekly journal on the industry, 24 states have
space station contracts worth at least Dollars 1m, with spending mostly
concentrated in California, Texas and Alabama.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Iraq banks face NY lawsuit over loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bank of New York filed a lawsuit in federal court yesterday charging
that Iraq's state-owned Rafidain Bank and the Central Bank of Iraq had
defaulted on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 523m) of loans.
The lawsuit, in a Manhattan court, seeks to force Rafidain or the Iraqi
central bank, which guaranteed the borrowing, to repay Bank of New York for
its share of the loans.
The New York bank says it is owed more than Dollars 22.6m plus interest on
two loans of Dollars 500m extended to Iraq during the height of the
Iran-Iraq war in the mid-1980s.
Bank of New York put up Dollars 35.2m of the first Dollars 500m loan
extended by 36 banks in 1983, and Dollars 10m toward another loan extended
by 25 banks in 1985. Payments were made on schedule by Iraq until the August
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Baghdad suspended its debt repayments when the United Nations imposed
economic sanctions.
Iraq has also defaulted on Dollars 2bn of US government loan guarantees,
including more than Dollars 300m related to loans made by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
Yesterday, in the latest of his disclosures relating to BNL's Iraqi loans,
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, released
documents showing that weeks before the invasion of Kuwait the Bush
administration allowed the US affiliate of the Iraqi-owned Matrix-Churchill
machine tools company to ship militarily useful technologies to Iraq that
helped President Saddam Hussein's missile projects.
The US export occurred, said Mr Gonzalez, despite US government knowledge
that Matrix-Churchill was part of Iraq's secret procurement network and was
funded by BNL.

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: SII talks open with new vigour - The US is
pressing Japan to redefine goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US today restarts the hunt for the 'structural impediments' said to be
behind Japan's persistently large trade surplus, which is set to reach a
record Dollars 100bn this year.
Two years ago, the two countries signed the Structural Impediments
Initiative (SII) pact that left behind day-to-day disputes and attempted to
alter the structure of the Japanese economy. US negotiators extracted
promises for infrastructure spending, reforms to the distribution system,
and a study of the keiretsu - the large corporate groups.
The original agreement, which took a year to negotiate, was extraordinarily
detailed, with Tokyo agreeing to increase the size of the average Japanese
house from 89 square metres to 95 sq m by 1995 and to add 25,000km of
footpaths over the next decade as part of the infrastructure package.
SII was repeatedly described as a 'two-way street' and, for its part, the US
was supposed to overhaul the education system, encourage executives to take
a 'longer-term' attitude, reduce the budget deficit, and speed the
introduction of the metric system.
At the time, the two agreed that the SII promises would need 'several years'
to take effect, but the surge in Japan's trade surplus this year and an
imminent US presidential election will encourage US negotiators to be more
impatient during this week's discussions.
Japanese officials say they have reason to be angry because the 'US hasn't
kept any of its promises and we have done a lot of work,' as one negotiator
put it.
The Japanese will produce the original report and emphasise that little has
been done on the deficit, the US corporate culture and even the metric
system.
A more assertive Japan will complain about 'Buy American' campaigns, which,
it argues, creates obstacles for overseas companies attempting to penetrate
the US market.
The Japanese government is concerned that the flagging popularity of
President Bush will prompt a tougher US response. The US Trade
Representative's office saw SII as a means of avoiding managed trade, but
the size of the US bilateral deficit and of Japan's overall surplus have
made easy-to-define concessions a political priority for the US
Administration.
In spite of SII, Japan accounted for 62 per cent of the US trade deficit in
May and 74 per cent in April, while Japan's overall trade surplus rose 49
per cent to Dollars 77.8bn last year and was a record Dollars 49bn in the
first half of this year.
The US will ask Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand and will again call for
studies of the country's corporate culture. The US wants further vigilance
in the monitoring of anti-monopoly laws and investigations into the business
habits of large trading houses.
One of the more obvious changes in Japan since SII has been the increasing
prominence of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the anti-monopoly body.
On Friday, the commission imposed surcharges totalling Y1.4bn (Pounds 5.85m)
on 28 companies in four industries for price fixing and cartel violations.
Two weeks ago, 166 construction and related companies were ordered to
disband a cartel in central Japan for allegedly rigging bids for public
works projects.
The FTC's success has prompted US officials to believe that cartels remain
commonplace and that the country's corporate structure is, by its nature,
restrictive.
Regardless of the merits of Japan's structure, there are differences in the
relationship between manufacturers and their component suppliers. The
Mitsubishi Research Institute has just found that 96 per cent of large
Japanese manufacturers hold shares in subcontractors, while the figure in
the US is only 15.6 per cent.
However, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) emphasises
that there is nothing unique about the keiretsu. Miti officials will tell US
negotiators that Deutsche Bank has stakes in a range of leading German
companies, and that Morgan Guaranty Trust has small holdings in companies
such as IBM and Mobil that resemble the strategic stakes common in Japan.
The US is unlikely to be convinced and will press that private procurement
practices be made more transparent. A separate Miti survey of 247
manufacturing companies found that only 25 per cent have their sourcing
requirements in written form and 31.3 per cent have anti-trust guidelines.
Japan's convoluted distribution system was one important target two years
ago, and the government agreed to speed the approval of larger retail
outlets, which the US hoped would increase shelf space for foreign products.
But the slowing of demand in Japan has also prompted developers to
reconsider plans to open new outlets.
The US is set to raise the issue again, most likely as part of its assault
on corporate groupings. They are likely to find Miti more defensive of the
'distribution keiretsu', which 'offer a balanced mix of competition and
co-operation'.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Spratly spat moves into murkier water: China's tactics set
Asean alarm bells ringing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE conflicting territorial claims to the Spratly islands have been vividly
illustrated in photographs and television pictures released by the various
claimants. The most recent, from Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, takes on
an almost comical air.
It shows three men on a tiny rock in the middle of the South China Sea with
a Chinese flag, a concrete territorial marker and a hut - twice as big as
the rock itself - standing on stilts in the shallows.
Nothing could illustrate more clearly the nature of argument over the 100 or
more atolls, reefs and islets that make up the Spratly islands: few people
would want or be able to live there unsupported, but governments want to own
them to lay claim to the surrounding waters.
The islands - called the Nansha by China and the Kalayaan by the Philippines
 -are scattered along the shipping route between the Indian Ocean and
north-east Asia, and are believed to have oil and gas deposits under the
seabed.
The main protagonists in the dispute are China and Vietnam, but Taiwan,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei also lay claim to all or some of the
Spratlys. With the exception of the small sultanate of Brunei, all have
troops stationed in the archipelago.
At a south-east Asian summit six months ago, nobody gave much thought to a
dispute which has simmered since the second world war and only occasionally
erupted into violence.
In February, however, China passed a law reaffirming its sovereignty over
almost the entire South China Sea and reserving the right to use military
force to defend its claims. Vietnam protested. So did Japan, because the
Chinese law also embraced a group of islands claimed by Tokyo in the East
China Sea.
In May, as if to underline the message that the South China Sea was not
called the South China Sea for nothing, the Chinese authorities signed an
agreement with Crestone Energy Corp of Denver to explore for oil between
Vietnam and Malaysia.
The concession area is regarded by Vietnam as part of its continental shelf
and lies about 1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan. Vietnam, which
says it lost 72 men and three vessels in a battle with China over the
Spratlys in 1988, protested again.
Japan and the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations
(Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand - have watched China's forays into the Spratlys with growing alarm.
At a meeting of foreign ministers in Manila last week, Malaysia said it was
watching events with 'grave concern'; the Philippines said a solution should
be urgently sought to avoid 'perilous developments'; and Indonesia spoke of
the danger of 'mutually destructive confrontation'.
Although only the Filipinos were openly prepared to admit it, there was
considerable debate over the risk of Chinese expansionism and the
desirability of continued US and Russian military deployment in the region
to provide a 'balance of forces'.
Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister who was a guest at the meeting,
denied that China was seeking regional hegemony. China, he said, wanted to
shelve disputes and proceed with 'joint development' of the Spratlys.
However, Asean ministers were apparently unable to elicit an explanation as
to how China reconciled its 1991 rapprochement with Vietnam and its talk of
'joint development' with the planting of new territorial markers on the
atolls and the unilateral decision to award an exploration contract to
Crestone.
The region's optimists say it was inevitable that irritating disputes like
the Spratlys would surface once the cold war ended. They believe that China,
preoccupied with domestic politics and the strains of economic growth, is
testing the mettle of its neighbours with its recent activities in the South
China Sea.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told the Asean meeting how
much the region had progressed since he first came to Manila as a young
diplomat in the 1950s.
The pessimists, despite claims by the US and Russia that each intends to
remain a Pacific power, view the end of the cold war and the closure of US
bases in the Philippines with foreboding. They see China as a potential
regional bully whose influence is already visible in Beijing's support for
the Burmese junta and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia.
'The Chinese will have the option to use 'gunboat diplomacy' as a means to
achieving their political objectives,' wrote Tai Ming Cheung in a paper on
the growth of Chinese naval power for the Institute of South East Asian
Studies. 'As the navy grows stronger, the chances of conflict over the
Spratlys becomes an increasingly real possibility, unless a satisfactory
diplomatic solution can be found in the next few years.' The paper was
published in 1990.

<TEXT>
ALGERIA has switched to a war economy, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, the new prime
minister, said yesterday as he outlined a programme which showed the
country's socialist pedigree and a disdain for free-market reforms, Reuter
reports from Algiers.
Mr Abdessalam, who led the nationalisation of the oil industry in the 1970s
and has opposed tentative reforms begun in 1988, gave this sombre message in
his first news conference since taking office a week ago.
Imports have to be cut to bare essentials, closing factories if necessary,
in order to be able to service Algeria's Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13bn) of
foreign debt.
The prime minister, who is also economy minister, said it would cost Dollars
10bn this year to service the debt, out of foreign currency earnings of
Dollars 12bn. But he ruled out rescheduling the debt on the grounds this
would simply postpone the problem. He also opposed further currency
devaluation or trade liberalisation, both recommended by the IMF and World
Bank.
Tension between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists
continued to smoulder yesterday as a home-made bomb exploded near a police
station in the Algiers neighbourhood of Belcourt, AP reports.
Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, it bore the hallmarks
of a wave of attacks by fundamentalists on police and troops in retaliation
for a harsh crackdown on their movement.  No one was injured.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S hard-pressed Labor government yesterday unveiled plans to spend
ADollars 767m (Pounds 300m) over three years to provide training and
subsidised jobs for young workers hit by recession and weak economic
recovery.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the scheme would cost ADollars
297m this year, ADollars 335m in 1993-94 and ADollars 135m in 1994-95. It
follows a ADollars 720m expansion of technical and further education
announced earlier this year.
The announcement reflects the government's sensitivity to youth unemployment
in the run-up to the next federal election, which must be held by June next
year. The conservative opposition has opened a significant opinion poll lead
over the government since total unemployment reached a record 11.1 per cent
in June. Nearly 36 per cent of workers under 19 are unemployed.
Mr Keating said the employment package would provide a six-month training
course and a subsidised job for young workers unemployed for more than 12
months.
The scheme will also improve existing training and job search allowances,
and finance benefits for young people who join environmental improvement
projects.
The spending programme will not be offset by savings from other elements of
the federal budget, which is expected to be more than ADollars 12bn in
deficit this year, following a deficit of ADollars 9.4bn in 1991-92.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S state pipeline company has sent a delegation to Baghdad for the
first time since the Gulf crisis started almost two years ago, in a further
indication that Ankara is seeking to improve relations with Iraq.
Officials confirmed that Botas, the pipeline company, sent representatives
to the Iraqi capital earlier this month to consider the technical problems
involved in re-opening the 1,000km twin pipeline, which was built to take
Iraqi crude to the Mediterranean.
Officials say Turkey has dropped its demands for financial compensation from
Baghdad for the loss of revenue which resulted from the imposition of United
Nations trade sanctions against Iraq in August 1990. Turkey is instead
considering claiming from the Geneva-based UN War Reparation Fund.
With Ankara soon to re-open its embassy in Baghdad and Prime Minister
Suleyman Demirel urging reconciliation during last week's showdown over
Iraqi compliance with Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, Turkey is making a
renewed effort to improve relations.
Its decision to send Botas to Baghdad follows reports that Iraq is
considering building an alternative pipeline through Jordan. The move is a
measure of Turkey's concern that the Gulf crisis should not prejudice its
long-term commercial ties with Iraq - before the war its second largest
trading partner.
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, Turkey has lost almost Dollars 600m in tolls on
the twin pipeline from Mosul in north Iraq to Iskenderum on the
Mediterranean. Turkey claimed a contractual right to compensation, under the
original agreement.
Its hardline position was in part responsible for Iraq refusing to adopt the
terms of UN resolution 706, under which Iraq would ship Dollars 1.6bn worth
of oil exports to finance medical and food imports under UN supervision.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Japanese rate cut fails to impress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government signalled its disappointment last night that a cut
in official interests had not helped the ailing stock market.
The Nikkei average surged soon after the rate cut yesterday morning but
later closed 124.45 lower at 15,373.34, a six-year low. In initial trading
early today, the Nikkei was down a further 150 points.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, was quick to welcome the cut, made
just before the markets opened, as 'a timely and appropriate step'.
Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the government had hoped
that the Bank of Japan's reduction in the official discount rate (ODR) from
3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent would encourage the market.
However, he said a recovery in share prices may only come in the
'longer-term'.
After announcing the cut, Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said the
reduction was necessary to stimulate capital investment and consumer
spending which have weakened in recent months.
He emphasised that the cut was not intended to support the stock market but
was timed to precede a supplementary budget.
While Mr Mieno said the bank would be unable to reduce the ODR much below
the present 3.25 per cent, the lowest level since October 1987, Mr Takeshi
Nagano, president of the Japan Employers' Federation, said the rate must be
cut again. He said the central bank and government had been too slow to
respond to the economic downturn, and that another rate cut should come
quickly. Mr Keizo Saji, chairman of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce, urged the
government to consider a cut in income taxes to stimulate the economy.
The Japanese government plans to hold a special session of parliament early
next month to finalise the supplementary budget, which it hopes will
rekindle the economy. The supplementary budget is likely to be between
Y5,000bn and Y8,000bn.
Another sign of the weakening of consumer demand came yesterday when the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) released statistics for
large retail stores showing that national sales in June were 4.3 per cent
down on the same month last year.
The ministry said demand for furniture and clothing was unexpectedly weak.
The central bank had hoped personal consumption would be the 'engine' for
recovery.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York-based Middle East Watch yesterday released a scathing report of
Egyptian human rights violations, including widespread torture, long
detention without trial and arbitrary arrest.
The report, 'Behind Closed Doors: Torture and Detention in Egypt', alleges a
'sub-culture of violence' among Egyptians officers employed by the Interior
Ministry to deal with political threats to Egypt's stability.
Singling out an organisation known as the State Security Investigation (SSI)
within the Interior Ministry for criticism, Middle East Watch claimed that
the 'detailed testimony of torture victims (indicates) that the methods of
torture in Egypt are rigorous, yet predictable, indicating that a system
appears to be in place to train SSI personnel in torture techniques. . . '
'Among the Egyptians who have suffered torturers' blindfolds, beatings,
hangings, electric shocks and other abuses are lawyers who defend
politically unpopular clients, journalists affiliated with Islamist
publications. . . and individual citizens targeted because they are thought
to possess valued information.'
Middle East Watch, which is affiliated to the respected Human Rights Watch
organisation, charged that physical and psychological mistreatment is
'facilitated and protected by a state-sanctioned system of incommunicado
detention'.
Among typical torture methods claimed by the human rights group were beating
and kicking of a blindfolded victim; suspension by the wrists for long
periods; beatings on the soles of feet; degrading treatment, including
threats against relatives; and the use of electric shocks administered to
various parts of the body.
Middle East Watch also strongly criticised the Egyptian authorities for
failing to investigate complaints about torture, or to take concrete steps
to end the practice.
The organisation also condemned the failure of Egypt's western aid donors,
including Washington, to press the issue of human rights abuses.
'The US Congress has been equally derelict' the report added.

MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, is expected to place
comprehensive plans for the colony's future political development before the
British cabinet in the autumn, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said
yesterday.
At the end of a two-day visit to the colony, Mr Hurd promised speedy
government deliberation of Mr Patten's blueprint.
He said Britain would consult China 'as necessary'.
He stressed that Britain wanted to ensure the 'continuity' of Hong Kong's
political system beyond 1997, when sovereignty reverts to China.
The foreign secretary also announced yesterday that negotiations between
Britain and China over Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport would resume
on Thursday. He said it was in the shared interests of Hong Kong and China
that they settle outstanding issues.
Mr Hurd said Mr Patten's review of the political structure in Hong Kong
would include the issue of more democratically elected seats for the local
legislature.
It would also include arrangements for the colony's 1995 elections - the
last to be held under British rule.
Mr Hurd promised consultation with China on both issues.
The review is expected to incorporate Mr Patten's views and recommendations
on the role and composition of the Executive Council, or cabinet, and its
relationship to the local legislature.
It may also include a recommendation that he institute a local version of
'prime minister's question time'.
It was unclear yesterday whether Mr Patten would make his recommendations to
the British cabinet in person. Mr Patten is due to open the autumn session
of the local legislature on October 7. Officials are uncertain whether the
government will have completed all work on the review of the political
structure by that time.
China's market-oriented reforms are likely to fuel the country's export
drive, widening its trade imbalance with the US and other trade partners,
the Central Intelligence Agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.

<TEXT>
THE US took steps to bolster its military preparedness in the Middle East
region yesterday in a blunt warning to Iraq after settlement at the weekend
of the latest tense confrontation between Baghdad and the United Nations.
It has despatched a third aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean, has begun
sending Patriot missiles to Kuwait and will hold joint military exercises
with the Kuwaitis.
The moves follow President George Bush's warning to Iraq that it must comply
fully with all the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions passed by the
UN Security Council.
Queried about the reasons behind the military moves, a Pentagon official
said simply: 'Be prepared.'
The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy broke off a visit to the Virgin Islands
to steam to the Mediterranean, joining the Saratoga and Independence within
striking distance of Iraq. The three ships carry a total of 200 warplanes.
The Pentagon said the US had also begun sending eight batteries of Patriot
anti-missile missiles to Kuwait from bases in Germany. They would be manned
by US troops to protect Kuwait from any attack by Iraqi Scud ballistic
missiles.
A defence official said US marines, navy and air force personnel would hold
two joint military exercises with Kuwaiti forces in the emirate south of
Iraq early next week to emphasise US resolve.
One exercise would involve the practice landing of up to 2,000 US marines in
Kuwait, while the other would involve practice in unloading US military
equipment from ships.
The US moves, keeping alive the threat of military action, came as Iraq
proclaimed it had won a 'brilliant victory' with the agreement for a team of
'neutral' UN weapons experts to inspect an agriculture ministry building in
Baghdad.
Under the weapons inspection agreement, a team of seven UN inspectors, led
by Mr Achim Biermann, will arrive in Baghdad today to complete inspection of
the building, from which a previous UN team had been barred since July 5.
But Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the commission investigating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, said on his way to Baghdad he was pessimistic the team
would now find anything in the building.
British officials said they expected the team to find only 'some traces' of
the missile-related documents and materials which UN inspectors suspected
were hidden there.
The original team of UN chemical weapons inspectors called off a vigil
outside the building last week in the face of hostile demonstrations.
British and US officials stressed yesterday that although the crisis over
the agriculture ministry building had eased, there was concern over other
aspects of Iraq's defiance of the UN and the west. 'The atmosphere will
remain fairly hot for a while yet,' said a British official.
Diplomats were not convinced the stand-off over UN access to the agriculture
ministry would be the last time Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would attempt
a provocative policy of 'cheat and retreat'.
With few other readily available options, diplomats say the Gulf war allies
will keep up pressure not only over the UN weapons inspectors' access to
Iraqi installations but also over the safety of UN guards in northern Iraq,
Baghdad's attacks on Shia Moslems in the south and other breaches of the
Gulf war ceasefire terms.

A BERLIN court yesterday approved an DM800m (Pounds 276m) business centre
project on the site of Checkpoint Charlie, the former crossing into East
Germany.
It dismissed a case by an east Berlin woman who claimed to own the site,
ruling that property at the Berlin Wall could not be returned under the
terms of the 1990 German unification treaty. Checkpoint Charlie was
dismantled in June 1990 after the city was united.
Central European Development Corporation, majority-owned by US cosmetics
company Estee Lauder and headed by Mr Mark Palmer, former US ambassador to
Hungary, was given the green light by the city government last year to erect
the American Business Centre on the site. ,
Nearly 3,000 dentists in Germany's populous North Rhine region downed drills

spending on the state-subsidised health care system, writes Quentin Peel in
Bonn. Members of the Free Association of German Dentists are being urged to

GUNMEN riding a pair of motorcycles killed an anti-Mafia police investigator
last night as he drove home from work, Agencies report from Catania. The
attack appeared to defy a big government crackdown on the Mafia.
Inspector Giovanni Lizzio, 46, was shot in the head and chest as he drove
alone in Catania, Sicily's second largest city. He was dead by the time he
reached hospital.
The inspector was killed eight days after top anti-Mafia judge Paolo
Borsellino and his five escorts were killed by a car bomb in the Sicilian
capital, Palermo. Italian state television said Insp Lizzio led Catania's
investigation into widespread Mafia extortion of eastern Sicilian merchants
and businessmen.
The government has sent thousands of troops to the island in an attempt to
curb Mafia activity there.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Money launderers cash in on upheaval in east: New patterns
and old problems for those on the track of drug profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTONIA'S central bank governor made a somewhat unusual statement when the
republic set up its own currency last month. He used the opportunity to
express his determination to combat drug money laundering.
This was not just a dutiful bow to the western powers who have been cracking
down hard on money laundering in recent years. The fact was, Mr Siim Kallas
said, that 'enormous amounts of cash have been deposited in our banks in the
last few days'.
Mr Kallas ruled that savings account balances exceeding Rbs50,000 and
corporate accounts worth more than Rbs1bn would be frozen until their origin
had been checked.
Among other things, this reveals that when it comes to taking advantage of a
new opportunity, the world's drug money launderers are hard to beat. And the
struggling countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are
usually easy targets for their operations.
Those were also the messages from Lugano - itself a centre notorious for
dubious financial transactions - during this month's annual meeting of
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering, set up by the 1989
economic summit of the seven largest industrialised countries.
'Virtually no financial institutions are immune as money launderers become
increasingly sophisticated in their techniques,' the FATF stated in its
report.
Mr Alexis Lautenberg, a senior official in the Swiss foreign ministry who
presides over FATF, revealed that the main focus of the organisation's
efforts in the new few months would be on eastern Europe and the Far East.
It is difficult to guess just how significant drug money laundering activity
in eastern Europe has become. FATF, being an outgrowth of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is coy about naming names
and amounts.
In its report, it says only that 'at present, the central and eastern
European region is not one of the most significant centres of money
laundering'.
The most significant centres of a trade, valued two years ago at Dollars
85bn, are still the US and western European countries. But there is little
doubt that the combination of tougher surveillance in the west and
institutional upheaval in eastern Europe has sent a considerable amount of
activity eastward.
Not for nothing did Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, make
money laundering the theme of a speech he made in Budapest at the end of
May. 'If money laundering is effectively driven out of the European
Community and Efta (European Free Trade Association) countries, they don't
want it coming here,' he said after meeting Hungarian leaders.
In March, Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, also touched on the subject. 'I think it is
obviously in the interests of the world that central and eastern Europe and
what I call far eastern Europe do not become a huge loophole in the cause of
fighting money laundering,' Mr Attali said.
Actual proven cases, however, are few in number. In April, the deputy head
of Finland's criminal police claimed to have information on the transfer of
several million marks to international markets through Finnish banks.
The money was said to originate from sales of stolen property in Russia, but
the managing director of the Finnish Bank Association denied the allegation.
Late last year, there were suggestions that money launderers would take
advantage of the privatisation process in Czechoslovakia, which involved the
issue of small value vouchers to citizens.
The FATF report points out the eastern European countries will inevitably
become more attractive to money launderers, especially as their currencies
move to convertibility.
However, the countries closest to convertibility, such as Czechoslovakia and
Hungary, also tend to be the ones that are drawing up new banking laws. The
FATF believes this is a good time to impress the importance of stamping out
laundering from the start.
FATF held a seminar for senior financial officials of the Czechoslovak,
Polish and Hungarian governments in Paris in February and had what Mr
Lautenberg described as 'very constructive discussions'.
The less developed eastern European countries and most former Soviet
republics present greater challenges. Mr Lautenberg said that FATF intended
to take stock over the next few months and then get in touch with the
authorities in these countries. But a FATF official admitted that it was
very difficult to make progress in countries where the people in charge were
changed frequently and the need for hard currency was desperate.
Meanwhile, the task force still has plenty to do in its own backyard. Many
of its members, which are the 24 OECD countries plus the Gulf Co-operation
Council, Hong Kong and Singapore, have yet to implement FATF's
recommendations for curbing money laundering.
According to the report, only 10 of them have ratified the 1988 Vienna
convention which would oblige them to make drug money laundering a criminal
offence. And many still do not oblige banks to verify the identity of those
making big transactions.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Bosnia's warring factions begin new search for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Bosnia's three warring factions began another attempt in London
yesterday to bring peace to their stricken country, in spite of the
breakdown of the latest ceasefire agreed only 11 days ago.
The meeting has been overshadowed by last weekend's British proposal to
organise a wider international peace conference on the former Yugoslavia in
London at the end of next month. Apart from the three combatants, this will
bring together the European Community, the United Nations, the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe and other 'interested parties' such as
the US.
Though the Bosnian Moslems have again refused to meet their enemies face to
face, Mr Jose Cutileiro, the Community's chief negotiator in the
EC-sponsored talks, will hold separate meetings with Mr Radovan Karadzic,
leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr Mate Boban, leader of Bosnia's Croats, and
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem representative.
Lord Carrington, the chief EC mediator, considers it pointless to negotiate
another ceasefire, which is likely to collapse as quickly as the previous
ones. He will try, therefore, to focus the talks on a constitutional and
political settlement rather than on military problems.
However, a British official made it clear that this did not mean that no
attention would be paid to halting the fighting. 'They have a ceasefire and
they will be told in no uncertain terms to implement it,' he said, while
admitting at the same time that there was no point in getting the parties to
agree on a new ceasefire.
Mr Karadzic yesterday proposed that the rival communities could be separated
by a 'green line' patrolled by UN peacekeeping troops, while their leaders
worked out a political settlement. Such a 'green line' has been in effect in
Cyprus ever since the Turkish invasion of the northern part of the island in
1974.
The London meeting is being held against the background of a quickly
deteriorating refugee crisis in the former Yugoslavia which will be the
subject of an international conference in Geneva tomorrow.
Germany, which has taken in more than 200,000 of an estimated total of 2.2m
Yugoslav refugees, has called on Germany's European partners to share the
refugee burden more equitably, but France and Britain are refusing to accept
a quota system.
However, western officials are understood to be studying the creation of a
Kurdish-style safe haven for refugees inside the former Yugoslavia to halt
the increasing flood of people fleeing their homeland.
US Navy jets flew sorties over the Adriatic yesterday but were under strict
orders not to stray near Yugoslav airspace, Reuter reports from aboard the
USS Saratoga.
The US stepped up its presence in the narrow sea on Friday, moving in a
battle group led by the aircraft carrier Saratoga. As waves of F-14 Tomcats
and A-6 intruders took off from the Saratoga, pilots were repeatedly told to
stay out of Yugoslav airspace and not to stray near two Yugoslav islands in
the middle of the Adriatic.
'Whatever the message Washington may be wanting to send to Yugoslavia, the
military orders are to keep things cool in the Adriatic,' said battle group
commander, Rear Admiral Philip Dur.
The US battle group, which includes the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima, is
by far the biggest military presence in the area. Its nearly 9,000 men dwarf
a four-ship Nato patrol off the coast of Montenegro and a three-ship
detachment of the Western European Union at the mouth of the Adriatic.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Names call for resignation of Lloyd's council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RULING COUNCIL of Lloyd's faced resignation calls yesterday at an angry
extraordinary general meeting attended by more than 2,500 Names, the
individuals whose assets provide the market's capital.
The atmosphere was markedly more tense than at the annual meeting last
month, when Lloyd's reported its record losses of Pounds 2.06bn for the 1989
year.
The meeting set the agenda for a postal ballot in which all 32,000 Names
will vote on demands for further reforms to the insurance market. These
include a proposal to scrap a levy on all Names imposed last month.
During the meeting Mr David Coleridge, the chairman, confirmed that he would
resign at the end of this year and nominated Mr David Rowland, to take the
insurance market's top job.
Mr Rowland, chairman of Sedgwick, must seek election to the council before
he can become chairman. As the author of a reform programme, which Lloyd's
agreed to implement earlier this year, he has a lot of support within the
market.
The EGM followed an initiative by Mr Claud Gurney, who said Names had 'an
opportunity to say goodbye to the old order' which was characterised by
'incompetence and ineptitude'.
One Name backing the motions said the council was guilty of 'gross
dereliction of duty' and 'if members had an ounce of honour or a scintilla
of integrity the council would submit their resignations'.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents 9,000 Names, urged Names to vote for a motion backing the council
and supporting the task force reform programme. The reforms - including a
modification of the principle of unlimited liability and the introduction of
corporate capital - would 'produce a new Lloyd's that is stronger and much
more efficiently managed and controlled', he said.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Desperate famine stalks the forgotten Somalis: Julian
Ozanne, recently in Baidoa, finds aid is not reaching those in need
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Said Musa gestured towards a group of gravediggers. 'There are no
ceremonies for the dead in Baidoa,' he said. 'We have to dig wherever we can
and bury as fast as possible. The world has turned its back on us in
Somalia. People are dropping like flies.'
Grief and hunger are the only commodities in large supply at Baidoa, a town
250km west of the war-shattered Somali capital Mogadishu. Up to 50,000
people have staggered into the town from the surrounding villages in a
desperate search for food.
This struggle is being repeated across Somalia, where aid workers say
thousands are dying daily and 4.5m people are in critical need of emergency
food aid.
All relief efforts thus far have become lost in the nightmare of Somali
politics. Aid officials must negotiate the passage of grain through fiefdoms
controlled by Somali warlords. Bandits on the roads, even in Mogadishu
itself, make a mockery of the most carefully negotiated arrangements.
The officials say Mogadishu is the key to any future relief effort. A
successful distribution programme there would enable aid agencies to build
up food stocks and to establish a base from which to move out to the
countryside, reversing the mass migration of refugees.
Across the pillaged town of Baidoa small pieces of wood stuck in mounds of
freshly turned earth marked the graves of children caught up in Somalia's
latest tragedy.
Countless children are dying of starvation in the ruins of a crumbling city
gutted by feuding gunmen. The graves are surrounded by the rubble of
buildings razed by mortars and grenades. Most wars are senseless, this one
more than most.
Inside a makeshift feeding centre run by the Irish charity Concern hundreds
of emaciated infants, muscles wasted to the bone, cling to their mothers
waiting to be fed. Many are almost lifeless and can only manage a pitiful
moan caused by acute hunger.
For some, with matchstick arms and thinning hair, it is too late. In a
corner of the compound one mother sits by the corpse of a four-year-old
lying under a dirty cloth. Her grief is blunted by her own hunger and the
worry that her other three children may die soon.
Emergency food aid is trickling into feeding centres run by Concern, the Red
Cross and Unicef but it is not enough to stop people dying of diarrhoea and
dehydration. Many of the Somali staff working in the feeding centres have
been contributing food from their own supplies but every day more and more
people in the last stages of malnutrition are struggling into town lured by
the prospect of relief.
'Things are getting worse every day,' said Ms Anita Ennis, a nutritionist
working in Baidoa for Concern. 'There is too much talking, too many meetings
among donors and not enough response. We need massive quantities of food and
medicine urgently.'
In another feeding centre crammed with people clustered round an oil drum of
rice and beans an elderly looking woman in rags pulls out her withered
breast, points to the wailing baby in her arms and puts her hand to her
mouth, begging aid workers to give her food.
Outside, a mother shows the scarred hand of her child burnt because the boy
was too hungry to wait for his high protein porridge to cool before he dug
his hand in.
Most of the original inhabitants of Baidoa fled to Mogadishu during the
height of the war.
People whose livestock and grain stores were looted and destroyed by
marauding soldiers take shelter in the bombed out buildings.
Children are so exhausted by the long trek to town that they die in the
ruined houses before they can reach a feeding centre.
Those that make it face an uncertain future in a town struggling to exist.
The water and electricity plants were destroyed by departing troops of
former dictator Siad Barre.
Water is now transported around the city in donkey-drawn carts but it is
seriously polluted by people washing and defecating near the spring which
serves the town.
In recent days, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations' Egyptian
secretary-general, angrily accused Security Council members of ignoring the
plight of the Somalis.
Meanwhile, in Baidoa's only hospital nurses try to force open the teeth of
an infant to force-feed it a rehydration formula.
'This one isn't going to make it,' says a doctor.
The hospital, which is treating infected bullet wounds as well as children
in the final throes of malnutrition, is desperately short of IV fluids,
antibiotics, oral rehydration salts and glucose.
'Pain relief in this hospital is one Panadol three times a day,' said Ms
Ennes.
Relief workers believe that Somalia's tragedy could be stopped from
escalating further if the world turned its attention to the suffering.
But, if much greater quantities of food and medicine are not airlifted
urgently to towns like Baidoa, tens of thousands of starving people will
attempt the long and desperate walk to Mogadishu with fatal results.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK agrees to minimum VAT rate across EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday conceded the principle that the EC needs a legally binding
minimum standard rate of value added tax.
In a meeting chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, EC finance
ministers reached provisional agreement on a package of binding excise
duties and VAT rates, ending five years of fierce debate.
The deal set the seal on the most significant example yet of the Community's
growing influence over national fiscal policy.
The agreement, which will have little immediate effect on prices when it
comes into effect on January 1, also marked the first important achievement
of the British presidency of the EC and a large step towards a single Europe
free of border controls.
Ironically, Britain was, until recently, the most vehement opponent of moves
to cede tax sovereignty to Brussels. Mr Lamont's role in forging a
compromise with his European colleagues immediately drew heavy criticism
from Euro-sceptic MPs in his own party.
Sir Teddy Taylor, secretary of the Tory European Reform Group, said: 'It is
tragic that the government has made the first real concession on the right
of Brussels to determine tax levels.'
But the chancellor mounted a staunch defence of the deal. 'The agreement on
VAT safeguards the UK's existing zero rates,' he said. 'It preserves the
flexibility of future British governments and parliaments to set VAT rates,
it requires no increase in any UK tax rate or duty, and it protects the
interests of the Scotch whisky industry.'
The agreement sets a minimum standard VAT rate of 15 per cent until the end
of 1996, when it would come up for review. There is no maximum rate.
Formal agreement on the whole package of legislation on VAT and excise
duties will have to wait until a number of specific disputes among
individual member states have been sorted out. Ministers have promised to
resolve their differences by Thursday. The package also covers duty on
cigarettes and other tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, such as
heating oil.
Most countries' VAT rates have already moved into line with last year's
non-binding political agreement on indirect tax and excise duties. Germany
will have to raise its standard rate from 14 per cent, and Spain will move
from 13 per cent next month.
The agreement removes one of the largest obstacles to a barrier-free Europe.
With VAT rates broadly harmonised, member states will no longer have an
excuse to retain customs controls beyond the end of this year.
Scrapping such controls would save Europe's governments some Ecu8bn (Pounds
5.5bn) a year in manning border posts, and businessmen and road hauliers the
trouble of filling in some 60m customs and tax documents a year.
There is still confusion about whether member states have committed
themselves to having a legally-binding minimum VAT rate for ever. Mr Lamont
indicated that the directive would lapse if ministers failed to reach
unanimous agreement on a renewed legally binding minimum before 1996. The
Community would then be subject only to last year's non-binding accord.
Others disagreed. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo of Portugal, Mr Lamont's
predecessor as president of the finance ministers' council, believed the
legally binding minimum would be automatically renewed if they failed to
agree. That would deprive dissenters, possibly including Britain, of any
effective veto.
Ministers also agreed a two-tier system of excise duty on spirits, which
will leave current rates of duty in the EC unchanged, but freeze duties at
existing levels between Ecu550 and Ecu1,000 per 100 litres of alcohol.
Member states with duty above Ecu1,000 per 100 litres, such as Britain, are
unlikely to take up the option to reduce their rates.
Issues still outstanding include the difference in duty on British and
Spanish sherry, and the possibility of a French-style control levy on wine
being extended to all member states.

FT  28 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in stock index futures was dominated by the disappointing
performance from the Wellcome share sale in the equities market, writes
Christopher Price.
The September contract on the FT-SE index opened brightly, early buyers
pushing it up to 2,391 within minutes of the opening. However, in a
20-minute burst the contract collapsed as the Wellcome shares came on to the
equity market and were immediately marked down.
By 9.30am, September had slumped to 2,369, at which point some support was
found and the contract rallied. But continued gloom over the state of the UK
economy, with talk of worse to come in this week's official statistics,
served to further undermine the contract in quiet trading.
What started as a drift early in the afternoon session soon turned into a
sharper decline in the last hour of trading as a softening in sterling added
to dealer's worries. September finally closed at 2,355, 28 points adrift of
Friday's session and at a 5-point discount to its fair value of around 12.
Turnover was 7,459 lots.
In traded options, 23,874 contracts were dealt, 2,880 up on Friday. Asda was
the top option stock, with 3,035 contracts, followed by BP at 1,065.

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Most bourses start the week on
a firmer note
</HEADLINE>

MOST BOURSES started the week on a firmer note but trading remained thin,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose in quiet trading but sentiment remained nervous. The DAX
closed up 7.67 at 1,618.09 while the FAZ was down 1.58 at 638.36 at
midsession. Turnover fell to DM4.2bn from DM4.9bn.
The chemical and car sectors were active. A recommendation by Salomon
Brothers yesterday to switch out of Bayer into BASF had no affect on the
shares with Bayer up DM3.80 at DM263.20 and BASF up DM4.90 at DM218. The
broker argues for the switch on the grounds that the outlook for plastics
has improved while 'prospects for pharmaceuticals have been tainted by
government cost-cutting plans'.
Volkswagen advanced DM5.70 or 1.6 per cent to DM354.50 while Porsche was one
of the day's losers, down DM4 to DM500. Daimler, whose Dasa division
announced its acquisition of Dutch aircraft maker Fokker on Friday, put on
DM3 to DM701.
With half-year results due in the next couple of weeks, the banking sector
began to reflect market uncertainty. Commerzbank lost DM1 to DM237, Deutsche
Bank was up DM3 to DM645.50 and Dresdner gained DM1 to DM325.
AMSTERDAM fell following the announcement after Friday's close that
agreement had been reached on Dasa's takeover of Fokker. The CBS Tendency
index lost 0.7 to 114.6.
The aircraft manufacturer dropped to a year's low of Fl 26.40 before
improving slightly to close down Fl 1.10 or 3.8 per cent to Fl 27.50. Some
analysts said minority shareholders were selling out now that Dasa no longer
had to buy shares in the market to accumulate a stake.
The chemical groups Akzo and DSM weakened on forecasts of disappointing half
year results from DSM on Thursday. Akzo was down Fl 2.40 at Fl 133.40 while
DSM shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 97.70. Elsewhere Nedlloyd sank to a year's low, off
80 cents at Fl 44.10 and the weaker dollar took Fl 2.40 off Unilever to Fl
177.60.
PARIS rose on the first day of the new account as dealers bought stocks
which had been out of favour in the previous trading period. LVMH jumped
FFr153 or 4.5 per cent to FFr3,590 in low volume of 9,170 and Suez added
FFr7 to FFr261. The CAC 40 index added 20.73 to 1,755.35 in thin turnover of
FFr1.2bn.
BSN remained weak, losing FFr10 to FFr1,033 following news last week that
the food company planned to limit voting rights. The stock was also weak on
concerns that BSN might not be able to consolidate Volvic into this year's
accounts. Euro Disney remained on its downward trend, falling FFr1.40 to
FFr94.75.
MILAN was lifted off the day's lows as prices recovered slightly in the
after-market but dealers said the outlook remained bearish. The Comit index
fell 7.98 to 398.38 in turnover estimated at around L85bn after Friday's
L102.4bn.
Blue chips bore the brunt of the day's fall, with Fiat losing L146 or 3.2
per cent to L4,409 following Friday's news of the arrest of a senior
executive at one of its subsidiaries in connection with the Milan bribery
scandal.
Banks were mostly weaker but San Paolo stood L10 higher at L10,050 after
reporting that gross operating profit rose 25 per cent in the first half.
ISTANBUL leapt 3.7 per cent as hopes of lower bank deposit rates were
revived by a newspaper report that Turkey's biggest state-run bank, Ziraat,
was planning a rate cut. The 75-share index closed at 4,210.05, up 150.33.
ZURICH was quiet with the SMI index closing up 5.1 at 1,761.9. The banking
sector advanced following last week's cut in interest rates. Union Bank
bearers rose SFr3 to SFr687.
STOCKHOLM recovered in thin trading, as the Affarsvarlden General index rose
7.1 to 841.8 as turnover slipped to SKr159m from SKr219m. OSLO's all-share
index rose 2.26 to 380.30 in low turnover of NKr118.8m, in spite of
disappointing first-half results from Norsk Hydro which fell NKr2.5 to
NKr146.5. VIENNA hit another new low, the 18-share ATX index ended 5.29 down
at 765.77.

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: State's impotence fuels Milan's fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The killing in Palermo of a second, leading anti-Mafia judge in as many
months and the Italian state's clumsy handling of the liquidation of the
state holding company Efim triggered an 8 per cent fall in the debilitated
Milan stock market last week, taking its drop since the start of 1992 to
18.9 per cent.
Elsewhere, continued pessimism about 1992 corporate earnings prospects drove
Japanese equities down by 5.3 per cent, which contributed to the 2.8 per
cent decline in the FT-Actuaries World index.
Analysts believe that the Italian stock market has further to fall, with
some predicting that the Comit index could drop to 380. The index closed at
398.38 yesterday.
Mr Michael Pacitti at County NatWest says there are suggestions that the
government could abolish or amend the capital gains tax, introduced last
year, and also remove stamp duty in order to support the stock market.
Ambiguities in the law protecting minority shareholders' interests are also
expected to be clarified.
'However, the government cannot introduce too many incentives because it
needs to keep domestic savings in the bond market,' he says. He adds that a
real yield of 10 per cent on government bonds cannot be sneezed at.
Vienna was the week's second worst performer, sliding 7.1 per cent following
the release of disappointing first-half results from Wienerberger, the
building materials company. The market had already been weakened by news on
July 10 of heavy losses at oil company OMV.
Mexico retreated 6.6 per cent as the euphoria following the withdrawal of Mr
Ross Perot from the US presidential election proved to be short-lived. The
prospect of higher interest rates prompted investors to take profits.
Moreover, foreigners sold shares in the cement company Cemex, expressing
their disapproval of its decision to buy Spain's two largest cement
companies.

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Discount rate cut fails
to boost confidence in Japan
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO, ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT in the official discount rate failed to boost confidence, and the
Nikkei average fell to another six-year low as afternoon selling erased
morning gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 124.45 to 15,373.34, its lowest since March 1986.
The index registered a high for the day of 15,974.31 in the morning on the
Bank of Japan's half-point cut in the discount rate to 3.25 per cent.
However, buying by dealers petered out as investors remained reluctant to
commit new funds to the market, and the index dropped to the session's low
of 15,288.34 in the afternoon.
Volume was still thin, totalling 220m shares against Friday's 201m. Falls
outpaced rises by 625 to 299, with 189 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks shed 10.61 to 1,193.94, slipping below the year's
low recorded in April, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.94 to
934.46.
Traders said favourable domestic factors - the discount rate cut and the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's victory in Sunday's upper house elections
 -were already discounted. Last Friday's emergency cabinet meeting convened
by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to discuss support measures for
the stock market and the economy did not produce specific results.
Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities, said:
'Investors do not think the support measures for the economy will have a
direct impact on the stock market. What the market needs is something that
works immediately.'
Blue chip electricals declined, Hitachi falling Y13 to Y732. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone lost Y9,000 to Y582,000. Dealers took profits in
speculative theme stocks: Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue,
receded Y28 to Y894.
Daikyo, the condominium developer, plunged Y77 to an all-time low of Y544 on
further rumours of financial troubles.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 207.70 to 17,732.33, its lowest since
November 1986. Volume dropped to 6.5m shares from Friday's heavy 24m.
Roundup
THE Japanese discount rate reduction also failed to cheer other Pacific Rim
markets yesterday.
BANGKOK was pulled lower by the debut of Thai Airways International shares,
the largest issue ever offered on the exchange. The SET index lost 11.22, or
1.5 per cent, to 734.94 in a turnover of Bt4.83bn. Thai Airways fell Bt5.50
from the opening level to end at Bt55.50, almost losing a day's limit of 10
per cent.
BOMBAY rose sharply after a court ruled in favour of a BSE petition to free
shares seized by the government in connection with a financial scandal.
Brokers ended their trading boycott and the BSE index leapt 125.81, or 4.7
per cent, to 2,804.15.
KARACHI continued to slide as investors were discouraged by political
uncertainty, caused by a split between the ruling coalition and one of its
allies in Karachi, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The KSE-100 index broke through the 1,400 support level to close at
1,384.94, down 16.41 or 1.2 per cent.
HONG KONG reversed early gains, the Hang Seng index ending a net 108.37, or
1.9 per cent, off at 5,664.3 in turnover of HKDollars 3.44bn. Active issues
included HSBC Holdings, down 50 cents at HKDollars 51.50, and Cheung Kong,
30 cents cheaper at HKDollars 24.00.
SINGAPORE saw profit-taking after climbing sharply in early trading. The
Straits Times Industrial index was finally 21.03 up at 1,422.34. SIA rose
SDollars 1 to SDollars 13.70 on news of a proposed one-for-one scrip issue,
but the foreign shares were unchanged at SDollars 17.20. Inchcape gained 20
cents to SDollars 5.75 on reports that it was distributing SDollars 109m to
shareholders.
SEOUL's composite index dipped 4.28 to 517.48 in thin trading. Turnover came
to Won121bn, against Won142bn during Saturday's half-day session. Declines
outscored gains by 486 to 213.
TAIWAN retreated on profit-taking and the weighted index, which had gained
more than 50 points earlier in the day, closed 10.63 down at 4,008.22.
Turnover amounted to TDollars 23.94bn, after Saturday's TDollars 17.5bn.
MANILA gained ground on optimism about the prospects for economic recovery.
The composite index climbed 11.71 to 1,475.10. Advances outnumbered declines
by 46 to 25.
Combined turnover expanded to 299.3m pesos from 252m. Philippine National
Bank lost 5 pesos to 290 pesos, while Philippine Long Distance Telephone
added 10 pesos at 1,040 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR fell in dull trading. The composite index lost 3.83 to 589.70.
Falls led gains by 180 to 51 as volume shrank to 52m shares from Friday's
70m. Investors took profits in Telekom, which declined 30 cents to MDollars
13.40.
AUSTRALIA eased as investors remained cautious ahead of tomorrow's second
quarter inflation figures. The All Ordinaries index slipped 3.3 to 1,606.3
in turnover of ADollars 200.9m.
Among active stocks, BHP fell 6 cents to ADollars 13.46 and News Corp gained
20 cents to ADollars 22.14. GIO, which was listed last week, saw 6.5m shares
traded and weakened 8 cents to ADollars 2.42.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index closed 1.78 higher at 1,550.51 in turnover of
NZDollars 33m.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland likely to import more as
crop tumbles
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND IS likely to turn to world grain markets next year for additional
wheat in the wake of a harvest that could fall to 21.2m tonnes, nearly a
quarter down on last year's 27.8m tonne yield.
The low result predicted for this year by the Central Statistical Office
follows a serious drought in May and June. There has also been a big decline
in fertiliser usage and a 4.6 per cent fall in the area of land sown with
grain this year.
The resulting purchases abroad could be between 1m and 2m tonnes of wheat
and maize. Last year Poland imported a mere 100,000 tonnes of grain compared
to the 2m to 3m traditionally imported in the 1980s and a record 8m tonne
worth of purchases abroad in 1979.
This time Poland can be expected to turn to the European Community, on which
Poland imposes a 10 per cent grain import tariff compared to a 20 per cent
duty on grain brought in from elsewhere. Polish grain traders, led by
Rolimpex, the largest potential purchaser, caution, however, that this
year's harvest could be as high as 24m tonnes.

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices yesterday continued the downtrend that set in late last week
at the London Metal Exchange, with the cash price closing Pounds 13 down at
Pounds 1,327.50 a tonne. However, most of the fall was attributable to
sterling's firmness against the dollar. Dealers noted that the three months
price held just above expected support at the equivalent of Dollars 2,540 a
tonne. Earlier the market was boosted by news that Polish copper workers
planned to step up their strike action and the three months price reached
Dollars 2,562 a tonne in the morning. Three months TIN came under heavy
pressure in afternoon trading and closed Dollars 110 down on the day at
Dollars 6,932.50 a tonne, in the process moving from a Dollars 27.50 premium
over the cash price to a Dollars 62.50 discount and breaching key support at
Dollars 7,000 a tonne. With charts weak further declines seemed to be on the
cards, dealers said.
PLATINUM continued on the downswing of its recent price pendulum, with the
afternoon fixing at Dollars 377.50 a tonne, down Dollars 2.85 on the day and
only 25 cents above last week's three-week low. The price rallied in later
trading but dealers thought it could slip back to test support at Dollars
375 and then Dollars 372 before rebounding.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghana points the way along
Africa's golden road - Growing interest in the mining potential of the
continent's sub-Saharan region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A USDollars 165m syndicated loan is at present being finalised that should
enable Ashanti Goldfields Corporation of Ghana to expand production and join
the relatively exclusive band of companies that each produce more than 1m
troy ounces of gold a year.
Ashanti's production boost is part of a gold mining renaissance in Ghana
since a new Minerals Code was enacted in 1986, together with incentives and
tax arrangements that the mining industry considers very reasonable.
Ghana's gold production has jumped from an annual eight tonnes in the early
1980s to 18 tonnes last year.
'Given the outstanding geology and well-organised institutional environment,
it is quite conceivable that by 1996 Ghana could be producing between 45 and
50 tonnes of gold a year,' suggests Mr Mark Keatley, senior investment
officer at the International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World
Bank.
Not only that, he says, sub-Saharan Africa (which excludes the Arab
countries of North Africa as well as South Africa) has the potential to
produce about 165 tonnes of gold a year - nearly double last year's 84
tonnes and almost as large as Canada's present output.
Past production figures are bound to be distorted, however, because nearly
40 per cent of sub-Saharan African gold production is by small-scale miners,
highly entrepreneurial people known variously as artisans, galampsey or
pailleurs.
Mr Keatley points out that 'they are estimated to produce almost as much
gold as the entire country of Chile and quite possibly much more that is not
reflected in the official statistics'.
At least ten African countries produce gold but about two-thirds of total
output is from three countries: Ghana, Zimbabwe and Zaire.
Ashanti Goldfields, which is 45 per cent owned by Lonrho, the UK-based
conglomerate, with the rest in government hands, is Ghana's gold standard
bearer. It produced 569,475 ounces last year and expects to move up to
670,000 in 1992 and to sustain 1m ounces a year from 1996.
The IFC has also been asked by the government to organise the return of
Ashanti to the international stock markets and this will be done 'when
suitable equity market conditions obtain', says Mr Keatley.
Drawing on the IFC's investment activities in the area and research by the
African Mining Unit of the World Bank, Mr Keatley prepared a paper for the
recent Financial Times World Gold Conference outlining sub-Saharan Africa's
gold potential. He pointed out that much of Africa had the right type of
geology for successful gold mining but not every one of its 44 countries had
the right 'enabling environment', by which he meant infrastructure, legal
systems, official policies and institutional development.
Ghana was an example of what was possible with the right enabling
environment, Mr Keatley suggested. Since 1986 it had yielded three new
world-class gold mines in the Tarkwa basin: Billiton's Bogosu mine producing
three tonnes a year; the Terebie mine a similar amount; and the Iduapriem
mine, majority owned by Golden Shamrock Mines of Australia, three to four
tonnes a year.
Elsewhere in western Africa, Mali had recently introduced a Mining Code
based to some extent on that of Ghana. In Mali Broken Hill Proprietary of
Australia brought a new gold mine into operation in 1990 which is producing
an annual 3 tonnes. This would be expanded to 6 tonnes by 1994 under an
expansion project in which the IFC is involved, said Mr Keatley.
A serious effort was being made to promote another western African country,
Burkina, to international mining companies. 'That country should be regarded
as a priority exploration target,' he said.
Southern Africa's biggest gold producing country is Zimbabwe, which produced
almost 18 tonnes of gold last year. Mr Keatley said the country had an
exceptionally well-developed infrastructure for the mining industry and it
had more than 100 mines.
At one end of the scale were mines such as that operated by Lonrho, with
output of more than five tonnes of gold a year, and Cluff Resources, Falcon
Gold and RTZ, each producing two or three tonnes annually. In contrast many
small mines were producing just over 100 kg each a year.
Zimbabwe was the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that offered gold mining
companies a realistic chance of financing growth through a local stock
market. During the past two years Cluff and Falcon had raised the equivalent
of Dollars 15m by share offerings to finance mine developments.
Other gold-producing countries in southern Africa are Namibia, where the
first gold mine opened in 1989, and Madagascar. But the country estimated to
have the highest potential was Mozambique. In the Manica area of Mozambique
alone there were more than 40 abandoned gold mines with a resource base
estimated at more than 50 tonnes.
Zaire, in east-central Africa, had two gold-bearing provinces. One in its
north east corner has been worked for its gold for two millennia. It might
have been a source of gold for Egypt in ancient times. 'It is not
implausible that the gold of the Pharaohs was brought down the Nile from
this source,' Mr Keatley pointed out.
In more recent times this gold area had been neglected. Most of it was
leased by the Zaire state gold miner, Okimo, which had not invested much in
exploration or development. However, last year the government agreed to
sub-lease part of the concession to a South African/Belgian consortium. This
joint venture - in which the IFC is a founding shareholder - would
eventually produced 2.5 tonnes of gold a year and estimated that sustainable
annual output of 14 tonnes could be achieved in five years.
The other Zaire gold region, containing the deposits of Twangiza and Namoya,
was very difficult to operate in, Mr Keatley pointed out. 'Supplies have to
be trucked for two to six weeks through East Africa to reach the mining
areas. Hydro-electric power stations have been installed in the mountains
but in general the infrastructure is poor.
'On top of these physical constraints, Zaire is presently in the throes of a
political and economic crisis unparalleled in its history. All central
institutions have practically collapsed. So investors interested in these
vast resources need to be well-organised and patient.'
Elsewhere in east-central Africa, while countries such as Burundi, Tanzania,
Kenya and Ethiopia have known geological potential, very little
commercial-scale gold mining is going on.
Mr Keatley suggested that the end of the Cold War, which had devided many
African nations into two ideological camps and lead to distortions in
economic policies, was very positive. Also, the more relaxed international
scene enabled South African mining houses to export their expertise to other
parts of Africa.
However, there was much catching up to be done because during the 1980s
total exploration expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa was only about Dollars
100m a year - 'a major under-investment by all yardsticks'.

RUSSIA'S DEPUTY agriculture minister yesterday revealed a further cut in the
republic's 1992 grain harvest estimate, reports Reuter from Moscow.
'Ministry of Agriculture experts believe that grain production will total
93m-94m tonnes,' Mr Vladimir Shcherbak told a news conference. Initial
estimates had put the crop total at between 104m and 108m tonnes, but that
was cut to 98m tonnes two and a half weeks ago and subsequently to 96m
tonnes. According to Russian statistics the 1991 harvest was 89.1m tonnes.
Mr Shcherbak blamed shortages of oil and lack of equipment and spare parts -
traditional problems in the troubled agricultural sector - for the
disappointing production figures, which in turn force reliance on expensive
imports.
The London-based International Wheat Council expects Russia to import 19m
tonnes of wheat and coarse grains in the 1992-93 season ending June 30,
after 36.3m the previous year.
Last week Russian President Boris Yeltsin told citizens in the Siberian city
of Omsk that he expected grain imports to total 10m tonnes in the coming
year, after 25m this year.

THE RUSSIAN government yesterday expressed concern about the low level of
grain deliveries to the state, saying that peasants had been holding back
supplies in the hope of an increase in the official procurement price.
Mr Alexander Kudelia, deputy head of the Russian Committee for Grain
Production, said that as of yesterday only about 1m tonnes had found their
way into government stores, compared with 9m tonnes at the same time last
year.
'The situation is serious but not catastrophic,' he told a news conference.
He said he believed that the peasants would stop hoarding their grain as a
result of an announcement by President Boris Yeltsin last week that the
procurement price would not be increased beyond the price obtained at
private commodity exchanges. The commodity exchange price currently stands
at Rbs10,000 a tonne for standard quality wheat.
A pick-up in procurement would in turn enable the government to meet its
target of purchasing 29m tonnes by November. Last year it scraped together
22m tonnes, with a poorer harvest than that expected this year.
Mr Kudelia said that he expected grain imports from other former Soviet
republics and the world at large to total between 16 and 19m tonnes, which
he described as an average level for previous years. This year's import
would included 3m tonnes already promised by Kazakhstan.

THE 1992 Barbadian sugar harvest has produced 54,500 tonnes, down 17 per
cent from last year but enough to satisfy its annual European Community
quota of 54,000 tonnes, according to officials in the sugar industry.
This year's output is the lowest for the industry in the past 60 years.
However, Mr David West, managing director of Barbados Sugar Industry Ltd,
the island's sole producer, said the yield was a 'remarkable achievement'
following a series of strikes and poor weather during harvesting.
The cut has left the industry unable to satisfy its 7,000-tonne US quota and
home demand of 12,000 tonnes has been covered this year by imports from
Guatemala and Trinidad.

for Avonmouth smelter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the state-owned Finnish mining and metals group, has ruled out
making an offer for the Avonmouth zinc smelter in the UK which was put up
for sale in March.
Mr Erik Nyholm, president of Outokumpu Zinc, said Pasminco, the Australian
company, had chosen the wrong time to dispose of Avonmouth because there was
too much zinc production capacity, particularly in Europe.
The market would not be in supply-demand balance until 1993 at the earliest.
Outokumpu was also worried about possible pollution clean-up charges
associated with the UK smelter - although he admitted his company had not
looked very closely at that situation.
Avonmouth is the UK's only zinc smelter. Pasminco recently completely a
Pounds 10m programme there that expanded its annual capacity to 105,000
tonnes of zinc and 50,000 tonnes of lead bullion. However, Pasminco has
decided to sell Avonmouth and its other European assets to reduce debt and
to focus on its operations in Australia.
Mr Nyholm pointed out that about 140,000 tonnes of annual zinc production
capacity had been closed down in Europe recently but the industry had been
surprised when Nuova Samim had abandoned plans to close its 100,000
tonnes-a-year Crotone smelter in Italy. Samim would keep it operating while
building a new 120,000 tonnes smelter. 'If Crotone had closed, the market
would be in balance,' said Mr Nyholm. 'The new Italian smelter makes no
sense - it will simply lose more money than the old one. This is expensive
politics.'
Mr Nyholm said that the technical squeeze on the London Metal Exchange's
zinc market was not helping the industry. Contracts all over the world were
linked to the LME price which, because of the squeeze, was at present about
Dollars 200-a-tonne too high. These artificially-high prices were delaying
closure of uneconomic capacity.
Mr Nyholm said Outokumpu had complained privately about the squeeze to the
LME board. He said the LME should make up its mind whether it wanted to be a
market for consumers and producers or one for speculators.
As long as the technical instruments were available for speculators to play
the market, manipulation would continue. As long as there were traders
wanting to make short-term profits, manipulation would continue, he added.
However, it was not possible to fight the fundamental market situation for
ever and eventually the price might collapse. 'We expected the price to
collapse this summer but instead the squeeze goes on to October.'
Outokumpu Zinc, which owns Tara, in Ireland, Europe's biggest zinc mine, and
a smelter at Kokkola, was just about breaking even at today's LME prices and
a weak dollar, he said. Tara produced 187,500 tonnes of zinc in concentrates
last year while the Kokkola smelter produced 170,400 tonnes of refined zinc.
This year, Kokkola is scheduled to produce 168,000 tonnes following a
two-week closure for essential maintenance work.
Mr Nyholm pointed out that the world consumed about 6m tonnes of zinc a
year, compared with 200,000 tonnes of excess capacity today. 'So as soon as
demand picks up the surplus will quickly disappear,' he said.

FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Questions over Uni's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise exit of Mr Jan Erik Langangen, president and chief executive of
Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, and the appointment of Mr Per
Terje Vold as interim president has provided more questions over the
company's future than answers.
Uni Storebrand's board appointed Mr Vold to succeed Mr Langangen but also
tendered its own resignation. Uni's nominating committee is due to meet soon
and is expected to accept the resignation.
Mr Langangen's departure was the result of pressure from disgruntled
shareholders who had grown increasingly dissatisfied with his handling of
the company's stake in Skandia, the Swedish insurer, for which he had
ambitious plans.
Uni paid NKr4.7bn (Dollars 798m) for a 28.3 per cent limited-voting stake in
Skandia. Uni's Skandia investment this year has plunged in value by about
NKr2.5bn, together with Uni's share price which has been halved to about
NKr25 since the turn of the year.
The board's resignation is a condition of the participation a group of key
shareholders in a Uni share issue which would allow the company to meet
capital adequacy requirements.
Mr Langangen was seeking to make Skandia the cornerstone of his vision for a
Nordic insurance alliance, although Uni's stake in the company held limited
voting rights.
Stonewalled by Mr Bjoern Wolrath, Skandia's president, Mr Langangen was left
with a large shareholding without the necessary clout to influence the
future of Skandia. He was counting on his company's key shareholders to
guarantee a capital expansion of NKr1.5bn-NKr2bn. Failing to win their
backing, Mr Langangen resigned and the board tendered its resignation.
Fresh capital would also allow Uni to retain the Skandia stake for at least
a year without pressure to sell. It could then dispose of the stake without
a significant loss.
Uni's board is due to meet tomorrow to map out a plan for the capital
expansion which Mr Vold says is his first order of business.
Questions have also been raised over the future of Mr Langangen's post as
chairman of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. These could become
pressing if Statoil participates in Uni's share issue.

NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, yesterday reported a NKr214m
drop in half-year net income to NKr788m (Dollars 133.61m), despite gains on
foreign currency and from the sale of securities.
Its performance was well below market expectations.
Second-quarter net income, however, rose by nearly NKr200m to NKr587m. The
group said: 'The second-quarter earnings benefited from a positive effect of
changes in currency rates, primarily the fall in the dollar and gains from
the sale of securities.' It recorded a second-quarter foreign currency gain
of NKr468m, against a loss of NKr322m last time.
Second-quarter net financial income was NKr374m, compared with a net
financial expense of NKr619m in last year's second quarter.
Hydro also made a second-quarter NKr213m gain from the sale of non-voting
shares in Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, but
bought a similar number of voting shares. The company owns 12.3 per cent of
Saga's total share capital.
Second-quarter group operating income slid by NKr336m to NKr810m, while
operating revenue dropped by NKr298m to NKr15.386bn.
At the half-year, group operating income was NKr1.1bn weaker at NKr1.85bn as
operating revenue fell by NKr563m to NKr31.34bn.
Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said results were still affected by the weak
international economic situation, but 'we have seen some price increases for
light metals and petrochemical products during the first half of the year'.
He pledged that cost-cutting would continue with the aim of reducing costs
by at least NKr1.5bn within two years.
Mr Myklebust said some benefits of restructuring the group's fertiliser
business were already apparent, but he warned that the unit faced a falling
west European market and low-priced imports from eastern European countries.
The agriculture division saw second-quarter operating income tumble to NKr9m
from NKr338m last year as half-year operating income plunged to NKr204m from
NKr864m.
Second-quarter operating income for the oil and gas division was up NKr63m
to NKr722m, helped by a 200m tonnes of oil equivalent rise in oil/gas
production and slightly higher oil prices. At the half-year mark, the
division saw operating income increase by NKr36m to NKr1.460bn.
Second-quarter operating revenue rose NKr27m to NKr3.35bn but by NKr47m to
NKr6.66bn in the first six months.

DOW Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning,
yesterday reported a 19 per cent drop in underlying second-quarter net
income to Dollars 36m on sales that rose 5.7 per cent to Dollars 488.4m.
A large one-time charge related to the company's silicone breast implant
business depressed the company's reported net earnings even further,
contributing to an 84 per cent decline to Dollars 6.3m.
In the 1991 second quarter, Dow Corning had net income of Dollars 40.5m on
sales of Dollars 462.1m.
The results had little impact on Dow Chemical and Corning's shares, which
respectively eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 and held steady at Dollars
36 1/4 at midday.
Mr Edward Steinhoff, Dow Corning's chief financial officer, said operating
profits fell on the back of slower than expected growth. 'Our sales grew,
although we didn't achieve the price increases we needed.'

BENETTON, the Italian casual wear manufacturer, yesterday confirmed it had
swapped a clutch of clothing assets with Edizione Holding, the Benetton
family's private holding company, in return for a 38 per cent stake in
Prince, the US sports group.
The transaction caused some surprise, as it appears to conflict with the
strategy of large-scale sub-contracting under which Benetton has flourished
since its birth in the mid-1960s.
Benetton is buying majority holdings in four Italian companies for L90bn
(Dollars 80m). It is transferring to Edizione Holding its stake in Prince,
worth around Dollars 70m.
Edizione Holding bought 80 per cent of Prince in September 1990 for an
undisclosed sum, and took a further 15 per cent the following month. The
company did not then reveal that part of the stake was being acquired by
Benetton itself, which is 80 per cent controlled by the Benettons through
Edizione Holding.

HEAVY catastrophe claims depressed second-quarter earnings at Safeco, the US
property and casualty insurer. The company made an after-tax profit of
Dollars 42.1m in the three months to end-June, compared with Dollars 51.2m a
year earlier.
The figure was achieved on revenues of Dollars 869.7m against Dollars 859.6m
last time, and profits before realised gains fell from Dollars 50.9m to
Dollars 30.4m. Realised investment gains contributed Dollars 11.8m, compared
with Dollars 264,000. Despite the second quarter fall, however, Safeco is
still showing higher profits for the first six months of the year, at
Dollars 127.2m after tax, compared with Dollars 106.5m.
Hailstorms, earthquakes, riots and the need to increase reserves for claims
after the Oakland fire disaster cost the group Dollars 80m in the second
quarter, and led to a Dollars 73m underwriting loss. Mr Roger Eigsti, chief
executive, said: 'Homeowners, the line of business most affected by the
catastrophes and weather, posted underwriting losses of Dollars 58.3m for
the second quarter, and Dollars 61.1m for the first six months.'
These problem areas were partially offset by improved car insurance results.
Personal car insurance posted an Dollars 8.5m underwriting profit for the
first six months, compared with a Dollars 21.9m loss a year ago. Alexander &amp;
Alexander, the insurance broker, made after-tax profits of Dollars 16.9m in
the second quarter of 1992, up from Dollars 13.5m a year earlier. Profits
for the first half of 1992 now stand at Dollars 37.7m (Dollars 15.4m).

<TEXT>
THE Treuhand agency, which handles eastern German privatisations, said two
European groups are contending to take over one of east Germany's largest
chemicals operations.
A consortium led by Enichem, subsidiary of the Italian state energy concern,
and inc-luding Thyssen Handelsunion, a subsidiary of Thyssen, the German
industrial and trading group, and OMV, the Austrian state oil company, has
bid to buy polyolefine facilities at the Buna, Leuna and Bohlen sites. These
make up the heart of the east German chemicals industry. Polyolefine is a
feedstock for producing poly-ethylene and polypropylene.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Treuhand spokesman, said the agency would sign
preliminary contracts with one of the bidders - the other group's name could
not be disclosed - by 1993. Investments of between DM2bn (Dollars 1.33bn)
and DM3bn would be needed to modernise the installations.
The deal would follow the recent contract won by a Franco-German consortium
of Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, and Thyssen to build a DM4.3bn refinery
at Leuna and to take over east Germany's Minol petrol station network.
Mr Wauschkuhn said Atochem, an Elf subsidiary, had bid to take over methanol
production at the Leuna site and was prepared to invest DM200m.
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company, OMV and Beaulieu, the Belgian
carpet manufacturer, had bid to buy Leuna's facilities for producing
tensides for the detergent industry.
The Treuhand was also seeking to privatise production of ethylene epoxides
at Buna. Investments apart from polyolefine production were expected to
amount to DM1bn.
Investments of about DM13bn will be needed because of a pledge by Bonn to
retain the nearly 20,000 workers in the chemicals industry. It employed more
than 100,000 people in early 1990.

<TEXT>
Mr Bjoern Wolrath, Skandia's president, said Skandia had proposed to Uni
Storebrand that it undertake its capital increase that would be combined
with an option to buy Uni Storebrand's 28 per cent stake in the Swedish
insurer.
Mr Wolrath suggested this option would create an opportunity for Uni to
dispose of its Skandia shareholding. He said the option could expire in 1993
or 1994.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Opting for the quiet life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTS IN the tax-haven of St Helier have devised an alternative tour for
curious visitors. On the left, they say, is the house where Guinness money
changed hands, on the right Polly Peck and down the road, the bank where
Brinks Mat gold finds a home.
The latest addition to the tour is Maxwell Chambers, home of Bryant &amp; Co.
These small accountancy offices have sparked a Serious Fraud Office
investigation into a possible share support scheme in at least two quoted
companies - Richmond Oil and Gas and Butte Mining.
Bryant &amp; Co was once a thriving firm, looking after the needs of hundreds of
off-shore clients. Yet when police raided the premises in April, they walked
into the Marie Celeste. Just a pile of unopened mail and thousands of papers
cramming numerous filing cabinets.
The local fraud office is still puzzled as to how the office came to be
deserted.
One of the few men who can answer that question is Mr Kelvin Myles, Bryant's
burly office manager since 1989. He took over the day-to-day running of the
business after the death of proprietor Mr Peter Bryant and the departure of
a fellow manager.
In the months preceding the raid, however, Mr Myles gave up his Jersey
career for a quiet life running a fishing tackle shop in the Republic of
Ireland. He, his family, their Bentley, Corvette and Jaguar now live in
peaceful obscurity in the tiny village of Danore, outside Drogheda.
Standing on the steps of his Pounds 70,000 home - a Costa del Sol
construction sited oddly among the cattle fields of Louth - Mr Myles refused
to answer the question preoccupying the police. Nor would he comment on his
role in the London flotation of Richmond Oil &amp; Gas.
Yet it is clear from documents that Mr Myles did have a legitimate part to
play. Cheques made out to Richmond, totalling several million pounds, were
signed in his distinctive scrawl.
Letters from Richmond, demanding repayment of Pounds 12m in January 1990,
were addressed to him as a director of Oakwood Management Enterprises.
When asked about Oakwood, however, Mr Myles would only say that he had
'heard of it'.
Whatever the case, it is clear that Mr Myles has more pressing matters on
his mind. Down the road from the Myles hacienda, patrons in the local pub
are sure of it. 'Two hundred thousand pounds worth of cars,' said one with
an ironic grin, 'and not one of them is even working.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Recession restricts Greggs to Pounds 2.29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREGGS, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based manufacturer and retailer of bread,
confectionery and savory products, returned profits of Pounds 2.29m before
tax for the 24 weeks ended June 13.
That was a 2 per cent improvement on last time's Pounds 2.24m and was scored
on the back of a 4 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 45.3m, helped by
the opening of nine new shops.
A small decrease in volume sales through existing stores reflected the
impact of the recession.
A more positive trend in sales and profits identified by the company in the
first five months of the year was not sustained after Easter.
Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said he was confident about the
medium and long term future but he did not expect the recession to end 'in
the very near term.'
At the half year end Greggs was trading from 482 outlets. In spite of a
Pounds 1.25m cutback in planned investment to Pounds 6.25m the group
expected to open a further eight new shops and close one during the
remainder of the year.
'We are investing in the future,' said Mr Darring-ton.
Apart from the recession, Greggs suffered from the impact of Sunday trading,
to which it was firmly opposed, and massive expansion by supermarket
competitors.
Interest income for the opening 24 weeks fell from Pounds 232,000 to Pounds
166,000, mainly reflecting lower interest rates.
The interim dividend is lifted by 5.3 per cent to 5p from static earnings of
13.4p.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chairman goes as Mosaic signals direction
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Mosaic Investments, the acquisitive mini-conglomerate based in
Birmingham, has dismissed Mr Brian Disbury, its Pounds 130,000 a year
executive chairman, and signalled a change in direction against a background
of falling profits.
Yesterday it announced that pre-tax profits for the year ended April 30 had
fallen from Pounds 7.56m to Pounds 4.24m. The decline was not unexpected as
last March the group issued a profits warning and saw its share price lose
40 per cent of its value in a single day.
Yesterday the price remained at 95p, still hovering at the bottom of its
1992 trading range.
Mr Disbury was relieved of his position last Friday. 'Compensation terms are
still being discussed,' the group said.
While a replacement for Mr Disbury is sought, Mr Greg Hutchings, a
non-executive member of the board since 1987 - the year Mr Disbury became
chief executive - will act as non-executive chairman. Mr Hutchings is the
chief executive of Tomkins, also an aggressive but a much larger
conglomerate.
The departure of Mr Disbury, allied to the closure or disposal of
loss-making interests and the sale, earlier this month for Pounds 10.4m, of
the group's engineering and automotive division to its management, showed
that Mosaic had abandoned its policy of diverse growth.
The search for small niche companies operating in varied markets - a policy
with which Mr Disbury was associated - is being replaced by a more focused
approach concentrating on display and packaging products and specialised
promotion services.
'What we are determined to do is to change direction in some respects,' said
Mr Leon Angrave, managing director. 'If we were going to move forward and
restore credibility with our friends in the City, we needed to be under
different leadership,' he added.
A group statement observed that a change in leadership had been necessary
for some months. Mr Disbury, who had obviously been at odds with his board,
refused yesterday to dwell on the situation: 'Policy differences there might
have been, but there are certain ways of going about things - that's all
I'll say.'
Mosaic was caught by the length of the recession. Mr Angrave acknowledged
that the position deteriorated shortly after the announcement, last
December, of the first half figures. Then the group talked of the rewards
'of serving many different markets' and of its confidence in 'a satisfactory
outcome for the full year.'
The first half accounted for over 75 per cent of the full year profits,
which were generated on turnover of Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 42.8m). Earnings
per share were halved to 16.26p (32.39p) but the dividend is held at 9.25p
with a final of 5.5p.
Although Mosaic said that its current trading was 'mixed' and there was no
sign of sustained economic recovery, the sale of its engineering and
automotive business had eliminated debt. Mr Hutchings said the group was now
'in a position to face the continuing recession with resilience.'

The Smaller Companies Investment Trust reported an increase in both revenue
and net asset value at the half year ended June 30.
Net asset value rose to 89.16p, against 83.13p 12 months earlier, while
income from investments rose from Pounds 320,000 to Pounds 368,000 and net
revenue came out at Pounds 227,000 (Pounds 190,000).
Nonetheless, the company decided not to increase the interim of 1.2p as the
rate of increase in revenue for the whole year is likely to be less than
that of the first half.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 17.5% rise for RPS as margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RPS Group, the environmental consultancy, saw pre-tax profits increase 17.5
per cent, from Pounds 302,000 to Pounds 355,000, in the first half of 1992.
The group reorganisation was almost complete. Margins rose substantially
compared with the second half of 1991, although turnover fell from Pounds
4.6m to Pounds 3.73m. Profit last time was struck after exceptional charges
of Pounds 121,000.
Progress in the second half would largely depend upon realisation of the
full benefit of cost reductions and more efficient staff utilisation,
thereby allowing margins to be raised further.
Earnings per share were 1.99p (1.64p) but the interim dividend is clipped to
1p (1.4p). On current projections the directors hoped to lift the total from
the previous 2p.
Over the six months gearing was cut from 40 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr
Brian Clouston, chairman, left the company as from yesterday as his contract
had expired; Mr Roger Looker takes over the chair.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bullough records 18% decline to Pounds
5.89m - Annual dividend expected to be maintained despite gloomy economic
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROLONGED and deepening recession in the UK and France was behind an 18
per cent fall in interim profits at Bullough, the office products and
refrigeration group.
For the six months to April 30, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.18m to
Pounds 5.89m on sales of Pounds 132.7m, down from Pounds 141.5m.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p. Earnings per share fell from 4p
to 3.12p.
Mr Derrick Battle, chairman, warned that 'because of the lack of any
discernible economic upturn' profits for the full year would be lower than
the Pounds 20.8m achieved last time. The group still intends to maintain the
dividend for the year at 6.05p.
Operating profits from office products fell from Pounds 4.27m to Pounds
1.55m. Atal in France was reduced to near break-even as the company has
still to work through planned redundancies with local authorities.
Mr Battle said he remained pessimistic about a UK re-covery in office
furniture.
Last year's demand for new fridges, prompted by health and safety
regulations covering the temperature of food in distribution and display,
was not sustained. Refrigeration's profits fell from Pounds 2.12m to Pounds
975,000.
The division's costs were up in anticipation of a better second half,
although both full-year sales and profits are likely to remain below last
year's.
The lower cost base of BFN Storefitters and Beanstalk enabled Store Fitting
to reduce its loss from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 66,000.
Operating profits at the remaining divisions were: heating Pounds 2.1m
(Pounds 2m); electrical Pounds 466,000 (Pounds 748,000) and engineering
Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 858,000).
Capital expenditure of Pounds 5.3m was mainly responsible for an increase in
net borrowings from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 8.8m.
COMMENT
Bullough has long been seen as a safe recovery stock. Given that the
long-awaited recovery looks further away than ever, the key question is how
will the group fare without an upturn in the economy? While office products
shows no signs of an improvement, electrical and engineering businesses
should continue to make impressive advances in sales and profits. The latter
is particularly sweet for the company since it was advised by some
commentators to sell the division. The worst appears over in store fitting,
and although refrigeration had a disappointing first half it is expected to
do better in the second. With full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.5m,
giving earnings per share of 9.3p, the shares - down 21p to 114p - are on a
prospective multiple of 12.2. They still look fairly priced though,
irrespective of whether an economic recovery takes place.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Excalibur dives 73% to Pounds 1.11m but
strengthens balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCALIBUR, the jewellery, merchandising and engineering group, said
yesterday that the year to April 30 had contained bad and good news,
suggesting the good - on the balance sheet - outweighed the bad - on the
profit and loss account.
Pre-tax profits tumbled 73 per cent to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 4.14m), after a
Pounds 1.6m exceptional charge for written-down jewellery stocks.
Sales in the jewellery division fell 11 per cent to Pounds 16.4m. Giftware
and merchandising lifted sales 11 per cent to Pounds 22.1m. The crystal and
pewterware companies were flat, but Pic-A-Tape, the music distributor,
achieved record profits.
Sales in the aerospace division grew 9 per cent to Pounds 10.1m with its
four companies all in profit but with slipped margins. Sales in the
industrial side advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 16.5m, though trading losses
were incurred.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 60.7m). Earnings were down at
1.3p (6.2p) per share and the proposed final dividend is reduced to 0.6p for
a total of 1p (1.8p).
The group was at pains to stress the good news on the balance sheet. All its
borrowings have been restructured away from short-term to long-term
arrangements with fewer banks.
Working capital has been reduced by 20 per cent and redeployed away from
jewellery and industrial to giftware and aerospace, which require additional
investment. Capital investment was maintained at Pounds 4.6m and gearing
held at 58 per cent.
COMMENT
With the jewellery market having shrunk by 40 per cent since the heady days
of 1989 and the industrial division in the wrong part of the cycle,
Excalibur needed its other two legs to stand on. Even though aerospace took
a double blow from Rolls-Royce, which decided to end its own raw materials
buying and switched from 30-day to 60-day credit, it has a good order book,
though it will have to claw back some margin. In giftware, Pic-A-Tape was
the star, though whether it can successfully break out of service stations
and into groceries remains to be seen. If the jewellery side needs no more
provisions, and that is a big 'if' with jewellery likely to be last out of
the recession, then Pounds 2m pre-tax can be expected this year, giving
earnings of 2.3p and a prospective multiple of about 7. Not expensive, not
exciting, but a recovery stock, though not yet.

<TEXT>
NU-SWIFT, the fire protection, office cleaning and property group, reported
a fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 20.2m, in the year to
December 31.
Turnover fell to Pounds 326m (Pounds 342m). The company said its businesses
had suffered from difficult conditions in the UK and US, but costs had been
closely controlled and operating profits were reasonable.
The office cleaning and maintenance division had found trading conditions
difficult in the US,but improved efficiency and reduced costs meant results
in the first quarter of 1992 were 21 per cent ahead.
Following the disposal in 1990 of its holding in Sicli, the French fire
extinguisher company, Nu-Swift invested Pounds 49m in property which,
together with non-recourse borrowings of Pounds 78m, enabled it to acquire a
property portfolio, mainly offices in central London.
Earnings per share fell from 45.36p to 34.74p. A same-again final dividend
of 10p is proposed, to make an increased total of 20p (18p).

<TEXT>
MERRYDOWN WINE, the USM-quoted cider, wine and health foods group, reported
a 14 per cent decline, from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 1.93m, in annual profits
before tax.
Its premium cider brands weathered the recession with strong sales growth
through supermarkets and off-licences but its honey business was badly hit,
according to Mr Richard Purdey, chairman.
The outcome for the year to March 31 was also affected by a 45 per cent
increase to Pounds 425,000 in interest charges and higher British apple
prices.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 2.53m to Pounds 2.35m on turnover up 3
per cent at Pounds 17.3m.
First quarter sales of the group's key brands were ahead of last year
despite increased competition and difficult economic conditions, Mr Purdey
said.
Merrydown Vintage cider had maintained its position as the leading premium
brand and was the best-selling packaged cider in Scotland. Merrydown
Traditional, launched in January last year, had secured 5 per cent of the
growing can sector; and Premium Draught, the group's first keg cider, would
be given wider distribution through a partnership to be announced shortly.
Reorganisation of West Country Honey Farms under a new managing director had
been completed, and the company would now compete in the mainstream honey
market as well as building its specialist preserves business. 'I am
confident we shall see a return to former levels of profitability,' Mr
Purdey said.
Group export sales increased 13.4 per cent to Pounds 760,000.
Earnings were reduced from 20.61p to 17.15p but the total dividend is raised
an effective 12.5 per cent to 7p with a final of 6p; as in the previous
year, there is a 1-for-8 scrip issue.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, the international leisure group which owns the national stadium,
has agreed to sell Guild Entertainment, the UK independent distributor of
films, for an initial Pounds 19m to Chargeurs of France.
It has also received permission to install up to 1,200 electronic gaming
machines - 'one-arm bandits without the arms' - at Lincoln Greyhound Park in
Rhode Island, US.
The Guild sale is part of Wembley's policy of reducing its debt by disposing
of non-core businesses. In April borrowings totalled some Pounds 175m; after
the sale they will fall to Pounds 124m, giving gearing of 58 per cent,
according to Mr Alex McCrindle, finance director.
The initial consideration is in cash and Wembley will be paid a further
Pounds 5.5m, dependent on Guild's profits performance in 1992.
Wembley bought Guild in October 1989 for Pounds 23.8m in cash and shares.
The figure included an outstanding balance of Pounds 4.5m in respect of
letters of credit issued to the original Guild vendors which will remain
payable by Wembley.
Guild distributes mainly independently-made films - such as Terminator 2,
Dances with Wolves and Basic Instinct - to the cinema, video and television
industries and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds
33.9m in 1991.
For Chargeurs, which has extensive interests in textiles and the film
industry, the acquisition offers an opportunity to expand its film and video
interests.
The French group, headed by the controversial Mr Jerome Seydoux, a close
associate of President Francois Mitterrand, is already a leading force in
the French film industry. It is an investor in Renn Productions, the
film-making company connected with Mr Claud Berri, the French producer
behind Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, and in the Pathe cinema
chain.

business'.
The group had performed well in the opening period and 'we see no reason why
this progress cannot be maintained during the second half'.
Progress was maintained in all three divisions - outplacement, residential
conference centres and training and publications.
Turnover totalled Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 12.5m including Pounds 3.93m for
discontinued businesses). The operating profit was Pounds 1.28m (losses
Pounds 266,000, with Pounds 750,000 from those discontinued).
Net interest charges were cut to Pounds 350,000 (Pounds 932,000) and there
were no exceptionals (Pounds 1.63m).
Earnings came to 2p (losses 18.6p).

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ADT acts over Britannia audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, yesterday issued a
writ against Binder Hamlyn alleging negligent statements in connection with
its Pounds 110m takeover of Britannia Security Group.
Mr David Hammond, ADT's deputy chairman, said: 'We have started proceedings
against Binder Hamlyn, Britannia's auditors, alleging negligent
misrepresentations in connection with our acquisition of Britannia.'
ADT alleges that at a meeting prior to the takeover in January 1990 Binder
Hamlyn said that Britannia's financial statement for the year to June 1989
was both true and fair. That statement, says ADT, contained 'material
inaccuracies'.
Its 1991 annual report reveals that a review of Britannia's businesses
showed that certain assets, particularly subscriber systems installed at
customer premises 'had been included in the consolidated financial
statements of Britannia at values materially in excess of their net
realisable value.'
This led to a Dollars 278m (Pounds 145.5m) goodwill write-off on the
acquisition which made ADT into Britain's second largest burglar alarm
company.
Binder Hamlyn said it could not comment since the partner who acted for
Britannia was away on holiday.

FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fyffes pays Pounds 48m for half share in
Swedish distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FYFFES, the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable distributor, has finally
secured a foothold in continental Europe by acquiring 50 per cent of Saba
Trading, a Swedish wholesale distributor with links into the Dutch, German
and Spanish markets, for SKr500m (Pounds 47.5m).
Ever since Fyffes' IPounds 60m (Pounds 56m) rights issue in June 1991, there
have been expectations of a strategic European acquisition which would give
it the strength to begin competing seriously with the other leading banana
and fruit distributors such as Chiquita and Dole.
Saba is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Axel Johnson, the Swedish trading
group, and the sale price marks a sharp reduction on the SKr4.1bn which Axel
Johnson paid to acquire the business from Carnegie in 1988. Saba currently
has turnover of Pounds 240m and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.4m in
the year to end-August.
As part of the deal, Fyffes has options to acquire, or may be obliged to
acquire, the remaining half share over a number of years.
In 1990, Axel Johnson entered into a co-operation agreement with Spar Handel
of Hamburg, the fifth biggest consumer goods conglomerate in Germany, under
which Saba took on responsibility for Spar's overseas import activities and
the purchase of tropical and exotic fruits through FTK, a Dutch subsidiary
of Spar in which Saba took a 50 per cent stake. Saba also has a 47.5 per
cent interest in Compania Fresa, a Spanish fruit and vegetable distributor.
These links raise the question of whether Fyffes will continue with its
interest in acquiring PPI Del Monte.
Mr Carl McCann, Fyffes finance director, said: 'If it's available and at the
right price then we are interested.'
However, for Fyffes to take control of PPI Del Monte it would probably
either require a partner, or a new rights issue, as the Saba deal will have
reduced its cash reserves to some Pounds 47m. PPI Del Monte is expected to
be valued in the Dollars 500m to Dollars 800m (Pounds 260m to Pounds 420m)
range.
Mr McCann played down the possibility of either option saying: 'Saba has
cash in it and we remain in a strong financial position even after the
acquisition'.
One market analyst in Dublin described the deal as 'a good strategic step
for Fyffes, even if the price being paid at 13 times historic earnings is a
bit high'.
He said that annual banana consumption in Sweden had doubled from 9kg to
18kg per head over the past ten years, making it one of the strongest
markets worldwide.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Dasa joins race for BAe's space business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE AEROSPACE (Dasa), a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest
industrial group, said yesterday it had joined the race to buy British
Aerospace's loss-making satellite business.
The news is a blow to GEC, whose joint venture with Matra of France,
Matra-Marconi, has been in talks with BAe since last year to acquire the
space division. BAe and Matra-Marconi are long-standing partners in the
space industry and their talks were close to completion.
It appears they planned to announce the joining of their space businesses at
the Farnborough air show in September. Senior executives at Matra-Marconi
said yesterday Dasa's entry had delayed its merger plans indefinitely.
'The timing does not now depend on us, it depends on British Aerospace,'
said Matra-Marconi. 'Dasa has made an offer, but we don't know what the
decision is.'
British Aerospace confirmed it was in talks over the future of its space
business but would not say with whom. It said the unit was not up for sale,
but it wanted a partnership or joint venture.
However, Dasa said: 'British Aerospace is selling the division entirely. We
are looking at what they have to offer.'
BAe makes satellites, their components and ground control equipment, but the
operation is small by world standards. BAe does not reveal sales figures for
its space business, but Dasa put the figure at about Pounds 150m a year.
It has received no new satellite orders since last year and last month it
halved its satellite-making capacity with the loss of up to 640 jobs. It
blamed the loss of an order for a Japanese satellite.
But, it emerged yesterday, the industry interpreted that move as preparing
the company for disposal. By cutting costs, the business would be more
attractive to a potential partner or buyer.
If Dasa secured the BAe arm, it would probably merge it with Space
Systems/Loral of the US, in which it has a 12 per cent stake.
Dasa paid Pounds 57m for the Space Systems/Loral stake last month to join
other European shareholders Alcatel and Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of
Italy. The company is controlled by Loral, the US defence contractor.
Dasa is also considering the future of the space activities of Fokker, the
Dutch aircraft maker it agreed to take control of last week. Fokker makes
control and power equipment for satellites, but the business is small,
Fokker said yesterday.
BAe faces increasing competition in a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) a year
industry dominated by US suppliers.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Richmond flotation questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in Richmond Oil and Gas, which has seen its shares plummet from a
peak of 173p to last night's 6p, may have been misled in the weeks following
the company's 1989 flotation, according to a preliminary report compiled by
Price Waterhouse.
The report, commissioned by authorities in Jersey pursuing a local
complaint, has sparked a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the
company's share dealings.
In the course of its investigation, Price Waterhouse has discovered what
appears to be evidence of a 'circle of funds'. The accountancy firm suggests
this gave the impression that the sub-underwriting for Richmond's offer was
fully financed.
According to Price Waterhouse, various amounts of money totalling Pounds 16m
were pumped repeatedly around the circle via three bank accounts in the 10
days after the July 10 closing date for the flotation. The circle appears to
have been 'kick-started' with funds from client accounts at Bryant &amp; Co, a
Jersey accountant.
Richmond came to the market at 105p in July 1989, with a market
capitalisation of Pounds 68m. Only 12.2 per cent of the shares were taken
up, however, amid concerns about the valuations of some reserves and the
company's lack of a trading record. Shares closed at 62p on the first day.
Two weeks later, the shares began a climb to peak at 173p in June 1990. They
then began a virtually unbroken decline.
Richmond retains few of the assets it had at flotation. Creditors foreclosed
on the main remaining property, the Johnson Ranch, last month. The company
is now focusing on two joint ventures - one in Siberia and the other on
Apache lands in the US.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Taking a leaf out of book-building: Sale's success owed much
to method of judging demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global sale of shares in Wellcome must be considered a success, even a
remarkable one.
For Wellcome Trust to raise Pounds 2.1bn when the London market has fallen
13 per cent and the Japanese market 18 per cent over the past three months,
is a notable achievement. The value of the Wellcome shares sold to the US
alone exceeds Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) putting it among the top 10 share
offerings recorded there.
It is undoubtedly the case that a Pounds 2bn-plus issue - the largest
non-privatisation share sale ever - could not have been done using a
traditional UK format. Three weeks ago a Pounds 2bn deal could not have been
underwritten, or at least not at a price approaching the 800p finally set.
Institutions will never forget the disaster of the Pounds 7.2bn BP sale in
1987, where the price was fixed and sub-underwriters signed up two working
days before the stock market crash.
The Wellcome sale is thus also a triumph for the book-building method used
to determine the level of demand for the shares at various prices.
Formal book-building has been in common use outside the UK and practised
informally in London, but it only made its UK debut in the Pounds 5.4bn BT
sale last December when the government sold its remaining 49 per cent stake
in the company.
Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, the bank
which ran the global tender offer, said the success of the book-building
method was not limited to a bull market - it proved an even better tool in a
poor market.
Every day the bank could see how the selling efforts were proceeding and act
accordingly. For example, on Thursday last week, the day before the tender
closed, the deal was under great pressure. The trust announced it would not
sell shares below 800p, a move which focused investors' minds on where to
pitch their bids.
In the end Fleming's computer could draw a price/demand curve showing how
many shares could be sold at various levels. That enabled the trust to
decide whether to sell fewer shares at a higher price or more at a lower
one.
The sale took book-building on from the BT sale. In that issue, two-thirds
of the shares were sold to retail investors through a relatively normal
offer for sale, although the price was set by the institutional tender.
Fleming prepared a level playing field across the world, with near total
flexibility on how shares could be allocated to different syndicates.
While the UK and US syndicates found more than enough demand to reach their
provisional allotments, interest in some areas was weak. In the end less
than 1m shares were sold into Canada, while Germany and France also produced
a lower than expected response.
Critics may carp that the trust had originally hoped to raise Pounds 4bn or
more by reducing its stake in the pharmaceutical company to 25 per cent and
that the outcome therefore represents a flop.
However, Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the trust, said the trust never said it
would sell the full amount possible, only that it wanted to cut its stake to
below 50 per cent. It has achieved that, reducing its holding to 42 per
cent.
In June the size of the sale was indicated at 330m. To the extent that only
270m shares have been sold, the outcome is worse than hoped. There were bids
for 360m shares, even though the possibility at lunchtime on Friday of
hostilities breaking out in Iraq put a damper on the final day, Mr Gibbs
believes.
The price of 800p is a disappointment. 'Of course we would have liked to
have got a higher price. But in these markets it was not practicable,' said
Mr Gibbs.
And, he points out, since the trust sold its first 25 per cent tranche in
1986 at 120p the company's share price has exceeded 800p for only the past
eight months. When the share price reached its high early this year the
historic p/e ratio was approaching an exaggerated 40. On these measures, the
sale price is still a good one.
But for the market's fall over the last week of the tender period, Mr Gibbs
reckons the issue price could have been 30p higher. And without the
activities of short sellers - who drove the price down and profited by
buying back at lower levels - another 30p could have been added.
Mr Gibbs is generous in his praise of the banks and brokers who worked on
the sale. Eyebrows were raised when Fleming was first appointed to run the
sale. 'Fleming was considered to be a most extraordinary choice,' admitted
Mr Gibbs. He said Fleming handled the Wellcome flotation in 1986 well, and
had con-tinued to advise the trust thereafter.
When it decided to sell another tranche of shares, Mr Gibbs said, the trust
drew up a list of 15 to 20 possibles. The trustees decided it would appoint
Fleming when the bank convinced them it could handle the book-building
exercise.
Fleming, which in terms of its profits is one of the top UK merchant banks,
believes its lack of a high profile in international equity issues turned
out to be a strength. It could bring banks into the nine regional syndicates
without the usual jealousies.
Mr Ian Hannam, the man who Fleming appointed to head the book-building team,
said Fleming could take a tough line with syndicate members where necessary
because it was not looking for repeat business. But after the success of the
Wellcome issue it may find it gets more to do anyway.

FT  28 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Pibs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appetite of UK institutional investors for undated, fixed interest
securities has proved astonishing. Building societies alone have raised over
Pounds 500m by issuing permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) since this
new form of regulatory capital was legislated into existence last June. Add
issues of undated preference shares by the likes of NatWest, Barings and
Commercial Union, and the UK financial sector has raised close to Pounds 1bn
in permanent capital over the last year.
This prodigious rate is unlikely to be sustained. Among the big building
societies, only Nationwide is still hovering. Sterling asset growth for both
banks and building societies remains stunted by recession. Moreover,
experience of illiquidity with other irredeemable instruments - such as
subordinated floating rate notes issued by banks in the mid-1980s - should
prove cautionary. Enough fund managers remain circumspect about the
liquidity of Pibs and undated preference shares to place a natural limit on
the capacity of the market. While retail appetite for income bonds has
worked to the benefit of building societies as well as the government's
national savings scheme, it is not sufficient to support the Pibs market on
its own.
In retrospect, it is clear that the birth of the Pibs market coincided with
a shift in institutional attitudes towards fixed interest securities. Few UK
life companies are likely to match the 60 per cent weighting to sterling
bonds now claimed by Scottish Amicable, but institutional inflows are
certainly being channelled towards bonds. If this allows the UK financial
system to top up on capital without recourse to the equity market, so much
the better.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The really depressing thing about yesterday's fall in UK equities is that it
happened in isolation. In the previous week or so, London had responded
along with other European bourses to anxiety about German interest rates.
But yesterday continental equities went up, sterling opened stronger against
the D-Mark and UK money market rates fell back. In addition, the Bank of
Japan did its best by cutting the discount rate. The Wellcome issue was at
least a qualified success and Wall Street opened higher. The FT-SE duly lost
29 points on the day.
The only rational explanation is that investors have become terminally
gloomy about the UK corporate sector itself. Of the 100 stocks in the FT-SE,
17 now yield over 8 per cent, a level at which the security of the payment
is being seriously questioned. The list covers oil, steel, food, building
materials, aerospace, hotels, shipping, retailing, banking and insurance.
All the companies involved are by definition big and relatively successful.
There are, for example, no construction companies on the list. This is
because there are no construction companies left in the FT-SE.
Today's quarterly survey from the Confederation of British Industry will
scarcely lighten the mood. Then again, there is no obvious reason why it
should worsen it. Not only was the survey heavily trailed over the weekend.
It also appears only to repeat what the market knew already - that
manufacturing industry, like the rest of the economy, has quite abandoned
its fit of cheerfulness at the time of the election. The market now faces
another hurdle in the form of the results season, starting this week with
the banks and ICI. If the news is not in the price already, it must be bad
indeed.

For Wellcome shares to hold the issue price on the first day must be
reckoned reasonable going, even allowing for a degree of support from the
trust's advisers. The question is how long the trick can be sustained. On
the one hand, 800p must be regarded as the natural short-term level, having
been arrived at through lengthy haggling with every conceivable buyer. But
if the market moves decisively lower, holders may well reflect that since
the advisers cannot support the 800p level for ever, it might be as well to
beat the rush. Then again, a rise above 800p would soon run into unloading
of loose stock. But fundamentally, Wellcome cannot be that expensive.
Unusually, its forward multiple is now lower than Glaxo's.

FT  28 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Too little, too late
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese authorities have fallen into a classic trap facing governments
in their dealings with financial markets. Having raised false expectations
ahead of last Friday's emergency government meeting on the equity market,
they belatedly cut the discount rate to offset that disappointment. Had the
action come out of the blue it would have stood a better chance of
stabilising the market. Instead, it looked like a reluctant afterthought.
The Nikkei duly fell 1 per cent to another six-year low. It could have some
way further to fall before the authorities are ready to launch the more
vigorous support which investors demand.
The Japanese market is in a rather different situation from Wall Street's
last December, when the Fed rate cut prompted a stampede into equities. The
outlook for corporate earnings is bleaker, equities yield little more than 1
per cent and short-term money market rates are 4 per cent. Much lower
interest rates will be needed to restore confidence in the financial sector.
The government may even have to take on some of the burden of bad debts,
especially in the housing market.
Unfortunately, the yen has begun to fall in anticipation of yet lower
interest rates. This may be counterproductive for equities because it will
further weaken bank capital ratios and may well worsen protectionist
pressure against Japanese companies ahead of the US election. But continued
Bank of Japan intervention in support of the yen suggests ambivalence over
further interest rate cuts. A more serious mood of alarm may be necessary to
goad it into decisive action.
The message for the outside world is twofold. There is still plenty of room
for a little local difficulty in Japan to spill into the international
arena. But the Nikkei may be so low once corrective action is finally taken
that it will then rebound strongly, especially if Japanese companies have
also begun to understand that profit matters more than market share.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Congress calls for changes to Nafta pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress will block the North American Free Trade Agreement unless
fundamental amendments are made to it to protect US jobs and the
environment, Democratic Congressman Richard Gephardt, the US House majority
leader warned yesterday.
Mr Gephardt's speech to the Institute of International Economics in
Washington may scupper one of the vote-winning initiatives left to President
George Bush, who is trailing Mr Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential
candidate, in opinion polls.
Mr Gephardt said Nafta negotiators 'can and must do better'. The pact could
become an 'engine of growth' but only if 'properly drafted'. He called for a
bilateral commission to clean up the environment on the US-Mexico border and
a cross-border tax to finance it.
Mr Clinton was expected last night to echo Mr Gephardt's comments. Mr
Clinton has previously said that he would only support a Nafta that
safeguarded jobs, the environment and Mexican labour rights. He has also
stressed his support for open world trading system.
The attacks on Nafta come as trade ministers from the US, Mexico and Canada,
who met in Mexico at the weekend, reported progress on a number of fronts
and appeared close to completing a final draft text.
Negotiators have worked hard in recent months to conclude an agreement which
could be submitted to Congress this year.
Mr Gephardt argued that uncontrolled free trade was part of the past and
that environmental and labour concerns could not be divorced from trade
agreements.
He frequently referred to European Community practices on regional subsidies
and worker compensation as providing a model for future US policy.
He said the current agreement was 'a lose-lose situation', failing to stem
either the flow of jobs to Mexico or a returning flood of cheaply produced
goods to the US.
Mr Gephardt detailed the environmental degradation and devastating living
conditions resulting from industrialisation along the US-Mexico border. He
insisted that a properly drafted agreement could create jobs on both sides
of the border and improve living conditions in the area.
Congress last year voted to give the Bush Administration 'fast-track'
negotiating authority for the Nafta - meaning the pact could not be amended
as it goes through the House and Senate.
However, Mr Gephardt has argued that a simple vote in the House could change
the fast-track rule to allow amendments, because the administration has
reneged on commitments to protect jobs and the environment.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Need for dose of realism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M WHITEWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ernst &amp; Young's survey, 'Managing in a zero growth economy', appears to
highlight a fatal flaw in business strategy, often replicated by the
government of the day; that of over-optimism ('Owner-managers' optimism
faulted', July 22). Lord Hanson's and Lord White's philosophy of judging the
suitability of an acquisition by assessing the downside risk rather than the
potential benefit has much to commend it.
What we need in the UK is a large dose of realism. Until living standards
are more closely related to achievable gross national product we will
continue to experience economic woes. Clearly we must strive for a fairer
society but this must be based on the foundation of living within our means.
What we most need is a return to commonsense pay levels, property values,
interest rates and the like which are determined by the UK's economic
standing vis a vis that of other countries.
I find it ironic that so many businesses attribute their problems to high
interest rates. High labour costs, low productivity and the cost of
servicing loans obtained for questionable commercial ventures (often secured
against inflated property values) are must more significant.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Personal View: Speaking up for Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KENEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the peoples and parliaments of Europe say no to monetary union, the
architects of Emu will have themselves to blame. Caught up in seeking to
understand how monetary union could be made to work, they ceased to ask why
one should want it to work.
The mistake was made early on, when the Hanover Summit asked the Delors
Committee to propose 'concrete stages' that could lead to Emu rather than
provide a rationale. It was compounded by the Commission, which produced a
cost-benefit analysis of Emu, titled One Market, One Money, but declined to
claim that the benefits would exceed the costs. The title was as close as
the study came to making a case for Emu.
The Commission's argument for Emu - that one market requires one money  - is
sound, but the missing steps have to be added. Forming one market and
managing one money are utterly different. One market meant deregulation. It
did not worry those opposed to strengthening EC institutions and creating
new ones. One money goes in the opposite direction. New institutions are
needed.
Nevertheless, the single market requires one money, because it requires
fixed exchange rates. Floating exchange rates do not prevent free trade or
free movements of capital and labour. But they would interfere with the EC's
more ambitious forms of integration, including the gradual harmonisation of
fiscal systems. When exchange rates are firmly fixed, moreover, and capital
is highly mobile, monetary autonomy vanishes. Europe must, therefore, decide
who should make monetary policy - the Bundesbank under the EMS, or the
European Central Bank under Emu.
That question is often misunderstood. It does not ask whether Europe's
policy objectives should differ from those of the Bundesbank, and the ECB
Statute is clear on that point. The ECB will pursue price stability, just
like the Bundesbank. But it will pursue price stability in Europe, which is
different from pursuing price stability in Germany.
This distinction is illustrated by the events of the past three years. The
European economy would be healthier if the D-Mark had been allowed to
appreciate in real terms after reunification. But France resisted the
realignment of nominal exchange rates, and the Bundesbank resisted the
realignment of national price levels - the two ways to make the D-Mark
appreciate in real terms.
The Bundesbank had no choice. It is obliged to resist any increase in German
prices. In the process, however, it has punished the European economy for
the deficiencies of German fiscal policy and the ambitions of German trades
unions.
If the ECB had been up and running, it would have been required to maintain
price stability in Europe as a whole but not in each individual country.
Hence, it would have been more tolerant of higher German prices and allowed
the realignment of price levels to occur automatically.
The president of the Bundesbank, worried about Germany, might have urged the
governing council of the ECB to adopt a tighter policy but would have been
out-voted.
Is this fantasy? Far from it. The Bundesbank does not aim at price stability
in Bavaria or the Federal Reserve at price stability in Texas. A European
monetary policy would not differ in nature from German monetary policy but
would differ in domain and thus allow relative prices to contribute to
macroeconomic adjustment.
Economists are fond of warning that Europe is not an 'optimum currency
area'. There is not enough labour mobility, and the EC does not have a
fiscal system required to make income-stabilising transfers. But that is why
price flexibility matters. The EMS resists it; Emu would accommodate it.
Seeking agreement at Maastricht, however, the architects of Emu made
mistakes that must be corrected.
For Emu to function more effectively than the EMS, the ECB must be able to
make monetary policy for the entire Community, not for the small number of
countries that can meet absurdly stringent convergence criteria by 1999.
Otherwise, Emu will replicate the asymmetry and rigidity of the EMS, with
the ECB pursuing price stability in northern Europe, and central banks in
southern Europe having to follow it, just as they must mimic the Bundesbank
now.
The compromise struck at Maastricht - between the French demand for
automaticity and the German demand for limited eligibility - is inconsistent
with the rationale for Emu.
A strong case can be made for reducing inflation rates and cutting budget
deficits before moving on to Emu. Concerns about the impact on the world
economy are greatly exaggerated. Those who have them, moreover, should ask
themselves what they would recommend to Italy or Greece, with or without
Emu.
Nevertheless, countries having high debt levels, such as Belgium, Ireland,
and Italy, cannot be expected to reduce them sharply in the few years
remaining before the EC must decide which countries can participate in Emu;
it may indeed be difficult for them to show that their debt levels are
falling 'sufficiently' and approaching the arbitrary target level at a
'satisfactory' pace without depriving these terms of any meaning.
Europe also needs a coherent fiscal policy. The rules adopted at Maastricht
are aimed exclusively at protecting the ECB from the political and market
pressures resulting from large national deficits and debts. They cannot be
expected to produce an appropriate fiscal stance for Europe - an objective
that was emphasised by the Delors report but ignored at Maastricht.
Other matters give rise to concern - the narrow scope for ECB involvement in
prudential supervision, the ambiguous division of responsibility for
exchange-rate policy, and the operational inefficiencies likely to arise
from the requirement that the national central banks should be used whenever
'possible and appropriate' to conduct the open-market and credit operations
of the ECB. These were concessions to jurisdictional jealousies - to
national governments in the first two cases and to national central banks in
the third. But that explains them. It does not justify them.
These defects can be corrected, however, after the treaty is ratified.
Little time is left for the architects of Emu to explain that Europe can
live more comfortably with Emu than with the EMS.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Jubilee Line will meet interests of Londoners and
taxpayers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER W CORFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Transport in Docklands' (July 22), correctly identified
the various components of this complex matter and needlessly lengthy debate.
However, in suggesting that the government should conduct a cost benefit
analysis you are clearly unaware that such an assessment was conducted, in
considerable depth, and forms the basis for the Jubilee Line Extension
Project. Of significance, one of the major benefits was seen to be the
transfer of excess passenger traffic from the Central, District and Circle
Lines to the Jubilee Line to the advantage of east-west-east commuters.
The vexed question of a contribution to costs from the private sector is
surely beyond debate - to my knowledge there is no formal, legally binding
agreement between the two parties, although Olympia &amp; York clearly had every
intention of honouring its side of the bargain prior to its recent
misfortunes. This contrasts strongly with the arrangements for improving the
Docklands Light Railway - to which Olympia &amp; York contributed in cash and
kind more than Pounds 100m and got, in return, a system that until recently
was quite unreliable and which was completed two years later than agreed.
By investing in the Jubilee Line extension, the government will meet the
interests of people who live and work in London and will protect the
interests of taxpayers at large. A considerable loss of income to central
funds from the unified business rates in the Docklands area, ranging from
Pounds 72m to Pounds 190m per year, is the inevitable consequence of
cancellation.
By providing the Jubilee Line the government will also be recognising the
plight of the east and south-east London communities which, although
contributing magnificently to the wealth and status of London for centuries,
have been denied proper access to the work and entertainment centres of the
capital. Peter W Corfield,

FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Oversight on precise Emu date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER COFFEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, An oversight appears with alarming frequency in reports and articles in
your own and in other newspapers and magazines with regard to the final
stage of European Economic and Monetary Union (Emu).
One frequently reads that, according to the Treaty on European Union, which
was signed on February 7 1992, the third and final stage of Emu will begin
no later than 1999.
However, if we examine article 109j, stations 3 to 5 (inclusive) of the
treaty, we read that it is only if the date for the beginning of the final
phase has not been agreed upon by the end of 1997 that it shall start on
January 1 1999.
The ministers could, though, decide on July 1 2015, for example. Certainly,
if as at present, only two countries, France and Luxembourg, fulfilled the
strict criteria for economic conveyance and budgeting deficits - as laid
down in the relevant protocols - there would be little point in going on to
the final stage at any time this century.
There is unfortunately already a precedent for setting down dates for an
Emu. In 1970, the six founder member states of the European Economic
Community accepted the second and definitive Werner report, which aimed at
creating full European monetary union by 1980] Alas, we are all too
painfully aware of what happened to that attempt.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Letter: Pensions should provide for extreme old age needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DENIS CASSIDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Authers properly drew attention to 'The rising cost of a ripe old
age' (July 11).
The extreme end of that spectrum is the predicament of people who are old,
ie over 80, who are now dependent and yet who are not ill in a conventional
sense. In most cases the spouse has died, which has either caused or
exacerbated the problems of dependence. If they do not have substantial
private means, or a substantial occupational pension income, they are
obliged to sell their home - a difficult process in the past three years -
to release capital to fund residential fees.
Because of underlying changes in the residential housing market, it is
likely that these problems will persist for some time.
It is true that there are some private sector life and health insurers who
have launched 'long term care policies' but the problem with these is that
by the time need is recognised, they have become too expensive in most
cases.
There is therefore clearly a need for the requirements of old age to be
considered much earlier and I believe the process should start with
providing for the need now while simultaneously trying to educate people to
recognise the potential need for the longer term future. I believe that the
most obvious way to do this would be for occupational pension funds to
provide for the most extreme cases of need through pension fund benefits
which would be funded across the entire company membership.
In simple terms, providing for an exceptional occurrence by a modest funding
rate applied to the whole of the employee population in a way analogous to
that of providing for death in service. We should recognise that, although
the number of old people requiring care is increasing, it is still a small
number who survive beyond 80 and who require full time nursing care.
John Authers' article is a very helpful contribution to an overdue debate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you noticed how the pecking order in British banking has been reversed?
A year ago Barclays Bank was capitalised at Pounds 7.4bn on the stock
market, towering above the rest of the Big Four clearing banks. Its position
as one of the world's biggest and strongest banks was underscored by its
triple-A credit rating.
Now it is the smallest in terms of its stock market capitalisation at under
Pounds 5bn. Its value has fallen by a third over the past year.
The Hongkong Bank's takeover of Midland Bank has distorted the rankings, but
even so Lloyds Bank, whose balance sheet is less than half Barclays' size,
has leapfrogged it, and is now running neck and neck with NatWest, which
used to be Britain's biggest bank before it was knocked off its perch by an
aggressive Barclays.
For an institution that is two years older than the Bank of England and
prides itself on traditions of integrity and prudence inherited from its
Quaker founders, Barclays' recent fall from grace is a rather sad state of
affairs.
No doubt it will bounce back.

The hosts were all her surviving prime ministers (with the exception of Lord

the Royal Family and household.
For starters, where do you put the Prince and Princess of Wales, or Sir
Edward Heath and Lady Thatcher? And in these post-Maastricht days, would it

Sea bass and summer pudding were on the menu, but like all the best parties

Let's hope it was another diplomatic triumph for the prime minister.

Veteran cricket commentator Brian Johnston confessed to being stumped when
he discovered a radio station that seemed to be broadcasting nothing but
birdsong.
So during a lull in Sunday's Test Match special on Radio 3 he asked his
startled guest to throw some light on the mystery chorus.
The answer would hardly have provided a crumb of comfort; what Johnston had
stumbled across was the test transmissions for Classic FM - the national
classical music station to be launched in September and a deadly rival for
Radio 3.

Whatever may be thought of the old style Keynesianism of economist Wynne

him as a model for a work for the then newly rebuilt Coventry Cathedral,
entitled 'St Michael triumphing over the Devil'. So which one of the two is

'You'll be disappointed to hear it's not Old Nick,' chirps Cambridge's
professor of applied economics. 'I'm on the godly side as St Michael,
although only his face is mine. His body's an athlete who worked as a
quantity surveyor, whose own face was for some reason thought more fitting
for the devil.'
But Godley's features at least are cast in stone for all time?
'Well, bronze actually,' he says. 'But apart from that, I suppose so. Unless
the cathedral gets bombed again, at any rate.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One man who ought to have earned a mention in dispatches for his role in the
Wellcome share sale is 36-year-old Ian Hannam, the man responsible for
Robert Fleming's global book building team. Getting an issue of this size
away in current conditions would have tested the talents of the best
connected merchant bankers.
As it is, Hannam is one of Fleming's most recent recruits. The merchant bank
was lucky to catch him on the rebound from Salomon Brothers. There is a
suspicion that Fleming, whose capital markets team is good, but not that
good, wouldn't have landed the Wellcome plum had it not been for Hannam. He
joined for a month's consulting, but somehow just stayed.
Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust which was selling the shares,
says Hannam was 'utterly splendid'. He dedicated himself completely to the
sale over the past few weeks, although on his fourth wedding anniversary
last Thursday he did slip out for an hour to see his wife. But will he stay
once the loose ends of the deal are tied up?
While Hannam didn't look out of place in Fleming's orange and blue 'war
room', it is less easy to imagine him retreating into its rather dour
environment once the excitement has abated. But Lawrence Banks, Fleming's
corporate finance chief, is optimistic and says his bank has room for a few
oddballs.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Travel blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party's suggestion that the government consider compensating
those who lost money in last week's collapse of the Land Travel coach
company will receive little sympathy from the majority who take the trouble
and can afford the expense to book their holidays through better-protected
organisations.
Most holidays are sold through companies affiliated to the Association of
British Travel Agents (Abta) or other trade associations, which offer a high
level of protection to customers. Land Travel, which was not an Abta member,
was an exception.
The government insists its proposed regulations will ensure that from the
beginning of next year, all purchasers of package holidays will be as well
protected as the majority are today. In their current form, however, the
proposed regulations are unlikely to prevent future Land Travels.
The aim is to implement a European Community directive due to take effect at
the beginning of 1993. This stipulates that travel companies make
arrangements to ensure holiday makers receive compensation and can return
home if their company collapses.
The directive will not require changes to be made to the sale of air charter
holidays, since UK providers of these already have to be licensed and
arrange bonds to protect their customers. The bonds are backed by the Air
Travel Trust Fund, set up in the 1970s through a levy on holidays and
shortly to be topped up via the same mechanism.
Travel by land and sea presented the government with a more complex
challenge. Many providers of non-air package holidays are small companies; a
hotel in Scotland which also offers golf is a provider of package holidays.
It would be expensive and impractical, the government says, to license all
of these.
Abta suggested the government distinguish between holidays abroad and at
home. All companies taking travellers out of the UK should be licensed and
bonded, Abta said. A surface travel fund should be set up along the lines of
the air travel fund.
The government has now agreed to the establishment of such a fund, but
membership will be voluntary. Surface travel companies which remain outside
the fund will have to make arrangements to protect their customers. Trading
standards officers will check they have done so, but it will be difficult
for them to know whether arrangements are adequate, and there will be no
reserve fund to back them up if a company fails.
The government has reason to resist yet more molly-coddling of package
tourists. Why, after all, should package holiday makers be better protected
than those who buy pensions? But if the government is going to regulate
holidays - and the EC directive gives it no choice - surely it is better to
have a simple, universal system for holidays abroad of the kind Abta has
recommended. At least that would be effective.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Arts: The US consummates a romance with Monet - The opening
of a US-inspired museum in Monet's beloved garden at Giverny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA DEITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A recent summer day in the French village of Giverny, the old stone
houses along the rue Claude Monet were draped in banners that read:
'Parkings Exterieurs; Vie Meilleure.' No students' or farmers' protest this,
but a village at war with its fame and the tourists' cars which residents
would like to restrict to areas away from the narrow streets in order to
maintain their quality of life.
The occasion of the protest was the opening of the Musee Americain, a small
museum on the rue Claude Monet devoted primarily to American Impressionist
painters. But the roots of it go back to that day in 1883 when Monet saw -
fleetingly from a train - the property in Normandy he made famous as his
home in this village along the Epte, a tributary of the Seine, 45 miles
north west of Paris.
Soon after, Giverny became a mecca for those American artists who sought to
treat art as Monet did, in Paul Valery's words, as 'the eye's most delicate
reactions to light.' Influential among the strong Boston contingent that
arrived after studying in Paris was the artist Lilla Cabot Perry, who lived
in the house next door to Monet, whom she befriended during her sojourns
there. She also maintained small studios for her friends, and at one time
more than half the houses in Giverny were occupied by US artists.
In a sense, this American romance with Giverny has never abated, for when
the time came in the 1970s to restore Monet's house and the water garden
that inspired his water-lily paintings, the job was largely done with
American funds. Successful as was this restoration, the village has been
overrun ever since by tour buses. Still, the magic is there for Chicago art
collector Ambassador Daniel J. Terra and his wife, Judith, who found out in
1986 that the Perry house was for sale. They purchased it with the notion,
which later proved impractical, of creating a small gallery for the American
Impressionist paintings in their collection.
They developed instead the idea of building an American Museum in the
village to commemorate that period of cross-pollination. On the eve of the
opening of their Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago in 1987, they
purchased a site on the rue Claude Monet, formerly the haystack fields of
Monet's paintings. (A Reagan cultural affairs ambassador, Daniel Terra's
invention in 1936 of ultra-rapid drying ink transformed the magazine world
and led to his financial success.)
After many long meetings with the mayor of Giverny and the village council,
the architecture for the museum came about almost by accident. The main
concern of the Terras was to return American canvases painted in Giverny to
the natural light there. Rural though the site is, it shares the same street
with the mairie and the church and is in close proximity with village
houses. French architect Philippe Robert of Reichen &amp; Robert found a
solution by doodling a design based on the stepped terraces that cascade
down the hillside village. The result is a quiet architecture, more a
conversation with the landscape than a statement in it.
Inside, the galleries are like three enclosed terraces descending a steep
slope, and the light that enters through north clerestories is reflected off
exterior stone walls and diffused into the galleries across inclined
ceilings. Periodically, glass walls overlook wheat fields with poppies.
Without resorting to the vernacular, Robert has been careful to preserve the
character of the village with a series of low limestone rectangular
buildings that almost disappear under flat rooftop terraces planted in
heather. (Some 70 per cent of the structure is actually underground.)
One of the prettiest parts of the whole project is the parking lot for 250
vehicles, a lush green field planted with fruit trees that is
indistinguishable from any orchard on a local farm. For the gardens that
front the museum on the village street, pains had to be taken to make them
attractive without duplicating either the flower borders and trellises of
the Monet garden across the road or the landscape paintings on view. Here
again, Mark Rudkin, an American landscape gardener who lives in France,
appears to have drawn inspiration from the small front gardens of the
village houses across the way.
For the opening exhibition 'Lasting Impressions: American Painters in
France, 1865-1915' (until November 1), the curator has gone to great pains
to convey the Giverny experience both in terms of artists and range of
styles by securing loans to complement the Terras' collection. The 90 works
on view represent 40 artists. Not since the late 1880s and 1890s at the St.
Botolph Club in Boston have so many of these canvases been shown together.
In the first two galleries are paintings from the early and late periods in
Giverny; and in the third, works by compatriots living elsewhere in France
including Brittany and Paris.
The one painting that speaks for the whole period is Theodore Robinson's
'The Wedding March' (1892), which celebrates from memory the ceremonial walk
from the mairie to the village church for the marriage a few weeks earlier
of Monet's stepdaughter to the American artist Theodore Butler (father and
bride lead off the wedding party.) Robinson wrote in his diary, according to
the catalogue, that his only model was the groom's silk hat, but what he had
learned about light, colour and brushwork can be summed up in the fragile
transparency of the bride's veil.
Although there are paintings of Giverny gardens and of haystacks in changing
light, some of the strongest works in the show, by among others Willard
Leroy Metcalf and Theodore Wendel, have as their subjects the River Epte and
the streams and brooks eddying around the village through green fields with
pollarded trees. When they returned to America, the artists brought this
same sensibility to New England scenes: Wendel's 'Bridge at Ipswich' (ca.
1905) could almost be Giverny if not for the architecture of the
neighbouring houses.
Three oil sketches and a study by John Singer Sargent for 'Oyster Gatherers
of Cancale' (1878), united in the show with the finished painting, offer
rare documentation of how he developed his fluid brushwork and muted
palette. With Childe Hassam's 'French Peasant Girl,' Mary Cassatt's prints
influenced by the Japanese style and Maurice Prendergast's view of the
Tuileries Garden (that predates his Boston Public Garden Sketchbook), the
viewer is introduced to a wide spectrum of American art, albeit as practiced
abroad.
As a showcase for American art, the museum plans to broaden its programme to
include exhibitions, for example, of early abstract paintings by such
modernists as Arthur Dove. Otherwise, as an attraction with good public
facilities, it could be that the Musee Americain will disperse the
concentration of visitors to Monet's garden over a wider area and decrease
congestion in the village. Judging by the still tranquil stretch between the
mairie and the village church, the essence of Giverny has been preserved.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Arts: The Kirov in New York - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK may well be the world's worst place for watching the Kirov Ballet.
It only stays at the Met for three or (this year) two weeks, uses a local
orchestra, and arrives at the end of a big North American tour. London, by
contrast, had six weeks of the Kirov in 1990; and Paris, whose Palais des
Congres has presented the company for several eight-week seasons and with a
Kirov orchestra, is luckier yet. In Paris the company is also not obliged to
squeeze ballets into a three-hour time limit. This year, however, New York
is not the Kirov's only problem.
For 30 years, the Petersburg company has thrived on exalted mystique. It
used to tour far less than the Muscovite Bolshoi, and therefore had rarity
appeal. Though no one has ever been able to claim seriously that the Kirov
was a shrine of spontaneity, ingratiating manners, keen musicality or sheer
generosity of spirit, its advocates have remained hooked on its pure
classical style. But, during the ten years I have been watching it, the
Kirov has been touring more and more extensively and has shown unmistakeable
signs of decadence. And evidence suggests that some of the decadence began
long ago.
How pure is any classical dance style that is not attentive to musical
detail? Numerous Petersburg dancers - notably (by all accounts) Olga
Spessivtseva in the 1920s and 1930s and (in vivid memory) Natalia Makarova
in the 1970s - have appalled Western audiences with their indifference to a
musical phrase or beat. Watching current Kirov dancers in recent years, we
have been able to see that they have been encouraged to grow ever less
responsive to the score (and also to dictate ever slower tempi). Is this
part of the great tradition? Well, as Mahler told the Viennese: 'What you
people call tradition is mere slovenliness.'
And how truly classical is a style that leads its dancers away from true
vertical stance? In the last ten years, more and more Kirov dancers have
shown a deep, gymnast-like curve in the lower spine. The pelvis, instead of
being held vertical and fluently conjoined with the waist, is pulled back at
an angle, exaggerating the divide between 'upper' and 'lower' halves of the
body. Londoners should remember this at its most ludicrous with the
narcissistic Farouk Ruzimatov; but it is present too with most Kirov women
of a certain experience - notably the otherwise bulldog-like prima Olga
Chenchikova.
Oleg Vinogradov, the Kirov's artistic director, has given the company a new
production of Swan Lake. Perversely, it has scrapped most of the features
that distinguished the old production great (eg the Tutor in Act One), and
has kept every feature - especially the post-Imperial accretions - that
blighted it (eg the Jester). His new version of the final act, to a bizarre
mish-mash of music, has opposed corps of black and white swans. One dance
began with the whites hitting the upbeat and the blacks hitting the downbeat
 -as if 'you say potato, I say potahto' had reached Swan Lake.
Vinogradov has also staged his own recension of the original Kirov staging
of the Lavrovsky Romeo and Juliet - the version that, with the Bolshoi and
Galina Ulanova, conquered the West in the 1950s. It still shows the dramatic
point of some details of Prokoviev's score but this Romeo, even more than
others, needs thoroughly verismo acting and surging vitality of performance.
The 1950s Bolshoi (as film shows) had that; the 1992 Kirov does not. The
best feature was the ravishing original designs, recreating in scene after
scene the beauty of the Italian Renaissance.
The company's best full-length show was La Bayadere, even though it often
did not feel much like a ballet. The production's big thrill is its old
turn-of-the-century painted scenery, handsomely restored. Then there is the
absorbing oddity of Kirov mime - rigorously eliminated from the company's
Swan Lake these several decades - here deplayed with massive silent-movie
weight. But there is also the depressing spectacle of Kirov dancing at its
worst - stuffy, effortful and posey. The legendary corps de ballet, in one
of its off periods, exemplified this.
For just one performance only the company presented a triple bill of Western
choreography - a sequel to the now-famous pair of Balanchine ballets the
company presented on its Western tours of 1989 and 1990. These three
amounted to much less. Antony Tudor's The Leaves are Fading challenged the
dancers to show a brand of lyrical, light spontaneity that as yet eludes
them; Jerome Robbins's In the Night prompts them to use the kind of slow,
heavy, solemn Romanticism they already overdo.
Best was Balanchine's Apollo - flawed but alive. This Apollo, not the
shortened 'Pollo that Balanchine staged in his last years, gave New York its
first view of the old prologue and apotheosis for 17 years - a more
satisfying text of the century's most influential ballet. Igor Zelensky, the
young stone-faced tough who danced the protagonist and who gave the season's
strongest male dancing, joins New York City Ballet later this year.
The Kirov still has a number of real dancers; but just now it is not the
best place for them to be. Too many of them, like the young Yulia Makhalina
(Terpsichore in Apollo and first-cast ballerina in Swan Lake and La
Bayadere), show outstanding physical talent that has been educated away from
its truest dance instincts.

FT  28 JUL 92 / People: Saxon Riley fills the gap left by Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sedgwick Group, one of the world's largest insurance brokers, has moved
quickly to fill the void created by David Rowland's decision to take on the
chairmanship of Lloyd's. Saxon Riley, 53, the group managing director, has
taken over as chief executive; a new chairman will be appointed by the end
of the year.
The elevation of Lancastrian Sax Riley is not a surprise. Since joining the
firm in 1964 from Scholfields, a Manchester insurance broker, he has moved
steadily up the organisation. The first signal that he was the heir apparent
came in January when he was promoted to his current job and given
responsibility for the group's insurance, reinsurance broking and risk
services.
However, Rowland's departure is still a blow for Sedgwick. He was brought in
as chief executive in 1988 from rival Willis Faber, following mounting
concern about Sedgwick's poor results. It was the first time that the
company had gone outside for a new chief and Rowland, 59, is credited with
knocking into shape a broker which had grown rapidly through acquisition.
A year after he arrived, Rowland also added the role of chairman; he
replaced Carel Mosselmans who had headed the group for five years. Until
yesterday's news it had been expected that Rowland would stay till 1995.
Sedgwick has chosen to use the occasion of his departure to split the role
of chairman and chief executive. A number of well known city figures on the
board who might fill the spot include Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of
Smith New Court, and Rupert Hambro, chairman of J O Hambro Magan.
Meanwhile, Sedgwick also announced yesterday that Rob White-Cooper, 49, had
been appointed a vice-chairman. He is chairman of the operations group
responsible for co-ordinating the worldwide activities of Sedgwick James and
is responsible for the European, overseas and Asia Pacific regions of that
company.

FT  28 JUL 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Court ruling vindicates role of the
European Parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a case of fundamental importance for the institutional balance of power
in the European Community, the European Court of Justice has overturned a
1989 regulation of the European Council of Ministers on road transport
cabotage.
The European Court annulled the regulation because the Council had infringed
essential procedural requirements laid down by the Rome Treaty's transport
rules. The Court ruled that the Council had failed to consult the European
Parliament a second time, as required by the legislative procedure, when the
initial proposal was substantially modified by the European Commission.
The modified proposal adopted by the Council provides for even less
liberalisation of road haulage operations within member countries than the
text criticised by the Parliament when it was originally consulted.
However, the Court said that the 1989 regulation, which expires at the end
of 1992, should remain in force until a new regulation is adopted after
proper consultation.
This is a landmark decision in the growth of business influence over EC
legislation through the European Parliament.
First, the decision is a test case giving guidance as to when the Parliament
may insist on second consultation.
Second, the Parliament, as in the present case, may insist that the Council
consults it again when the proposal initially considered has been
substantially modified.
Third, any further consultation will enable the Parliament to insist on its
opinion influencing the legislative process, as it retains its existing
powers to postpone giving an opinion.
However, a potential limitation of the judgment's impact on future
legislation lies in the Court's application of its powers to declare that a
void regulation remains in force.
Case C-65, European Parliament v Council, ECJ FC, July 16.
Use of evidence in competition proceedings restricted
In a reassuring judgment for business and professional advisers, the
European Court held that national competition authorities may not use as
evidence in their own investigations information given to the EC Commission
in the course of EC competition procedures.
The Court said the use of such evidence would infringe EC rules guaranteeing
confidentiality of business secrets, the restricted use of information
obtained for specific investigative purposes and the rights of defence.
The case concerned the investigation by Spanish competition authorities of
certain business practices of Spanish banks. The banks had also notified
their arrangements to the EC Commission for clearance or exemption under the
EC competition rules. Notification provides immunity from fines for any
prior infringements.
The banks had also provided information to the Commission in response to
formal requests. Member countries are given copies by the Commission of all
important documents provided in the course of notification, information
requests or inspection visits to the business premises concerned.
The Court's decision, which is also likely to be relevant in the context of
mergers, may complicate competition law enforcement by member countries.
However, it does not prevent the national authorities commencing their own
investigation, as a result of the knowledge gained from evidence given to
the Commission, and obtaining their own evidence of possible infringements.
A similar approach has been taken by the Court to the Commission's use of
information obtained in one proceeding as evidence in another proceeding
involving the same parties.
Case C-67/91, Direccion General de Defensa de la Competenza v Asociacion
Espanola de Banca Privada (AEB) and others, ECJ FC, July 16 1992.
European Court lays down the law to national judges
In two cases decided on the same day, the judges of the European Court
rejected EC law questions referred for their interpretation by national
courts.
The first, from Germany, concerned eight questions on the second company law
directive on the structure and capital of companies. The Court declared the
questions outside its competence since they were hypothetical with no real
connection to any dispute.
Neither party to the national proceedings disputed that the relevant German
company law provisions were in conflict with the second directive. The only
issue was whether the plaintiff's argument that those German provisions
applied was correct.
Case C-83/91, Wienand Meilicke v ADV/ORGA F A Meyer AC, ECJ FC, 16 July
1992.
The second case, from Portugal, concerned eight questions intended to
clarify whether Portuguese taxes imposed on imported and locally-made cars
amounted to discriminatory internal taxation prohibited by the Rome Treaty.
The fifth chamber of the Court declared all but two questions outside its
competence for lack of any relationship between the questions and the
national proceedings.
However, the Court did rule that when one national provision is caught by
the Rome Treaty's prohibition of discriminatory tax, other provisions in the
same law are not necessarily prohibited, if they are unrelated.

FT  28 JUL 92 / People: Goldring ventures into consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's rare to find an optimistic fund manager these days but 42-year-old
Howard Goldring seems to fit the bill. He has chucked in his job as director
of global strategy at Allied Dunbar Asset Management and set up his own
consultancy, Alberon Associates.
'I felt the recovery was coming and wanted to be in place when it came,'
says Goldring, who has been a fund manager for 12 years. He will continue to
work as a consultant for Allied Dunbar and write a monthly newsletter on
global investment strategy. But he is keen to get more heavily involved in
business - he was a non-executive director of Ernest Jones before it was
taken over by Ratners - and work on some venture capital projects.
He has been appointed a non-executive director of Michael Heller's London &amp;
Associated Investment Trust. Despite its name, London &amp; Associated is not an
investment trust but a property company specialising in investing in
shopping centres and parades.
It is one of three public companies, chaired by the 56-year-old Heller who
made his first fortune when he sold the family's KP Foods business to United
Biscuits. His other vehicles are Bisichi Mining, a speculative mining stock,
and Electronic Data Processing, a highly-rated computer software company.
Goldring, who says that he has known Heller for some years, owns 300,000
shares in London &amp; Associated, which gives him the biggest shareholding of
any director save the chairman. The Heller family owns 40.4m shares, or 58.5
per cent of the equity.
Allied Dunbar, which manages Pounds 9bn of funds, says that Malcolm Baker,
who looks after European investments, will assume Goldring's
responsibilities.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Bank managers' eyes glaze
over - Diane Summers explains why women entrepreneurs have to try much
harder to succeed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best that Emma Bridgewater hopes for when she goes to see a bank manager
is that he - and so far in her career it always has been a he - has a wife
who reads glossy magazines.
Bridgewater's business is designing, making and selling classy
hand-decorated pottery that is much-featured in the pages of stylish
publications.
Her problem is that the product has a predominantly feminine appeal; she has
found bank managers, meanwhile, are invariably male.
The perception of women starting up their own businesses is that they face
more problems than men. Top of the list of complaints is that they are not
taken seriously enough by colleagues or business contacts, according to a
Barclays report published earlier this year*.
Part of this problem may be that women tend to set up very different sorts
of businesses than their male counterparts. While almost a third of
start-ups are by women, they are concentrated in the service sector,
commonly in retailing. Unsurprisingly, women's businesses may often be based
on an extension of their traditional roles and existing experience. And, as
in Bridgewater's case, the product or service itself may appeal more to
women than to men.
When faced with a proposition with which they have difficulty in
identifying, bank managers display an astonishing lack of curiosity,
according to Bridgewater. 'I've found them extremely unwilling to try and
discover anything about the business. Even to step across the road to see
what we make seems too much effort. They have only been interested in profit
and security. This seems to me desperately stupid and short-sighted,' she
says.
From the banks' point of view, Bridgewater's experience would suggest missed
opportunities. As Baroness Denton, small firms minister, points out,
somewhere out there 'the bank manager who first turned down Anita Roddick
must lie awake at night'.
Clearly, a solution would be more female bank managers, although Bridgewater
is not attracted to the US notion of banks specifically for women. One piece
of progress would be to abolish the 'big mahogany desk carry-on designed to
intimidate', as she calls the interview with the bank manager. Banks need to
evolve a different way of assessing business projects brought to them by
women, perhaps by using mixed-sex panels, she argues.
'Instead of a nasty grilling session that's more like a viva, I'd prefer to
have a discussion, preferably with a group of people. The confrontational
approach is very alien to a lot of women,' says Bridgewater.
Fortunately she had already made a start in her business before her own viva
came up. With no formal training and barely covering her costs, she started
to buy pottery, decorating, glazing and firing it herself. She claims her
bank woke up to the fact she was in business 'when my cheques stopped being
made out to Fiorucci and Threshers and started to be to suppliers in Stoke'.
Now aged 31, Bridgewater is the eponymous chairman (she will have no truck
with what she considers feminist-speak) of a company with a turnover of
Pounds 1.25m. Between a shop in London's Fulham Road and a factory in
Stoke-on-Trent the business employs about 35 people and has made the
transition from a 'girlie-craftie profile to market leader in 'casual
dining', as china buyers call it. And I feel I've barely started yet,' she
says.
Top of the list of problems faced by women in small businesses may be not
being taken seriously; close behind, however, are the double pressures that
particularly affect women of combining a business start-up and sustaining
family life and domestic responsibilities.
Bridgewater's workroom behind the shop is a pleasant confusion of children,
sofas and dogs. Husband Matthew Rice, painter and a joint managing director
of the company, will some days cook them all lunch there; other days she
will go the few yards back to their house. There have been times when she
has been able to get away with putting very few hours into work; at present
she is on a run of 10-hour days.
In case it all sounds too much like some neo arts and crafts movement idyll,
Bridgewater describes the diverse pulls on her time and attention as
'horrendous'.
Running a business 'suits single people', she says. 'I spent my twenties
creating a vehicle for my strengths; I've spent the four-and-a-half years
since we married trying to work out how to accommodate the business
alongside marriage and children. Those 'you can have it all' types, who make
it look so easy, are doing girls a disservice.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Problems pile up for
ageing owners / Investigation into the difficulties facing Mittelstand
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German Mittelstand - the 10,000 small- to medium-size businesses which
account for half of Germany's GNP - is in difficulties. Sales are likely to
shrink this year, the workforce is going to have to be reduced, wages are
too high, environmental regulations are too tough and, most serious of all,
they face succession problems as their owner-managers approach retirement
age.
These, at least, are the conclusions of a recent poll of 206 Mittelstand
companies conducted by the German arm of 3i, the UK investment capital
group.
Of these industrial companies, 44 per cent are predicting a fall in sales
during the present business year, compared to more than 70 per cent which
increased sales in 1991-92. More than half are planning to reduce the number
of employees, 44 per cent are going to cut back their capital investment and
a third expect a decline in profit.
Nearly half the managers polled were more than 50 years old and 13 per cent
were older than 60. In addition more than half had been running the business
for more than 10 years. The chief long-term worry of more than 90 per cent
of the total poll is management succession.
More than half of those polled do not have a stake in the business,
indicating that the owners have already moved on from day-to-day management.
The survey does not attempt to look at some of the more fundamental reasons
for the Mittelstand's troubles, which reflect, inter alia, increased
competition in certain sectors because of the single European market
programme (for example, in the transport sector) and the difficulties being
experienced by motor components manufacturers, many of which are coming
under intense pressure as car manufacturers strive to reduce their costs.
But from the venture capital industry's point of view, the results of the
survey are encouraging. The survey identifies a pool of experienced managers
who put a greater value on independence than on job security and money.
Surprisingly, given the conservatism of Germany in financial matters, many
of these managers are prepared to consider participating in a management
buy-out of the company at which they work - or even in a buy-in, buying
another company with the help of a financial institution such as 3i.
On the other side of the equation, owner-managers are increasingly prepared
to consider selling to management.
As Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, joint head of 3i's Frankfurt office, puts
it: 'The managers have achieved everything they want to achieve as managers
and want to become owners. The owners are prepared to sell to them.' There
is, though, a 'communications deficit', because the managers do not realise
that the owners may be prepared to sell. Hence a role for 3i in putting the
two parties together and financing the transaction.
It is not just 3i which is eager to participate in this potentially enormous
market: the German banks have their own venture capital subsidiaries and
increasing numbers of overseas venture capital houses are setting up in
Germany.
The trouble is that - in spite of the satisfactory results of the poll  - it
is a very slow process persuading the owner of a Mittelstand company to sell
to anyone, let alone his management. 3i has been in Frankfurt since the
middle of 1986 and has done only 23 deals in that time - fewer than five a
year.
In the meantime, the survey has picked out a new breed of German manager:
the relative youngster whose background is in finance rather than in
production and engineering.
Those rich inheritors who decided to work rather than going shopping are
showing signs of not wanting to get their hands dirty.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Authors keyed up for DIY
publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS SLEMEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost anyone can become a publisher of books, magazines, comics or
pamphlets - all they need is a desktop publishing system. This computer,
which can produce high quality text, graphics and even photographic images,
has spawned a host of small presses and publishers.
At the last count there were about 6,000 in the UK, while in the US it has
been estimated there will be around 200,000 small presses by the end of the
decade.
The small desktop-based presses are attracting discontented authors who have
been turned down by the principal publishing houses, and publishers who have
either been laid off, or are tired of working for big employers. Bizarre and
outrageous books on subjects ranging from corn circle spotting to successful
busking in Europe are now being printed and are proving popular with readers
who are bored with orthodox literature.
Desktop publishing systems enable many corners in traditional publishing to
be cut. Anyone who can use a 'mouse' can produce a limitless range of images
on the computer screen to create an eye-catching picture for a cover.
With a little capital and the expert advice of the Small Press Group it is
possible to set up a desktop-based small press.
A DTP-based press can earn a surprisingly high amount. Five thousand copies
of a popular book priced at Pounds 10 each will give a return of Pounds
50,000. Each book can be produced for as little as Pounds 1. Some presses
claim they can do it for less.
Most small presses offer their authors 7 to 10 per cent of any royalties,
although some offer a much lower percentage. A greater problem arises in
getting the books widely distributed and reviewed - economies of scale work
in favour of the larger houses. This makes it advisable to stick to
specialised subjects. For further information contact: The Small Press
Group, BM Bozo, London WC1N 3XX. (Tel: 0234-211606).

FT  28 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Hatchet blade may have the edge - A
new development in rowing technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, rowers have become highly design-conscious. All competitors at the
Olympic regatta are being scrutinised for the shape of their oar blade.
Cleaver or conventional? Six months ago the advent of a new hatchet-shaped
blade, developed by an innovative US company, set rowing on its ear.
Believers claim that the larger area of the new blade gives more power per
stroke. Against that is increased drag and wind resistance. Around the
lakeside at Banyoles, the mountain resort 150km from Barcelona, little else
is being talked about. Mind games abound.
The German eight, current world champions and favourites for the gold medal,
changed back to conventional blades a week ago, causing puzzlement among
their opponents - possibly intentionally. Rumour has it that research at a
German university has found against the hatchets. Most spectators and
competitors agree that they are visually unappealing.
'They may look ugly, but close your eyes and they feel fine,' said Steve
Redgrave, the British rower who is favourite for a third gold medal in the
coxless pairs with partner Mathew Pinsent. In the same event his American
opponents have tried the new equipment and discarded it.
'My guys were slower with the big blades. There were some gains in the first
500 metres but it was a definite trade-off further down the course. Maybe
you get more tired using them,' said US coach Bruce Konapka. However, the
bulk of the powerful US team will be using the new oars.
The hatchet oar originated with the Dreissigacker brothers, Peter and Dick,
in Vermont. Their Concept II company introduced the successful Delta blade
eight years ago, the first break from traditional oars in 30 years.
Critics say that Concept II is far more interested in marketing that rowing.
Certainly the company knows how to sell.
The first commercially available big-blade oars were tested against
conventional sweeps in a blizzard last December by the Harvard A and B
crews. Despite changeovers, the rowers with the new equipment always won.
Within an hour of the result leaking out, the Dreissigackers had an order
from Yale for eight hatchet oars at Dollars 350 each.
Since then, any crew has tended to feel at a pyschological disadvantage if
it hasn't at least tried and discarded the new fashion. To try to protect
poorer countries from spiralling costs, FISA, rowing's governing body,
considered banning the big blades but decided against it.
One equipment manufacturer based at Banyoles for the Olympic regatta said
that he had refitted a battered Estonian eight out of human charity - then
witnessed the crew turn up with Dollars 3,500 worth of new big-blade oars
for their first practice.
'There is a huge amount of pure fashion and kidology in this,' cautioned
Australian team coach Paul Thompson. 'If the opposition is using them, any
sportsman wants to feel he is on equal terms.'
Some of the little scientific research that has been undertaken on big-blade
oars has been done at the world-renowned bio-mechanical department of the
Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.
According to Thompson, there is a measurable advantage at sub-maximal strike
rates, fading somewhat as the rowers peak at full power. The effect was more
marked with physically stronger rowers.
Against that was an easily perceived difficulty of handling the big blades
in higher winds. 'In the end it's the motor in the machine, not the colour
you paint the box, that is going to make the difference,' said Thompson.
There is some evidence that the more experienced rowers are more sceptical.
Pertti Karpinnen, a Finn single sculler with three gold medals and now
attending his fifth Olympics, handed his hatchets back to Zurich equipment
manufacturer Stampfli after a short trial.
'He just gave them back and said 'wood is better',' said company boss
Melchior Burgin, himself a former world champion rower.
'Aesthetically it's not appealing,' agreed Burgin, 'but people said that
when we moved from wooden to composite boats. Scientifically, nothing is
proved. If the German eight wins with traditional oars it's going to have a
lot of people scratching their heads. It caused consternation when they
dropped big blades after the Lucerne championships.'
Although Burgin is benefiting commercially from what he describes as
'everyone rushing to buy new equipment,' he is sad to see a conservative
sport falling overboard.
Australian oar manufacturer Howard Croaker, sharing Burgin's workshop,
pointed out that if the stars do well here with the new design, every
college kid and high school rower is going to be badgering his dad for new
oars.
'A lot of people think that the only ones really benefiting are the
manufacturers,' said Bruce Konapka.
Croaker, more of a rower than a businessman, agreed with him. 'My turnover
on oars is already up 400 per cent this year. This has opened a whole new
can of sardines.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / Labour set to decide tactics against Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is to use the first meeting of the new shadow cabinet, to be held
today, as a springboard for a summer campaign against the government's
handling of the economy.
The party will revive the charge of Thatcherite dogmatism against the
government and accuse Mr John Major of underestimating the extent of the
recession. It will also charge him with misleading the public during the
election and with complacency in the face of mounting unemployment and
business failures.
Labour officials are convinced that the failure of the economy to take off
in the wake of the Conservative election victory has offered it
opportunities to subvert an already vulnerable chancellor.
A detailed strategy to be agreed at tomorrow's meeting is intended to keep
ministers on the defensive while stimulating Conservative unease already
stirred up by the efforts of Tory Euro-sceptics. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, has begun the process by charging Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, with 'breathtaking and arrogant complacency' and 'fundamental
neglect of duty' towards the effects of the recession.
He is expected later this week to present a number of policy options to
support his scorn for the nostrum 'there is no alternative'.
Among the proposals will be a revival of Labour's argument that fiscal
incentives should be adopted to help revive investment. Opposition figures
will ask why the government is holding to its refusal to continue its
'holiday' on stamp duty beyond next month when the housing market is in
steep decline.
Officially, Labour is claiming that the government was aware even before
April 9 that an upturn was never on the cards. It will use the charge that
the Tories deliberately 'lied' to the electorate during the campaign.
However, there is some evidence that the continued economic gloom was as
unexpected to Labour as it appears to have been in Whitehall. The aim now is
to portray Mr John Major's government as ideologically hamstrung in a way
that would not hamper more pragmatic administrations elsewhere in Europe.
'We have a government that is so non-interventionist they are letting
everything drift - it has decided it has no part to play,' one Labour
official claimed. The offensive on the economy gives the new Labour
leadership a breathing space in which to reevaluate how it can revamp its
own agenda and lift the spirits of its rank and file after the April
election defeat.
Staff in the office of Mr John Smith, the party leader, are beginning work
on a document to be submitted to the party conference in Blackpool in
October, setting out how the party's core aims and values should be
reinterpreted as the century draws to a close.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Call for joint action on R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOINT EFFORT by government, academia and industry is needed to boost
investment in engineering research and development, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers urges in a report today.
The proposal for a forum to co-ordinate action is one of 10 recommendations
by the institution in a report highlighting the lack of investment in UK
engineering R&amp;D compared with countries such as Germany and Japan.
The institution, which represents more than 78,000 engineers, says
investment in R&amp;D is of critical importance in the coming decade and beyond
for improving the inadequate performance of manufacturing industry.
It says the UK's R&amp;D total expenditure in the period leading to the 1989
Cabinet Office R&amp;D Review was about 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product.
Civil R&amp;D spending was only about 1.6 per cent of GDP, compared with about
2.8 per cent in Japan.
This is compounded, says the report, by a falling proportion of UK
government funding available for civil R&amp;D from around 0.7 per cent of GDP
in 1981 to about 0.5 per cent in 1989.
'These statistics all point to a reduction in the nation's R&amp;D effort,' says
the report. 'It is belived this has an ultimate relationship to the
commercial exploitation of technology and consequently is at least partially
responsible for the slippage of the UK in the international scene.'
Among other concerns raised by the report are the recent limitation of
funding for the Science and Engineering Research Council and lack of
substantive support for small and medium-sized firms in securing European
R&amp;D funds.
The current support for 'pre-competitive' research and lack of funding for
'near-market' projects also affects engineering research particularly
adversely, says the report.
Apart from proposing an Engineering Research Forum to help develop coherent
R&amp;D funding policies and actions, the institution also wants industry to
make a commitment to increase R&amp;D funding.
It says government funding for R&amp;D and training sponsored through the
Department of Trade and Industry and SERC should be increased, while
consideration should be given to consolidating engineering R&amp;D grants under
one body.
The report also says the Government should promote and fund specific
programmes to support R&amp;D in small companies, where that R&amp;D is directed
towards innovative products. In addition, industry bodies are urged to set
up and support a unit to help small companies approach the EC for R&amp;D
funding.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Training bills for job leavers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one third of British companies have asked people leaving their jobs
to repay the cost of their training.
A majority of managers believe job leavers should repay part or all the
costs of their training, according to the magazine Personnel Today.
Some 28 per cent of companies taking part in the survey conducted by the
Industrial Society had such policies, while a further 8 per cent were
considering it. Overall 55 per cent of managers favoured the idea, and only
26 per cent ruled it out.
The government has estimated that employers spend about Pounds 20bn a year
on training. The Civil Service, for example, spends around Pounds 788 per
employee on training, a figure that is probably higher than the private
sector.
Mr Michael Howard, the former employment secretary, had mooted the idea of
employees having legally enforceable contracts which would allow their
employers to recoup some of their training costs.
However, the suggestion was dropped after informal consultation with
employers.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Interest in Land Travel database
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AROUND 20 companies have expressed an interest in buying the customer
database of Land Travel, the Bath-based coach operator which collapsed last
week.
Mr Robert Buller of liquidator Grant Thornton said yesterday that most of
the potential purchasers were travel companies experiencing a difficult
season.
Sale of the database would not provide funds to compensate the estimated
50,000 people who booked holidays with Land Travel or the 2,500 who had
their holidays cut short, he said.
Land Travel was neither a member of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta) nor the Bus and Coach Council and was not part of any money-back
scheme.
Any funds obtained from the sale would go towards paying the cost of the
liquidation, Mr Buller said. A single letter to each of the company's
creditors inviting them to a meeting would be likely to cost about Pounds
15,000, he said.
There was little prospect of any buyer wanting to purchase the company
itself, he added.
Mr Nigel Griffith, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said the government
should consider paying compensation to Land Travel customers who had lost
money in the collapse.
Mr Griffiths said: 'For the past eight weeks it has been the talk of the
travel trade that this company was in trouble and there are various factors
which gave rise to that belief.
'If the Department of Trade and Industry knew about these things and were
dilatory or negligent in acting on them, then the government must consider
compensating those who have fallen foul of this collapse.'

FT  28 JUL 92 / RMT dock workers lose rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED British Ports, one of Britain's largest docks employers, has
withdrawn recognition rights from the transport union RMT. The move is a
further step in the company's campaign to put all staff on to personal
contracts.
Although 650 of the company's 2,000 staff are nominally members of the
union, only 90 have refused to sign the personal contracts which require
them to give up all their rights to union representation.
Until now the union has continued to bargain on behalf of the 90 - who are
mainly manual workers in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, south Wales - but the
company has now written to the RMT saying that it will no longer be
recognised for collective bargaining or individual disciplinary issues.
Lawyers for the union believe that the company may have decided to go ahead
with de-recognition after the Employment Appeal Tribunal recently upheld an
appeal by Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, against the
National Union of Journalists.
Mr David Wilson, an NUJ official at the Daily Mail, had won a case at an
industrial tribunal complaining that he had been denied a 4.5 per cent
salary increase because he remained a union member and had refused to sign
an individual contract.
The appeal tribunal's reversal of that decision makes it unlikely that
Associated British Ports could now be sued for discriminating on grounds of
union membership against the rump of staff refusing to sign personal
contracts.
The company denies that the decision is connected to the Daily Mail case. It
is, however, appealing over three dockers at Southampton who refused to sign
personal contracts and won compensation from an industrial tribunal ranging
from Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 2,850.
The appeal tribunal met last week but has not yet reached a decision. If the
company's appeal fails the RMT is likely to seek similar compensation for
others who have refused to sign personal contracts.
Mr Tony MacGregor, assistant general secretary of the RMT, said yesterday
the company's decision would penalise all RMT members in the company and not
just the 90 who have refused to sign.
'ABP are in breach of their agreement with us on notice of termination but
there is no legal redress for the union,' he said.
'Most of our members felt they were coerced into signing personal contracts.
The choice facing those brave enough to stand up to the initial intimidation
is to sign personal contracts now or accept that there will be no
improvements in existing conditions,' he added.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Regulator to probe power prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, has written to
National Power and PowerGen, the privatised electricity generators, asking
them to explain why electricity prices have risen sharply since May.
The move could lead to a full investigation of electricity prices, and might
end with the two generators being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Prof Littlechild's move comes after large electricity consumers from the
Major Energy Users Council, a lobbying group, complained in May that
electricity prices were too high.
Prices in the electricity pool, or wholesale market, rose from around 1.9p
per unit in March to around 2.3p in May, June and July, large users
complained. They alleged that the increase occured because the two
generators were bidding the price up.
'The bid prices were going up when the coal price was dropping,' said Mr
John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group. 'They bore no
relation to the underlying costs. Our impression was they were winding the
price up.'
Prof Littlechild, who last investigated pool prices in September, will now
give the generators time to explain the increase.
If they do this successfully, the issue may go no further. But if the
regulator is not satisfied, he will order a full inquiry into the pool,
similar to the review he published last December.
At that stage, he said it was too early to say if the pool price was too
high or too low. But he is likely to make a clear decision this time, and if
he decides it is too high, he would not rule out a referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The council said it would welcome this outcome. 'We'd like them to be
referred, then they would probably be split up and there would be more
competition,' said Mr Topliss.
Both generators acknowledged that they had received a letter from Prof
Littlechild, but said they believed a full inquiry was unlikely.
'The market conditions are now supporting higher prices,' one generator
said, explaining that pool prices were still much lower than contract prices
 -which are around 2.6p per unit for a large customer and 3p for a domestic
user. This was too low for them to recover their costs, the generators said.
Some regional electricity companies said they were aware of the review, but
had not yet been consulted.

THE EC yesterday sounded out major partners in Gatt to see if they would be

compensation for the damage they claim to have suffered from EC
protectionism on oilseeds, David Buchan reports from Brussels.
The EC's executive Commission planned to discuss reaction to its offer, made
yesterday, with EC governments on Friday, so talks could end by August 18.
This is the deadline for the Gatt negotiating procedure, where Brussels has
offered to compensate its partners rather than make another change to its
oilseeds system.

   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
URENCO, the uranium enrichment consortium which links British Nuclear Fuels
with German and Dutch partners, has broken into the Japanese market. Tokyo
Electric Power Company (Tepco) has awarded Urenco a long-term contract
expected to be worth at least Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m) over 10 years.
Tepco said that because there were very few international providers of
enriched uranium, it had decided to widen its sourcing in order to ensure
that its needs were met.
As the country's biggest electric utility, Tepco's choice of Urenco is
thought likely to prompt other Japanese regional power companies to follow
suit.
Japan is now one of the few countries with a clear policy to expand nuclear
generating capacity. Its needs for enriched uranium are currently met by the
US, through the Energy Department in Washington, and by the French-led
Eurodif.
Tepco said the contract, which runs from 1995-96, had passed all regulatory
approvals required by the Ministry for International Trade and Industry.
Urenco is to supply two boiling water reactors which Tepco is building in
Niigata Prefecture in central Japan. The deal comes after several years in
which it has tried to enter the Japanese market while protecting the
centrifuge technology developed by the venture.
Mr JA Paleit, Urenco managing director, said the enrichment work would be
carried out by all three of the consortium's partners: British Nuclear
Fuels, Uranit of Germany and Ultra-Centrifuge of the Netherlands. It is
likely to add at least 10 per cent to Urenco's turnover in the late 1990s.
Japan's 42 existing nuclear power facilities all have long-term supply
contracts, with further opportunities for Urenco most likely to accompany
new plants. Eleven are being built, with 20 more in various stages of
planning.

</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government will no longer accept aid from the US to combat drug
trafficking, according to Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the attorney-general.
Aid would be refused from this month, he said.
The move seems to be in retaliation for the US Supreme Court ruling in June
upholding the kidnapping of the Mexican murder suspect, Dr Humberto Alvarez
Machain, by agents working for the US Drug Enforcement Agency.
Mr Morales Lechuga said of DEA activities in Mexico: 'If you are a guest in
a house you can't act like the host.'
The aid amounted to Dollars 48m (Pounds 25.1m) last fiscal year. The
attorney-general said in an interview with the New York Times that the
decision to refuse US money would not impede Mexico's fight against drug
traffickers.
The government continues to bridle at the refusal to return Dr Alvarez
Machain to Mexico for trial, and is seeking to amend the countries'
extradition treaty to make such kidnappings illegal.
Last week Mr Santiago Onate, attorney-general for environmental protection,
said that environmental co-operation between the US and Mexico had been made
more difficult by the Supreme Court ruling and, by implication, Washington's
refusal to return Dr Alvarez Machain. The Mexicans may not allow joint
inspections of border factories, or joint settlement of environmental
disputes.
Mexico had originally said after the Court ruling that it would suspend
activities of the DEA, but a day later it reversed its decision. The U-turn
has been explained in some quarters by the Mexican government's fear of
upsetting US legislators while North American free-trade agreement (Nafta)
talks enter their most critical stage.

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING house sales and weaker business confidence have reinforced
economists' fears that the US recovery, already one of the slowest on
record, may once again be losing steam, writes George Graham.
The National Association of Realtors said yesterday the sales of previously
owned houses fell 2.9 per cent in June, the third consecutive monthly drop.
Although home sales rose in the north-east, they fell sharply in the
mid-west and west.
'We've been experiencing a stall within a rise,' said Mr John Tuccillo, an
economist with the association.
At the same time an index of business confidence produced by Cahners
Economics, a Massachusetts-based forecasting group, showed a sharp drop in
July. The survey showed businesses were particularly pessimistic about the
chances of increasing workforces.
Mr Daryl Delano, senior economist at Cahners, said: 'These numbers are
fairly convincing evidence that the recovery had once again stalled before
the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on July 2.'
He said the effect of lower interest rates had not become clear when
businesses were questioned, prompting an unusual degree of uncertainty among
planners.
Economists expect the rate cut to boost sales in coming months as mortgage
rates fall.

includes criminal charges against 'copycats' and allows appeals before a
licence is awarded. Violators could face seven years' jail.

THE Financial Times and Izvestia, the leading quality daily in what was the
Soviet Union, yesterday announced a joint business publishing venture,
Raymond Snoddy reports. Starting in October, the 300,000 Izvestia
subscribers in the Moscow area will receive a weekly eight-page
Russian-language business supplement. It will be printed on pink paper and
be called Financial Izvestia.
The longer term aim is to turn the supplement into a jointly owned
stand-alone weekly publication devoted to the economies of the former Soviet
Union. If the project is a success, there would also be the eventual
possibility of a daily business paper.
Mr David Palmer, chief executive of the Financial Times, said yesterday:
'The FT-Izvestia project is most exciting. The market for Russian-language
and financial news is largely untapped.' Mr Igor Golembiovsky, Izvestia's
editor-in-chief, said that for advertisers the venture would represent 'a

FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: McDonnell Douglas boosts Israeli ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace group, is strengthening its ties with
the Israeli aerospace industry by contracting two Israeli companies for
additional work worth about Dollars 522m (Pounds 273m).
The biggest contract, worth around Dollars 500m, involves the state-owned
Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) and includes work on overhauling DC-9
twin-engine commercial airliners and extending IAI's activities on wing
components for the US group's MD11 three-engine airliners.
The second contract worth Dollars 20m over five years involves the
Haifa-based Elbit company, which will produce cockpit displays for the T-45
trainer aircraft system for the US Navy.
The centre piece of this system is the T-45 Goshawk aircraft, the US version
of the British Aerospace Hawk trainer in which McDonnell Douglas is prime
contractor to the US Navy, and BAe main subcontractor for the airframe.
The US group said it had decided to strengthen its ties with Israeli
industry 'because of its competitiveness and commitment to high quality'.
Under its agreement with McDonnell Douglas, IAI will carry out maintenance
overhauls on the first six of a fleet of 26 DC9s formerly owned by Delta Air
Lines. IAI would help lease or sell the DC9s.
It was the first time the US group had taken back an entire fleet of
aircraft from an operator and begun an extensive maintenance programme, it
said. After being refurbished, the jets are expected to be leased back to
Delta.
IAI will continue to build all production requirements for MD11 three engine
jetliners' fixed leading edge and slat assemblies under an expanded
agreement with McDonnell Douglas.
The US company indicated it was continuing to work with airlines in an
effort to launch a new four-engine jumbo, the MD12. The company, which
originally wanted to launch the MD12 programme this year, is now hoping to
launch the new jumbo project next year. But the future of the MD12 programme
will critically depend on the US company securing an alliance with
international partners.

USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways plans to invest Dollars 750m
(Pounds 392m) for a potential 44 per cent stake, is among four companies
named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of two victims of the La Guardia crash in
March, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Twenty-seven passengers died when a USAir Fokker F28 veered off a runway on
March 22 at New York's La Guardia airport and ended up in the icy waters of
Flushing Bay.
The lawsuit, filed in northern Ohio, seeks a total of Dollars 80m in damages
from USAir, Fokker Aircraft USA, Dow Chemical and Rolls-Royce.
It alleges that Dow Chemical, which made the de-icer used on the plane, and
the other companies 'knew or should have known that the de-icer they were
using was not effective on this particular airplane in these circumstances'.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Turkey softens hardline stance over pipeline for Iraqi oil
</HEADLINE>

   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S state pipeline company has sent a delegation to Baghdad for the
first time since the Gulf crisis started almost two years ago, in a further
indication that Ankara is seeking to improve relations with Iraq.
Officials confirmed that Botas, the pipeline company, sent representatives
to the Iraqi capital earlier this month to consider the technical problems
involved in re-opening the 1,000km twin pipeline, which was built to take
Iraqi crude to the Mediterranean.
Officials say Turkey has dropped its demands for financial compensation from
Baghdad for the loss of revenue which resulted from the imposition of United
Nations trade sanctions against Iraq in August 1990. Turkey is instead
considering claiming from the Geneva-based UN War Reparation Fund.
With Ankara soon to re-open its embassy in Baghdad and Prime Minister
Suleyman Demirel urging reconciliation during last week's showdown over
Iraqi compliance with Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, Turkey is making a
renewed effort to improve relations.
Turkey's decision to send Botas to Baghdad follows reports that Iraq is
considering building an alternative pipeline through Jordan. The move is a
measure of Turkey's concern that the Gulf crisis should not prejudice its
long-term commercial ties with Iraq, before the war its second largest
trading partner.
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, Turkey has lost almost Dollars 600m (Pounds 314m)
in tolls foregone on the twin pipeline from Mosul in north Iraq to
Iskenderum on the Mediterranean. Turkey claimed a contractual right to
compensation, under the original agreement.
Its hardline position was in part responsible for Iraq refusing to adopt the
terms of UN resolution 706, under which Iraq would ship Dollars 1.6bn worth
of oil exports to finance medical and food imports under UN supervision. The
former Motherland party government demanded Dollars 264m for use of the
pipeline for this six-month operation.
However, Mr Demirel's government is taking a softer approach.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Baghdad hails 'victory' over UN weapons team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ yesterday proclaimed it had won a 'brilliant victory' over the United
Nations by reaching agreement for a team of 'neutral' UN weapons experts to
inspect an agriculture ministry building.
Under the agreement, which defused the most serious threat of resumed allied
military action against Iraq since the Gulf war, a team of seven UN
inspectors, led by Mr Achim Biermann, arrives in Baghdad today to complete
inspection there of the ministry building, from which a previous UN team had
been barred since July 5.
However, Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the special commission investigating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said on his way to Baghdad that he was
pessimistic that the team would now find anything in the building.
British officials said they expected the team to find only 'some traces' of
the documents and materials relating to Iraq's missile programme which UN
inspectors suspected to have been hidden in the agriculture ministry.
The original team of UN chemical weapons inspectors called off a vigil
outside the building last week in the face of concerted and increasingly
hostile demonstrations.
Both Iraq and the Gulf war allies yesterday claimed that the other side had
backed down.
Mr Mohammed Hamza al-Zubeidi, Iraq's prime minister, said in a statement
carried by the Iraqi news agency that the UN's agreement to send in a team
of inspectors excluding nationals from the main Gulf war protagonists was a
'brilliant victory' which 'incarnated the solid national will of the Iraqis'
around President Saddam Hussein.
President George Bush, meanwhile, claimed that Mr Saddam had climbed down
and said that further 'infringements' of the Gulf war ceasefire terms would
not be tolerated. US officials said President Bush was due to meet senior
national security advisers last night - the third such meeting in a week.
British and US officials stressed yesterday that although the crisis over
the agriculture ministry building had eased, to the extent that the
immediate threat of military action against Iraq had been deferred, there
was continued concern over other aspects of Iraq's more general defiance of
the UN and the west.
'The atmosphere will remain fairly hot for a while yet,' said a British
official.
Diplomats were unconvinced, in particular, that the stand-off over UN access
to the agriculture ministry would be the last time Mr Saddam would attempt a
provocative policy of 'cheat and retreat'.
With few other readily available options, diplomats say the Gulf war allies
will maintain pressure over not only the UN weapons inspectors' access to
Iraqi installations but also over the safety of UN guards in northern Iraq,
Baghdad's attacks on Shia Moslems in the south and other breaches of the
ceasefire resolution. These include the non-return of Kuwaiti property
snatched during the war and the alleged detention of several hundred Kuwaiti
prisoners of war.
The US yesterday also kept the threat of military action alive by preparing
to send another aircraft carrier to the Gulf region.

SIR James Mancham, the former Seychelles president, cried foul yesterday
after losing an election to President Albert Rene, the man who overthrew him
15 years ago, Reuter reports from Victoria.
'We do not consider the election result credible,' said Sir James.
Sir James returned from exile this year to lead the Democratic party in the
contest for seats on a 20-member constitutional commission.
The vote on Sunday was the first multi-party poll for 18 years in this
cluster of 115 Indian Ocean islands.
A team of Commonwealth observers judged it free and fair but Sir James
accused Mr Rene's Seychelles Peoples Progressive Front of intimidating
voters.
Mr Rene's party won 58.4 per cent of the vote and will have 14 seats in the
commission, which is to write a new constitution before a presidential
election in December.
The Mancham campaign won 33.7 per cent and will have the remaining seats, as
none of the six other parties got the minimum for representation.

MR Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, assured parliament yesterday
that the 16th century Babri mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya would not
be demolished to make way for a Hindu temple.
The dispute over the future of the mosque has caused communal tension
between Hindus and Moslems including rioting in two Indian states last week.
Hindu militants agreed over the weekend to follow a court order stopping
construction at the disputed site.
They also agreed to wait for the Indian courts to decide on the dispute. Mr
Rao said the government was willing to consolidate all the cases pending in
different Indian courts under 'one judicial authority' for a speedy verdict
on the temple issue. He also suggested the all-party talks resume to solve
the temple dispute amicably.
Supporters of the Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal, both militant
affiliates of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have
reluctantly agreed to shift their attention for now to another temple at a
site nearby in Ayodhya.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL is well positioned to cope with the big burden of foreign debt it
intends to take on to help absorb mass immigration from the former Soviet
Union, Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, said yesterday.
The government is confident it will shortly get US government guarantees to
back Dollars 10bn in foreign borrowing after taking steps to meet
Washington's condition that it cease expansion of Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories.
Left: Mr Jacob Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, who backs borrowing to help
absorb an influx of immigrants
The guarantees are also seen in Israel as the key to winning a further
Dollars 10bn in loans from international markets over the next five years.
Mr Frenkel rejected suggestions that Israel, which relies heavily on US aid
to help service existing debt, could not afford such a heavy load.
He said the ratio of foreign debt to Gross National Product had been reduced
from 80 per cent in the mid-1980s to 27 per cent now.
'Israel has positioned itself in the best possible starting point for a
borrowing enterprise,' he said.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Frenkel said Israel needed such large
amounts of foreign capital because domestic sources were not sufficient to
match the investment required as a result of immigration, which has totalled
around 400,000 in the past 30 months.
'The alternative to borrowing abroad will be less investment today, and less
investment today misses the entire point of a successful absorption of
immigration in the private sector in the most effective way,' Mr Frenkel
said.
But he reiterated his insistence the new Labour-led government must use the
loans to back a comprehensive programme of market reform, to increase
investment in infrastructure and to reduce fiscal deficits, thus ensuring
the productive growth that in turn would facilitate debt servicing. He said
he was optimistic the government would do so.

FT  28 JUL 92 / IMF calls for deep cuts in Greek public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has urged Greece to slash the public deficit
by Dr1,300bn (Pounds 3.7bn) by the end of 1993 in order to meet the
Maastricht timetable for economic convergence with its European Community
partners.
In its annual report on the Greek economy, the IMF called for deep cuts in
public spending, including rapid reform of the state pension system where
outlays account for about 15 per cent of the country's gross domestic
product.
The normally confidential report was made public by Mr Stefanos Manos, the
economy minister, who hopes to make Greeks more willing to accept continued
austerity by revealing the extent of the country's economic problems.
The report said the government's current efforts to reduce the deficit by 4
percentage points this year to 13 per cent of GDP were inadequate for
meeting the Maastricht target. 'Primary adjustment of 8-10 percentage points
of GDP was needed in 1992-93 to put Greece on the path to convergence with a
clearly declining debt to GDP ratio,' it said. The public debt last year
reached 116 per cent of GDP, compared to the Maastricht requirement of no
more than 60 per cent by 1997.
'The focus of the stabilisation effort should be on a curtailment of public
spending,' the report addded. 'Lasting savings in the central government's
wage bill require significant cuts in public employment, including the
abolition of unnecessary functions.' A hiring freeze is nominally in effect
in the public sector, but the government has been reluctant to incur the
political cost of large scale dismissals.
Greece requested IMF technical help in its second attempt in two years to
overhaul the pension system, but discussions with trade union officials have
been delaying the launch of a less generous scheme.
A stabilisation programme launched last year has succeeded in reducing the
current account deficit from 5.4 to 2.2 per cent of GDP and cutting the
inflation rate from 20.9 to 15.1 per cent - still almost three times the EC
average. However, the size of the deficit remains a serious obstacle to
further progress.
In addition to the government's unwillingness to enforce harsh spending
curbs, its revenue forecasts still appear too optimistic. According to the
report, further reforms of the fiscal system, including a broadening of the
tax base and higher indirect taxes are crucial to boosting revenues.

The leader of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo has said a
revolt brewing there could result in a tragedy greater than that in Bosnia,
Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Ibrahim Rugova told Figaro newspaper that he
believed a popular revolt could erupt in Kosovo, where the majority Albanian
population is seeking to break with Serbia.
Mr Rugova, elected president of Kosovo in clandestine elections in May, said
he did not rule out his Democratic League taking up arms against Serbia,
which has stripped the province of its autonomy. 'But because we lack
weapons, it would be difficult to organise,' he said.
Kosovo's 1.9m ethnic Albanians outnumber other nationalities, including
Serbs, 10 to one. Serbia accuses them of wanting to annex the province to
neighbouring Albania. More than 100 people have been killed in unrest in
Kosovo since March 1989, but Mr Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders
have urged civil disobedience instead of demonstrations which invariably
result in violence.

THE GROWING political corruption scandal in northern Italy has claimed its
second victim with the death yesterday of Mr Mario Majocchi, head of a
Como-based building group and deputy chairman of Italy's Builders'
Federation.
The death of Mr Majocchi, who was taken to hospital after shooting himself
in the head at home on Sunday, follows that last month of Mr Renato Amorese,
secretary of the Socialist party in Lodi, near Milan.
Mr Majocchi's motives remain obscure, unlike those of Mr Amorese, who left a
long letter. After being interviewed by Milanese magistrates on Friday, Mr
Majocchi, managing director of a company active in public sector contracting
in Lombardy, returned home apparently unperturbed.
The latest incident follows a shift of focus from politicians to
industrialists in the continuing investigation. Last Friday, police arrested
Mr Giancarlo Cozza, the 55-year-old chief executive of Fiat Ferroviaria
Savigliano, the railway equipment division of the Fiat group. His arrest,
and that of the owner of a local Iveco bus dealership, brought to 71 the
number of people now charged in connection with the widening investigations.
Mr Cozza, detained on suspicion of having paid bribes for contracts to
supply rolling stock to Milan's underground railway, is the second Fiat
executive to have been arrested in the affair. Earlier this year, police
arrested Mr Enzo Papi, chief executive of Fiat's Cogefar Impresit building
subsidiary, Italy's biggest building group. Mr Papi, who refused to give
evidence and eventually resigned from his job, was finally released.

NEARLY 3,000 dentists in Germany's populous North Rhine region downed drills

Members of the Free Association of German Dentists are being urged to pull

privately, mirroring a move taken by British dentists three weeks ago.
At the same time doctors in the wealthy state of Baden-Wurttemberg are
organising a mass poster campaign attacking the health minister, Mr Horst
Seehofer, who has drawn up plans to save DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year from
the swelling costs of the health service.
They include a freeze on doctors' and dentists' fees, as well as on
pharmaceutical prices, an increase in hospital fees, and a system to curb
prescriptions by doctors: if they prescribe more than laid down in strict
budgets, their fees will be cut accordingly.
Mr Seehofer denounced the dentists' strike action yesterday as 'absolutely
excessive'.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FRENCH lawyers representing Aids victims yesterday began legal
proceedings against three former ministers, including Mr Laurent Fabius,
first secretary of the governing Socialist party, for alleged poisoning.
The move could provoke an embarrassing parliamentary debate over the
government's responsibility in the distribution of HIV-infected blood to
haemophiliacs, as a result of which 256 people have died in the past seven
years.
If the debate takes place, it is likely to happen in the run-up to the
sensitive September 20 referendum on European union, thus dealing another
blow to the government's unsuccessful attempts to avoid controversy.
The indictment, which also cites Ms Georgina Dufoix, former social affairs
minister, and Mr Edmond Herve, former junior health minister, arises from a
trial of four former senior health officials, charged with allowing
transfusions of HIV-infected blood in 1985.
French ministers cannot be brought to court directly to face charges linked
with the exercise of their jobs. They have to be impeached by both houses of
parliament.
First, examining magistrates have to decide whether there is a case to
answer and pass on the case to the public prosecutor. It will then be up to
Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister, to decide whether to pass the case to
parliament.
Given the huge public interest in this tragic trial, any official attempt to
bury the indictment would spark an uproar.
Mr Fabius, prime minister at the time, told the court last week that he
acted as quickly as possible to introduce obligatory screening of blood as
soon as he knew of the danger.
Mr Herve admitted he knew stocks were infected, but acted on experts' advice
in allowing them to be used until heat sterilisation became available.
Around 1,300 people have since become HIV positive, including nearly 45 per
cent of French haemophiliacs.

FT  28 JUL 92 / West helpless as Russian budget deficit swells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government is rapidly losing control of the budget deficit and
inflation and there is little that the west can do to help, according to
both foreign experts and Russian government officials.
Two separate credits of Rbs500bn have been approved by the government for
industry under the influence of the powerful industrial lobby - with
expectations that inflation will surge as a result.
The new chairman of the Russian central bank, Mr Victor Gerashchenko -
former chairman of the Soviet state bank (Gosbank) - has said he favours
soft loans to key industrial sectors, and has postponed the convertibility
of the rouble for the foreseeable future.
These measures would relieve the pressure on industry, but would also delay
the date of any substantial restructuring and increase both budget deficit
and inflationary pressures.
Moreover, the price likely to be paid to farmers for grain this year will be
at least Rbs10,000 a tonne. Such a sum is much higher than the government
had wished, but likely to be necessary since farmers are refusing to sell.
This in turn will lead to huge increases in the price of bread - the most
politically sensitive of all prices - and to further inflation.
In the opinion of Professor Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University who is
working on proposals to stabilise the rouble: 'My belief is that we could
have inflation at 50 per cent (the commonly-defined threshold for
hyperinflation) by the end of the year because they cannot stop the credits.
There is nothing the west can do about this.'
President Boris Yeltsin has revised down his previous forecast of when the
economy would stabilise - from the latter part of this year to early next.
Negotiations between the Russian government and the International Monetary
Fund, suspended over the holiday period, are expected to restart in late
August or in September but hopes that a stand-by agreement will be reached
in the autumn are now evaporating.
An IMF spokesman in Washington said that the forecast of an October signing
of the agreement was 'the Russian government's estimation' and added that
'it's not clear if the Russians know how difficult this process is'.
Furthermore, some powerful Russian politicians increasingly confidently
dismiss the desirability of western assistance. General Alexander Rutskoi,
the vice president, said that 'the time has come when we should no longer
hope for a kind uncle - the IMF'.
Mr Yeltsin said last week that he had defied the requests of the IMF to
freeze wages and raise energy prices, though he added they would be raised
to world levels by the end of next year.
Intensive discussions within the IMF and at senior levels in the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries now focus on how far the IMF should
continue to act as the judge of Russian reform on the part of the G7. Some
officials, alarmed by the possible collapse of reform and with it, the
Russian government under Mr Yegor Gaidar are calling for direct assistance
from rich countries to Russia in order to prevent a backlash against both
the market and democratic institutions.
The worsening economic situation is prompting increased security precautions
against public discontent. An emergency committee, possibly including a
paramilitary force, is to be set up in St Petersburg following a warning
from Mr Sergei Stepanshin, the city's security chief, of disturbances 'in
the wake of a worsening economic and political situation'.
The Russian Security Ministry has also announced the formation of a special
force of former KGB officers to protect officials against assassination.
Evidence of attacks is sketchy but Itar-Tass news agency, quoting the
ministry, said the force was being set up following 'more than 100 terrorist
acts' in Russia over the past year.

ROMANIA'S politicians face a long, hot summer with the start yesterday of a
two-month campaign for concurrent presidential and parliamentary elections
on September 27.
The polls, only the second general elections since the overthrow of the
Ceausescu regime in December 1989, are expected to lead to significant
changes in the country's political spectrum.
With no strong opponent nominated to challenge Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's
president, he appears virtually assured of a second term of office, this
time for four years.
However, in parliament, the National Salvation Front (NSF) which swept to
power in May, 1990, with two-thirds of the vote, looks certain to lose its
dominance.
The NSF was weakened earlier this year by internal disputes between those
favouring the reformist Mr Petre Roman, the former prime minister, and the
supporters of the more conservative Mr Iliescu, a former high-ranking
communist official, who left to form the Democratic National Salvation Front
(DNSF).
The NSF has also seen its power eroded by the Democratic Convention (DC), a
coalition of opposition parties which successfully contested February's
local elections, winning control of many key cities including Bucharest, the
capital, and the Transylvanian town of Timisoara, birthplace of the 1989
revolution.
However, the DC has been rocked by internal quarrels, too, notably over its
choice of presidential candidates and by the departure of the National
Liberal Party, one of Romania's parties from the 1920s.
Pollsters disagree which of the three main groupings, the DNSF, the NSF and
the DC, will be the victor. Most believe the future government will be a
coalition between Mr Roman's NSF and the DC. Some fear that DNSF and other
left-wing parties will emerge strong enough to take power through alliances
with extreme right nationalist parties.

FT  28 JUL 92 / Wellcome Trust raises Pounds 2.1bn through sale of 270m
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WELLCOME TRUST, the medical research charity, yesterday confirmed it had
raised Pounds 2.1bn net of expenses through its sale of 270m shares in
Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group, at a price of 800p.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Trust, said he was 'very pleased' with the
result of the sale given poor stock market conditions since details of the
issue were announced in June. At that time the issue size was indicated at
330m shares, and the company's shares were trading above 900p.
Wellcome's share price fell yesterday from 826p to 800 1/2 p, as the stock
market weakened. The volume of shares traded was 14m, regarded as a low
level for the first day of trading in an issue of this size.
Mr Gibbs said that 'the Trust's total income for its next financial year
will now be some Pounds 220m, double that of the current year'. The Trust
announced a number of research initiatives yesterday.
Mr Gibbs said the Trust now had a Pounds 5bn portfolio, half invested in its
remaining 42 per cent Wellcome stake and the rest in higher-yielding
securities. It will build up a diversified equity portfolio.
Around 60 per cent of the shares sold were allocated to UK institutions.
Applicants through the UK public offer received 14.4m shares.
Another 70m shares were allocated to investors in the US. This makes it the
largest share sale in the US for a non-US company, barring privatisations.
It takes the proportion of Wellcome's shares held there to 10 per cent.
About 2 per cent of the group's shares will now be held by Japanese
investors.
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said the sale had gone some way
to achieving a broader international spread of shareholders for the company.
Mr Robb was particularly pleased that the take-up of shares had been strong
in the US and Japan, as well as Britain, as these were the two largest
pharmaceutical markets in the world.
Demand from other areas was weaker, with investors in Germany, France and
Canada taking only a few million shares in all. Some of the selling observed
yesterday was believed to have come from Germany.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank running the global sale, is expected to
track down the identity of these sellers.
Mr Gibbs praised the Trust's advisers.
As well as Fleming, he picked out Warburg Securities and Cazenove in the UK,
Morgan Stanley in the US and Nikko Securities in Japan.

<TEXT>
ARAB states and Israel are expected to resume peace negotiations in
Washington early next month after a meeting in Damascus at the weekend of
Arab foreign ministers endorsed an early resumption.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said the Arabs were ready
to resume bilateral talks 'as soon as possible'. In Jerusalem, officials at
prime minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin's office said they had not received any
formal invitation and expressed reservations about meeting at such an early
date. However they indicated they would accept Washington as venue for the
talks.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, who completed a Middle East tour
last Friday aimed at revitalising the peace process, had urged both Israel
and its Arab neighbours to bring forward talks.
He suggested the two sides should re-convene on August 10. Previously, they
had agreed to hold the sixth round of bilateral negotiations in Rome in
September, but the defeat of the hardline Likud government in Israel and its
replacement by the dovish Labour party prompted renewed efforts to
accelerate the process.
Israel and the representatives of Syria and Lebanon plus a
Jordanian-Palestinian team have held five rounds of desultory discussions on
issues of land and peace since the US-sponsored process started in Madrid
last October.
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan were represented in Damascus by their foreign
ministers. Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation's 'political department', represented the Palestinians. Also in
attendance was Dr Haider Abdel Shafi, the head of the Palestinian delegation
at the peace talks.
Dr Shafi is from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Israel bank warns on loans guarantee waste
</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday warned the government not to waste on
current spending Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees it now expects to
secure. It said they must be used to finance productive investment which
would ensure the loans can be repaid, listing the country's heavy defence
spending among expenditures that must be reviewed.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, told a cabinet meeting
that winning the loan guarantees, sought to help finance the absorption of
mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, would increase confidence and
investment in an economy burdened by sluggish growth and high unemployment.
The new Labour-led coalition aims to use the guarantees to underwrite a big
foreign borrowing programme that is a cornerstone of its recovery plans. It
is confident they will be released following the government's move to curb
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, in keeping with US
conditions for the aid.
Mr Frenkel told ministers the guarantees must be used to support business
policies that would produce sustainable growth. He said the government must
accelerate investment in infrastructure, education and training, reduce
corporate taxation and speed reforms such as privatisation.

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S already weak economy declined further in the first half of 1992,
figures published by the country's statistics commission indicate, writes
Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Mr George Danielescu, minister of finance, described the country's half-year
economic indicators as grim. He singled out the continuing drop in
industrial production and high inflation as particularly negative signs.
Industrial production fell by 19.5 per cent in the first half, contributing
to an overall decline of 47 per cent since 1989 when the Ceausescu regime
was overthrown, while consumer price inflation has this year averaged 10.4
per cent a month.
Inflationary pressures will remain high in coming months due to the near 100
per cent devaluation of the leu in the past three months and to a further 25
per cent reduction in subsidies on many basic foods due on September 1.
On a more positive note, Mr Danielescu stressed Romania's foreign debt -
Dollars 3.24bn or Dollars 141 per capita - remained low and compared
favourably with Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary, where per capita debt exceeded
Dollars 1,200.
He was also encouraged by growth in exports, up 21 per cent against last
year's period.

FT  27 JUL 92 / European Bonds: Bundesbank fails to erase fears of interest
rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's government bond markets remain volatile as the recent increase in
Germany's discount rate failed to erase fears of further rate rises by the
Bundesbank, and left higher-yielding European markets particularly
vulnerable.
Mixed German economic data last week took its toll on the bund market. On
Wednesday, money supply figures showed annualised M3 growth slipping to 8.7
per cent in June from a revised 8.8 per cent in May - well above the
Bundesbank's target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
The markets have speculated about further increases in German rates -
specifically the Lombard rate - although some economists say that after the
Bundesbank raised the discount rate from 8.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent on
July 16, a further rise in German rates is unlikely.
More favourable were inflation figures for three western German states last
week. The July annual inflation rate for Baden-Wurttemberg fell to 3.2 per
cent from 4.2 per cent in June, while in Hesse, it fell from 3.7 to 2.7 per
cent, and in North Rhine-Westphalia from 4.3 to 3.3 per cent. With Bavaria
still to report, economists expect western German inflation to fall below 4
per cent in July.
Meanwhile, tensions within the ERM are playing havoc with some Mediterranean
markets. On Thursday, Spain increased its key intervention rate from 12.4 to
13 per cent - following spending cuts and tax increases earlier in the week
 -pushing up yields on Spanish government bonds.
The lira has come under speculative pressure during the last month, with the
markets wondering nervously if it will be devalued - forcing the Bank of
Italy to raise interest rates. The Italian bond market has see-sawed wildly
recently, and last week was no exception with continuing devaluation fears.
News that the main credit rating agencies were considering downgrading some
state-controlled enterprises did not help sentiment.
Tensions within the ERM seem likely to remain as the spectre of higher
interest rates hangs over European bond markets and ahead of the French
referendum.

The airline hopes the move will help its shares climb out of the narrow

the end of the Gulf war in February 1991.
SIA's shareholding structure restricts trading: about 100 shareholders
control 91.6 per cent of the airline. Local analysts said a bonus issue
would make SIA shares more liquid. With more shares available for trading,
prices could be expected to rise.

'The board of Uni Storebrand has this afternoon accepted Jan Erik

Storebrand said.
Mr Langangen has been criticised for letting Uni Storebrand buy 28 per cent

Nordic Co-operation Pact. This plan has so far failed and it is not clear
what Uni Storebrand will do with its stake in Skandia.

<TEXT>
ZALE Corporation, the world's largest jewellery retailer which in January
sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy
code, last week filed a reorganisation plan with the Dallas courts.
The move came as Zale revealed net losses of Dollars 960m for the year to
end-March, compared with losses of Dollars 54m in the previous 12 months.
However, the losses were struck after a Dollars 811m provision for asset
write-downs and restructuring expenses associated with the bankruptcy. Sales
last year totalled Dollars 1.16bn, compared with Dollars 1.33bn.
The official creditors' committee is supporting the plan, along with banks
and trade creditors. Under the plan, Zale's operating subsidiaries would be
consolidated and much of the group's debt would be swapped for equity in the
reorganised business.
Zale also said Swarovski International, a big shareholder in Zale since
1986, is 'very interested' in participating in the reorganisation.
'Swarovski has advised Zale that it would like to purchase a substantial
amount of equity in the reorganised company,' said the Dallas-based company.
SIH is a Zurich-based vehicle for the wealthy Austrian Swarovski family, The
other leading shareholder in Zale is Peoples Jewellers of Toronto.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Deal signals moves to fly in formation: Implications for
Europe's regional aircraft business of the agreement to transfer Fokker into
German hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Freedom Snack bar, run by an ex-convict in The Hague, the Dutch capital,
had a busy night last Thursday. It fed the nocturnal appetites of three men
debating a Fl 1bn (Pounds 312m) deal in the foreign ministry next door.
Their eventual agreement, secured on Friday morning after 20 hours of talks,
opened the way for the transfer of one of the Netherlands' flagship
companies into German hands. It could also trigger a consolidation of the
regional aircraft industry, which makes short-range aircraft, most of them
for the domestic US market.
Officially, the talks were a three-way affair between Fokker, the Dutch
aircraft maker, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, and the Dutch
government, whose 32 per cent stake in Fokker gave it a veto on any deal to
sell the company.
In reality, they pitted the Dutch government against Mr Jurgen Schrempp and
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, the chairmen of Dasa and Fokker.
Across a table on the ninth floor of the foreign ministry building in The
Hague, the two men pressed Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economic affairs
minister, to agree to Dasa taking a 51 per cent stake in Fokker. Mr
Andriessen wanted guarantees that Fokker would not become a screwdriver
plant run from Dasa's Munich headquarters.
Mr Andriessen eventually, and grudgingly, agreed on a timetable for the
Dutch government to surrender its influence on the new Dasa-Fokker holding
company. The industrialists were delighted. In the words of Mr Nederkoorn:
'Fokker will become the Airbus of the regional aircraft market in which
other companies will participate.'
Important details - even the price - have yet to be agreed. 'Price did not
play a role in the negotiations,' said Mr Andriessen. The talks were about
the structure of Europe's aerospace industry and the role to be played by
Fokker.
There are also regulatory obstacles still to overcome, and delays are still
possible from the Dutch parliament or European Commission competition
watchdogs. But there is little doubt that the regional aircraft market is
ripe for an Airbus-style grouping, in which many manufacturers contribute to
a single range of aircraft.
The industry is dogged by overcapacity, with nine different manufacturers
having sold more than 100 aircraft each into the huge US market. That
overcapacity has led many manufacturers into financial difficulties.
Companies such as British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Sweden's
Saab have been forced to consider partnerships to survive.
Fokker had more to worry about than many. It has already been rescued by the
Dutch government, in 1987, and its successful Fokker 100 aircraft needs
heavy capital investment for 70-seater and 130-seater versions to be
developed.
In the forefront of partnership moves across the industry is Dasa, just
three years old and owned by Germany's biggest industrial group,
Daimler-Benz. It was established as an umbrella for the country's fragmented
aerospace industry and has since entered into a series of international
alliances for helicopters, satellites and aero-engines.
Last November, Dasa formed the Regioliner regional jet consortium with
Aerospatiale and Alenia of Italy. Fokker believes that the French and
Italians will take stakes in the new Dasa-Fokker company and that the Fokker
100 will form the core of the consortium's model range.
The arrival of Fokker in the Dasa camp brings one step closer the creation
of a genuine giant in regional aircraft.
Regioliner is dominated by Dasa and could provide the sought-for focus for
the German company's disparate activities. And, if successful, Regioliner
could face only dishevelled and dispirited rivals struggling to find
partners. BAe, which last month relaunched its loss-making regional
aircraft, said yesterday it was 'still pursuing talks leading to a joint
venture or a merger, not necessarily in Europe'.
BAe may be hoping that the Dasa-Fokker deal hits trouble. This happened in
1969 when Fokker merged with VFW, now part of Dasa. The partnership was
dissolved in 1978 amid recriminations over the flop of a new 44-seater
aeroplane, the VFW 614.
Nor is opposition dead within the Netherlands. Dutch politicians and trade
unions remain worried about 'carving up' Fokker among the Germans, French
and Italians.
This disquiet springs from many sources. Unlike the fruitfulness of
Anglo-Dutch partnerships, which have produced big groups such as Unilever
and Royal Dutch/Shell, there is no tradition of successful corporate
alliances between Dutch and German companies. At the same time, lingering
resentment resulting from the Second World War, combined with the natural
wariness of a small country for a powerful neighbour, charges the takeover
with emotion and politics.
But everyone in the regional aircraft industry is aware of what happened to
big aircraft makers. This once bustling business is now dominated by just
three companies: Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell-Douglas.
They know that the regional aircraft industry needs fewer competitors,
Fokker needs a big brother and Dasa wants to become a mature business. Some
in the Netherlands fear that the deal means the beginning for the end for
Fokker. Some in Germany hope it is the end of the beginning for Dasa.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Economics Notebook: Obstacles on the road to growth in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Straight-line projections of past trends are almost always wrong, but with
that caveat in mind consider this one: in a little more than 20 years China
could have an economy as large as the US.
In terms of income per head it will, of course, lag America by a
considerable margin. It may only be of the order of USDollars 7,000 (Pounds
3,665) per head. But, by 2015 China will be well on the way to being the
most important economy in the world.
So, what are the assumptions? China's potential growth rate is the sum of
the growth in its workforce plus growth in productivity. The sum of these
two ought also to represent its non-inflationary growth path.
Mr Enzio von Pfeil, economist at Smith New Court in Hong Kong, expects the
workforce to grow by about 3 per cent and productivity by about 12 per cent.
For the US he estimated 1.7 per cent for civilian labour force growth and
1.5 per cent for productivity to give a potential growth rate for the US of
more than 3 per cent.
On the basis of these assumptions the real value of both the US and Chinese
economies reaches USDollars 10,000bn in 2015; during 2016 China overtakes
America.
Now back to the real world. China's economy is overheating. It seems set to
ride the boom phase of the 'boom-bust' cycle that has been a hallmark of the
Chinese economy since Beijing embarked on market-oriented economic reform in
1978.
In the first half of this year gross domestic product (GDP) was 10.6 per
cent higher than in the first half of 1991. Industrial production, on the
same basis, was up 18.2 per cent, and consumer spending was 14 per cent
higher over the same period.
China's nation-wide inflation rate in June was 5 per cent. But that national
figure disguises inflationary pressures where they matter most  - in the
cities. In May, three major Chinese cities, including Guangzhou (Canton),
had inflation rates above 20 per cent. That month inflation in the country's
35 main cities was more than 10 per cent and in June it accelerated to 10.5
per cent.
Some mainland Chinese commentators are sanguine. In the face of steep price
rises there was no 'sign of panic buying and people rushing to withdraw
savings from banks as predicted by economists,' wrote one Chinese
commentator in a recent issue of China Economic News. Well, no sign yet.
The desire for faster economic growth has become an article of faith for the
country's ageing leadership.
Just over a week ago it became Chinese government policy to strive for
annual real growth of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent a year for the rest
of this decade. If successful, China will have managed to double the size of
its economy by 1999.
But, at the current stage of its development the World Bank estimates that
China can probably not grow faster than 6 per cent a year - its estimate for
the long-run trend growth of total factor productivity - without inflation
getting out of hand. This is the growth rate which Mr Li Peng, China's prime
minister, also supports but he has clearly lost the argument.
The main constraints to China's growth and the sources of inflation are many
but a number stand out.
The first is monetary. China operates quantitative controls on credit but
its ability to enforce them is weak.
In the first half of the year China's banks made loans worth Yn120bn - twice
the government's original target. Much of this credit is being pumped into
the country's inefficient state industrial sector.
In the first three months of this year, money supply was rising at an annual
rate of 31.6 per cent. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of
accelerating growth and the highest quarterly reading since 1988 when the
economy last came unstuck.
China also had a problem with its budget deficit. At around 3.5 per cent of
GDP the deficit mainly reflects subsidies to state industries and the
country's urban population which receives virtually free housing, education
and health.
Although it sells government bonds to finance the deficit, it does not
sterilise the deficit. The massive loans to state industry are the result of
printing money; in effect, China monetises its deficit.
The second is infrastructure. Take road and rail. China is a little larger
in area than the US but its road network is equal to only 16 per cent of
that in the US while the length of its rail network is 23 per cent of the US
network.
The road network is poor, and the rail network is operating at full
capacity. With a quarter of the capacity of the US, China's railways ship
about 70 per cent of what the US transports by rail a year. Although China
is the biggest coal producer in the world power plants in Guangdong have to
import coal.
Electricity generation is another major constraint on China's growth. Simply
to satisfy current demand and eliminate shortages China needs to increase
its generating capacity by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent from its
current level of around 140,000MW.
China plans to increase capacity to 200,000MW by 1995 and to add another
40,000MW by the end of the century. But it has to run fast simply to stand
still.
However, the biggest constraint on China realising its full potential for
growth is political. Although China has liberalised many goods markets, it
is fearful of liberalising that nation's biggest market: the market for
labour.
The country's urban labour market is tightly controlled through a system of
urban registration with the police. Workers are tied to their place of work
which provides them with housing, health and educational services.
The cost of providing these services, especially in the state industrial
sector, is costing China dearly.
Yet the solutions to the problem - freeing the labour market, instituting
sensible housing reforms, and lifting the burden of the state from the backs
of the people are still distant prospects.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Wellcome to sell 270m shares at 800p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME Trust last night set an 800p price for the sale of shares in
Wellcome, the drug company, bringing to a successful conclusion the biggest
non-privatisation share sale ever mounted.
The price compares with Friday's close of 826p and was considered a narrow
discount given the size of the issue and the recent difficult market
conditions.
Depending on last-minute fine-tuning, the trust will sell 270m shares. The
sale will raise Pounds 2.1bn after paying Pounds 75m to the banks and
brokers who organised the global sale.
The sale was completed in spite of the poor state of equity markets in the
UK, US and Japan during the period of the offer and the possibility of
hostilities breaking out in the Gulf again as the offer was closing on
Friday.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the trust, said the sale would increase the
medical charity's annual income to around Pounds 220m which 'will be of
great benefit to medical research'.
When the trust first announced its plan to reduce its stake in Wellcome from
73.5 per cent to less than 50 per cent, the shares stood at Pounds 11.26.
The trust considered cutting its stake to 25 per cent through the sale of
417m shares. In June it indicated the offer would be of 330m shares.
Although the trust had bids for 360m shares it decided to cut back the sale
to ensure a successful aftermarket. If it sells 270m shares it will still
hold 42 per cent of the company's equity.
Trading in the shares will start at 8.30 this morning. Robert Fleming, the
merchant bank co-ordinating the sale, has allocated an extra 40m shares
under the 'green-shoe' option. It can stabilise the share price by buying up
to 40m shares until August 26 if the price falls below 800p. If it buys back
less than 40m shares the sale will, in effect, have been increased.
Last night Fleming was finalising allocations to investors who put in
tenders for the shares. UK institutions were slightly favoured and about 60
per cent of the shares will go to them. US investors will receive about 23
per cent, although they made 25 per cent of the bids. Japanese investors
will take about 5 per cent with the rest divided between other regions and
the UK public offer.
Individual bidders were scaled back according to a number of criteria. Those
who put in bids early were rewarded, and a slight advantage was given to
bidders who were aggressive on price.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Sunday racing gets off to a flying start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON the government to revise the web of laws which constrain
commercial activity on the sabbath in Britain increased yesterday when more
than 20,000 people attended the country's first Sunday horse race meeting at
Doncaster.
Shetland pony races, brass bands, a fashion show, a Scud missile display,
children's games and a parade by former racing favourites, including Red Rum
and Desert Orchid, contributed to a carnival atmosphere.
The racing, in which jockeys Lester Piggot, Willie Carson and Steve Cauthen
took part, produced some exciting finishes too.
The course management, selected by the Jockey Club to stage the event, was
able to charge admission without breaking the 1780 Sunday Observance Act by
laying on musical entertainment. But the 1963 Betting, Gaming and Lotteries
Act explicitly bars on-course Sunday betting, and so all betting at the
track was banned - a move enforced by surveillance and an undercover police
operation.
Anyone at the course wanting to bet had to telephone off-track to bookmakers
or the Tote.
The Horse Race Totalisator Board said the afternoon's seven races generated
Pounds 117,000 in bets to the Tote, mostly from people telephoning from
home. A comparable non-Sunday event at Doncaster would, he said, have
resulted in bets of about Pounds 200,000. Most of yesterday's crowd seemed
content, or at least resigned, not to bet. The bookies' area was turned over
to children's entertainments.
The Doncaster management, which had budgeted for a 17,000-strong crowd, was
delighted with the attendance and the good-natured atmosphere.
In a small nod to Sabbatarians, a short service was held at noon with
prayers and communal singing of Abide with Me.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Rowland set to head Lloyd's: Sedgwick chief's appointment
will boost confidence in troubled market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID ROWLAND, the chairman of Sedgwick, the UK's second biggest
insurance broker, is expected to become chairman of Lloyd's of London. His
appointment would probably boost confidence and spur reform at the troubled
insurance market.
The outgoing chairman, Mr David Coleridge, will today endorse Mr Rowland as
his successor to the top job at Lloyd's at an extraordinary general meeting
called by dissatisfied Names. It is the first Lloyd's EGM in a decade.
Mr Rowland will have to be first elected to the 28-man council, the Lloyd's
governing body, which will select the new chairman from among its own number
in December. But the council is already understood to have signalled its
full support for Mr Rowland. He is understood to have accepted the job in
principle, a full-time paid post lasting for three years and beginning on
January 1 1993.
Mr Coleridge will leave as planned in December after two years in the job.
The changeover will be welcomed by many at Lloyd's. Leading agencies and
brokers as well as the Association of Lloyd's Members, a moderate group
which represents over a third of the market's 22,300 Names, the individuals
whose assets support the insurance market's capital, are all likely backers.
At today's EGM, Mr Neil Shaw, newly elected ALM chairman, will speak in
favour of a motion, backed by the ALM, which urges the council to press
ahead with implementing reforms recommended in January by a market task
force led by Mr Rowland.
The task force advocated the modification of the principle of unlimited
liability - by which Names are liable for all insurance losses - and the
introduction of corporate capital to Lloyd's.
Task force recommendations that the regulation of Lloyd's be separated from
day-to-day governance were echoed in the conclusions of a second committee,
headed by Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds bank chairman, earlier this month.
Mr Shaw said yesterday that it was 'fundamental' to have a new leadership
team in place 'as quickly as possible'. He warned that Lloyd's dissidents
would send the wrong signals to Lloyd's bankers and policyholders if they
win motions which the dissidents have tabled at the EGM. Names would trigger
a 'meltdown' if they voted to overturn a levy needed to boost the market's
central fund, he added.
The fund, recently increased from Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn, pays claims
when Names are unable to meet their obligations.
The proposal is one of four submitted by the dissidents who called for the
EGM last month. But voting will be by postal ballot, with the result not
known until the end of next month.
Mr Claude Gurney, a Name who heads the dissident group, described Mr Shaw's
allegation as 'baloney'.
He said that, even if names were to vote in favour of his resolution, the
Lloyd's council or governing body would not be legally obliged to implement
the decision. Lloyd's should consider other ways in which the levy could be
more fairly distributed.

FT  27 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With tensions mounting over Iraq, Friday might have seemed an odd day for
the gold price to go into reverse after its recent run. But finding a
plausible rationalisation for gyrations in the price of the barbaric metal
is increasingly difficult.
The mini-boom since early summer was supposed, in part, to have been
inspired by the weakness of the dollar and a consequent increase in gold's
safe haven attractions. Yet the safe haven theory derived little support
from gold's muted euphoria during the Gulf crisis. Nor should it have, given
the success of the financial services industry in devising less cumbersome
hedges against uncertainty.
Recently, gold is said to have derived strength from the weakness of global
equities. Yet sagging equity prices reflect worries about debt deflation.
The opportunity cost of holding a non-income producing asset in a period of
high real interest rates is high; and where, as in Britain, inflation is
falling faster than interest rates, the opportunity cost becomes higher by
the day.
If there is a case for real assets in the current climate, it is easier to
make for income-producing real estate. In the bombed-out UK property market,
the average yield on all properties at 9.3 per cent shows a positive
half-point margin over long gilts.
The snag in looking at property as a fixed-income investment lies in the
residual value attaching to land at the end of the 25-year institutional
lease. In the absence of land price inflation, the comparison with gilts may
prove optimistic.

FT  27 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid battles aside, the recent history of the UK clearing banks has been
dominated by disappointment about the scale of domestic bad debt provisions.
There is unlikely to be much relief when the banks start reporting interim
results. Barclays, thanks to its relatively low rate of provisioning in the
past and its well-publicised problems with Heron, Mountleigh and Olympia &amp;
York, is likely to report a sharp increase in provisions compared with the
Pounds 639m set aside in last year's second half. Abbey National's
provisions are also likely to rise, while the absence of economic recovery
means other banks will show only modest falls at best.
So much for the recovery hopes with which investors consoled themselves
after last year's poor results. The longer term trend in provisions is
difficult to predict. By and large,the market's record has been one of
excessive optimism. To be sure, there are one or two hopeful signs on the
horizon, not least a slight fall in administrative receiverships. BZW
calculates that cumulative provisions at the four largest clearers now
average 3.1 per cent of loans outstanding, a ratio which has more than
tripled over the past five years. It might thus be legitimate to ask whether
provisions need to continue at such a high level
Unfortunately, the overwhelming impression is that they easily could. The
stock market hardly reflects a picture of glowing corporate health. There is
no sign of interest rates coming down and the property market remains
depressed. For the year as a whole, there is scant reason why interest rates
should fall much, if at all, and the chances are that any decline in 1993
will only be gradual.
The outcome may, of course, vary from bank to bank. Midland's loan book grew
more slowly in the late-1980s than those of its three main competitors and
its provisions rose faster with the onset of the recession, so it may have
dealt with the problem earlier. Lloyds has the offsetting benefit of a large
surplus in its developing country debt provisions, while National
Westminster will at least be able to show a sharp drop in provisions on its
US business.
The more general consolation is that the slow growth in lending will prevent
any threat to capital ratios. That said, only lacklustre growth can be
expected in operating income, from which the provisions have to be financed.
Not only have retail fees and charges been raised just about as far as the
market will bear; there is also increasing competitive pressure in the
hitherto lucrative life insurance market. Net interest income is being
squeezed on the one side by a rise in the volume of non-performing loans and
on the other by the higher cost of retail deposits. That leaves a redoubled
effort on cost control as the banks' main hope for earnings growth.

FT  27 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The fear of failure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the trough of the last recession, according to the corporate analysts
Syspas, 23 per cent of UK-quoted industrial companies were at risk of
failure. The figure now is 26 per cent. Among construction companies, it is
an unnerving 65 per cent. If the economy does not pick up materially in the
next two years, Syspas says, the resulting failures will cost the banks up
to Pounds 1.8bn in bad loans and creditors another Pounds 2bn on top.
Since Syspas privately described Maxwell Communication as 'beyond saving in
its present form' at a time when the equity market still valued it at over
Pounds 1bn, it perhaps deserves to be taken seriously. Its method is based
on the familiar US technique of Z-scores, which establishes common
characteristics for bankrupt companies and seeks to identify them elsewhere.
The system produced dire predictions about Lowndes Queensway, Turriff,
Graham Wood and Astra, all of which have since gone under. Syspas claims to
have scented the present recession as early as the start of 1989, on the
grounds that balance sheets had started to deteriorate despite the fact that
profits were still rising.
Since then, the number of companies at risk has increased faster than in the
recession of 1980-81. The rise continues, which suggests the economy is
still getting worse.
For the equity market, there is perhaps one ray of comfort in all this.
Experience suggests that companies with poor Z-scores - that is, at high
risk of failure - underperform the market in an economic decline and
outperform in a recovery. It should therefore follow that the worse mess the
corporate sector is in, the greater scope there is for a market bounce.
This may help to explain why the construction sector should be on a
seemingly ludicrous historic multiple of 42, three times the industrial
average. But the pressing question is not how sharp the bounce will be. It
is rather how far the market falls before it turns; and which companies will
still be around by then.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Rail privatisation so complex, performance will not

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Bob Reid was understandably non-committal about the government's
proposals for the reorganisation of British Rail (Personal View: 'A
challenge to us all', July 17). But the proposals must represent the most
extraordinary gamble that a government has taken with the organisation of
transport in Britain: an untried division of financial responsibility and
operation is to be combined with an untried form of ownership, and the
decision to adopt this structure has been taken before an analysis of its
feasibility has been undertaken. Now the white paper has been published,
consultants are to start studying the problems of allocating paths on the
railway tracks to competing services and of charging for the use of the
track. If there were no practicable solutions to these problems, government
policy would be unworkable.
Ministers appear to have picked on franchising as a means of getting private
sector involvement in running the railways without surrendering ownership -
because they could not agree how the railways should be sold. They do not
seem to have understood that a franchise requires a long-term commitment,
because entrepreneurs want some security for their efforts: so franchising
is not a preliminary to privatisation but an alternative. They will have to
make up their minds which they want to adopt.
The results of this gamble will not become clear for several years, until
the work that should have preceded the white paper has been completed and
until the demand for franchises has been established. Uncertainty about the
feasibility of the white paper policies implies that radical changes in
policies may have to be made; the white paper may be yet another consigned
to the dustbin.
The tragedy of the government's policies is that an opportunity to move
British Rail wholly into the private sector has been lost; and BR's
management will be devoting most of its efforts to making a complex new
organisation work, rather than to improving the performance of the railways.
The traveller is liable to lose on the deal, and there is some danger that
the taxpayer will also lose, because the government may have to buy the
services of the franchisees with subsidies.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Windows thrown open in a suffocating room: The Israeli
government is winning friends in the US and the Arab world with its peace
and settlements initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Israel's new government moves into its third week in office tomorrow, its
supporters are asking themselves how long Mr Yitzhak Rabin's remarkable
honeymoon as prime minister can last. The weekend's ebb and flow of tension
between Iraq and the UN illustrates how conflict can all too easily
supersede talk of peace in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the transformation since Mr Rabin took over has been
impressive. Only a few weeks ago, under Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the previous
prime minister, the country seemed to scowl at the rest of the world,
stubbornly refusing to loosen its grip on the occupied Arab territories. At
loggerheads with the US, its greatest ally and financial prop, Israel
excited little sympathy even from its friends.
Mr Rabin's arrival at the head of coalition led by the Labour party has
changed all that remarkably quickly. Within days of the government's
installation, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, was in Jerusalem,
conferring amiably with Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister,
and publicly praising their commitment to Middle East peace talks.
In particular, Mr Baker welcomed their willingness to curb Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories, the issue which, more than any
other, had soured relations between Washington and Mr Shamir. The juicy
reward of Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees to aid absorption of mass
immigration from the former Soviet Union - sought in vain by Mr Shamir  -
now seems assured.
The day after Mr Baker was in town, Mr Rabin was warmly welcomed in Cairo by
President Hosni Mubarak, an honour the Egyptian leader never extended to Mr
Shamir. And in a week or two, the prime minister is off to the US to see
President Bush at his Kennebunkport holiday home. Chummy tennis games (Mr
Rabin is a keen player) and boat rides are likely to be the public image of
the meeting - unthinkable in the days when Mr Bush and Mr Shamir spoke
through clenched teeth.
The change has largely been welcomed by Israelis: all the mainstream
newspapers are backing Mr Rabin's initiatives. The opposition - especially
Mr Shamir's battered Likud party - is still reeling from Labour's June
election victory. Many government supporters bubble over with enthusiasm,
now that the long years of battling with what seemed the Likud's eternal
supremacy are over.
'I must tell you I'm so happy about what is happening,' confided a woman in
a Jerusalem record store on discovering her customer was a foreign
correspondent.
'There is a great feeling of relief,' said Mr Gideon Rafael, a former
director-general of the foreign ministry. 'It is as though we were a people
suffocating in a closed room when suddenly someone threw open the windows.'
It is not just that people are pleased at the restoration of diplomatic
cordialities. Many of those who backed Labour and Meretz, its left-liberal
ally in government, were afraid that the Likud's dogged ideological
attachment to permanent Israeli rule over the occupied territories was
leading towards a breakdown of the Middle East peace negotiations begun last
October in Madrid. They feared that, ultimately, such a stance would
precipitate another war between Israel and its Arab neighbours.
'I believe we saved the country at the last minute,' said Mr Tzaly Reshef, a
leading figure in the Peace Now movement.
Mr Rabin has not put it in such apocalyptic terms. But he has made it clear
repeatedly since winning the election that he believes that Israel now has
an opportunity to achieve peace with its neighbours and that it must be
seized.
He sees the disappearance of Soviet influence in the region and the military
subjugation of Iraq by the US and its allies as a priceless windfall for
Israel. At the same time, however, hostility to Israel is still latent in
the region and a new threat lies in the nuclear and other advanced weapons
capability that may be accumulated by states such as Iran.
'I believe this situation will not exist forever. Either we exploit it or we
might miss it,' Mr Rabin said shortly after the election. Later he said: 'A
lot depends on what we do in the area of making peace, something which could
help us get international participation, led by the US, in a war against
nuclear arms proliferation.'
Mr Rabin therefore wasted no time in setting out his store: settlements have
been substantially frozen and the Palestinians and Arab states invited to
engage in continuous negotiations based on an ultimate commitment by Israel
to exchange occupied 'land for peace' - the formula Mr Shamir always
rejected.
But the prime minister is canny enough to know that the smooth ride he has
so far enjoyed may give way to rougher terrain. The honeymoon at home is
unlikely to last forever.
So far, the government has been pleasantly surprised by the lack of
effective protests from the heavily armed Jewish settlers. But they still
have the capacity to cause noisy and perhaps violent disruption through
demonstrations both against the government and their Palestinian neighbours.
The Likud, too, will surely regroup. Mr Shamir is set to resign as party
leader. An election for a successor will be held in December in which the
front-runners will be Mr Binyamin Begin, son of the late Menachem Begin,
Likud's great founding hero, and Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, the energetic former
junior minister.
Both profess deep commitment to the Likud ideology and will seek to rally
opposition to what they regard as Mr Rabin's disastrous willingness to make
concessions to the Arabs. Some newspaper commentators have already begun to
voice anxieties that the government's moves on settlements have met only a
cool reception in the region, failing, for example, to elicit any commitment
to end the Arab boycott of trade with Israel in return, as the US has
proposed.
The Arabs remain sceptical of Mr Rabin, auguring difficulty when the peace
talks resume, probably next month. They are unhappy that, despite his
commitment to giving up territory, Mr Rabin has said that it will not happen
before Israelis have had another chance to vote on the question.
Under the structure of the peace talks as they were launched in Madrid,
permanently giving up land will not be at issue until after an interim
settlement with the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza has run for three
years. Therefore, Mr Rabin says, it is almost certain another general
election will be held in Israel before any decision is made on the final
status of the territories.
What Mr Rabin and his allies in Israel are hoping, however, is that an
interim agreement with the Palestinians can be negotiated which will prove
sufficiently successful to persuade Israelis that a reversion to the Likud's
expansionist ideology would be untenable, leaving Labour in the driving seat
for many years to come.

Australia's simmering republicans are sharpening their claws. They have
discovered that acetate - commonly found in nail varnish remover - can be

'Republic now' and 'Caroline Chisholm Rules]', a reference to the 19th

Leaders of the Australian Republican Movement seem unsure how to react.

Still on the subject of women's career prospects (or lack of them), one
wonders how much longer Britain's elderly trade unions can march out of step
with the new look Labour party.
On the same day last week that Labour elected a record number of women to
its front-bench team - it leads the Government five to two on this score -
Diana Warwick resigned as general secretary of the Association of University
Teachers. Not so long ago there were four female trade union bosses. Now
there is only one - Elizabeth Symons of the Association of First Division
Civil Servants.
Sogat's Brenda Dean and Helen McGrath of the National Union of Hosiery and
Knitwear Workers, both lost their jobs as a result of mergers with other
unions and 47-year-old Warwick is off to run the Westminster Foundation for
Democracy. Interestingly, it sounds like Unison, which will be Britain's
biggest union and Europe's largest public service union, will be run by men
even though two-thirds of its executive committee will probably be women.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Davies, the CBI's high profile new director general, has an
intriguing explanation for the bizarre affair of Alison Halford and her
inability to win promotion in the Merseyside police force.
Davies, a former boss of the Audit Commission, blames a manpower control
system operated by the Home Office under which police forces can bid each
year for the right to employ additional officers. Every year some new
constables are allocated. 'There is no provision in the system for police
numbers to fall, ever', says Davies, in a column in last Friday's Evening
Standard.
As a result of this system there are now almost twice as many policemen per
thousand inhabitants in declining Merseyside as in Cambridgeshire, where the
population is growing. Merseyside is the most intensely policed area in the
country. 'No wonder they have to find exotic ways of passing the time', says
Davies.
Indeed, he calculates that if present trends continue there will be only
policemen left in Merseyside 60 years from now and if they do not recruit
any women the force will die out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Readers will no doubt know the old Forces saying: 'Once is happenstance,
twice is coincidence, and three times is enemy action.' While that's fine as
far as it goes, however, what on earth is 607 times?
The question is raised by the response to the problem Observer posed last
Tuesday, about why the small cowboy was grateful when, instead of handing
him the glass of water he'd requested, the giant bartender drew a gun and
fired into the air.
It was tackled by 654 people from 23 countries besides the UK, including a
man from El Paso claiming to be the small cowboy in the case - a claim
which, since he's evidently 5'10' tall and has the scarcely western name of
Keith Pannell, is being taken with a pinch of salt.
Further occupations ranged from an ambassador and an archdeacon, through an
avalanche of chief and other executives as well as their spouses and
offspring, to the secretary general of the International Federation of
Tiddly Winks Associations (no kidding]).
The oddest thing was that, although several of the 654 pointed out that such
lateral thinking problems can have many different answers, no fewer than 607
all hit on the same one. It's that, until the gunshot served as
shock-therapy, the small cowboy had been suffering from hiccoughs. And as
the other suggestions, albeit ingenious, seem less plausible, the prize of a
bottle of malt goes to the first of the 607 out of the hat: Stephen Allen of
Britannia Airways.
But that still left Observer wondering how more than nine in every 10
entrants hit on an identical solution - until the latish arrival of an entry
from a certain Paul Sloane. Yet another opting for hiccoughs as the answer,
he adds: 'It appears in my book Lateral Thinking Puzzlers published in 1991
by Sterling in the US and by Cassell in the UK.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: MMC must find solution to gas pipeline returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN POWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report 'British Gas to separate top jobs' (July 23) quotes the
chief executive (designate) as not ruling out a referral to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission if no agreement is reached about rate of return on
pipeline assets.
From the customers' point of view, a referral is overdue. Only the MMC can
adjudicate between recent conflicting judgments by OFT, Ofgas and
government.
The effect on an integrated industry of these piecemeal decisions, and of
British Gas's meek acceptance of all of them, is likely to be higher gas
prices for industry, commerce and households. The two main reasons are
these:
British Gas accepted Ofgas's setting of a tough value of X, in the (RPI  -
X) domestic price cap formula, on a basis of planned cost-saving programmes
and of earnings from a large market share. That share has been sharply
reduced by OFT edict, in the industrial market, and by a government decision
to lower the volume threshold of household supply monopoly. The case for
price cap review, in British Gas's favour and against the consumer interest,
is worryingly strong while British Gas also faces additional costs in a
separate pipeline and storage unit.
About 50 per cent of gas sales to industry are by interruptible contract. It
is popular with customers, because it is cheap, and it is valuable but not
essential to British Gas as a means of meeting peak domestic demand. But it
is of no present interest to competitors; British Gas cannot substantially
reduce its share of the industrial market except by putting up the price of
interruptible gas.
Paradoxically, the government's headlong rush to introduce competition is
accompanied by risk of higher prices. Sir James McKinnon, director-general
of Ofgas, cannot allow a high rate of return if, in consequence, British
Gas's marketing arm faces extra costs for carrying gas along the pipelines
of the separate transportation unit, created by OFT, which it will be
entitled to pass on to consumers. The MMC must look at the apparently
different objectives of the three regulatory players to find a solution that
is in the public interest.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Too lean for a long life: Edward Balls asks whether the UK's
manufacturing sector is strong enough to respond to economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's manufacturing industry may be lean, fit and competitive; but it is
getting leaner by the week. After two deep recessions in little more than a
decade, the UK's export industries may be too small to sustain anything more
than sluggish recovery.
The government's anti-inflation medicine is certainly hurting. The recession
started in the service sector; but, as it has lingered, the damage to
industry has grown more severe. Manufacturing output has fallen by 7.8 per
cent since the recession began, a fall three times deeper than that in
service sector output. In the past fortnight, two more machine tool
companies - the Beaver group and Matrix Churchill - have gone into
receivership.
Yet the cries of pain from Britain's manufacturers have been surprisingly
muted. The latest economic forecast from the Engineering Employers
Federation paints a gloomy picture of falling employment and sluggish growth
over the next 12 months. But most industrialists support the government's
low inflation strategy and want to stay in the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Neil Johnson, the federation's new director-general, is typical. A
'short-term quick fix' would be counter-productive, however attractive. 'It
is vital for 'UK plc' that we remain in the ERM at the current level and get
as close to the heart of the European market as possible.'
Why are manufacturers so confident that they can endure the pain? Many
believe that in the 1980s the efficiency and competitiveness of British
manufacturing industry was transformed. Productivity grew by an average 5
per cent a year, compared with just 0.9 per cent between 1975 and 1980. Only
Japan, among the main industrialised countries, had a superior productivity
growth record. Profitability was higher than at any time since the
mid-1960s; and Britain became a magnet for foreign investment.
Even the performance of the export sector has improved since 1981, relative
to that in previous decades. The share of UK manufacturing in total world
exports stabilised after 1982, albeit at a sharply reduced level in
comparison with the early 1970s. Mr Bill Martin, economist at UBS Phillips
and Drew, finds that the responsiveness of UK export volumes to changes in
world trade was greater than at any time after 1955.
'British industry achieved considerable success under the industrial
policies governments pursued in the 1980s,' argues Mr Walter Eltis,
director-general of the National Economic Development Office and soon to be
chief economic adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary. Falling capital investment must impede the rejuvenation of
British industrial competitiveness. But for optimists such as Mr Eltis, it
is a price worth paying for low and stable inflation.
'ERM membership together with a reduction in UK inflation to the best levels
achieved in Europe will create the underlying economic environment for a
sustained and durable period of expansion,' he argues.
There are dissenting voices. Mr Martin Taylor, managing director of
Bridgeport, one of the UK's largest machine tool companies, fears that the
recession and the accompanying collapse in investment are doing 'irrevocable
and irretrievable' damage. 'If you do not invest, you do not compete . . .
You cannot stop investing for three years and then expect to be competitive
when the recovery comes.'
Mr Taylor wants more than just ministerial stroking from the new management
at the Department of Trade and Industry. A package of investment incentives
to help recovery would be better. But even Mr Taylor refuses to join the
growing chorus of economists calling for a sterling devaluation.
Yet how sound are the achievements of the 1980s? Is manufacturing industry
in a state to lead a sustained upturn when consumer spending picks up?
Productivity growth was rapid. But the bulk of the gain in output per head
was achieved by shedding jobs rather than increasing output and investment.
Manufacturing employment has fallen by a third since 1979, while the real
value of manufacturing output only recovered to 1979 levels in 1987. The
share of manufacturing output, relative to gross domestic product, has
shrunk from 28.2 per cent in 1979 to 22.4 per cent in 1991.
Most of this loss in output occurred during the last recession when a
sterling appreciation, encouraged by North Sea oil output and high interest
rates, reduced export competitiveness of manufacturing by 50 per cent in
four years. Despite some gains in the 1980s, exports remain much less
cost-competitive than in the 1960s or 1970s.
A harder look at the international comparisons shows that the UK still lags
on measures other than cost competitiveness. While UK productivity was
catching up with its competitors, it started a long way behind. German
manufacturing productivity was 151 per cent of British levels in 1979. Even
in 1990, it was still 19 per cent higher.
More worryingly, UK productivity gains were dissipated through high real
wages. 'The 1980s were an excellent decade for living standards for the
great majority of those associated with industry, whether they were workers,
managers or shareholders,' says Mr Eltis. But the British paid themselves so
well that it was not profitable enough to invest in the UK in sufficient
quantities to arrest the shrinkage of the manufacturing sector.
Real wages in UK manufacturing grew at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in the
1980s, outstripping real wage growth in all the UK's five largest
industrialised competitors. A recent NEDC study of the UK engineering
industry finds that the share of value-added output paid to employees in
1989 was still higher than in Germany, France, Italy or Japan, though not
the US.
Not surprisingly, the rate of return on capital remained lower than in any
of these five countries, in spite of the partial recovery in UK profits.
Business investment also grew more slowly in Britain.
Britain's manufacturing industry, provider of just over 60 per cent of UK
export earnings, consequently remained too small to support its citizens'
appetite for imports. The manufacturing trade deficit increased during the
decade as the growth of import volumes outstripped exports. While the
1980-81 recession produced a current account surplus of 5 per cent of GDP,
after eight quarters of recession the current account is in deficit by
nearly 2 per cent of GDP.
The shrunken manufacturing sector and the existence of a trade deficit, at
the bottom of the recession, suggest that the UK economy may experience
difficulties when the recovery finally arrives. 'A consumer-led expansion
without manufacturing investment would generate imports without the means to
pay for them,' argues Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser at the EEF.
Unless those imports are predominantly capital goods, the foreign exchange
markets may become nervous at a growing deficit and demand higher interest
rates to compensate for the devaluation risk. 'The size of the manufacturing
sector will be a constraint on the pace of the recovery through the balance
of payments,' he says.
Implicitly, Mr Thompson is arguing that sterling is overvalued within the
ERM: UK real wages relative to other countries are too high to make it
profitable for enough companies to sell produce in Britain at the current
exchange rate.
Is sterling overvalued? The simple answer is that nobody knows. Most of the
standard tests of exchange rate overvaluation confuse, rather than
enlighten, the debate. Model simulations of the exchange rate needed to
maintain a sustainable pattern of capital inflows point towards
overvaluation. But the recent forecasting record of macro-economists does
not inspire confidence in their models.
Purchasing power parity exchange rate measures add little value. The PPP
method estimates an exchange rate at which traded goods prices would be
equivalent in different countries. On this basis, sterling is correctly
valued against other European countries, but overvalued against the US
dollar.
Yet currencies often diverge for years from these notional PPP rates, which
tend to bear little relation to trade performance. Calculations by Goldman
Sachs, the US investment bank, suggest that the only time the dollar was
correctly valued in the last 15 years was in 1984-85, when it was at the
peak of a speculative bubble, and the trade deficit was growing.
Nor does the fact that industrialists are not complaining about the value of
sterling add much of interest. The only reason they are still producing is
that they are profitable at that exchange rate. They might complain about
changes in the rate, but not the level itself. The businesses that might be
producing at a lower real exchange rate have gone.
Overvaluation does not imply that existing manufacturers are on the verge of
bankruptcy, but that they are too thin on the ground. The shrunken size of
the manufacturing sector, the unusual phenomenon of a substantial trade
deficit at the bottom of a recession, the high level of UK long-term
interest rates and the reliance on short-term capital inflows to fund the
deficit, all these suggest overvaluation.
The feeble performance of the export sector during the recession also
suggests that British companies have found it difficult to shift production
to foreign markets as domestic demand has fallen. There have been
exceptions: annual car export volumes rose by 183 per cent between 1988 and
1991. But cars make up less than 5 per cent of total exports. Overall, the
UK export performance has been disappointing, particularly in comparison
with Japan, where companies have responded to sluggish domestic demand
growth by boosting exports. Japanese export volumes grew 5 per cent in 1991
compared with 6.4 per cent in the US and 0.7 per cent in the UK.
Whether a sterling devaluation would reduce UK real wages or simply generate
higher inflation to offset the gains in cost competitiveness is another
matter. But until recovery comes, economists can only guess how long foreign
exchange markets will tolerate a large UK current account deficit. As Mr
Thompson explains: 'Ultimately the only way you can measure it is to see
whether the export capacity grows to meet the import demand that the
recovery brings.' When, that is, recovery finally arrives.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Spending: a new try
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two out of every five pounds spent in the UK come from central and local
government. Sixteen years ago the proportion was Pounds 5 out of every
Pounds 10. You do not have to be a rugged opponent of all collective
spending to realise that the present proportion is high enough, or to
realise how easily we could drift back to the proportions of the mid-1970s,
or even higher. You only have to listen to the large number of claims by
pressure groups un-critically reported on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 3 every
morning saying that this or that worthy cause needs to have much more spent
upon it.
There is no uniquely right method of controlling the public purse. Since the
Plowden committee reported in the early 1960s, there have been periodic
shake-ups in the system. As spending departments have become adept at
working one control system to their advantage, the Treasury has devised new
systems which they may not immediately be able to exploit. Thus, most of the
reforms are welcome; but there is no point in going over the top and
disparaging the previous system whenever a new one is introduced.
Just as predictably, the popular media become excited by talks of 'cuts',
when there have been no overall cuts since the Labour government negotiated
with the IMF in the mid-1970s. The so-called cuts are simply reductions in
planned rates of increase. If there are cuts in specific programmes - such
as unpledged social security benefits - it will be to make room for larger
increases elsewhere, eg in health and education.
Ever since Plowden, public spending plans have been based on rolling forward
looks. The problems arise in translating these projections into hard plans
for the year immediately ahead. In recent years, the cabinet has tended to
take the tentative cash total in the projection for the year immediately
ahead and ask ministers to stick as close to it as possible. Bids for up to
Pounds 14bn more have been made in most years, as a matter of political
virility, and the Treasury has usually managed to cut down these excess bids
by about two-thirds, sometimes with the aid of a group of senior ministers
called the Star Chamber.
Public spending will always be a compromise between a top-down and bottom-up
approach. The new system announced by the British chancellor, Norman Lamont,
on Thursday is a round in favour of top-down. The cabinet will agree every
year on a firm ceiling; and the bargaining between the Treasury and
departments will be about the allocation of an agreed total. The Star
Chamber will be put to sleep - until it is reformed in a new guise - and the
allocation will be made earlier in the year than the customary autumn by a
committee headed by the chancellor.
A more detailed change is that unemployment-related social security benefits
will be removed from the Control Total (up to now known as the Planning
Total) which will then cover about 85 per cent of General Government
Expenditure. This move seems sensible to help avoid the opposite errors of
cutting dole payments in a slump and using recession as an excuse to give an
upward ratchet to public spending.
There is a further and more vulnerable element in the new approach, which is
to take more seriously the second and third years of the projections.
Indeed, supposedly firm decisions have been announced for three years ahead;
but we do not know exactly what they are, as the definitions of the new
Control Total are still being negotiated in Whitehall.
The adjoining table gives, however, the picture as seen in terms of
percentage increases. The idea is that, with a trend rate of growth of GDP
at 2 to 3 per cent per annum, the trend growth of public expenditure must be
less. The aim is an average 1 1/2 per cent annual rise in the Control Total.
Adding in other elements, General Government Expenditure is expected to rise
by an average of 2 per cent.
But within the overall aim, the specific profile still looks like the
hump-backed bridge characteristic of spending plans. There is a more
generous real increase in 1993-94, the first year of the new system, owing
to a drop in the Treasury's inflation projection. The reductions in planned
increases are in the two subsequent years.
Clearly, the chancellor will not be able to stick to both his real and his
nominal spending projections, unless he has miraculous good luck in
predicting inflation. Faced with a conflict between the two, there has been
a shift of emphasis towards real terms for the medium term, while using the
cash total as a short-term weapon of control.
Whether all this will actually reduce the growth of spending in the medium
term depends on political and economic pressure groups and the firmness of
ministers, rather than on the technicalities of the control system.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Controlling EC mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY CHALLENGING Nestle's recent takeover of Perrier on the grounds that it
would result in a duopoly of the French mineral water market, the European
Commission has significantly broadened the scope of EC merger policy in a
way that will potentially affect a wide range of industries. Brussels argues
that the consumer interest is served by strengthening controls to cover
deals that would create duopolies as well as those which give just one
company a dominant position. However, the methods it has used to assert this
principle, and its application in the specific Nestle-Perrier case, raise
serious concerns.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, says he is merely fleshing
out the 22-month-old EC merger regulation by bringing it into line with the
practices of national merger authorities, notably in Germany and the UK. He
has also indicated his intention to apply the new principle pragmatically.
The creation of a duopoly would not, as in Germany, automatically give rise
to a presumption that a merger should be prohibited. Instead, Brussels would
in each case base its judgment on the likely impact on future competition.
This was broadly the approach adopted in the Nestle-Perrier merger. However,
the Commission's methodology and judgment appear curiously inconsistent. For
instance, it cites the relatively low prices of mineral water in France as
the reason why there is little competition from 'parallel' imports there.
Yet the thrust of the Brussels objections was that the merger could result
in higher prices, which would be likely to encourage such imports.
Limp slap
Brussels also says the high marketing costs of developing new brands inhibit
market entry. However, its remedies require Nestle to dispose only of some
minor brands and unexploited springs. Finally, Nestle and BSN of France have
been left controlling together about three-quarters of current French
mineral water sales. After all Brussels' strictures about duopoly power,
this outcome seems a limp slap on the wrist.
But the most serious issue is not whether Brussels is applying its new-found
duopoly criteria too leniently, but whether it has the authority to invoke
them at all. The merger regulation speaks only of controlling
'concentrations' which create or strengthen a dominant position. Sir Leon
insists this wording covers duopolies. However, many independent lawyers
disagree. They argue that if the authors of the regulation had intended it
to be used in this way they would have said so explicitly - as is the case
with German competition law. In the circumstances, it is particularly
unsatisfactory that the Commission should assert the duopoly principle by
introducing it without warning into a pending merger case. Nestle is
justified in complaining that Brussels has unilaterally moved the goalposts
while a game is in progress.
Unpredictable manner
At the very least, this turn of events threatens to create heightened
business uncertainties. Because the new approach to duopolies has not been
spelled out as a general principle, but has grown out of one specific case,
prospective acquirers in the EC cannot be sure how it will apply to them.
Furthermore, the Commission's conduct on this occasion raises the unsettling
possibility that it will use future cases in an equally unpredictable manner
to establish other precedents which expand its power.
The situation demands urgent clarification by the European Court of Justice.
However, no party to a merger is likely to seek such clarification unless
the deal has been blocked by the Commission. So the only way to guarantee an
early test of the new policy may be for an EC member government to exercise
its prerogative to appeal to the Court.
Ideally, the Commission itself should request a speedy Court review of its
interpretation of the regulation. Indeed, it is in Brussels' own interest to
do so. For merger control to command confidence, it must operate within a
framework that ensures that it is fair, consistent and accountable. Any
suspicion that Brussels is intent on enlarging its power by taking
controversial policy decisions on the hoof undermines those objectives.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Dealing with Mr Saddam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHS of relief in western capitals last night, after Iraq had climbed
down in the crisis with the United Nations over weapons inspections, were
almost audible. After Baghdad's agreement to UN demands that a team of
inspectors be allowed in to its agriculture ministry, the immediate threat
of punitive military action by the US and its allies appears to have
receded. But the west has won at best a symbolic victory; and Baghdad's
behaviour means that the danger of renewed military action has by no means
disappeared.
The latest bout of brinkmanship between President Saddam Hussein and the UN
underlines once again the challenge the Iraqi leader poses to international
order by his flouting of the security council resolutions which provided for
a ceasefire in the Gulf war last year. Unless he follows yesterday's
agreement with a clear indication that he is prepared to respect the will of
the international community on a broader front, it must be only a matter of
time before another confrontation similar to that of the past few days
arises.
If and when that confrontation comes, western governments will again have to
think carefully about their objectives. It became clear during the stand-off
in the past week that purely punitive action would have brought at best
highly uncertain benefits and would have entailed considerable risks.
Broader objectives
What can be achieved militarily in this respect has long since been done,
and as Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN official in charge of inspection programmes,
has admitted, whatever documents or other material were being stored in the
agriculture ministry will almost certainly have been moved elsewhere.
Western government have thus found themselves inevitably focusing on broader
political objectives.
Indeed, as the confrontation over the inspection team intensified, Mr James
Baker was careful to draw attention to Mr Saddam's other acts of defiance
towards the UN: notably his continued attacks on the Shia population in the
south, his violent harassment of UN relief workers in Kurdistan, and his
renewed claims to Kuwait's territory. Whereas many Arabs have some sympathy
for Mr Saddam's efforts to build up Iraq's military strength, arguing that
at least similar attention should be paid to Israel's nuclear arsenal, there
is little admiration even within the Arab world for his treatment of the
Iraqi population, or for his invasion of another Arab state. Whatever
happens next, it is vitally important to the whole world that the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be halted, in Iraq as
elsewhere, and that UN resolutions should not be violated with impunity.
Aggressive actions
The latter point is more important than ever at a moment when the
international community is striving to convince the Serbian leadership of
the risks it runs by continuing its aggressive, if not genocidal, actions
against the Moslems of Bosnia. Those who violate the terms of a ceasefire
expose themselves to a resumption of hostilities, and cannot escape the
responsibility for it.
But Mr Saddam's responsibilities go even further than that; and the
impossibility of achieving peace and stability in Iraq and its surrounding
region while he remains in power has been amply demonstrated. Therefore if
renewed military action by external powers should eventually be necessary in
Iraq, it should have the clear purpose of protecting Iraqis against his
brutality, and assisting those who are brave enough to resist him.
It has already been shown that allied air power can preserve a 'safe haven'
for the Kurds in the north, simply by threatening punitive strikes against
any military forces that Mr Saddam sends into the area. There is a similar
need to protect the Shia refugees who are still holding out, against ever
increasing military pressure, in the marshes of the south.
If more of Iraq's territory were to be placed off limits to Mr Saddam's
repressive forces, the west might be seen as promoting not Kurdish
separatism but security and freedom for Iraq as a whole, and the forces
still supporting Mr Saddam might realise that their best hope of preserving
Iraq's unity is to get rid of him and to seek agreement with his opponents
in both north and south.

FT  27 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: US makes an early strike for gold /
A look behind the scenes at swimming precedes disappointment for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN before the sparkling Piscines Bernat Picornell had been filled with
water, it was obvious that yesterday's men's 100 metres breaststroke would
be the most competitive swimming event at the Olympic Games. Nine of the
fastest times ever had been set within the past 12 months, so that Nelson
Mandela's presence in the VIP box merely added to the electric atmosphere at
poolside.
As things turned out, Britain's hopes of a fast start to the Games quickly
fizzled out in the breaststroke final. Nick Gillingham, the world's fastest
man this year, and Adrian Moorhouse - defending the title he won in Seoul
four years ago - could only finish 7th and 8th respectively. Nelson Diebel
of the US took the gold medal in an Olympic record of 61.5 seconds.
Gillingham, 25, whose Commonwealth record of 61.33secs at the trials left
him top of the world rankings, was the most disappointing, though his effort
could have been affected by a long-term groin strain which caused trouble
again after yesterday's heats and needed physiotherapy.
Gillingham had apparently considered pulling out after finishing fourth
fastest qualifier, to save himself for the 200m breaststroke. Instead, he
took the plunge and was always struggling to keep up.
Moorhouse, meanwhile, had entered the Games as an underdog after failing to
record a fast time this year, and was unable to repeat anything like his
best - 61.49secs - trailing home last in 62.33secs.
Hungarian swimmer Norbert Rozsa's current world record of 61.33secs looked
vulnerable, but survived. Among team-mates, Rozsa is known as 'Richie'
because of his striking facial resemblance to the young Richard Burton.
How Hungary has retained its traditional power in swimming is one of the
minor mysteries of post-Cold War sport. Training camps in San Diego and
Mauritius appear to present no financial problem. In 1991 the 11-strong
Hungarian squad broke six world records, while the rest of the world's
swimmers managed only eight between them.
Moorhouse's muscular style seems to have been adopted by Dmitri Volkov of
the former Soviet Union, who set the fastest qualifying time of 61.74sec. As
he churned down the pool beneath the sparkling Catalan skies, Volkov seemed
to create whirlpoools and waves.
If his horsepower were ever harnessed to Gillingham's fluid balletic style
there might be a record to stand for a decade.
However, as always in swimming, there was the might of the US to consider.
Shaven-headed Diebel, 22, had set the second fastest 100m time of 1992 and
looked aggressively determined. Naturally, a freshly shaven pate - complete
with razor nicks - always looks impressive.
After his victory, Diebel, who confesses to having been hooked on soft drugs
from 12 to 16, said: 'Swimming is the path by which my life was turned
around.'
It is a fact of top-class swimming that the era of 13-year-old muppets,
driven to swim hour after hour by wicked coaches, is over.
Most of the US women's team are over 20. Three are even married. As such,
they have the chance to be interesting.
Jenny Thompson, for example, is known around the team as a James Dean type.
'She goes into town, gets the job done and leaves,' said a team-mate.
Unfortunately, Thompson was unexpectedly beaten in the 100m freestyle final.
Britain's favourite female swimmer, Sharron Davies, is also struggling. At
29 and with Olympic memories stretching back to 1976, the leonine Davies
must surely be on her swansong. In qualifying heats of the 400m medley she
came last.
Yet it is a truism that the British love nothing more than a gallant loser.
Davies was mobbed by cameras and microphones. Perhaps her mission as she
left the pool for the Olympic village should have been to counsel the frisky
young Australian females who had performed an impromptu striptease for male
team-mates. The tabloids were slavering.

FEARS that pregnant women working with visual display units are at increased
risk of miscarrying have been eased by research sponsored mainly by the
Health and Safety Executive, Lisa Wood writes.
The research, the first of its kind to be carried out in Britain and which
involved studying the conditions affecting 450 pregnant women, is to be
published in this month's issue of the British Journal of Industrial
Medicine.
Dr Colin Mackay of the HSE said: 'It shows that pregnant women who work,
even habitually, at VDUs are not at increased risk of miscarriage.'
Dr Eve Roman, who led the study, said: 'We found it made no difference
whether a woman worked on a VDU as part of her general day, whether she used
it occasionally or whether her only contact with a VDU was that it happened
to be in the same room.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / 'Someone even swore at the chairman . . .': People who work
at Lloyd's, where the extraordinary meeting demanded by Names is to be held
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRY McDONNELL, touching seven feet tall in his black and gold top hat,
hurries from the sentry box outside Lloyd's of London to usher his
chairman's Daimler into the lunchtime traffic.
Mr McDonnell, a liveried waiter, stands sentinel in Lime Street to the
world's oldest insurance market. A man of unfashionable servility, who
pockets Pounds 6 extra for candlelit functions in the 11th floor dining
room, he fiercely defends the 300-year-old institution housed behind him in
a stainless steel and translucent glass tower and which daily sucks in
Pounds 30m of insurance premiums.
Mr McDonnell strikes a realistic note. 'Things have been very difficult,
sir,' he explains. 'There is tension in the air. Someone even swore at the
chairman on his way out after the annual meeting. I had to remind him that,
whatever has happened, we are all still gentlemen here.'
Good manners, along with the guiding principle of utmost good faith which
has endured since marine insurance began in a Tower Street coffee house, are
being tested to breaking point at Lloyd's.
The announcement of losses of Pounds 2bn during 1989 follows an
unprecedented run of natural and man-made disasters. Now the most reputable,
rock-solid society of underwriters is enduring its own brush with
catastrophe.
On the 11th floor, with its incongruous chandeliered Adam Room, members of
the governing council today face an extraordinary general meeting and votes
of no confidence. Some have received hate-mail and abusive telephone calls.
The spectacular calling to account of those who staked their all on the
promise of profit - but now live with the stomach-churning reality of
unlimited personal liability - has taken a heavy toll.
Ford Orions are said to have replaced Ferraris. Cries of 'Bankrupt]' slip as
easily off the tongue as the fresh Galway Bay oysters that used to start a
lunch at Wheeler's.
The preamble to the Insurance Act passed during the reign of Elizabeth I
laid down that after catastrophe 'there followeth not the undoing of any man
but the loss lighteth rather easily upon many than heavilie upon fewe . . .
'.
'Undoing' there has been. Accusations of incompetence and betrayal are
poised to lead into what one wounded soul has dubbed 'the slurry pit of
legislation'.
Many Names have fled the market - some to face ruin. More than 6,000 have
gone in 18 months and more will follow, leaving behind unproven allegations
that working Names with inside knowledge sacrificed outside Names to save
their own skins.
Not surprisingly, the members' agents responsible for entry into the club
say inquiries from prospective Names are down to a dribble.
'Insurance is supposed to be dead boring. But this lot are straight out of a
disaster movie', laughs Sam Niblock, a streetwise sandwich maker, waving at
the lunchtime crowd spilling on to the pavement outside the Lamb Tavern in
Leadenhall Market.
Underwriters and brokers, who live or die by each other's efforts, mingle
with aspiring assistants to sip spritzers under the Victorian street
market's ironwork canopy. They swap gossip - part of the broth of the
insurance business since the 17th century.
Mark Bowen, a bank clerk turned broker who specialises in big construction
projects, has just had a quick cappucino at the Croissant Express with a
deputy underwriter. They will meet later at Lloyd's when a stamp and
signature on Bowen's slip will seal a promise binding in honour, if not
necessarily in law.
Nathan Philips, whose plummy tones hint at youthful privilege, says his
priority is to complete professional indemnity cover for a Hong Kong
structural engineering business. Clutching his 'Sushi de luxe' lunch box, he
complains: 'It's proving tricky. You'd think the Chinese had already marched
in.'
Though they may not all approve of the comparison, those at Lloyd's have
much in common with the crew at Linwood's, the local fishmonger, or at
Booths, the florist which delivers flowers or fluffy bears carrying
messages.
In the words of David Rowland, chairman of international broker Sedgwick and
leader of the recent investigation into Lloyd's governance: 'We are all
barrow boys in pin-striped suits who like making money.'
The Lime Street insurance market does not flog flounder or freesias and its
traders wear Gieves &amp; Hawkes suits and Gucci loafers rather than rubber
gloves or aprons. Shirt sleeves or short skirts inside the famous
underwriting room may even bring reprimands from a discreet waiter. But it
is, for all that, little more than a marble-floored bazaar in which the
highest risk is touted for the lowest fee.
If your client seeks protection from war risks, head for Stephen Merrett's
underwriting box; don't forget George Lloyd-Roberts if insuring babies
against illness; call on Danny Chappell if you want cover for a Dollars 1m
racehorse that might go berserk.
It is Lloyd's readiness to consider the unusual, encouraged by its
individualistic heritage, that adds piquancy to its public image. Beside
insurance terms of 'long tail', 'short tail' and 'excess-of-loss' stand less
traditional alternatives such as 'Samurai' cover - 'so bloody risky you
deserve to have your head cut off'.
Whether it is film stars' legs, wine tasters' palates or rock star's voices
 -Lloyd's will usually oblige. Fish can be insured against drowning and
satellites against wandering off into the wide black yonder.
But in spite of its openness for diversity, the recent contraction in the
market, aided by imploding syndicates and shot-gun mergers, means the number
of syndicates is down to 279 - nearly 100 fewer than last year. There is the
more vacant trading space than at any time since the present building opened
in 1986. Rents, which can reach Pounds 20,000 a year for a modest perch,
might fall.
Earnings have fallen for the underwriters after being stoked in the 1980s by
big commissions and syndicate fees. But many still earn well over Pounds
100,000 a year.
Most brokers remain salary slaves, but high-rollers can strike deals which
include a share of the action. A few are said to have broken the Pounds 1m
barrier.
Julian Messent, a geology graduate who decided to become a broker after a
boozy night in the Duke's Head, Putney, is looking for Dollars 400m cover on
a Chilean copper and gold mine. A Latin American property expert with
Alexander Howden, he has researched his risk well and lined up a lead
signature. He wants Jeremy Austen, underwriter at FR White, to add his
stamp.
The two regularly play squash but the negotiation is strictly business. Mr
Austen signs a line and Mr Messent makes for Mark Donald at syndicate 33, a
shaker-and-mover who has made a name as an expert in issues relating to
property, sabotage and terrorism.
Peter Tritton, a colleague of Mr Messent, sums up the bargaining process:
'It's all about peer respect, gut feelings, intuition and accurate
intelligence.
'If someone lies in here . . . news goes from one corner of the building to
the other in a flash. If you get found out, your credibility is shot.'
But Lloyd's credibility is at stake, having found itself sucked into the
maelstrom of the 'anything goes' economy of the 1980s.
Paul Barnes, a would-be painter turned non-marine underwriter, scans a
Dollars 25m claim for snow damage from the Israeli Flower Board before
reflecting on what has gone wrong at Lloyd's. He has a saying, 'volume is
vanity, profit is sanity' to sum up his view of a market that took its eye
off its prime duty to secure profitable business for its Names in favour of
winning premium income.
A senior broker at Fenchurch Group comments: 'It was the mood of the times.
Too many underwriters threw caution to the wind. They were doing things they
did not really understand.'
What they did understand, and lap up, was the wave of entertainment that
oiled the wheels of a booming business.
'It's amazing how many underwriters got a suite in one or more of the luxury
hotels they agreed to insure,' says Phil Guthrie, a non-marine broker who
admits to his own share of treats from clients.
Now, more modest hospitality prevails: 'It's back to football tickets for a
while,' Mr Guthrie grins.
Dave Burling, the casualty loss-book clerk whose quill pen commits lost
Cuban barges and Irish fish factories to the book that once recorded the
Titanic and the Torrey Canyon, has seen 'a real sifting out' among brokers
and underwriters.
Danny Chappell, an unstuffy underwriter whose mum worked for a broker, is
putting his name to a Dollars 2.5m all-risks policy on Dr Devious, this
year's Derby winner. He gives his views on some of the new breed of people
around him.
'It used to take years to work your way up through the ranks. Now, they
arrive out of the blue, set up their stall and they're away. It's not
surprising if some have come unstuck.'
'It's the survival of the fittest,' chips in his assistant, clutching lurid
pictures of American cows allegedly struck by lightning.
Those running Lloyd's say they do not doubt that it will survive.
Better self-regulation is promised although old-timers warn that it will
destroy Lloyd's individualistic heritage and raise costs.
David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, traced the fault line when he told
members last month that the dash for business had sapped market disciplines
and standards.
The finger of suspicion inevitably points first at the ambitious young men
and women who did not do their homework. Many of them have already paid with
their jobs.
Some of the older hands were not impressed with the newcomers and stuck to
the practices they knew best. Others tried to keep up with the pacemakers
and became players in areas of which they had little or no experience.
Yet, to the casual observer, the depth and breadth of experience held
collectively by those who make up the Lloyd's market remains impressive when
set against the skills and competence employed in other professional
marketplaces. When a broker and underwriter discuss cover for a South
African goldmine there is still a fair chance they have both been down it.
While Lloyd's tries to regain its footing, the job of re-establishing its
reputation continues. In the claim office, housed in the old Lloyd's Room
across the street, Bob Moore and his team work on to demonstrate that,
whatever the problems, payout calls are promptly met.
But if the money is still flowing out, people such as Keith Leonard,
managing director of RW Sturge, one of the Sturge members' agencies, are
doing their damndest to keep it coming in. A cheque for Pounds 190,000 has
just arrived.
Mr Leonard, who has a six-figure sum to find, also gets daily letters of
resignation from Names. 'There's no sense to it,' he rails, 'they are
pulling out at the bottom of the worst cycle and will miss the upturn.'
Back in the Room, Paul Barnes muses on risks attached to a sewer back-up in
Saskatchewan and ponders on a critical time for a great British institution.
'We've all got one last shot to get to the promised land,'he says. 'Blow it
and God knows where we'll all end up.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / Paisley demand clouds Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS between parti-cipants in the adjourned talks on Northern Ireland's
political future appeared to be mounting yesterday after the Reverend Ian
Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, warned that the talks would fail if the
Irish Republic did not agree to drop its territorial claims to the province.
The mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party said that Mr
Paisley's remarks were 'not encouraging'. His attempts to turn the
abandonment of the Republic's constitutional claim over the province into a
pre-condition for continuing the talks conflicted with the principal
accepted by participants that nothing would be agreed formally as long as
any issue was still outstanding.
Mr Paisley challenged Dublin to remove two articles in the Republic's
constitution. 'If they continue to say 'no, we have a claim over you' . . .
then they will have brought the talks to an end,' he said.
In a fresh move, the Democratic Unionists intend to use the five-week summer
recess in the talks to send other participants a 'shopping-list' of
'problems' that the party has with their respective positions and would want
them to address.
'Strand two' talks between leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland
and the British and Irish governments adjourned on Friday with an invitation
to participants to 'prepare papers to assist the progress of deliberations
following the recess'.
When they reconvene on September 2, the hard bargaining - if there is to be
hard bargaining - will need to begin, building on this month's preliminaries
where participants set out their starting positions.
The new timetable was facilitated by an agreement to put back until the week
beginning September 28, the earliest date on which the next meeting of the
Anglo-Irish Conference would take place.
Meanwhile, a meeting between the British and Irish governments in Dublin
this week will mark the start of 'strand three' - a new phase in the complex
talks structure.
This is regarded as particularly significant by Unionists as the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement, which they oppose because of the role it gives
Dublin, will be on the negotiating table.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Team briefing has 'little effecton commitment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEE-involvement initi-atives such as team briefings and company
newspapers appear to have little effect on the commitment of employees or
their understanding of management decisions, according to research sponsored
by the government.
The investigation of employee-involvement schemes in 25 companies was
conducted by the Manchester School of Management and took nearly two years.
The results were said by the Department of Employment to show that most
workers welcome involvement schemes.
But the report also includes some less encouraging findings. A survey of 700
employees in 18 of the organisations found that 81 per cent of respondents
thought team briefings either left unchanged (77 per cent) or decreased (4
per cent) their commitment to the organisation.
The report also notes a sceptical attitude to the employee-involvement
philosophy among middle managers and supervisors.
At one chemical company, supervisors described employee-involvement
initiatives as 'long-haired, idealistic views of workers', as 'soft'
management, or as 'eulogising the workforce'.
Seventy-one per cent of the employees in the survey said there was either no
change (66 per cent) or a decrease (5 per cent) in their understanding of
management decisions as a result of team briefings. Sixty-five per cent said
that team briefings did not lead to greater management openness and 8 per
cent said it decreased openness.
Fifty-nine per cent said team briefings did increase their information about
the company but 41 per cent said there was either no change or an actual
decrease in information.
In spite of the widespread introduction of team briefings, house journals,
total quality management, customer care initiatives and joint consultative
committees in the 25 companies during the 1980s, only 49 per cent of
respondents felt that communication had improved.
Twenty-six per cent said it was about the same and 25 per cent said it was
either worse or much worse.
The report tried but failed to establish any relationship between employee
involvement and overall corporate performance. It suggests that it may be
better corporate performance that facilitates em-ployee involvement rather
than the other way round.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Car trade warns over tax proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR TRADE leaders fear Inland Revenue proposals to be published this week
on taxation of company cars could delay a recovery in the UK fleet market
until next year.
Fleet operators are worried by indications that the document will include an
un-desirably long and detailed consultation process.
Mr Stewart Whyte of the Association of Car Fleet Operators said: 'We need to
know what the final formula is to be at the earliest date possible.'
Some fleet executives believe that if the consultation takes several months,
carmakers already suffering from severely depressed sales could be affected
for even longer.
'If the consultation process were to run up to December, there would almost
certainly be hardly any fleet sales right through the first quarter of next
year as well,' said Mr Whyte.
'Business car buyers, having been deterred from making purchase decisions
until the tax formula was thrashed out, would then be highly likely to put
off buying for a few more months, figuring that they might as well wait
until they know what's in the next Budget as well', said Mr Whyte.
The document has already caused concern within the industry because it is
understood to propose retaining a car-price banding system for assessing tax
liability - albeit a more sophisticated one than at present.
The latter has been heavily criticised for failing to discriminate between
essential and 'perk' car users, as well as placing some carmakers at a
disadvantage.
Under the present system, the amount of tax payable by a company car user on
the benefit of the private use of his or her case is calculated according to
a scale involving engine capacity, age, purchase price and business mileage.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Concern at bids for EC funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH businesses are failing to take advantage of sizeable benefits they
might be elegible for from the European Commission's Thermie programme,
which provides EC funding for energy conservation projects, according to the
Association for the Conservation of Energy.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the association, which represents a number of
companies active in the energy conservation industry, told a conference this
weekend that insufficient British bids were being made for funds.
The UK had received only 12 per cent and 10 per cent of the available budget
for energy saving and for renewable energy projects respectively, when its
rightful share should be around 18 per cent.
The EC is today launching a leaflet designed to explain to businesses how
they can benefit from Thermie.
Funding of up to 40 per cent can be awarded to projects involving a first
application of new processes or products on a sufficiently large scale.
Mr Warren said the programme was due in 1993 to enter a new phase,
concentrating on technologies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and
sulphur dioxide. It was vital that British businesses bid for as much as
possible of the Pounds 250m available in 1993 and 1994.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Fishermen drift towards a net loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANCIENT tradition of drift-net fishing for salmon and sea trout off
England's north east coast would be phased out under proposals published by
the National Rivers Authority, Chris Tighe writes.
Around 400 fishermen using little wooden cobles, reminiscent of Viking
longboats, depend on salmon drift netting for their livelihood in the spring
and summer.
The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food invited the authority to draw
up plans to phase out the 143 drift net salmon licences between Holy Island
in Northumberland and the Humber following claims from Scottish and English
riparian owners and anglers that drift netting is depleting river salmon
stocks.
The ministry said there was no evidence it posed immediate threat to stocks
but suggested they could be better managed if the netting were ended.
Critics describe the 600-yard long monofilament drift nets which are played
out across the tide as 'curtains of death'. The fishermen, who deny they are
responsible for the decline in salmon stocks, liken their nets to 'a pair of
shoe laces in Wembley stadium'.
Under the authority plan, licences would be reduced as netsmen leave the
fishery, resulting in a halving of drift netting activity over 10 years and
its phasing out over about 30 years. Last year about 30,000 salmon, and a
similar number of sea trout, were drift netted off the north-east coast.
The fishermen are now considering whether to object to the proposals, a move
which would force a public inquiry.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Building groups take desperate measures: How construction
companies are taking on work for little or no profit to survive the
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARD-PRESSED construction companies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
already weakened by the collapse of residential and commercial property
prices - are facing a new threat.
Contractors desperate for cash to reduce large borrowings raised to buy land
for housing and commercial development during the 1980s have been bidding
for building work at prices which do little more than cover their overheads.
Such bids could rebound on them when demand for construction starts to
recover and material and labour prices begin to rise again before the work
is completed. In many cases, prices already suggest that losses will be made
on some contracts.
Even a small increase in costs could turn these marginal jobs into heavy
lossmakers. Companies already close to insolvency could be pushed over the
edge, according to Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers
Confederation, the industry's largest trade association.
Southern England, where hundreds of completed office blocks stand empty, has
been worst affected by the downturn in construction orders.
Mr Peter Birse, chairman of Birse Group, an aggressive contractor which grew
rapidly in the mid to late 1980s, says: 'Anybody who says they are doing
better than just covering overheads on contracts won in southern England is
lying.'
The National Economic Development Office has forecast that construction
output will fall 6.5 per cent this year following a drop of 9 per cent last
year. Commercial construction, mainly offices and shops, is expected to fall
25 per cent this year and 10 per cent next year.
Large customers of the industry such as the Department of Transport and
Anglian Water, one of the biggest water companies, estimate that prices for
building and civil engineering work have fallen by between 20 per cent and
30 per cent since the late 1980s.
Main contractors have been assisted by sharp falls in sub-contractors'
prices as well as in building material and labour prices.
Mr Robert Napier, chief executive of Redland, one of the UK's biggest
building material producers, estimates that prices of the cheapest bricks
have fallen 40 per cent since 1989. He says: 'Brick prices in the past 12
months have fallen on average by 20 per cent. The industry has the capacity
to produce 3.8bn bricks a year but is only selling 3bn a year. There is
currently six months supply of unsold stock standing on factory forecourts.'
The price of roof tiles has fallen 15 per cent since 1989 and 10 per cent in
the past 12 months, according to Redland. Ready-mixed concrete is being sold
at a loss, according to Mr Napier, and margins have virtually disappeared on
coated stone for roadbuilding. Constructional steel prices have fallen by a
quarter since 1989.
Dr Derek Tordoff, director of of the British Constructional Steelwork
Association, says: 'Contractors pricing a construction job have been taking
the lowest quoted steel price and then knocking 10 per cent off that. They
have been able to get away with it because of over-capacity in the
industry.'
It has become harder for contractors to do this as steelworks have closed
and capacity has been reduced - 50 companies are estimated to have shut down
since 1989. Constructional steel prices, in one or two instances, have
started to rise very slightly during the past couple of months, says Dr
Tordoff.
Even without a rise in material and labour prices, contractors could be
facing serious difficulties on some jobs. Few will admit openly that they
are taking lossmaking jobs. Privately, they say their businesses would
disappear within six months if they did not accept a proportion of work at
zero or even lossmaking margins.
Mr Birse tells of a team of contract estimators at a rival construction
group who had reduced their bid to as low as they dared when they were
ordered to slice a further Pounds 1m off the price. 'Profits on the job were
irrelevant: the company needed the cash,' says Mr Birse. Stories like these
are legion in the industry.
The only hope for companies bidding rock-bottom prices is that they will be
able to justify claims for extra payments as the job progresses and project
designs and construction timetables are modified.
Mr Anthony Edwards, a partner specialising in construction litigation at DJ
Freeman, the law firm, expects legal claims for additional payments to
spiral as contractors attempt to recover margins.
Falling construction prices have meant that there has seldom been a better
time to build a new motorway, sewerage works, home extension or even a fifth
terminal at Heathrow airport.
According to BAA, formerly the British Airports Authority, the cost of
building the fifth terminal has halved from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 800m. The
decline is partly due to improved designs and better project management but
also to lower building costs since the scheme was first devised.
A comparative study by EC Harris, the international cost consultants, of
current developments and similar buildings constructed in the late 1980s,
reveals that construction prices in London have fallen on average by more
than a fifth since the second quarter of 1989.
Motorway and trunk-road prices last year were about a fifth lower on average
than had been forecast in the transport department's budget. The fall in
prices means it can bring forward schemes which were expected to take place
in future years.
The department carefully vets tender lists to ensure that construction
companies have the financial strength as well as physical skills to carry
out the job. Less careful customers could find that they are storing up
trouble by accepting an unrealistically low bid should their contractor be
forced out of business or seek redress through the courts by claiming extra
payments.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Treasury defends its reputation in a hostile environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY, the govern-ment's most powerful department, is facing growing
criticism from outsiders who link it with Britain's economic problems.
As the arm of government in charge of economic policy and public spending,
the Treasury has always had enemies. But as the recession has dragged on,
its popularity has sunk because of complaints that it has made policy
mistakes which have exacerbated the economic decline.
A senior Treasury official said: 'The environment is very hostile. Everyone
is saying we've messed up forecasts, messed up public spending and messed up
interest-rate decisions.'
But no one can complain that Treasury officials are failing to earn their
keep. They have been key figures in efforts to ease the strains on sterling
through methods such as intervention on currency markets to support the
pound by the Bank of England. They are working hard on efforts to keep down
public spending and so stop public borrowing from soaring.
But in the absence of convincing signs that the recession is over, such
intellectual efforts have won the department few new friends. Professor
Patrick Minford, a monetarist economist at Liverpool University, complains
that the Treasury 'has lost its grasp' of economic principles, while Mr
Christopher Haskins, chairman of food manufacturer Northern Foods, says it
is out of touch with the real world.
Treasury officials have an instant defence. Since they merely advise
ministers, politicians must carry the can for mistakes, just as they take
credit when things go well. 'We reflect back to politicians what they want
to hear,' says one. 'If I was to die tomorrow, someone else would replace me
and do just as good a job.'
Partly because of the weight of criticisms, Treasury officials, supported by
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, have instituted some modest changes. For
example, the Treasury has invited economists from leading UK companies to
share their thoughts on the way out of the recession, a step intended to
improve on the Treasury's poor forecasting record. As part of the broad
effort to bring in more ideas from the outside world, Mr Alan Budd, the
Treasury's thoughtful chief economic adviser, is increasing the amount of
time he puts into making contact with leading City economists.
In some ways, Treasury officials do not have it easy. They work very long
hours and are not well paid by private-sector standards. Since few have
expense accounts, they can rarely offer outsiders a lunch which is anything
more lavish than sandwiches. In after-work drinking sessions on overseas
trips, Treasury men normally rely on their colleagues from the Bank of
England, who have more generous expenses, to pick up the bar bills.
But being a Treasury official also has its advantages. Treasury mandarins
are at the centre of a power structure about which, because of Whitehall's
secretive ways, little is known. One insider says: 'You can imagine how
great it feels. They are doing all these important things that hardly anyone
knows about. And because the outside world has no way of checking, they can
pretend their work is even more important than it is.'
Last week week - amid the efforts to tackle the ailing economy - two of the
Treasury's top officials had their efforts rewarded by being promoted. Mr
Nick Monck, the public-spending chief, was told he will be the next
permanent secretary at the Department of Employment. He will be replaced by
Mr Andrew Turnbull, a rising star who is currently in charge of monetary
policy.
More than anything, officials are praying for a respite from the poor
economic news. Not only would this get the critics off their backs, it would
give them more time for serious policymaking, such as dreaming up new tax
structures.
'The past couple of years have been firefighting,' said one. 'I'll be glad
when the recession is over.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / Secret services face scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD CABORN, the new chairman of the all-party Commons trade and
industry committee, is to raise the question of the accountability of the
intelligence services with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, adding to pressure on the government to open the service to
parliamentary scrutiny.
Mr Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, plans to write to Mr Heseltine
addressing the subject in the context of the Iraqi supergun affair.
He will ask Mr Heseltine whether the government intends to respond to the
committee's assertion in a recent report that the affair 'raises serious and
important questions about the accountability of the intelligence services
both to ministers and to parliament'.
A slim response from the DTI to the report contained no reference to the
committee's claim.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has signalled that he is looking at ways
of making the secret services more accountable as part of his commitment to
more open government.
Top of the committee's new agenda is UK trade with the European Community -
a topic which it will begin to examine, along with the aerospace sector and
domestic energy pricing, when parliament returns in October.
The committee will aim in particular to assess claims made in
representations to the government that European continuous-process
industries such as steel and chemicals benefit from hidden subsidies in the
form of cheap energy.
Consideration is being given to inviting Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Bruce
Millan, the two British EC commissioners, to appear as witnesses.
In deference to the Energy Department's absorption by the DTI, the committee
has agreed informally to devote about a quarter of its time to energy
issues.
Mr Caborn is also considering devising some form of continuous monitoring of
the DTI's performance, although thinking on this is at a preliminary stage.

<TEXT>
A CALL for tighter controls on the ways companies operate so directors can
better assess their effectiveness is made today by the Chartered Institute
of Management Accountants in its response to the Cadbury Committee report on
corporate governance.
In particular the institute recommends a wide range of new measures to
improve the internal auditing of companies.
The institute says more importance should be given to the disclosure of
company liquidity and that interim reports should be improved to ensure good
accounting practices are observed throughout the year, not just at year-end.
'The balance sheet and profit and loss data should be augmented by a
reasonably detailed cash flow statement and disclosure of all material
events which have occurred in the period covered by the report,' the
institute says in its report.
The institute also recommends a further examination of the effects of
separating the roles of chairman and chief executive.
It says the proposed code of best practice should be made mandatory. It adds
that audit committees and remuneration committees should be mandatory for
all listed companies and other public-interest groups such as the
nationalised industries.

FT  27 JUL 92 / BR deals Labour an unkind cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party is about to learn that all direct InterCity rail services
to the Lancashire resort of Blackpool will be abolished on the day its
annual party conference opens there.
British Rail is expected to announce the decision next Monday, blaming it on
the need to cut costs in the face of the recession. It will come into effect
with the introduction of BR's autumn timetable on September 28.
The fact that the Labour conference opens on the same day is coincidental,
but the timing is likely to infuriate members planning to travel to and from
the conference by rail. Like other passengers heading for Blackpool, they
will now be able to go only as far as Preston by InterCity. They will then
have to wait for a local stopping service to take them on the 17 1/2 -mile
last leg of the journey.
The closure of the InterCity service will be bitterly resented in Blackpool.
The town drew 17m visitors last year and its economy depends heavily on
tourism and the conference market.
Lancashire County Council fears that the loss of direct rail links with the
rest of the country will affect Blackpool's ability to compete with other
resorts such as Brighton, East Sussex; and Bournemouth, Dorset, which have
frequent trains direct to the capital.
The ending of Blackpool's InterCity link is the latest in a series of moves
by BR aimed at cutting back the InterCity network to a profitable core.
InterCity services beyond Wolverhampton in the West Midlands to Shrewsbury
were abolished in May, and last month BR announced that InterCity services
to south Humberside would end in September.
Earlier this year Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, publicised a
memo by a BR employee claiming 15 services on the fringes of the InterCity
network were vulnerable to closure.
InterCity has been reviewing its services in the wake of a fall in operating
profits from Pounds 49.7m to Pounds 2m in the financial year to April.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Support for Mellor signalled by polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day signalled its determination not to be rushed by
the Mellor affair into taking action to curb press freedom, saying it would
await the publication of a report on the press by Sir David Calcutt, David
Owen writes.
The message came as the position of Mr David Mellor, the national heritage
secretary, who is alleged have had an affair with an actress, appeared to be
strengthened by the findings of two opinion polls at the weekend.
A survey of 100 Tory backbenchers by the Mail on Sunday indicated that 54 of
those questioned believed that Mr Mellor should retain his post, compared
with 26 who felt he should resign and 20 who refused to comment. Only one
Tory, Mrs Ann Winterton, MP for Congleton, has publicly called for his
resignation.
A Gallup poll of the general public for the Sunday Telegraph put support for
Mr Mellor at 62 per cent and at 64 per cent among women. A total of of 1,028
people were interviewed last week. A total of 52 per cent supported
legislation to restrict press intrusion, with 38 per cent opposed.
But a number of Tory MPs including Mr Patrick Nicholls, Mr Mellor's former
parliamentary private secretary, and Ms Angela Knight, MP for Erewash, are
calling on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to introduce legislation
on electronic eavesdropping, if necessary before publication of the Calcutt
report.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Record salary for impresario

<TEXT>
A PRIVATE company rather than big business or a former nationalised industry
last year paid the highest salary ever recorded in the UK, according to
Management Today magazine.
According to the magazine, Mr Cameron Mackintosh, owner of the theatre
production company of the same name, earned a salary of Pounds 8.3m last
year, a 65 per cent increase on his pay of Pounds 5m the year before.
Mr Philip Beresford, Management Today's editor, said many of the highest
earners were to be found not in the quoted companies where every move was
subject to the gaze of the City but in private companies, where the accounts
and information on pay were quietly filed in Companies House.
Research by the magazine has shown that 12 of the 44 highest earners in the
UK, including six of the top 12, run private companies.
They range from Mr Mackintosh to Mr Ronald Hobson and Sir Donald Gosling,
founders of the National Parking Corporation.
But while Mr Mackintosh takes home the largest pay cheque he is only fifth
in a total salary league according to the magazine. Heading that list is Mr
David Sainsbury, chairman designate of J. Sainsbury, the food retailer. Last
year his dividend income rose by Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 30m.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Working women and the rise of the house-husband
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS tend both to be men and to study the economic activity of men.
The employment behaviour of women has been highly unstable both over time
and across countries, so male unemployment rates are more reliable for
tracking changes in the economy at large. Yet this practice, however
justified, may be obscuring the sexual revolution that has occurred across
the developed world over the past decade.
Changes in male unemployment rates do provide a better guide to the degree
of tightness or slack in the economy at large. Female unemployment rates,
compiled by governments, usually contain little information because many
job-hunting women are not eligible for unemployment benefits and are
therefore not counted as unemployed. In Britain, the headline female
unemployment published monthly by the government tends to be three or more
percentage points lower than that compiled by the OECD from survey evidence.
Even the survey-based female unemployment rates are misleading. When
vacancies are low, women without jobs tend to work in the home rather than
spend time searching for employment. Rather than be counted as unemployed,
women are more likely to be classified as 'economically inactive',
especially in recessions.
Yet these observations merely highlight the deficiencies of unemployment
rates as measures of joblessness in developed economies. The OECD, in its
lastest Employment Outlook, has investigated the pattern of non-employment
rates - the percentage of the population without jobs - in developed
countries. It confirms that male non-employment rates have grown faster than
unemployment rates everywhere, especially among 55-64 year olds. Yet this
rising trend of male inactivity has been more than matched by increased
employment of women. The left-hand charts compares the percentage of men and
women that had jobs on average across the 1980s. It covers the 25-54 age
group only to avoid complications caused by education or early retirement.
Male employment rates are universally higher than female employment rates.
But, roughly speaking, those countries with lower male employment rates have
higher female employment rates. The US, for example, has a male
non-employment problem at least as serious as in the main European
countries. But the US also has the highest rate of female employment,
followed closely by the UK and Canada.
Women are catching up fast. Female employment rates rose in every country
between the beginning and the end of the decade, while the male employment
rate fell everywhere except in the US and Japan. Again, the rise in female
employment was relatively rapid in those countries where the male employment
rate was lower: the US, UK and Canada. Female employment also rose rapidly
in Australia.
Why, when the fall in male employment has been universal, has the rise in
female employment occurred more rapidly outside continental Europe? One
reason is that Anglo-Saxon deregulated labour markets have done better at
job creation. In these countries, demise of heavy industrial, highly paid,
'good jobs' has been more than offset by the growth of less well paid, often
part-time, employment in the service sector. The share of part-time
employment in total UK employment was 21.8 per cent in 1990, up from 16.4
per cent in 1979. The US part-time share was 16.9 per cent in 1990, compared
to 12 per cent in France and 5.7 per cent in Italy.
Women have proved to be both cheap and flexible relative to men. They take
the bulk of these part-time jobs - 87 per cent in Britain, 78 per cent in
Australia, 68 per cent in the US - and often at lower wages than men would
command. Part-time female workers are more likely to have children; and
while single women tend to earn at least 90 per cent of the hourly wage paid
to single men, married women earn much less: 69 per cent in Australia and 59
per cent in the US and UK. Wage equality between men and women remains a
distant goal; but an equal sharing of paid and household work is not so far
away.

    INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous
year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is
shown as a percentage of the total labour force.  Figures for the
composite leading indicator are end-period values.

President Saddam Hussein urged Iraqis yesterday to hold high the banners of
the Mother of Battles - his term for the war over Kuwait, Reuter reports.
Speaking before the latest UN confrontation was settled, he said Iraqis had
to continue to mobilise because their enemies still wanted war. But in
Baghdad there has been little sign of the kind of preparations seen before
the Gulf war last year.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Saddam pulls back from brink: Iraqi president flexes muscles
in strongest challenge yet to UN resolutions
</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein has once again pulled back from the brink of a
fresh military confrontation with the west. But on this occasion he came
closer to provoking military action than at any time since the end of the
Gulf conflict in February last year.
Iraq's refusal to grant access for United Nations weapons inspectors -
charged with identifying and dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
 -to the agriculture ministry in Baghdad was the strongest challenge yet to
the terms of the UN Gulf ceasefire resolutions. It concided with other signs
of increasing defiance from Baghdad.
Earlier this month in a speech that recalled some of his more bombastic
statements during the Gulf crisis, Mr Saddam sneered at the UN, the west and
its regional allies.
The UN Security Council, he declared, had become 'an advertising billboard
for US interests and policies towards the world.' He condemned what he
described as the 'miserable actions and deeds of this international
organisation.'
Some regional experts see this tone as a sign the regime, which is under
increasing pressure - reports of coup plots and terrorism abound  - is
seeking to redeem its authority. Others argue Mr Saddam feels that, having
resisted pressure for more than year, he is in a stronger position to thumb
his nose at international opinion. A combination of these two factors may be
at work.
Iraqi perversity has been apparent for weeks. Apart from barring the weapons
inspectors, Baghdad has:
Refused to co-operate with a UN commission charged with re-drawing its
boundary with Kuwait;
Objected to the terms for the UN-supervised sale of Iraqi oil to pay for
humanitarian supplies;
Stalled on the renewal of an agreement covering the presence of UN guards
and humanitarian groups in Iraq;
Begun using fixed-wing military aircraft, according to western intelligence,
in defiance of the Gulf conflict ceasefire. Iraqi MiG-23s have reportedly
flown missions against Shi'ite rebels hiding out in the marshes south of the
town of Amara on the Tigris.
Stepped-up military operations against rebels would tend to support the view
that the regime is flexing its muscles again, although reports persist of
morale problems in the military's higher ranks and of an increasingly
beleaguered President Saddam relying even more on supporters from his home
area of Takrit, north of Baghdad.
There have been frequent reports in the past year of coup attempts, most of
them emanating from Iraqi opposition sources living abroad. The most recent
attempt, according to Iraqi emigres, occurred in late June when four
Republican Guard officers plotted to blow up the Iraqi leader's car.
The allegations of coup plots have coincided with reports of a continuing
purge of the military. As many as 200 officers are said to have been
stripped of their authority and some executed.
However, as recently as last month, US intelligence concluded that the Iraqi
leader had strengthened his position in the past year, an embarrassment for
the US administration, which is dogged by criticism that it has not done
more to get rid of Mr Saddam.
A national intelligence estimate, which represented the combined efforts of
various US intelligence agencies, reported that, with the help of Jordan and
by using hidden Iraqi reserves, the regime had begun rebuilding its
infrastructure. President Saddam had also re-organised his military and his
five security services to strengthen control.
Western intelligence has been paying particular attention to ways in which
Iraq may be funding imports of goods, including the purchase of military
spare parts in contravention of UN ceasefire terms.
In spite of Iraqi efforts to re-equip its re-organised military, western
experts doubt whether he would be in a position to combat any bombing attack
by the allies.
During the Gulf conflict Iraqi surface-to-air missiles proved ineffective
and Scud medium-range missiles aimed at Israel and Saudi Arabia were wildly
innaccurate. Kurdish intelligence reports that Iraq is still holding on to
some of its Scuds and their launchers, but numbers have been reduced.
Western experts estimate about 50 per cent of Iraq's ground forces were
destroyed. Main battle tanks, ranging from Chieftains to Russian-supplied
T-72's were reduced from nearly 6,000 to under 3,000.
The loss of most of Iraq's frontline fighter aircraft, flown to 'safety' in
neighbouring Iran during the Gulf conflict, has been another blow. These
fighters are reportedly being integrated into Iran's airforce.
Mr Saddam must recognise that his capacity to resist would be almost nil,
but this feebleness does not, it seems, prevent him from indulging in a
political strategy of brinkmanship and defiance.
While the latest crisis has been defused, it is almost certain that there
will be further confrontations with the UN and the west. The danger for Mr
Saddam and for the region is that he will miscalculate and go beyond the
brink.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Arab states maintain low profile over confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB states have kept relatively quiet over the drama being played out
between Iraq, the United Nations and the western powers, with Egypt
virtually alone in commenting on the crisis.
In Damascus on Friday, Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, expressed
the hope that the issue could be resolved peacefully and that 'we shall not
be in need of any escalation'.
With the Arab world deeply divided following Iraq's 1990 seizure of Kuwait,
it was most unlikely that a common front would have emerged in any case to
oppose western military action.
But there is also little doubt that such states as Egypt and Syria, which
contributed ground forces to the removal of Iraq from Kuwait, had little
enthusiasm for further conflict.
In March this year, when a similar crisis arose over Iraq's tardiness in
complying with the Gulf war ceasefire resolution, both Egypt and Syria came
out against the use of force.
Not much has changed since then, except that the moderate Arabs, including
the Gulf states, will have been discomfited by signs that the Iraqi
president is again flexing his muscles, and heaping scorn on pro-western
Arab leaders.
Gulf rulers, namely those of Kuwait and perhaps Saudi Arabia, are unlikely
to have been as squeamish, however, about some form of military strike
against Iraq as their Egyptian and Syrian brethren.
But they wanted to be sure that if action had been taken it would have
amounted to something more than a slap on the wrist for Mr Saddam. The
spectacle of the Iraqi leader grinning in his Baghdad citadel having
survived another allied strike would not have brought much comfort to
jittery Gulf rulers.
For the future, the Saudis, for one, would probably prefer the US and its
allies to step up their efforts to destabilise the Iraqi regime rather than
continue planning high-profile bombing raids that would yield little
dividend.
The renewed criticism over the weekend of Saudi oil policy by Mr Abdel Razak
al-Hiti, Iraq's oil minister, will have added to the irritation.
He charged that the kingdom was squandering millions of dollars a day by
over-producing.
The Iraqi official claimed that Saudi Arabia was losing Dollars 3m a day by
'deliberately de-stabilising the international oil market.' Kuwaiti
overproduction and its depressing effects on oil prices was one of the
pretexts cited by Iraq for the August 1990 invasion.
