FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Far-reaching consequences of paying promptly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN SIMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Delayed payment by companies for goods and services beyond agreed terms
is becoming endemic in the UK. This is causing avoidable business failures,
especially among smaller companies. Under the present system, which harks
back to the 19th century, payment is normally expected once per month and
agreed credit periods vary between 20 days and 60 days, but in reality they
have become much longer.
There have been extensive discussions about whether companies should be
charged interest on overdue payments and how to speed up claims in the
courts. But there is an alternative answer, and one which would have massive
national advantages. This is to change settlement terms to standard payment
35 days after date of invoice - a practice similar to that in northern
Europe - with, of course, continued prompt payments arrangements.
Settlement should be once per week, or four times per month (in practice,
simple), with some invoices paid within 32 days and some within 38 days.
Advantages would be a steadier flow of funds and more effective, and more
prompt, credit monitoring and control. Suppliers would more quickly be able
to impose delivery 'delays' on later payers - which would be more effective
than attempting to apply sanctions when the amount at risk is at least
equivalent to goods supplied in previous and current months. Any bad debts
would be half those incurred under the present system. Banks would benefit
from fewer business failures and should respond with reasonable transaction
charges.
Ordering would become more even - eliminating the practice of small orders
being placed when the credit period is at its shortest and large orders when
at its longest. Suppliers would no longer have customers optimising the
credit period and would be able to rationalise distribution. Safety and
environmental advantages flowing from better transport arrangements are
fully appreciated and supported by Sir John Cullen, chairman of the Health
and Safety Commission.
A major UK manufacturer or professional organisation needs to take the lead
in agreeing and speedily implementing a new system along these lines.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Conflicts of 1930s a lesson on need for European
integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AUBREY JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reasonably stable exchange rates are an essential complement to freedom
of trade. For otherwise a country can dodge its obligation to keep open its
frontiers to goods and services from elsewhere by depreciating the exchange
value of its currency.
This lesson is evident from the events of the 1930s. The devaluation of the
pound sterling to the tune of some 40 per cent in September 1931 was
followed within a year by more than 40 countries; in 1933 by the US; and in
1936 by France, Holland and Switzerland.
In addition to this competitive depreciation of currencies, countries sought
to fend off the consequent penetration of imports by raising tariffs or by
imposing import quotas. As a result, the world-wide deflation was
aggravated.
The European Community, the Single European Act and the Treaty of Maastricht
have represented, as far as Europe is concerned, a progressive attempt to
avert a relapse into the conflicts of the 1930s.
In the widespread recession (depression?) of the 1990s, that attempt has to
be resumed.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Little difference in approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH HORTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the letter from Mr Tetsuro Kikuchi (September 23)
concerning the different approaches by Japanese companies to combating
recession.
I feel that he has missed one vital and perhaps most important difference
between the current recessions, both in the UK and Japan.
Here in the south-east region of the UK we have been in recession since late
1989 and the majority of companies have gone through the process of
improving productivity, cutting costs, asking for increased government
spending (which in the main has fallen on deaf ears) and we are now at the
final stage of asking for the only option which is left open, that of the
reduction in interest rates.
To conclude therefore, there is probably very little difference between the
approach of Japanese and UK companies; it is just that the Japanese are some
three years behind in the process.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Reassurance needed on accuracy of trade figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN D ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his interesting 'Anatomy of the UK defeat' (Economic Viewpoint,
September 24) Samuel Brittan states ' ..the Bundesbank economists have
straightforward, unreconstructed mainstream views. They judge the sterling
parity by the British trade figures. . .' For pretty well all my working
life the published British trade figures have been so consistently dreadful
that one wonders how on earth Britain, far from sinking without trace,
manages to survive as a comparatively wealthy nation.
Since published trade figures appear to be taken at face value by people and
institutions whose actions can be favourable or very damaging to the
national interest it is obvious they should be compiled with the utmost
accuracy and care.
I do not believe we can be entirely confident that this is the case and
there seems to be a need for some public reassurance on the following
matters:
(a) How are monthly trade figures compiled?
(b) Who prepares them and from what sources?
(c) What steps are taken to verify that the figures are accurate and
complete?
(d) Are the figures compiled on a comparable basis and with a similar degree
of accuracy to those of other countries, for example in the EC?

FT  26 SEP 92 / Life outside the premier league: Britain's prospects in a
two-speed Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We must build a United States of Europe. Only in this way will hundreds of
millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make
life worth living.' That was the vision of Winston Churchill, expounded in
September 1946 in a celebrated speech in Zurich.
He made clear at the end of the address that, whatever this European union
might be, Britain itself would not take part. It would remain grandly on the
flank, along with the US and the Soviet Union, among the 'friends and
sponsors of the new Europe'.
This week, the UK is once again facing up to the prospect that European
integration could forge ahead without British participation. This time,
however, if Germany and France went forward with political and monetary
union among a small 'hard core', Britain's outside position would be a great
deal more uncomfortable than that envisaged by Churchill.
Instead of sharing the 'joys and hopes' of the champions, Britain could well
be toiling in the second division - a somewhat shabby, soft-currency cousin
ploughing a low productivity furrow ever further away from the EC centre.
Britain's economic output per head has already fallen by about 20 per cent
compared with the 12-nation EC average during the last 30 years. Now the
long, slow decline looks likely to continue.
Is this view a caricature? Not according to Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive
of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, one of the few UK
companies in this sector successfully to have steamed through the shocks of
the recession. 'We'd better get started pretty damn quick. Otherwise we'll
be a third-world nation next to a first-rate European economy.'
Mr Garrick calls on the government to use the current phase of policy
reappraisal to give more support to manufacturing industry - not through
'interference' but through practical measures such as help in export credits
or research and development. 'If we keep on like this we will not be in the
slow lane of Europe. We'll be stationary - on the east European fringes.'
Mr Garrick says his company managed to 'compete with the Germans' with
sterling pegged at the former central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of
DM2.95. Although Weir has been given a competitive boost by sterling's
devaluation, Mr Garrick believes UK inflation could, before long, be 'out of
step' with inflation rates in the rest of Europe.
Almost inevitably, British people will become poorer compared with the
French and the Germans, Mr Garrick says. 'Successful economies see their
currencies becoming worth more, not less. And they sit at the top of the
pile in terms of spending power.'
A slightly less gloomy view comes from Mr Wynne Godley, professor of applied
economics at Cambridge University, who has given consistently accurate
forecasts of the depth of the recession.
Although Mr Godley says he remains very pessimistic about the outlook for
real recovery, he believes sterling's devaluation will put Britain in the
fast lane of European growth in the next few years. This is because 'the
whole of Europe is locked into depression' as a result of the strictures of
the exchange rate mechanism.
'We are clearly better off than we were a fortnight ago. One of the lunacies
of the last year or two was when people said that a devaluation would lead
to higher interest rates. That was absolutely wrong.'
Consumers, house-owners and anyone involved in small business will benefit,
Mr Godley predicts. Lower interest rates 'will stop a lot of suicides. A
large number of people were in real trouble. And it will lower unemployment.
This will tend to make Britain a happier place.'
Longer term, there are clearly worries about whether British consumers and
industrialists will profit if the UK remains outside the mainstream of
Europe. Mr Graham Mather, head of the European Policy Forum, a pro-European
think-tank, sees some appeal in Britain's position as a cheap and relatively
unregulated manufacturing base serving the European core. 'Making Britain
the Hong Kong of Europe could be a viable strategy. I can imagine Lord Young
(the former industry secretary) selling it, seizing on the idea of 'free
port Britain'. But somehow I don't sense the mood that our business leaders
want to do this.'
However powerful a formal European currency bloc might eventually become,
employees in British banks and financial services could benefit if Britain
remains outside. After sterling's ignominious withdrawal from the exchange
rate mechanism, the City's idea that London could play host to the European
central bank is no more than a pipe dream. But, says Mr Brendan Brown, head
of research at Mitsubishi Finance in London, 'there would be a competitive
advantage in trading the money and instruments of the core group without
being subject to the same restrictions'.
Two parts of the economy which stand to prosper if sterling remains on the
'soft' monetary periphery are tourism and retailing. Mr Michael Herbert,
chief executive of the Tussauds group - part of the Pearson concern which
publishes the FT - expects increased numbers of foreign visitors to the
group's tourist attractions. He reacts strongly to the notion that Britain
is set to become a sort of a weak-currency tourist supermarket.
'Tourism tends to be regarded as a poor sort of industry, when in fact it's
one of Britain's most thriving sectors.' British Aerospace used to be the
biggest employer in the area around Kingston-upon-Thames, he says, whereas
now it is the group's Chessington World of Adventures theme park. 'I don't
see swapping heavy industry for service industry is a bad thing.'
The Harrods department store also sees a silver lining in the monetary
fall-out. 'Harrods has always been integrated with Europe,' says Mr Michael
Cole, Harrods' main press spokesman. The store's 700 tills at present accept
only sterling and dollars. 'But if the customers want us to take D-Marks, we
will take them.'
With 15 per cent of Harrods' merchandise bought from France, and 11 per cent
from Italy, Chianti is likely to fall in price relative to Bordeaux, he says
 -and there are even prospects for cheaper pasta in the food hall.
Harrods' sales on Thursday were up 15 per cent compared with the same day
last year. About 60 per cent of Harrods' clientele come from the 'tiara
triangle' within three miles of the store. But 10 per cent are from overseas
visitors. 'The public was stunned by what happened last week. But then it
collected itself and decided that it (the fall of sterling) was not such a
bad thing.'
From what used to be the country's industrial heartland in north-west
England, the Bishop of Manchester, as might be expected, has his eyes on
loftier matters than the price of pasta. He said yesterday he welcomed
anything - including a devaluation - which would improve the lot of
'devastated' local manufacturers. But he added: 'It seems incredible that
European leaders can't get closer together.' British 'pride' was to blame
for the government's failure to accept an earlier devaluation of sterling:
'It was clear that we were overvalued.'
As for Britain's prospective European relegation, the bishop said: 'It is
not inevitable. It needs imaginative leadership to keep Europe united, to
keep the European movement going forward, and to maintain Britain at the
heart of it, like John Major says.'
After the events of the last 10 days, if Mr Major is to stop Britain's slow
decent towards second class Euro-citizenship, he will need intervention
considerably exceeding that furnished by the Bundesbank. A divine spark may
be the prime minister's best hope.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is likely to open up almost all industries to foreign investment and
scrap administrative restrictions on imports after the Communist party's
14th congress next month, a pro-Beijing daily said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Hong Kong.
'The government has developed new thinking in reforms: aside from 'bread and
butter', everything could be opened to foreign investment,' Hong Kong's Wen
Wei Po newspaper quoted Beijing sources as saying.
Senior leaders at the congress will probably allow foreign investors to take
part in building airports, railways and roads, said the newspaper, which
often acts as a mouthpiece for the Chinese government line.
'The central government will give special support to foreign investors who
plan to build major airports in northwestern China,' it quoted authoritative
sources as saying.
Wen Wei Po said primary industries including crude oil and coal would be
opened further to foreign partners.
Beijing has pledged to accelerate the pace of economic reforms since senior
leader Deng Xiaoping visited China's booming south in February. But the
government still restricts the entry of foreign capital into certain
industries.
China will also open up other markets to foreign goods by easing import
regulations in line with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt),
it said.
Administrative intervention to adjust imports will be gradually replaced by
measures such as tariffs, exchange rates, interest rates, quotas and import
licences, the newspaper said.
'The current administration-based import-control system falls well short of
Gatt's requirements and increases trade friction,' the newspaper said.
China is seeking to join the world trade body. It is also in dispute with
the US, which has threatened punitive sanctions unless Beijing opens its
markets wider by October 10 - two days before the party meeting.
The report said fledgling car and camera industries would remain protected
under a revamped import tariff system.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Kanemaru slips off the hook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SHIN KANEMARU, powerbroker of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
yesterday ended a curious two-week stand-off with the public prosecutors'
office by formally admitting that he violated the country's political
funding laws in accepting a donation of Y500m (Pounds 2.36m).
For the past two weeks, prosecutors have demanded that Mr Kanemaru, 78,
appear before them to answer questions, but he settled the issue yesterday
by dispatching a written statement in which he admitted receiving the money
from a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.
Mr Kanemaru's willingness to ignore the prosecutors' requests had angered
ordinary Japanese, who were treated to nightly news broadcasts from outside
his Tokyo home. The 'godfather,' as he is known, has remained inside his
home for the past month, receiving guests and refusing to comment.
LDP officials have apparently received an assurance from the the Tokyo
district public prosecutors' office that Mr Kanemaru will not face a public
trial, but will be summarily fined Y200,000, the maximum penalty under the
Political Funds Control Law.
The likelihood that Mr Kanemaru will not face a trial has also angered many
Japanese, and has prompted television commentators to brandish copies of the
constitution, to point to the section stating that all are equal under the
law, and to suggest that the 'godfather' is a bit more equal than most
people.
Passed in an attempt to control 'money politics,' the funds law limits to
Y1.5m annually the amount an individual politician can receive from a single
company. Mr Kanemaru virtually admitted a month ago that he violated the law
by announcing that his office had received the Y500m, but he presumed that
he would not be pursued by prosecutors.
At that time, he resigned as the LDP's vice-president, but his real power
lies in his control of the party's largest grouping, the Takeshita faction.
Mr Kanemaru's troubles have prompted a power struggle within that faction,
and several of his supporters apparently negotiated with prosecutors to
ensure that his political future will be safe.
While Mr Kanemaru intends to remain as head of the faction, his power has
been weakened, if only by the fact that the scandal may limit his ability to
raise funds. In his statement yesterday, Mr Kanemaru said the Y500m was
distributed among his faction's members, many of whom are dependent on his
largesse.
Mr Kanemaru has previously said that the money was received from Tokyo
Sagawa by his staff in early 1990, but he now admits to having received the
money himself from Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Tokyo
Sagawa Kyubin.
Japanese commentators have drawn a stark comparison between the treatment of
Mr Watanabe, who is now on trial for breach of corporate trust, and Mr
Kanemaru, who appears set to avoid the ignominy of a public trial.
Several supporters have apparently negotiated with prosecutors to ensure
that his political future will be safe

HONG KONG protested to China yesterday over an armed confrontation between
marine officers from both sides on a fishing boat in Hong Kong waters, the
Government Information Service (GIS) said, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong Political Adviser's office summoned a representative of the
New China News Agency, China's de facto embassy in the British colony, to
express 'grave concern over an incursion which took place in Hong Kong
waters and the dangerous behaviour of the Chinese officers involved.'
The GIS said police received a report that a fishing vessel inside Hong Kong
waters had been boarded by a number of armed Chinese officers after it had
been stopped by a Chinese security forces vessel.
When Hong Kong police boarded the fishing boat they were surprised by three
Chinese police officers who threatened them and confiscated film when they
tried to photograph the incident.
The stand-off, near Waglan Island in southeast Hong Kong, lasted nearly two
hours.
It ended when the Chinese officers returned to their speedboat and left for
Chinese waters.
No shots were fired and there were no injuries.
Earlier, government-run RTHK radio said armed Chinese security men boarded a
Hong Kong police launch and confiscated a film the police were making of a
speedboat towing another vessel.
The waters around the British colony have this year become increasingly
dangerous for shipping after 13 armed incursions and at least 14 raids on
ships bound for Vietnam. Nearly all the incidents involved Chinese gunboats.
Relations between Hong Kong and China, traditionally wary, have further
soured over financing plans for a new airport in the colony and the issue of
greater democracy for Hong Kong ahead of its 1997 return to Chinese
sovereignty.
Governor Chris Patten has abandoned the diplomatic approach of his
predecessors and openly attacked China's foot-dragging on the airport.
He has not commented on the incursions which officials said were apparently
not officially sanctioned.

FT  26 SEP 92 / China to hold first public auction of cultural relics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is to hold its first public auction of cultural relics, among them
pre-1795 objects formerly strictly banned from overseas sale to preserve the
national cultural heritage.
The auction, to run for three days from October 11, is a big departure from
past practice. A US businessman recently offered Dollars 100m to buy a
terracotta warrior from the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang, but his offer was
turned down.
The Chinese Communist party has tirelessly denounced foreigners for
plundering and pillaging its ancient temples and Silk Road treasures in the
late 19th and early 20th century, dismissing claims that the plundered
objects were saved from destruction during decades of turmoil and chaos in
China.
Now it has been tempted into the market to compete with Sotheby's and
Christie's in a bid to take some of the profit from the lucrative illegal
relics traffic, run by highly-organised gangs of professional grave robbers
and smugglers aided by corrupt police and customs officers.
It is almost impossible to stop the cultural crooks operating across vast
stretches of remote rural China, or restrain the dealers, collectors, museum
curators and scholars outside China who make the illicit trade possible.
China's Bureau of Cultural Relics has no money to spend to police the
movement of large quantities of precious Chinese artifacts through foreign
auction houses to overseas museums and the homes of wealthy western
collectors.
All across the country, China Daily reports, treasures hundreds and even
thousands of years old are being lost to natural and man-made hazards. Some
historical relics have been reduced to rubble and the vandalism of the
cultural revolution is still not repaired.
Thieves take advantage of the lag in excavating tombs and historic sites
caused by lack of funds, digging them up and smuggling them out of the
country.
This year police in Shaanxi province in China's northwest, dealt with 846
cases of tomb robbing and 130 cases of smuggling cultural relics. They
siezed over 3,300 relics and arrested 1,622 criminals.
The proposed auction is aimed at recouping some of the losses to this murky
underground antiques market by selling off relics at a profit abroad, taking
advantage of sky-high prices for Chinese objets d'art, and generating some
revenue for further excavations.
The most famous of all China's archaeological digs, the pit near the tomb of
China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, where the 7,000 strong terracotta army
was buried two millenia ago, is still only one quarter restored.
Foreign money already goes to preserve some major treasures. Tomb frescoes
in the Xian historical museum are partially funded with Italian money.
American Express adverts in the Forbidden City testify to US conservation
money.
At October's auction 2,188 objects will go under the hammer, over 200 dating
back to the 11th century BC. Co-sponsored by the Beijing Cultural Relics
Bureau, the Beijing Auction Market and a Dutch company trading in Chinese
antiques, the auction is expected to attract 1,000 international buyers.
Ten per cent of the objects to be sold are privately owned, but their
owners' names are not revealed. Lots include Chinese porcelain, jade,
jewellery, antique clocks and watches, paintings and calligraphy, gold,
silver and bronze, even old cars once used by VIPs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS of an early Japanese interest rate cut were damped yesterday by a
slight rise in the inflation rate in Tokyo, which usually leads inflationary
trends in the rest of the country.
Tokyo consumer prices rose by 0.5 per cent in September, about 2.2 per cent
up from a year before, compared with an annual rate of increase of 1.8 per
cent in August, according to a report from the Management and Co-ordination
Agency.
The national annual inflation rate in August was 1.7 per cent, the agency
reported.
Meanwhile the Japanese cabinet was presented with an official report which
warned that the economy was still slowing.
The report from the Economic Planning Agency warned that only new housing
starts and government spending were providing domestic sources of growth as
consumer spending and capital investment were still falling.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said there was no need for
a change in monetary policy even though the economy was going through a
preiod of 'severe adjustment.'
The depression in consumer markets was highlighted by a 3.9 per cent fall in
Japanese department store sales in August, according to the Japan Department
Stores Association.
A firmer dollar helped take the wind out of the Tokyo stock market.
The Nikkei average closed down lost 215.19 points to 18,394.76, after a 327
point gain on Thursday.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Hopes rise as South African leaders meet: An encounter that
cannot be allowed to end in failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER four fractious months of political bickering and daily deaths, the
South African Government and the African National Congress (ANC) have agreed
that their leaders, Mr FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, should meet - and
that the meeting, to be held later today in Johannesburg, cannot be allowed
to fail.
White and black South Africans, fed up with the months of stalemate, will be
relieved to see Mr de Klerk, the South African president, and Mr Mandela,
the ANC President, shaking hands for the cameras for the first time since
last May.
There is always a chance that they will also see their leaders hurling
insults at one another - as the two men did during the first session of
constitutional negotiations earlier this year - but that seems unlikely.
For senior officials from both sides have spent almost every waking moment
for the past 10 days clearing away the political obstacles which could have
tripped up the two presidents: issues such as preventing violence launched
from single-sex township hostels, banning the carrying of dangerous weapons
in public, and releasing political prisoners. They were under pressure
throughout from western diplomats and from the United Nations to abandon the
habit of intransigence and get back to substantive talks on a new
constitution.
Then, late on Thursday night, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk were in contact to
seal the final deal: three of the ANC's most celebrated guerrilla fighters
are to be freed on Monday, with 150 less notorious prisoners to be released
within 48 hours (124 were released yesterday).
The two sides have also reached outline agreement on security measures for
township hostels most often involved in violence, and for banning dangerous
weapons in public.
These agreements (especially the release of the three ANC guerrillas, all of
whom staged terrorist attacks which claimed white victims), represent a
substantial concession from the government, which insisted until the 11th
hour that their immediate release was impossible. In the end, Pretoria's
legal objections were overcome when it was agreed that they would leave jail
on parole.
Pretoria has placed other contentious issues on the summit agenda, including
its demand for a general amnesty for state officials accused of political
crimes as well as a demand that the ANC curtail its campaign of mass protest
actions. The government argues that mass action provokes violence, and wants
the ANC to abandon plans for further homeland protests.
Mr Mandela is unlikely to commit himself publicly to halt mass action. But
he has already put the campaign on hold in the hopes of success at the
negotiating table: a planned march on Bophuthatswana has been delayed, and
the ANC has pointedly refused to set a date for a march on Ulundi, the
KwaZulu capital, the seat of Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who has
issued veiled threats of bloodshed if the march proceeds.
So the chances are that tomorrow's summit will succeed, and that Mr Mandela
will afterwards declare the resumption of bilateral talks on a new
constitution (informal talks have been going on despite the official
suspension). But those negotiations - over an interim government and a
constituent assembly - are likely to prove as difficult as ever.
And even if the two sides reach agreement, they face the unenviable task of
persuading the irascible Chief Buthelezi to accept a subordinate position in
the new South Africa. So long as he refuses to do so, low-grade civil war
will no doubt continue between his supporters and the ANC - and the fragile
talks could again founder, as so often before, on the unsolved problem of
violence.

FT  26 SEP 92 / US-Japan chip dispute defused

A POLITICALLY sensitive trade dispute between Japan and the US was yesterday
defused at least until after the US presidential election, following
government reports that the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market
rose significantly in the second quarter of year.
The US and Japanese governments said yesterday that the foreign share of
Japan's market rose to 16 per cent, compared to 14.6 per cent in first
quarter. This was the biggest quarterly increase since 1986, when the the US
and Japan signed the first semiconductor trade agreement.
'The increase in market share is a positive step in the right direction and
is an indication of an improved effort by Japan to comply with the
semiconductor trade agreement in the second quarter,' said Mr Andrew
Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a US trade
group.
Japanese government and industry officials also welcomed the increase,
although they expressed concern that further progress would be difficult to
achieve while the electronics industry continued to be in recession.
The Electronics Industries Association of Japan, the private industry
association, made a commitment in June to increase the purchase of foreign
semiconductors in the second half of the year at a faster rate than the
increase in Japanese semiconductors. The commitment, however, was predicated
on a recovery in the economy during the second half of the year that now
looks difficult to achieve.
The Japanese government last year acknowledged US industry expectations that
foreign market share should grow to more than 20 per cent by the end of this
year. Many in the US industry have interpreted this as a commitment by the
Japanese side
The second quarter increase in market share could help to deflect US
government anger. Last month a US government inter-agency review concluded
that Japan's efforts to open its semiconductor market had produced
'insufficient progress'. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative,
warned that America would take 'additional actions, as necessary, to fulfil
the terms of the (1991) arrangement,' if substantial progress was not
achieved by year end.
Yesterday Mrs Hills said the rise in market share 'represents the first
bright spot we have seen in an otherwise disappointing first year of the
1991 arrangement.'
Two Japanese camera manufacturers have reached an out-of-court settlement
with Honeywell, the US electronics company, over their alleged infringement
of its patents for auto-focus cameras, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Olympus Optical has agreed to pay Dollars 34.7m (Pounds 20.2m) and Asahi
Optical will pay Dollars 21m to settle a dispute over the patents.
Both Japanese companies also disclosed that their financial results would
deteriorate sharply this year as the slowdown in the Japanese economy takes
its toll.
Olympus said it expects to make an after-tax loss of Y700m for the first
half of the year after initially forecasting a Y1.5bn profit. Asahi is also
expected to make a loss after initially forecasting a small after-tax
profit.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Ethics on the bottom line - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT is ethical? The difference between right and wrong. But what
constitutes being wrong?
Despite the ending of apartheid, some people still refuse to invest in
companies with South African interests. But would it not be better to invest
in South African companies which display an enlightened attitude towards
black employees so that other companies may learn from their example?
Do those people who still boycott South Africa also refuse to invest in
other societies which have experienced racial conflicts?
Should investment be made only in countries that are democratic? In that
case, investment in Hong Kong should be avoided - although if Hong Kong had
been run along democratic lines, perhaps it might not have prospered so
quickly and dramatically and I would not have profited from my investments
there.
Indeed, a case could be made for investing (or not investing) in almost
every country: there is probably something objectionable in all of them. As
a private investor, I have no moral qualms about investing anywhere in the
world - so long as the companies in which I invest are run on ethical lines
and there are opportunities to make a profit.
For some years, I refused to invest in companies which produced cigarettes,
partly because I dislike people puffing smoke in my face and partly because
I felt that, eventually, much tougher legislation or changes in social
habits would cause a decline in such companies' profits (although, as yet,
it has not happened).
When I mentioned this to a friend she commented that, to be logical and
consistent, I should also refrain from investing in supermarket groups that
sold cigarettes and transport companies that helped to distribute them. And
why, she asked, did I not also refrain from investing in companies dealing
with alcoholic drinks? Perhaps I should reassess my investment criteria.
I have avoided putting money into various 'ethical' unit trusts because some
of their restrictions are not to my taste. A number of them refuse to invest
in companies involved in the gambling industry. Yet, surely the stock market
itself is a gamble.
Should they also avoid investing in companies where the chairman or chief
executive has a mistress on the basis that, if he lies to his wife, he might
lie about the true state of the company?
Personally, I ignore people's sexual peccadillos when making investment
decisions. I am much more interested in their overall basic honesty. I can
accept that bribes are necessary in some countries in order to do business
and ought really to be regarded as 'advance commissions.' But if a UK
company made such payments to someone for business in Britain, I would not
invest in that company.
People who are liars and cheats are usually poor at creating or running
long-lasting businesses. That is why I avoided investing in companies run by
Robert Maxwell.
I keep a list of names of other people whose companies I avoid and have made
sure that the executors of my will cannot invest with them. The laws of
libel prevent me from disclosing this list.
Companies that are slow to pay their bills are hardly encouraging their
suppliers to provide the best quality and service. With such an attitude,
might they not be equally 'tough' towards their customers?
All this seems to me to be morally reprehensible and bad for long-term
business, so I try to avoid making investments in such companies.
I also dislike companies that have a discriminatory recruiting policy.
People should be employed for their ability, not because of their age, sex,
race, religion or who they know.
Is a company that advertises for a financial analysis manager paying up to
Pounds 50,000 plus benefits, but restricting applicants to those 'aged 28 to
33' (as did the Prudential in a recent advertisement), really doing its best
to find the most capable person? Too many UK companies are stipulating
ridiculous age ranges for job applicants. In the US, the American Age
Discrimination Act allows people to sue for compensation for age
discrimination.
What is even worse is that Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation) advertised recently for assistant enforcement
officers, while the Securities and Investments Board wanted a senior policy
assistant. Each regulatory board specified an age range of '25 to 35.'
How can you have any confidence in the integrity and ethics of such
organisations if they are prepared to practise such blatant discrimination?
And will they really find the best candidates? Surely people with years of
experience of City crooks might have something to offer.
Dixons, the stores group, has agreed to fund a Pounds 1m chair in business
ethics at the London Business School. I hope this will lead to further
investigation of the morality of discrimination and its effects on company
performance. Meanwhile, I will continue to refrain from investing in
companies with discriminatory policies.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capital gains tax allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in August. To
use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure shown for the
month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the result will
be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought some shares for Pounds 6,000 in March 1984 and sold
them in August 1992 for Pounds 15,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
March 1984 figure of 1.588 gives a total of Pounds 9,528.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 15,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 5,472, which is below the 1992-93 capital gains tax allowance of
Pounds 5,800. If you realised no other gains during the year, the profits
should be tax-free.
If you are selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the
March 1982 figure.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Free of CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I BOUGHT a flat in London in 1985 while working for a US bank in the UK. My
employer provided rented accommodation and I bought the flat in case this
perk fell away. It has since been let out for most of the time and I have
never lived in it.
In 1989, I got a job with a French bank and moved to Paris. Since I no
longer need a base in London I want to sell the flat and buy something in
France. Will I have to pay capital gains tax on any eventual profit?
If you are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK at any time in
the tax year (ending on April 5) in which the sale contract is made, you
will be outside the scope of capital gains tax. The solicitor who acts for
you in the sale will, of course, be able to guide you through the tax maze.
You may like to ask your last UK tax office (or the Inland revenue Public
Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, UK WC2R 1LB) for copies of the
free pamphlets CGT14 (Capital gains tax - an introduction) and IR58 (Going
to work abroad).

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): BES losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I BOUGHT Pounds 5,000 worth of shares in a BES company on March 5 1986 (ie.
under the old regulations). I received income tax relief on the whole of my
investment at the top rate of income tax which applied at that time.
The company was wound up on April 7 1992: no dividends were ever paid and
the disposal proceeds were nil.
Am I entitled to any capital loss relief on the original investment or on
the net cost after tax relief? Is any indexation due?
On the facts outlined, the answer is no. Section 150(3) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992 says:
'The sums allowable as deductions from the consideration in the computation
for the purposes of capital gains tax of the gain or loss accruing to an
individual on the disposal of shares issued before March 19 1986 in respect
of which relief has been given and not withdrawn shall be determined without
regard to that relief, except that where those sums exceed the consideration
they shall be reduced by an amount equal to
a) the amount of that relief; or
b) the excess
whichever is the less, but the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall
not apply to a disposal falling within section 58(1).' So, as you will see,
the cost of your shareholding for CGT purposes is Pounds 5,000 - Pounds
5,000 = NIL on which indexation can be claimed.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Dividends and profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT possible for a small private limited company such as ours to pay out
dividends in excess of trading profit, in any one accounting year, thus
making use of the retained profit of previous years? If so, then at the end
of the year will the company be able to get back from the Inland Revenue the
difference between the ACT (which presumably has to be paid in any case at
the end of the relevant quarterly period) and the corporation tax due on the
year's profit? Or is the adjustment of this excess payment allowed only
against future tax liabilities?
If the dividend route is not permissible for distributing the retained
profit, can you please suggest other tax efficient ways of achieving this?
Yes, you can pay dividends in excess of profits.
It is possible, in principle, to carry the excess ACT back and thus recover
part of the corporation tax paid for past years. The rules are complex.
The company's accountants are best placed to advise you on what strategies
to adopt, because they know the full background facts, figures and dates. If
the fact that you have written to us indicates that you have no confidence
in the company's accountants' competence in tax matters, perhaps the Board
should consider changing to a better firm.
Possibly your bank manager can recommend a suitable one, if you do not wish
to seek recommendations from business acquaintances, for example.

THE OWNERS of the freehold of my home also own a vast number of other
residential properties.
To the best of my knowledge these properties are all leased on full
repairing leases.
As all the tenants pay for maintenance and a lot of these properties were
built in the 1830s and require considerable maintenance, should the
landlords be entitled to claim tax relief against depreciation or, what
seems to be more equitable, should not the tenants be able to make such a
claim?
Can landlords claim tax relief for insurance of properties in their
portfolios - when the tenants pay for insurance, albeit in the name of the
landlord?
Under section 25 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, a landlord
can obtain tax relief for payments in respect of maintenance, insurance etc
which he has made personally. He gets no tax relief for depreciation of the
property.
The tenants cannot obtain tax relief (unless they receive rent from
subtenants).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY PARENTS and I jointly own, in equal shares, two properties neither of
which we live in. If we each make a gift of our respective halves to each
other, thus having a house each, solely owned, will we be liable for any
capital gains tax there may be on the value of the half-interest
transferred? Would the tax on such gains have to be paid as soon as possible
after the gifts had been made?
You will be taxed as though you had disposed of your respective interests at
their current market value.
Since you will be exchanging interest of (presumably) more or less equal
value, there will be no element of gift in fact. That being so, the CGT will
be payable on December after the end of the tax year in which the exchange
takes place. So the middle of next April might be suitable time to do the
swap.
The timing depends upon your other chargeable gains for 1992-93 and 1993-94
and the size of the potential chargeable gain arising from the exchange.
The solicitor who prepares the conveyance for you will be able to help you
with the tax implications.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: What will you pay . . . - . . . And
how much will you be able to save? / The government cut base rates to 9 per
cent on Tuesday. Finance and the Family writers discuss the impact on your
mortgage and savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE rates began moving steadily downward this week in the wake of
Tuesday's 1 per cent cut in the banks' base rate, writes David Barchard.
As usual, however, rates for new borrowers were cut quickest; existing
borrowers will have to wait a month or so before seeing the benefit.
The medium-sized societies led the way, establishing a norm of around 9.95
per cent for mortgage rates, while the largest lenders paused to consider
their strategy.
By the weekend, Abbey National and Nationwide, two of the top three lenders,
had cut their basic mortgage interest rates to 9.95 per cent and the new
rate was firmly established. Three banks, Royal Bank of Scotland, Midland
and National Westminster, have now moved mortgage rates to under 10 per
cent.
Halifax and the other big lenders now look set to fall into line. There is
one exception: the centralised lenders, whose rates, mostly at 11.5 per
cent, are far above the norm.
When they move, the chances are that most centralised lenders will cut their
rates by a full percentage point. That will still leave them well above the
building societies and banks, at least so far as their existing borrowers
are concerned.
Building society mortgage interest rates do not often fall below 10 per cent
in the UK. May 1988 was the last time they fell below this threshold, and
that did not last long. To find a period when mortgage rates stayed below 10
per cent for a considerable time one has to go back to 1977-78.
This time may be different. Some economic pundits forecast a base rate as
low as 6 per cent. Mortgage lenders are hoping that first-time buyers, and
others who have been waiting before buying a home, will be tempted back into
the market.
Those who prefer certainty may opt for the 8.25 per cent fixed rate
mortgages being offered this week by National &amp; Provincial and Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester. Northern Rock is offering 8.99 per cent fixed for two years. The
C&amp;G offer, which lasts for two years, is particularly attractive
because,unlike the others, it is not tied to the sale of property insurance
and is available on an interest-only basis, as well as for repayment and
endowment mortgages.
Most striking in the latest round of cuts is that societies have not passed
on the full 1 percentage point cut to customers. It shows that societies are
beginning to structure their mortgage interest charges along new lines. For
the last two or three years, customers with very large mortgages have done
much better than those with average-sized loans.
Abbey National's customers with mortgages over Pounds 100,000, for example,
were being charged 9.99 per cent, when those with mortgages of Pounds 60,000
or below paid 10.7 per cent.
This week, Abbey National customers with mortgages under Pounds 60,000 must
have been delighted to learn that their rates had been cut by 0.75
percentage points to 9.95 per cent, while those with mortgages over Pounds
100,000 enjoyed a much less impressive reduction of only 0.5 percentage
points to 9.49 per cent.
It will take a good many years of low interest rates before lenders and
homeowners forget the painful lessons of the last few years in the British
housing market.
Building societies are traditionally slower to announce changes in savings
than mortgage rates, although cuts in savings returns are usually put more
quickly into effect, writes Philip Coggan.
A few institutions have started to lower savings rates already. At Nat West,
for example, gross rates have fallen by a shade over 1 per cent with a
Pounds 25,000-plus deposit in the Premium Plus account now offering 7.85 per
cent, down from 8.91 per cent. The result is a fall in net rates by just
over three quarters of a percentage point.
It seems likely given the recent complaints by building societies about
margin pressure, that savers will suffer the full percentage point decline
in gross rates, whereas homeowners are only enjoying a 0.75 of percentage
point cut in mortgage rates.
The market for guaranteed income bonds has been in turmoil since the base
rate change, which is why our Highest Rates table (page VI) excludes this
category this week.
Baronworth Investment Services cites one company, Providence Capitol, which
cuts its one year GIB rates by 2.5 percentage points on Thursday. The best
offers on three-year bonds are just over 7 per cent net (Prosperity
Financial services is offering 7.5 per cent on sums of over Pounds 15,000);
to get 8 per cent, one has to invest as much as Pounds 50,000 for five years
with Aetna.
The prospect for annuity rates is a matter of debate, since these depend not
on base rates, but on the level of gilt yields. According to the Annuity
Bureau, annuity rates are likely to rise.
But William Burrows of Sage Financial consultants says: 'I cannot guess what
the short term yields will do - but the general feeling is that long term
rates will fall.'
National Savings was quick to respond to this week's UK base rate change,
with many of its products withdrawn from sale on Tuesday.
The 38th issue of fixed interest certificates, the Series E Capital bonds,
First Option bonds, Issue C Children's Bonus Bonds and the 7.5 per cent
Yearly Plan are no longer on offer.
New rates will be announced shortly. There will not necessarily be cuts of 1
per cent across the board, because of the tax-free nature of many of the
products.
Changes in variable rate accounts have already been announced. As from
October 6, the rate on the investment account will fall from 8.25 per cent
to 7.25 per cent. From November 5, the return on income bonds will drop from
9 per cent to 8 per cent.
The 5th index-linked savings certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent
plus inflation if held for five years, remain on sale.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Don't hang out the flags just yet -
The effect of base rate cuts on property prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASE RATE cuts cannot possibly be bad news for the domestic property market.
However, homeowners should not hang out the bunting just yet. In the long
term, the market will be boosted.
But there are several reasons to believe that this base rate cut will not,
in the short-term, give house prices the upward push that normal theory
suggests they should.
Part of the reason can be seen in market behaviour this year. If lower
lending rates were enough, then the market should already be showing signs
of life.
As the Weekend FT pointed out last month, the cost of servicing a mortgage
as a proportion of average earnings, having increased to unsustainable
levels in 1990, is back to the level of early 1988.
First-time buyers in particular should have been tempted back into the
market by the array of special discounts which lenders were offering. Ian
Darby, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, says they have had a range of
offers below 10 per cent to consider for some months, and affordability is
not the issue.
He says that the big issue is confidence. Young people are nervous for their
jobs. While unemployment and the fear of it remain high, then, a strong
pick-up in demand is unlikely.
This opinion is born out by a survey for the Woolwich building society of
18-25 year-olds' attitudes to house purchase. When asked which factors would
determine when they bought for the first time, 80 per cent named job
security, 70 per cent income and 56 per cent savings. Only 44.3 per cent
named mortgage rates, while future house prices, the presiding concern of
virtually everyone who is already on the 'housing ladder' were important for
only 11 per cent.
Last week's events were scarcely conducive to confidence. Deals fell through
as nervous buyers decided not to bother, while estate agents report
ridiculous offers from buyers trying their luck. This week's worrying news
about job losses may be more important for first-time buyers than base
rates.
However, the maths of buying is now appealing. A first-time buyer with the
Leeds Permanent, the biggest lender to cut its rates this week, could fund a
Pounds 60,000 mortgage with repayments of only Pounds 425.17 per month for
the first year, and Pounds 526.63 after that.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, in arguably the most attractive fixed-rate deal
currently available, would allow interest-only payments of just Pounds
360.94 per month to fund a mortgage of the same size, leaving the borrower
with a full range of options to save towards the capital.
This kind of sum will in many cases be cheaper than the rent for an
equivalent property, and should be enough to tempt many savers out of
renting. The savings rates available to those who rent are coming down,
adding to the arguments for taking a loan.
The rental market, meanwhile, has shown signs of life, particularly in areas
such as London and the South East where homeowners have been particularly
hard hit.
According to Rowena Gilbert, letting director with Chestertons, the biggest
letting agency in London, the proportion of business from individuals,
rather than foreigners or corporate clients, has increased dramatically over
the last year. Rents have been stable for some time while the cost of buying
has continued to decrease.
All of this points to pent-up demand for housing. But experts, such as John
Wriglesworth of UBS Philips &amp; Drew, point to a similar overhang of supply
thanks to repossessions and inheritance. He does not expect prices to rise
until the end of next year. Those sitting on 'negative equity' need to stay
put for another year.
For first-time buyers, this is a 'time to buy' in terms of affordability,
but it is not an investment opportunity - it would be most unwise to expect
significant real returns from a house purchase.
Youngsters are unlikely to look at it this way. The British retain their
addiction to home ownership and this could rescue today's straitened
homeowners. The Woolwich survey found 83 per cent of 18-25 year-olds
regarded a home as a sound investment, and 80 per cent wanted to buy.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: A cheer for the knights at arms - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READ the next few sentences and try to guess who is speaking about the life
assurance industry.
'I should like to see a shift in competition away from who gives the best
commission to who gives the best value to the customer. I hope that product
competition will come to be stimulated by publication and comparison of
charges. I hope that consumer interests might be better served through the
availability of products without heavy early surrender penalties, and by
greater emphasis being given to improving the persistency of policyholders.'
Some of you will probably assume that the above comes from the mouth of a
consumer pressure group, or more likely, from the pen of some know-nothing
financial journalist.
In fact, those comments were made this week by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director
general of the Office of Fair Trading, a government body with responsibility
for ensuring competition and consumer protection.
Sir Bryan is a brave man. He made his remarks in a speech to the annual
conference of the Chartered Insurance Institute. Judging by the reaction of
the industry's trade body, one hopes he had a fast car waiting at the back
of the hall. The Association of British Insurers dismissed his speech,
saying Sir Bryan 'betrayed a lack of understanding about the way the
insurance industry operates.'
Regular readers of the Financial Times will not be surprised to learn that I
am on Sir Bryan's side. But judge for yourself whether his following
analysis of life assurance products displays ignorance or shrewd
observation.
'A key aspect of life assurance is the 'halo effect' of combining protection
with investment. Customers might find it helpful to know how much they are
paying for protection, that is, commonly, the right to receive the amount in
question if they die before the end of the term of the policy. The costs are
often only small sums but knowing them would enable customers to compare the
investment element of life insurance more readily with alternative
investment vehicles.'
In other words, when you pay Pounds 30 a month for an endowment policy, how
much is going to provide you with life cover, and how much is invested in
stocks and shares? If you knew the answer, you could compare the policy with
a combination of term assurance (basic life cover, with no investment
element) and a unit trust savings plan.
Sir Bryan also dealt with commissions and the surrender penalties applied to
endowment policies in early years.
'Given that such policies are mainly investments, people naturally ask why
the bulk if not all of premiums should be lost on early surrender' he said.
'This month's Which? consumer magazine shows that, for 40 different
companies, surrender values at the end of year two on similar policies,
averaged about Pounds 700 against total premiums paid averaging about Pounds
1,700. Why should consumers lose some Pounds 1,000 on such early surrenders?
No other investments result in such heavy automatic losses.'
Sir Bryan referred to the practice of 'front-ending' commissions, whereby
salesmen are paid heavily in the years immediately after selling a policy.
'If commission depended more on the maintenance of policies over their
extended lifetime, sales people might give more attention to whether the
policy fitted the needs of the customer - the industry would be forced to
address the quality of sale issue. and thereby reduce the level and costs of
inappropriate sales.'
To this observer, at least, Sir Bryan's analysis is splendid stuff. Given
that he is about to advise the government on the SIB's review of retail
financial regulation, one can feel that the consumer's interest is in safe
hands.
Coincidentally, another Sir Bryan has been battling on the consumer's
behalf. Sir Bryan Hayes, published a consultative document this week on the
formation of a new regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA).
The idea is beguilingly simple. Rather than the current alphabet soup of
regulatory bodies, Lautro, Fimbra and the like, financial companies which
deal with the private investor would be regulated by just one - the PIA.
Consumers would know where to complain and uniform standards could be set
across the industry.
The snag is that the system will remain self-regulatory. No-one will be
compelled to join the new body, they will have to be persuaded to do so.
Since products such as life insurance are increasingly sold through banks
and building societies, it is only logical that they should be regulated by
PIA. But the major banks are reluctant, fearing that they will be swamped by
the life companies and forced to pay, via the investors compensation scheme,
for the mistakes of others.
To calm these fears, the consultative document proposes a 30 strong board,
with a balance of industry representatives and consumers. An elaborate
voting system would require major changes to be approved by 75 per cent
majorities of the industry groups.
Although the PIA is a good idea, the structure seems a recipe for
bureaucratic chaos. And the more you please the industry, the less you are
likely to protect the consumer. A PIA with statutory backing would be a
better solution, especially if Sir Bryan Carsberg were allowed to run it.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Facelift for Henderson trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Henderson has revamped its range of investment trusts Peps. Investors have
the choice of putting all their funds into one of five investment trusts, or
into the Collection Portfolio, which splits the investment equally between
them.
The progressive investment option allows investors to put their money on
deposit at institutional rates, and then drips money into the investment
trusts over three, six or 12 months. This allows investors the advantage of
pound-cost averaging.
However, Henderson has decided not to enter into the competition on prices
currently being waged by other Pep-providers. Initial charge is 3 per cent
(plus VAT), transaction fee is 1.25 per cent, and the annual management fee
is 1.5 per cent (plus VAT).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two new tables of with-profits maturity values were published this week.
According to Money Management, the top five endowment performers over 25
years to August 1, assuming premiums of Pounds 50 per month (not Pounds 30
per month as used to be used), are Commercial Union (Pounds 111,540),
Standard Life (Pounds 111,506), General Accident (Pounds 110,352), Royal
London (Pounds 106,539) and Scottish Life (Pounds 105,925).
Planned Savings' league table, based on annual premiums of Pounds 100 for 25
years, has a similar sound to it. Top performers are: CU (Pounds 18,902),
Standard Life (Pounds 18,431), GA (Pounds 18,367), Tunbridge Wells Equitable
(Pounds 18,252) and Scottish Life (Pounds 17,998). Both magazines assumed
that the policies were started by a 29-year-old man.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Busy week for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilts traders thought Tuesday's one percentage point cut in UK base rates
was very bad news for inflation. This is shown by the behaviour of the
market for index-linked gilts, whose coupon and redemption value are linked
to the retail price index. Traders will pay more for index-linked gilts if
they think inflation is likely to increase. In doing so the price of such
gilts increases and the yield falls. The graphs show the real yields to
maturity (the annual income plus the capital gain to redemption, expressed
as a percentage of the current price), assuming inflation rates of 5 or 10
per cent. The calculations are complicated, but the graph shows how yields
fell as traders rushed to buy the issues.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Back in fashion in the City - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE wet weather was driving women into shops to give a good start to the
autumn season, two of the best known high street names - Next and Laura
Ashley - were warming City hearts with the latest chapters in their recovery
stories.
Both have come through the fire of losses and debt reduction and both boast
that they have returned to their roots in terms of customer appeal.
Next has once again caught the eye of the middle-market British woman (who
no longer goes off fashion in her 30s) and of the trendy young man. It
achieved a 14 per cent sales increase in its high-street shops.
Laura Ashley is reproclaiming its English country heritage in garments and
home furnishing and calling itself a 'lifestyle brand' rather than a
retailer. It also highlighted its international profile - only 40 per cent
of sales lie in the UK.
Next has made far more progress on the road to recovery. It returned to
profit last year, making Pounds 12.3m pre-tax compared with losses of Pounds
40.7m. Its first-half figure bounced back from a mere Pounds 200,000 to
Pounds 8.3m.
Laura Ashley, which lost Pounds 9.1m pre-tax last year, more than trebled
its first-half profit to Pounds 1.68m. However, the bulk of this was
contributed by its associates - bed linen in the US and Laura Ashley Japan.
North America lost money, offsetting a turnround in the UK and a profit
breakthrough on the continent.
Next, on the other hand, has finished its fire fighting (other than final
damping down in the credit operation Club 24) and reported a jump in its
operating margin from Next Retail and Next Directory to nearly 4 per cent,
after a small interim loss last year. A further step up should come in the
seasonally stronger second half.
A stark illustration of where the companies are in terms of restoring their
fortunes is provided by the dividend. Next restored its interim and Lord
Wolfson made encouraging noises about shareholders' prospects of sharing in
future proserity. Laura Ashley omitted the payment again. Jim Maxmin, the
chief executive, said: 'It's too early in the recovery cycle.'
Both companies confirmed the health of their balance sheets after much
restoration work. Next will have cash in hand at the year-end even after an
Pounds 87m repayment of Eurobonds. Laura Ashley continued to reduce its
debt, which is down to Pounds 6.5m.
Against a background of financial comfort in both camps, the questions
revolve around future prospects and the extent to which the prognosis is in
the share price.
Next's fine set of figures sent the share price back above 100p for the
first time since early 1990. It settled at 101 3/4 p last night.
Upgraded pre-tax profit forecasts of Pounds 26m for the full-year put it on
a prospective price-earnings ratio of about 16. Next year's figure could top
Pounds 30m as the full benefits work through of pruning the shop-chain -
from 348 to 316 in the year to July - and re-establishing the brand's
reputation.
Investors who piled in at the low point of 12.5p in January 1991 must be
laughing all the way to the bank. Anyone thinking of buying now has largely
missed the boat.
Laura Ashley presents a more tantalising picture, but must be accompanied by
a health warning because of the North American problem.
The first lure is the fall in its share price from nearly 100p in July to
around 60p for the past month. Even at this level, however, the prospective
p/e is well over 30, assuming more than Pounds 6m profit this year. Some
support is offered by the Japanese Aeon group's 15 per cent interest. (Sir
Bernard Ashley, chairman, has 53 per cent and sold some shares at 82p late
last year).
The second is that there is still a lot to improve. For instance, it fails
to deliver 40 per cent of goods to the right place at the right time.
The third is the recovery potential, including the scope for the group to
push its profit margin before tax and interest well above the 7 to 8 per
cent that a UK high street chain like Next might achieve.
Even the cynics might start to buy if the share price slipped nearer to 50p.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Insurance dividend gone with the wind - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ONE of those curious cases of bad news being good news. On Thursday,
Continental Corporation, which ranks 12th among US property and casualty
insurers, announced that it was slashing its dividend for the first time
since 1853 and taking Dollars 320m of pre-tax charges, mainly because of
catastrophe insurance policy losses.
The culprits were Hurricane Andrew, which tore through Florida and Louisiana
last month leaving some Dollars 20bn of damage, and Hurricane Iniki, which
has just devastated one of the Hawaiian islands.
The company also said it would withdraw from the reinsurance business, and
from its relatively small international operations, to concentrate on its
core business. These actions would account for Dollars 120m of the special
charges.
Continental's stock plunged by nearly 19 per cent on the day. The shock to
the market was particularly severe because Continental's traditionally high
dividend has made it attractive to investors.
Even as Continental was plunging, the rest of the insurance sector began to
rally smartly. The reason: analysts argued that its dividend cut was the
firmest evidence yet that the property / casualty insurance cycle might at
last be changing for the better. High quality reinsurance stocks, such as
General Re, rose particularly strongly.
'I don't think anybody can say until three or four months from now that the
turn occurred on September 24,' said Frederick Sandburg, an analyst at
Kemper Securities, 'but the stocks are trying to tell you this is a
significant event.'
Property / casualty business insurance premiums in the US have fallen by
around 40 per cent over the past five years as companies have engaged in
aggressive rounds of price-cutting. The growing belief is that the weaker
companies, reeling from Andrew and Iniki, will be forced to put up rates to
rebuild depleted capital, and that others will happily follow suit.
There have been plenty of false dawns before. Several US catastrophes, such
as last spring's Los Angeles riots, have been hailed as the turn in the
cycle, but the sheer scale of this year's hurricane losses means that the
time may have finally arrived.
Only the day before Continental's move, the mighty Prudential Insurance
Company of America quadrupled its estimate of losses from Hurricane Andrew
to more than Dollars 1bn, which led Standard &amp; Poor's the rating agency, to
put the group's top-notch triple-A credit rating on review.
Another straw in the wind, suggesting the cycle may have turned, was an
announcement at the start of the week that Primerica, the financial services
group run by Sanford Weill, was to take a 27 per cent stake in Travelers,
one of America's largest life insurers, with a sizeable property / casualty
business as well.
Travelers went on a real estate lending spree in the 1980s that has left it
with one of the worst property portfolios in the industry. It has spend
months looking for an investor who would inject cash into the business and
bolster its credit ratings, which have fallen worrying close to losing
investment grade status.
Enter Weill, regarded as one of the canniest investors on Wall Street. He
spent the 1960s and 1970s putting together a group of small brokerages which
he sold to American Express for over Dollars 900m in 1981, and he has spent
the last few years building the Primerica group into one of America's most
profitable financial services businesses.
He has bought his stake for a good price - less than half stated book value
 -and he will clearly be playing a big role in revitalising the insurance
company: Primerica will get four seats on the 16-person Travelers board and
Weill will chair the company's finance committee. Wall Street liked the deal
and Travelers' stock soared.
But even with his magic touch, Weill faces a long battle to turn Travelers
around. He too is betting that the insurance cycle is on the turn. That is a
powerful endorsement of Wall Street's hunch.
While insurance stocks soared, the week saw the automobile sector move out
of favour as analysts weighed up further signs of a painfully slow US
recovery and a flagging European market.
The equity market as a whole continued to be buffeted and bewildered by the
wild currency gyrations in Europe, mounting fears of disappointing third
quarter earnings, and growing uncertainty over the presidential election,
amid signs that Ross Perot might be about to re-enter the race. Yesterday
morning brought another batch of bearish economic statistics.
But while all these chills winds send the market twirling and dipping, it is
still groping for a clear sense of direction.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Flying not so bravely into a new world - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's short-term economic strategy is now clear: forward on a
wing and a prayer. It became even clearer this week that the wing will not
be made in Britain.
The mauling of the UK's engineering sector overshadowed the stock market's
cautious adjustment to a changed world, with the pound now drifting outside
the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Having seen the FTSE-100 jump 188.7 points in the immediate aftermath of
last week's devaluation, traders started the week in uneasy mood, unsettled
by thought that they had perhaps been overly optimistic in assuming a two
percentage-point cut in base rates was on the cards.
Nerves were steadied by Tuesday's cut of one percentage point, and the
immediate promise of lower mortgages, and the market advanced further on
Thursday when the prime minister made it clear that there would be no early
return to the disciplines of the ERM.
Yet relief about having escaped from the Bundesbank's straitjacket of high
interest rates was also mixed with concern about the outlook for inflation
and Britain's balance of trade. Last month's deficit on visible goods was
revealed to have been Pounds 1.7bn, worse than expected and the highest
level for two years.
Such concerns found a poignant focus in the plight of British Aerospace, one
of Britain's biggest manufacturing groups, which encompasses commercial amd
military aircraft, weapons, Rover cars and property.
BAe's shares plunged by 86p to 113p after the group announced the loss of
3,000 jobs, the closure of its historic aircraft plant at Hatfield,
Hertfordshire, and a proposed joint venture with Taiwan to manufacture
regional jets. At that level the whole group had a market value of Pounds
426m - less than the Pounds 432m it raised in last year's rights issue.
BAe said it had lost Pounds 129m in the first half and would write off
Pounds 750m on its regional jet operations in the second half. The group
lost Pounds 278m in its commercial aircraft operations in the first half and
Pounds 31m at Rover, wiping out the Pounds 296m it made from defence.
The rescue plan presented by Mr John Cahill, who became BAe's chairman four
months ago, failed to impress the City and revived speculation that the
group could could be bid for by GEC, the defence and electronics group.
Gloom about the state of British engineering increased when Vickers
announced that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, its loss-making luxury car
subsidiary, would cut 950 jobs, or nearly a third of the workforce, from its
plant at Crewe in Chesire. On the same day Ford, the leading UK car maker,
said to would cut 1,487 jobs at its British plants.
Vickers slashed its interim dividend to preserve cash for the other,
profitable parts of the group - defence, aerospace, marine engineering and
medical equipment. Despite an initial 39p fall, Vickers shares closed 5p
higher at 84p on the day after analysts were assured that the job cuts were
designed to achieve breakeven at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars by the year-end.
Of course, both BAe and Vickers were reporting their performance in an
economic climate which has changed markedly since last's week's devaluation
of sterling turmoil.
Institutional investors continued to show they were happy to get into
equities, given the prospect of lower interest rates and possibly higher
inflation. Yet the tentative nature of this advance is demonstrated by the
way the market rose only on Tuesday and Thursday.
A sector that might be thought as poised to benefit from a drop in lower
interest rates and higher inflation is housing, but even here the signals
were mixed. Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said it had to cut the
number of homes it plans to build by up to a fifth after one of the worst
trading periods in its history.
Sir Lawrie Barratt, who became the man most identified with wider home
ownership in the eighties, revealed that he had managed to turn a Pounds
105.9m loss by Barratt Developments into a an Pounds 11.3m pre-tax profit, a
result which boosted the share price by 67p to 57p.
However, Sir Lawrie, who came out of retirement to achieve this turnaround,
still felt it necessary to write to the the prime minister, urging him to
boost the housing market by cutting base rates to 6 per cent, ending stamp
duty and raising the ceiling for mortgage tax relief.
It was a bad week for another symbol of the eighties' property boom, the
Canary Wharf development in east London. Chemical Bank of the US joined
American Express in refusing to move its European headquarters to the
Docklands. Bankers also refused plans to take over the troubled development
which were tabled by a group of US investors formed by Mr Paul Reichmann,
founder of Canary Wharf.
The market closed the week as it had started - in an uneasy mood. Germany
and France seem to have succeeded in fending off a devaluation of the franc,
raising the uncomfortable prospect that they might be prepared to proceed to
a 'fast-track' Europe which excluded the UK. It is one thing to have escaped
the surly bonds of high German interest rates: quite another to be
permanently excluded from a strong D-Mark zone.
One can scarcely criticise the City and industrialists for being uncertain
about the economic outlook, when the government clearly has still to
establish its new economic policy.
So far, the equity market has responded to devaluation by racing ahead in
traditional fashion. However, further advances will depend on further
interest rate reductions, which could be upset by continuing turbulence on
the currency markets.
The pound yesterday touched a new low of DM2.509 before recovering slightly.
If this is a bull market, it is a very timorous beastie.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: A wine bluffer's guide to the Midi - A
primer on Languedoc-Rousillon and some of the world's best value bottles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ALL know that the Languedoc-Roussillon, France's biggest wine region, can
offer some of the world's best value bottles but few of us, even wine
merchants, know our way round it yet.
Britain's biggest off-licence chain thinks Sete is 'on the edge of Cotes de
Rousillon (sic)', most of its rivals still lump both Languedoc and
Roussillon in with minor obscurities under the belittling title 'French
Country Wines', and many wonder where Oc is. Here is the briefest of
bluffers' guides to bottles that can offer real diversity and character in
the Pounds 3 to Pounds 5 bracket:
Midi is a general but delightfully evocative name for the south of France.
In terms of time rather than place, midi is noon, a time of firmly closed
shutters when you may as well have your feet under a table here as everyone
else will be busy lunching or snoozing.
Languedoc, the land where 'oc' meant yes and white wine is still pronounced
'venga blenga', is a vast sweep of vine monoculture around the Mediterranean
coast. Generalisations about the wines produced are now, happily,
impossible. The plains which once spewed forth vapid vin ordinaire for
thirsty workers in northern France now boast pockets of
quality-consciousness where prices are still ludicrously low (which means
most cellars are still frugally equipped).
Roussillon should not be a Languedoc suffix at all but is the quite
distinct, Pyreneen, semi-Spanish region that is French Catalonia. Here are
exotic soft, full, dry whites; some uniquely complex dessert wines labelled
Banyuls, Maury and Rivesaltes; and reds that are cheap but only occasionally
excite. The Rivesaltes co-operative and the larger houses Cazes and
Sarda-Malet do a good job but all producers struggle to fit the wines they
want to make into the straitjacket of appellation controlee rules.
Corbieres. The Languedoc's most interesting appellation, spread over 11
newly-defined but almost equally rugged terroirs of arid, generally hilly
vineyards. Although generic blends of Corbieres are as dull as any, many
individual domaines are busting a gut to win medals and competitions with
wines as well-made as France's finest. A typical good Corbieres is deep red,
slightly wild and intensely savoury. Fine dry whites are also increasingly
easy to find, if not invariably thanks to fashions for oak-ageing and grape
varieties as exotic as Roussanne, Marsanne, Vermentino and even Viognier.
Over-achievers: Lastours, Voulte-Gasparets (Cuvee Romain Pauc)
Roque-Sestiere (white), St Auriol, La Baronne, Villemajou, Fontsainte,
Ollieux, St Louis.
Minervois is the queen if Corbieres is king, its wines lacking some of the
punch perhaps, but making up for it with their suavity. As in Corbieres, the
best reds are made of Syrah, Grenache, Cinsault, Mourvedre and as little
Carignan as possible. There are dozens of dedicated domaines, but also some
fine co-operatives which are investing in luxuries such as de-stalking
machines and new oak casks. Over-achievers: Fabas, Laville-Bertrou,
Fontbertiere, La Combe Blanche, Violet, Gourgazaud, Centeilles, La Grave,
Tour St Martin, Jean d'Alibert.
Fitou commands a mysterious price premium over the two appellations which
lie to its immediate north, but has recently been coasting on a reputation
cleverly built upon the wholesome-sounding but effectively fictitious Madame
Parmentier's label. At best a mature Fitou can be a rewarding, full-blown
experience but too high a proportion of production is undistinguished,
fairly tough, high-volume stuff. Notable exception: Ch de Nouvelles.
St Chinian, the appellation to the immediate east of Minervois, is already
slightly more Rhone-like, producing rounder red, and occasionally pink,
wines with more obvious Cinsaut/Grenache sweetness, which can make them
slightly less distinctive to palates brought up on Cotes-du-Rhone.
Over-achievers: Coujan, Jougla, Berloup (top cuvees)
Faugeres The best are silkier than St Chinian next door and manage to slip
the juiciness of the local grape varieties into a bordeaux-like structure.
Over-achievers: Estanilles, Laurens, Grezan.
Coteaux du Languedoc is the catch-all appellation for wines made east of
Minervois and west of the Gard of which the authorities approve (ie are not
named after grape varieties) So far sub-regions St Chinian and Faugeres have
managed to float above the surface to establish their own identity. Others
bubbling up include La Clape - its Bourboulenc whites can beguile - another
oddity, Picpoul de Pinet, and Pic St Loup. Over-achievers:
Rouquette-sur-Mer, Mas Jullien, Prieure de St Jean de Bebian, Hortus.
Vin de pays. Most of France's 'country wines' come from either the Languedoc
or Roussillon, and many of the Languedoc-Roussillon's most interesting wines
qualify only as Vin de Pays rather than one of the appellations above.
They often carry obscure geographical names, but can offer superb value. The
most common is the catch-all Languedoc category, Vin de Pays d'Oc, which may
also be labelled with the name of a grape variety. Syrah and Merlot have
been particularly successful reds, while whites stray boldly outside
Chardonnay and Sauvignon territory.
Although Chardonnay is being planted fast and furiously, until recently the
lion's share of Languedoc Chardonnay was planted around Limoux, famous for
its sparkling Blanquette.
After Mas de Daumas Gassac, the Vin de Pays de l'Herault with the
classed-growth prices, the most successful PR coup has been Limoux co-op's
Toques et Clochers annual auction of oak-aged Chardonnays, now available
from Britain's Majestic chain for around Pounds 7.50.
Some of Roussillon's finest wines qualify only as Vin de Pays (and Fernand
Vaquer's only as Vin de Table) because of grape varieties or alcohol levels.
Languedoc: Condamine l'Eveque, Limbardie, Arjolle, St Martin de la Garrigue,
Aupilhac, Bosc, Cante Cigale, Valmagne, Raissac, Peyrat, Montmarin,
Coussergues. Roussillon: Mas Chichet, Gauby, Cazenove.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: How to be a Schickimicki - Giles MacDonogh
eats out in Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 17 years a city can change a good deal. This has certainly been the case
in Munich.
When I first visited the Bavarian capital as a student in the mid-1970s, the
scars inflicted by the massive Allied bombardment were still visible and the
huge Wittelsbach Residenz was partly ruinous and roofless.
The restoration of the city's exterior image is now complete and Munich has
reverted to type: fiercely independent of the rest of Germany; Roman
Catholic, chic and snobbish.
I arrived from Baden where my hosts had warned me to be on the look out for
some of the more glaring elements of modern Munich society: the so-called
Schickimickis or Bussi-Bussi Gesellschaft.
A Schickimicki they defined as a young man or woman squandering his or her
parents money in a succession of fashionable bars and restaurants.
'Bussi Bussi is the noise a Schickimicki makes when greeting another member
of the species: a call for a peck on both cheeks; a gesture common enough in
Saint Germain des Pres but distinctly foreign to Germany.
With only two nights at my disposal tracking down a clutch of Schickimickis
proved an uphill struggle. There were none in my first port of call
Schumann's Bar in the Maximilian-Strasse: this was a serious drinkers' bar
much frequented by journalists who prefer a Scotch on the rocks to the
Schickimicki standbys of Prosecco or champagne. Nor has any crept into
Harry's Bar in the Falkenturmstrasse, where the clientele was largely made
up of Americans.
If any city made a claim to being the gastronomic capital of Germany it
would have to be Munich. There are only three Michelin three-star
restaurants in Germany and two of them are here: Heinz Winkler's Tantris and
Eckart Witzigmann's Aubergine. In Germany Witzigmann enjoys a reputation
similar to those of Paul Bocuse or Joel Robuchon in France.
Munich's chic tends to shun the more overtly Germanic. Shops such as
Dallmayr in the Dienerstrasse by the Rathaus are brimming with imported
Italian and French food and wine. All the top restaurants work in an adapted
French idiom. Italian restaurants are the most popular with the
Schickimickis.
Personally, I was looking for something more typically munichois After
taking advice from friends I ended up at the Halali a restaurant in an old
house in a quiet street not far from the Residenz. Halali is a German
hunting cry, and in season game is the speciality.
Not surprising then, that the walls should be covered in hunting trophies
with stuffed pheasants and owls peering at you from every corner. It would
be a mistake, however, to see Halali as the sort of taxidermist's wet dream
found elsewhere in Germany or Austria (one has only to think of the Weisser
Rauchfangkehrer in Vienna with its moth-eaten stuffed bears), the hunting
theme is not overstated.
My meal started with a little carpaccio of tuna as an amuse gueule while I
studied the menu. I chose a salad of venison and some baby calf kidneys and
sweetbreads to follow. The salad was made up of endive, lamb's lettuce and
mesclun with shitake and oyster mushrooms, pink peppercorns, roast rosemary
sprigs and very tender venison fillet with its juices. It was a nicely
balanced dish.
The sweetbreads and kidneys on the other hand, I felt had been rather too
heavily flavoured with marjoram, a seasoning which seems to achieve a
greater importance the further east you travel from the Rhine. This course
was served with some fine sweetcorn drop cakes.
The service was discreet. Being alone I was trying unobtrusively to read a
novel on my lap. The waitress pretended not to notice. There was piped music
of the classical sort but turned down fairly low. Classical music should
come as no surprise in a city where two out of three taxis I took were tuned
into the classical radio station. Viennese drivers please copy.
I finished my meal with some rote Grutze with a dollop of walnut ice. Rote
Grutze are sometimes billed as the German version of an English summer
pudding, although the German dish blends its raspberry, red and blackcurrant
mixture with semolina rather than bread, mixing the elements together to
make a kind of deep red pond. There is nothing particularly munichois about
it; in Mecklenburg there is even a dialect song about rote Grutze.
Up to this point I had been quite happy with the extensive wine list which
was more than equitably priced. Sadly, however, in a country so famed for
its pudding wines, Halali had none by the glass. I asked myself what a
Schickimicki would do in the circumstances, and ordered a glass of
champagne.
Information: Halali Schonfeldstrasse 22, 8000 Munich 2. Tel (89) 28 59 09.
Open Mon to Fri 12 - 3pm and 6pm - midnight. Saturday 6pm - midnight. Closed
Sunday. Menu at DM85. A la carte DM110.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: Taste of Russian riches - Grand hotels . . .
but only if you are a foreigner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK CHISHOLM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPEN ANOTHER luxury hotel in London and no one notices. Do it in an
impoverished, developing country, trying to recover from 70 years of
communism, and you experience contrasts otherwise restricted to avant-garde
films.
Since the Grand Hotel Europe reopened last Christmas, St Petersburg has
provided the only true five-star hotel in Russia amid contrasts obvious even
to the short-sighted.
'Dom Perignon?' 'Of course, Madame.' 'Claret?' 'Yes, sir. Might I recommend
the Haut Brion '79?'. The price, Dollars 179, (Pounds 101.10) a mere four
years' salary for an average Leningrader.
Beggars, including children, stand or sit in the snow outside. A cheeky boy
hops round on his one leg. Does he really need the money, I ask the
top-hatted doorman? He begins a prepared speech about the 'inadequacies of
our former social system,' thinks better of it, and replies simply 'yes'.
Perhaps the same contrasts were evident in 1824 when the hotel first opened
and Russia already had an emerging middle class, although an absolute gulf
separated serfs from aristocracy. Then, as now, it was the place to stay
with regular visitors including Maxim Gorki, Nikolai Gogol and Anna Pavlova.
And it was never cheap.
By the 1980s the hotel - renamed the Evropeiskaya - was completely run down,
operating on service-with-a-snarl lines. I lived there for several weeks,
enjoying the central location just off Nevski Prospect, the architectural
gems, especially the extraordinary brass and marble, art nouveau lavatories
(now sadly gone) and enduring the food in silence. It closed in 1989 with
reconstruction entrusted to Swedish companies SIAB and hotel group Reso AB,
the current operator, which own 30.5 per cent. Intourist's majority share
has now passed to the city.
I may not be the best person to write about large hotels as I wilt under
their impersonality. The Europe is truly different. Internally, at least,
many rooms and guest suites go beyond good taste in achieving a harmony
approaching artistic beauty.
Many old features have been retained, including the wonderful, galleried
dining room and the first floor salon, though the grand piano has gone. Sven
Vermelin, the urbane hotel manager, says: 'We are trying to get it back but
we are competing with a museum.'
Modern features include a wonderfully spacious 'open-air' cafe/business
centre (there is a distant, glass roof) where the jangled nerves of
afternoon guests are soothed by a superb harpist from the nearby
conservatoire.
Capitalist brooms doubtless anticipated problems in sweeping out socialist
stables, but the transition has been remarkably smooth.
Vermelin says: 'We made a profit from day one. Ninety per cent of our guests
are business people, mainly from France, Germany and the US. Food? We have a
container from Sweden every week and higher returns than expected on food
and beverage operations. Room rates start at Dollars 110 and go up to
Dollars 500 for suites'. And, although he was too polite to say so, those
suites are really something.
Western businesses wanting to operate in St Petersburg have experienced
major differences in finding office space. The Swedish consul Dag Ellander
says: 'First there are legal uncertainties over owning property. And
secondly people here do not understand market realities. St Petersburg is
not Tokyo or downtown New York.'
So, many western organisations set up house in the Grand Hotel Europe, where
attractions include reliable international communications facilities. They
include Proctor and Gamble, the Danish Consulate and Dresdener Bank.
One of my favourite places is the Brasserie. Where else outside a university
can you eat with so many graduates (all the waitresses?) such as the
beautiful Maria, who has fluent Italian, good English (yes, I know, I am
smitten) and a degree in film making, or economist Alesa: 'It must sound
funny. I graduated in economics from St Petersburg University and now I am
learning to be a waitress in a capitalist production . . . Though I enjoy
the work. Really] It is totally new for me.'
Food is good, too, although with a Swedish bias. Breast of chicken in pepper
sauce, should be fiery, not served, Swedish-style in up-market ketchup. And
if you can find any Russian currency, the place to meet locals - especially
neighbourhood mafia yuppies - is the Sadko rouble bar, where there is a
simple, appetising menu and a glass of Swedish beer or a bottle of Russian
sparkling wine cost the same, R200 (Pounds 1.12).
Nothing beats seeing how your food is prepared so I wandered into the
gleaming, stainless steel kitchens to chat with Welshman John Evans, chief
pastry cook and former sous-chef at London's Connaught.
Hard at work on gateaux opera and raspberry royales, Evans told me the hotel
was just like home for quality, with only staff training carried out at a
noticeably inferior level. But he admitted to other problems: 'Like people
nicking all my cooking chocolate.'
For a final verdict, I turned to American Lynnley Browning, who works in the
Europe for a resident US company. She told me: 'This hotel is not only first
rate by Russian standards, it is first rate by world standards. There is
nowhere else like it in St Petersburg.'
Meanwhile, flushed with success, Reso is setting its sights on the capital.
Watch out Moscow, real food could ruin your tastebuds for ever.
I marched into the street and the grim reality of contemporary St
Petersburg. Only a fraction of a per cent of the city's inhabitants have
ever been inside the Europe. The Dollars 64,000 economic question is: how
many of them ever will?

FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: High cheese - Country Fare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS YOU climb Puy Mary in the Cantal mountains of central France the air
becomes clearer and the tinkle of cowbells in the distance sharper; finally,
you reach the summit.
Nearly 1,800 metres (6,000 ft) up, on the top of this extinct volcano is a
view of awe-inspiring beauty. Nearby is Salers, one of the most picturesque
towns in the area.
My reason for wanting to visit this medieval relic was not the church or the
15th century lava houses. I was there for the cheese and biscuits. A very
special cheese, it has to be said, that carries the appellation Salers Haute
Montagne.
Salers is made only in that particular area of the Auvergne from the milk of
cows grazing at an altitude of 2,300 to 3,300 feet. It is to cheese what a
premier cru claret is to wine. Aficionados reckon it tastes of mountain
flowers - and they are right. But it is a complex flavour, tasting of milk
and fruit, too. Made by hand in burons, shepherds' huts, the cheese takes
months to reach its crusted best.
If you contact the local tourist office in Salers they will be able to
arrange visits to the burons - the Salers cheesemaking season is from May 1
to October 31. If you do not feel like motoring up the mountain - or worse,
backpacking or cycling - you can visit the Marche aux Fromages in the rue du
Buis in Aurillac. There you can learn the secrets of Cantal cheese
production by looking at a reconstruction of a shepherd's hut and the
traditional tools used to produce a real mountain cheese.
More important, just about every Auvergne cheese you can think of is on sale
in the marche. If you want Cantal, Saint-Nectaire, Fourme d'Ambert or Bleu
d'Auvergne in perfect condition this is the place to go. They also ship
cheeses.
Oh - I nearly forgot the biscuits. Do not miss out on a packet - they are
called Salers. Eaten straight from the oven these sweet rectangular wafers
crumble delightfully in the mouth. Do not, as I did, keep them in a paper
bag overnight, or they will taste like a soggy Weekend FT.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Computers that can do it by the book: Electronic wizardry is
helping literary research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing as a code-breaker is one
of the legends of the second world war. Around 1944, when the German naval
codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher
school at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, Turing had (in the words of his
biographer, Andrew Hodges) 'learned how to build a brain - not an electric
brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic
brain.'
If Turing were alive today - the harsh English law against homosexual men
led to his untimely death in 1954 - he would surely take a well-deserved
pride in the universal labour-saving which the electronic brain he and other
pioneers conceived plays in all our lives. He might have foreseen that it
would revolutionise business and industrial practices, and that it would
take over much of the ground-work in applied mathematics, the engineering
sciences, physics and astronomy; but could he have imagined the inroads it
has now begun to make into the area known traditionally as the humanities?
Some of the most hitherto insoluble problems of authorship have begun to
yield to scrutiny by Turing's electronic brain. The identity of the
acidulous Whig activist who contributed letters to the public prints,
attacking George III and other 18th century worthies under the pseudonym
'Junius,' was one of the earliest pieces of successful, computer-based
research analysing an author's style. Swedish scholar Alvar Ellgard
published his conclusions in A Statistical Method for Determining Authorship
(1962), where he established the overwhelming probability that the
scurrilous letters were written by Sir Philip Francis, Gibbon's schoolmaster
and later a civil servant.
Work of this kind where each word and punctuation mark in a text is computed
into lists, charts and graphs designed to show the number of times it is
used in a given type of sentence-formation - plotted against a putative norm
 -once required the resource of a mainframe computer, the kind of machine
available only to a scholar working in some handsomely endowed university
research centre. Now, though, the equipment to undertake such a project is
coming within the reach of anyone with a reasonably efficient modern home
computer.
Many of the Oxford dictionaries are now on computer disc and available
commercially to the ordinary 'user'; so are several of the standard texts of
the Oxford English School. The Oxford University Press has in train an
extensive programme of electronic publishing, as I discovered on a visit to
its headquarters at Walton Street, Oxford.
'Look here upon this picture, and on this . . .' as Hamlet says. In this
instance, Picture One depicts 20 heavy, large, dark-blue volumes occupying
4.5 ft of shelf space and costing around Pounds 1,500 for the set (according
to the bargain you strike with your supplier). Picture Two shows what author
Anthony Burgess calls a 'silver beer mat'; in other words, a compact disc.
This particular one costs Pounds 495.00. Both accommodate exactly the same
amount of information - the entire contents of the Oxford English Dictionary
2nd edition (1989). In the first instance, all you need is a strong pair of
arms and reasonably good eyesight;. in the second, a personal computer (PC)
fitted with a CD-ROM drive.
This is a gadget that extends a computer's memory vastly, necessary when the
machine has to take on board the OED's 500,000 head words, their
definitions, pronunciation, etymology, and the 24m quotations that
illustrate their use in texts since the beginning of English. Many libraries
and institutions have such a drive but most private PC owners do not
(although it is becoming less expensive and is likely to become a standard
option for them fairly soon). To run the OED electronically, you also need
to have the Microsoft system known as Windows (version 3 or above); a
Macintosh version of the OED 2nd edition will be available next spring.
In this form, the OED has become a lexical database. Its users are able to
look up English words in a variety of different ways, not just
alphabetically as before. The entire dictionary may be scanned in less than
a minute to give the answer to abstruse searches. Colonel Pickering in
Pygmalion was an authority on spoken Sanskrit and was working with Professor
Higgins on Indian dialect words in English. He would have been overjoyed at
being able to 'wild card' - that is, put an asterisk against typical
end-formations in English of the kind of words in which he was interested
and, within 40 seconds, to have on screen a complete list of all such words
in the dictionary. At a more frivolous level, crossword addicts may use the
wild card command to find words of which they know only certain letters.
There is an obvious benefit in having the OED available in this electronic
form for its editors and compilers; it releases them from an incalculable
amount of donkey work. Looking to the future, the editors now have the task
of preparing the 3rd edition of the OED, scheduled for publication in 2005.
Will there need to be a printed version of the 3rd edition at all or will by
then everyone be using it electronically?
That is a question to which the OUP does not yet know the answer. What is
becoming clear is that the old system of issuing supplements between
editions in order to keep up to date with new words and fresh shades of
meaning can now be abandoned because these neologisms can, as soon as they
are identified, be added to the database.
It is not only lexicography that it is being given a new lease of life by
the computer but classical and literary scholarship as well. Computers have
been aiding scholars in deciphering early languages like Ancient Egyptian
for many years, but now they are moving in force into the study of
literature.
The Americans have a project to put the whole of English poetry, from
Langland to Larkin, on to computer disc, and some classical texts studied in
the Oxford Greats School are available as software. The Bodleian Library in
Oxford has a terminal in the reading room and classics dons at work on
Virgil or Horace can be seen operating it.
The OUP has just launched its Oxford Electronic Texts Library for English
literature. This consists of The Complete Works of Jane Austen (Pounds 60),
The Riverside Chaucer (Pounds 75), The Poetical Works of Samuel Coleridge
(Pounds 60), and The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth (Pounds 60). These
are all out now, and coming next Spring will be electronic versions of
Hardy, Milton, Mary Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft.
The controversial modern spelling edition of William Shakespeare: The
Complete Works, edited by Wells and Taylor and published in 1986, is now
available to PC users at Pounds 95.
None of these electronic texts has the search functions that are built into
the electronic OED. They offer the standard Oxford texts on diskettes of
regular size in which each line, as well as each page of the text, is
enumerated. Used in combination with a text-analysis software package such
as Micro-OCP (Oxford Pounds 175.00), however, you can very easily get your
computer to make searches, word lists, concordances and indexes from them.
What use, though, is it for the person who does not happen to be studying
for a BA in English or a B Litt to have such a resource? Clearly, no use at
all. If you just want to sit by the swimming pool and read Northanger Abbey
for fun, you would be much better off with the Worlds Classics paperback.
But it is important, even to such a reader, to have a text as close as
possible to the one approved by the author. Computers can play an important
role in establishing an authentic text and, in some cases, establishing
authorship as well.
A new computer-based literary discipline called Stylology has begun to
emerge in which texts are submitted to computational tests not merely as
part of textual scholarship but also in the hope of arriving at new critical
insights. An outstanding example of this is the book Computation into
Criticsm: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels and An Experiment in Method by JF
Burrows (Oxford, Pounds 25.00). The author, an Australian professor of
English, checked the speech habits of all the main characters in Jane Austen
through an extended series of computer tests and collated them, using
methods borrowed from statistics, to determine variations from normal or
average usage.
Burrows' findings inevitably are the source of much debate in English
faculties. They have been welcomed warmly in an appreciative review by at
least one prominent member of the Oxbridge establishment: Marilyn Butler,
the Cambridge professor of English Literature. His charts and graphs of
pronoun usage by Elizabeth Bennett, Mr D'Arcy and the rest prove beyond any
doubt (if they prove nothing else) that, in a novel, the distinction made up
to now between the 'grammatical' words said to be inert, and the 'lexical'
words said to be the source of energy, no longer holds. Burrows shows in
innumerable ways how grammatical words are as great a source of fictional
energy as the lexical ones in character building, narrative development etc.
Move over, Dr Leavis, you have had your byte at the cherry. Now let the
computer have its turn.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Gardening: More bark, same bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST development in the seed and potting compost controversy is that
Fisons, connected closely with the development of peat composts for 25
years, is about to market a non-peat product in direct competition with its
own well-known Levington Multipurpose.
Some months ago, Fisons gave virtually all its peat bogs to English Nature,
a government-sponsored conservation agency. It now decides which bogs should
remain undisturbed to preserve the natural flora and fauna, and which can
continue to be used for peat extraction.
Putting these events together, you might suppose Fisons was pulling out of
the peat industry altogether, but this would be wrong. The company's faith
in peat as an ideal compost material is as strong as ever.
But it recognises that the kind of peat required for top-grade plant
composts is becoming fairly scarce in the British Isles and needs to be
conserved, although there is plenty of it in other parts of the world.
Fisons started seed and potting compost research in 1956 when it moved to
Levington, near Ipswich, Suffolk, but the research was aimed at finding a
substitute for soil-based composts (such as the John Innes' mixes, which
were running into difficulties even then because of the shortage of loam of
the required type and quality).
The company investigated many materials before settling on sphagnum peat,
but it was not until 1966 that the peat-based Levington range was marketed.
Testing and further research continued and, in 1976, a wetting agent was
added; this made it easy to moisten the composts even after they had become
very dry.
At first, there were several composts (differing mainly in their chemical
content): one for potting, one for seed germination and the cultivation of
small seedlings, and a third for growing-on mature plants. Eventually, a
single mixture known as Multipurpose was deemed satisfactory for all these
purposes in the home garden, and also for rooting cuttings. It has remained
so.
While there seems little evidence that gardeners are moving away from peat
composts on any scale, some obviously are uneasy about their ecological
effects. So, Fisons has chosen softwood bark as the best alternative and has
based its new peat-free compost on this.
Softwood bark is available freely as a waste product from the timber
industry. It has no toxic elements or anything else that might prove harmful
in the garden, and the new compost is intended to be just as effective as
its peat-based predecessor for seed germination, seedlings, growing and
full-grown plants, and cuttings.
The peat-free product is pleasant to handle, moist and crumbly, and easy to
fill into pots or use for picking out seedlings or inserting cuttings. It
seems in every way a useful addition to garden composts.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Gardening: Artful additions to autumn - How to prolong the
life of a fading season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTUMN began officially this week although that will not surprise gardeners
who have been living with it for almost a month. Asters have opened early;
at least one day in each weekend has given a fine imitation of mid-November;
and, everywhere, there are trees with berries or bunches of over-ripe fruit.
Blackberries have peaked already in the hedgerows: gardeners are left with
postscripts which are only as good as they have planned to make them.
Years ago, I took a decision to be artful in autumn. Sooner or later, the
weather clears. Days are perfect, and I certainly do not wish to spend them
among a sweep of dead flowers, pussy-cat colouring and the first signs of
yellow on ageing leaves. Instead, I want new life, colours which are not
rusty, not too many chrysanthemums, and a rest from orange daisies.
Gardeners tend to give up. We all enthuse about early flowers, plant winter
gardens and romanticise Lenten roses - but nobody plants beds for October or
thinks about schemes for the season's last six weeks. This year, I have had
some sudden successes which have turned received wisdom upside down although
their spelling is awkward and they belong at the end of alphabetical
catalogues.
Down in the Z section, I remember an early flop which involved zephyranthes.
This late-flowering beauty is known as the West Wind flower but it went west
from my keeping after only one season. Ever since, I have avoided late
plants too late in the list, assuming that they are tiresome. In fact, some
of them are much easier than people admit.
Most catalogues still list a bright red flowering carpet of a plant as
zauschneria, although botanists have re-named it. Its popular name is
supposed to be Californian Bonfire, but nobody uses it and not many people
grow it. It is supposed to flower only in hot summers, late in the season.
but this belief is quite untrue: my plants have been magnificent since
August and nobody could call 1992 a bonfire of a season.
Zauschnerias make low carpets of green leaves which are covered with tubular
flowers in a brilliant shade of scarlet which clashes with almost nothing.
They certainly prefer a dry, limey soil, the sort of garden which is better
at growing pinks than hostas. They are slug-proof, an important virtue in a
late-flowering plant, and remain fresh and clean in any sunny position,
however small the garden.
The names are still chaotic, but the best variety for gardeners was
discovered in Ireland - hardly the hottest of climates. Nurserymen tend to
call it Glasnevin after the great botanic garden, although botanists have
now named the entire plant epilobium Dublin. So far as I can establish,
these plants are easy, hardy, and excellent value on well-drained soil. But
watch out for a grey-leaved form which seems to flower less freely than the
conventional green, which is now the main form in the trade.
Whereas the Bonfire is supposed to like drought and a hot summer, Kafir
lilies are supposed to prefer an impossible combination: damp soil and a
sunny aspect. As a result, I have been very wary of them, but this year is
showing up the approved wisdom. Once again, their name - schizostylis - is
not to be dropped lightly but the plants are far prettier than their
photographs in dictionaries suggest and they are one of my small triumphs in
this obliging season.
The best Kafir lilies tend to turn up in the West Country, growing under
houses in areas of lush green grass and high rainfall. Not for me, I decided
years ago (like Cornwall, which is out of reach of intellectual libraries).
As usual, the publication of The Plant Finder changed everything. On late
summer evenings, the entries can be ransacked and whole families identified.
Sixteen types of schizostylis are on sale in Britain, from whites through
pinks to one named after a professor. Why not grow the lot?
You cannot, the experts tell us, if you live in a dry, sunny garden. One
kind nurseryman offered to prove the point by sending me a selection of
potential victims, fit only for wet conditions. So far, I have proved him
wrong.
What a schizostylis likes is enough water in spring and enough water again
in the weeks when it sets its buds. In between, the weather can be as hot as
it wants: this year, my new plants are flowering wildly with no more
attention than two watering cans and a wet April. If this performance is
typical, they are the postscript we all need.
The green leaves are like rushes and send up stems about 2 ft high, set with
clear, open flowers of pink, white or scarlet rounded at the edges. My
plants are set near paving stones where the ground is always rather more
cool. The flowers have high quality in colours which do not clash and which
raise the tone in autumn among clear blues and white autumn crocus.
As for the varieties, the main distinction seems to lie in their season:
November Cheer is late, whereas several of the paler pinks are early. One of
the best collections is kept by Rowden Nurseries at Brentor near Tavistock,
Devon, which will supply by post (I agree with the owner that each variety
is as good as the other, although the whites are perhaps less interesting).
From September onwards, this South African flower is something to anticipate
and to try in a mood of hopeful experiment. There is no need to worry about
long-term damage from frost and, as for the need for constant moisture, the
experts seem to be slightly wrong. Half the fun of received wisdom is that
it does not always need to be received - and that adventure can turn it
upside down.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Two well-timed cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO companies, Abtrust and Guinness Flight, this week made well-timed moves
to cut charges on their bond unit trusts. Both were planned in advance, but
should profit from the interest in bonds and gilts.
Abtrust is launching two new funds, Aberdeen Gilt Growth and Aberdeen Gilt
Income, neither of which has any front-end charge at all. This makes 'bed
and breakfasting' - selling units and re-buying them the following day to
establish a fixed gain or loss for capital gains tax purposes - very
cost-effective.
This facility allows investors to reduce the biggest problem of holding
gilts via a unit trust - that CGT is payable on any gain in the unitholding.
The tax is not payable when gilts are held directly.
However, both funds have annual management charges of 1 per cent, which are
slightly above average for this sector. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
Guinness Flight has altered the charges on the existing three bond funds -
which make up its monthly income plan - Premium Fixed Interest, EMU and
Global High Income. Annual management charges will be 0.5 per cent for
Premium Fixed Interest, and 0.75 per cent for the other two.
Initial charges will also be reduced for large investments, as follows: sums
between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 9,999 pay 3.5 per cent, with charges of 2.5
per cent from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 24,999, 1.5 per cent from Pounds
25,000 to Pounds 49,999, and 1.0 per cent for investments greater than this.
Guinness Flight's funds all include a mixture of gilts and European bonds.
The company is very bullish about the prospects for bonds, saying that the
current high rates of interest in force across Europe are likely to come
down next year.
Arguments about the outlook for inflation and the gilts market will
continue, but at least fund managers have taken substantial action to make
the products more attractive than before.

COMPETITION is a marvellous thing. Following Fidelity's relaunch of its
stockbroking service two weeks ago, Sharelink has moved in to undercut
Fidelity's commission rates.
On deals worth over Pounds 8,000, Sharelink will now charge a commission of
just Pounds 50. This compares with the Pounds 65 charged by Fidelity on
deals worth Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 10,000, rising to a maximum of Pounds 250
on deals worth Pounds 100,000 plus. Sharelink says its rates are lower than
Fidelity's for all deals over Pounds 5,500.
Fidelity responded by pointing to its frequent dealing discount of 10 per
cent, for those who pay more than Pounds 250 in commission in a calendar
month.
The US group also claimed that its trading muscle would save investors money
through its ability to get keener prices from market-makers.
Meanwhile, a Manchester-based stockbroker called Gall and Eke has set up an
telephone-based execution-only dealing service called Sharemarket.
The commission rate on deals of up to Pounds 1,000 is Pounds 10, on deals of
Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,667 is Pounds 15, and on deals of Pounds 1,668 to
Pounds 45,000 is 0.9 per cent, with a maximum of Pounds 45. Deals worth over
Pounds 45,000 will be charged at a rate of Pounds 22.50 plus 0.05 per cent,
so a Pounds 100,000 deal would cost Pounds 72.50.
Investors may find that they can match or beat these rates if they go
elsewhere. Some building societies offer cut price dealing services to their
depositors who wish to sell small holdings in privatisation issues.
Of course price is not the only way in which these services can compete.
Fidelity's service requires shares to be held in a designated nominee
account whereas Sharelink allows investors to hold shares directly.
Sharelink is offering vouchers to Fidelity customers to meet the cost of
transferring out of the nominee system. But Mark Collier of Fidelity says it
will not charge its customers if they want to sell their shares to take
advantage of the Sharelink offer. 'I am convinced we will not see a single
trade as a result,' he added.
Investors may find that the standard of service is as important as cost.
Efficiency in dealing with paperwork, opening hours, access to foreign
markets - all factors will have varying levels of appeal to different
investors.
Many investors will not want to rely on an execution-only service but will
need advice or portfolio management skills in handling their stocks.
But it has to be good news for private investors as a whole that brokers are
prepared to compete on price.
Telephone-based services make the business of share dealing much less
cumbersome and remove the 'intimidation factor' involved in approaching a
stockbroker.
Those who want further information should call Sharelink on 021-200-2242,
Sharemarket on 061-237-9443 or Fidelity on 0800- 414191.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A forgettable unit trust birthday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEDNESDAY September 30 is an anniversary the unit trust industry and
thousands of investors would probably rather forget.
It will be five years to the day since Royal Life launched the 'Royal
Event', three unit trusts, described in Pounds 6m worth of
privatisation-strength advertising as 'an investment opportunity more
exciting and versatile than any share issue.'
Responding at four times the normal rate, 135,000 people put Pounds 240m
into the three funds. For 60 per cent of them, this was a first unhappy
venture into unit trusts. Royal Life invested rapidly, via brokers James
Capel, and had Pounds 200m already invested by October 19, 1987 when world
stock markets crashed.
Five years later, Royal Life has about Pounds 100m of the Pounds 240m still
under management and around 96,000 remaining investors, estimating that
market movements had wiped off Pounds 50m, with the rest accounted for by
investors cashing in, although an unknown number might have switched to
other funds within the group.
Individually, the five-year record, up to the beginning of this week, was an
18.5 per cent gain for the International Cautionary Trust, according to
Micropal. This was far short of the building society return which earned
between 25.5 per cent and 43.65 per cent in the same period.
The International growth trust, which aimed to outperform the FTA World
index, showed a 10.5 per cent loss against the FTA World's 5.9 per cent
gain.
Meanwhile, the risk-oriented International Speculative trust showed a 24 per
cent loss.
'Looking back, it clearly was not a good time for people to invest in
equities,' said Steve Atkins, associate director of unitised funds at Royal
Insurance. 'But I am not sure there was really anybody about five years ago
who would have said to you they thought equities were likely to be a poor
investment. Our expectation then was that people would do quite well.'
Atkins noted that the five-years since 1987 were unusual because equities
had performed so poorly, particularly in relation to cash-type investments.
'The theory is people must get a better return from in investing in equities
where prices are volatile or people would always gravitate to cash.'
He said: 'At a theoretical level that stands over a genuine long period of
time, but I am not sure five years is long enough.'
However, as Atkins acknowledged, the Royal Event funds also performed badly
by comparison with other unit trusts. For example, International Speculative
trust was outperformed by around 90 per cent of competitor funds in the year
to September 1.
On average, across all Royal's unitised funds, the group was outperformed by
about 35 per cent of competitor funds.
'In the early couple of years of these particular trusts, overall
performance by most of the funds we were running was not good at all, he
said, referring to the total of 11 unit trusts and 45 unitised funds run by
the group, totalling Pounds 2bn under management.
Royal took action by setting up a separate asset management company early in
1990 and had since seen a steady and considerable improvement in fund
performance, he said.
On an offer-to-offer basis, Atkins said, Cautionary Trust had outperformed
building society accounts over the last two years. A unit holder who stayed
with the trust over that period had done better than by selling in disgust
and then depositing the money with a society.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Poor pension performers - The life
office league tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURVEYS published in Money Management magazine this week show that charges
on personal pensions and early surrenders of endowments are at worryingly
high levels.
They also suggest that the league tables advocated by Sir Carsberg, director
general of fair trading (see Serious Money, page II) would make interesting
reading.
Several offices are shown to be poor performers. But at least they are open
about it, while several companies decided not to disclose their figures.
Many of these were poor performers in the past, suggesting that revealing
the information might have been bad for business.
On personal pensions, the stock market crash of October 1987 meant that 35
per cent of all unit-linked five-year funds failed to return the gross
amount of premiums which had been paid into the fund.
The most disquieting figures concern charges. Money Management asked offices
to predict their final pay-out on the assumption that their funds grew at 13
per cent. Note that this return now looks on the high side, and that
differences in projected pay-outs will be determined by charges alone. In
reality, strong investment performance can often compensate for high
charges.
Lautro, the life assurance regulator, prevents companies from quoting
projections on the basis of their own charges, but instead stipulates a
fixed level, even if an office's charges are much higher. Money Management's
figures suggest that this approach could be misleading.
The table shows how much of the final fund you use to buy a pension annuity
when you retire will be eaten up by charges. With no charges at all, the
fund would be worth Pounds 399,297. If charges are on the Lautro basis, they
will knock Pounds 63,697 off this. However, Money Management's survey shows
that the average fund would shed Pounds 48,653 in charges, while the worst -
Canterbury Life - would lose Pounds 169,989, and only pay out Pounds
229,308. By comparison the cheapest office, Professional Life, would pay
Pounds 365,553.
As for early surrenders of endowments - only 11 companies would say how many
of their policies started in 1990 had survived into 1992. Their figures are
shown in the bottom table. Some of them, particularly over 25 years for
Colonial Mutual and Sun Alliance, are very poor. Long-term policies
surrendered this quickly are a dead loss for both investors and the life
companies. But at least these companies admitted the problem.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS have continued to show faith in the medium term future of their
companies, with further buying in the week of currency turmoil. Not only
does the market's sharp rally vindicate the heavy buying seen in recent
months, but it also leaves scope for the emergence of frustrated would-be
sellers over the short term.
John Murray, a non-executive director of Southern Business Group, a
photocopier supplier, has sold more than 1m shares at 79p - down sharply
from the 94p level at which Paul Roberjot disposed of 150,000 shares at the
end of July. The company's year-end is September.
The insurance broking sector has had a miserable 1992 after a relatively
buoyant 1991. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the share price of
Bradstock Group.
Directors sold heavily in April, June and September last year at prices
around 150-165p. During the summer, though, the shares collapsed, hitting a
low point of 83p. Now, with the price rallying, directors have taken the
opportunity to offload a further 225,000 at around Pounds 1 apiece.
Shares in Shandwick, the public relations company headed by Peter Gummer,
have surged lately, albeit from a very low base. Further purchases by Gummer
and Lord Chalfont bring the total bought during the past two weeks to just
over 5m. The most recent deals were made at 5p against a present price of
about 15p.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The importance of preparing for the
day when you retire - Planning Your Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the time you retire, it is possible that your pension, and not your
house, will be your greatest single asset. However, few people understand
either how much they have invested, or how much they are entitled to invest.
Over the coming weeks, the Weekend FT will publish a series of articles to
explain your entitlements, and the different bodies which could provide a
pension.
If you want to take advantage of the full Inland Revenue tax benefits for
long-term pension saving there are three choices of provider: the
government, your employer, or a personal pension via an independent fund
manager or insurance company. This first article explains the pension
provision available from the state.
THE STATE will support you in your old age - but that support is designed to
fund fish and chip suppers rather than haute cuisine. And even the limited
state pension system faces horrendous problems as the average age of the
population increases.
These problems are so big that the government has been offering incentives
for investors to opt out of the state scheme. All of which goes a long way
to explaining why pension planning is so important - and so difficult.
The state's pension provision comes in two layers: the 'basic pension' and
then, for some, the 'additional pension' - known to most as Serps (the state
earnings-related pension scheme). The government then provides tax reliefs
of varying sizes to allow companies and independent providers a chance to
compete.
To take the two tiers in turn:
Basic pension
Everyone who pays the full rate (Class 1) National Insurance contributions
for most of their working life is eligible for the basic pension, and the
payment of NICs is compulsory for those who are employees.
Some women still pay the reduced rate of NIC, which does not give them a
right to this pension. The self-employed build up a right to the basic
pension through paying Class 2 NICs.
The rules governing the basic pension are as follows:
1. It is paid weekly (as are contributions) and rises in line with retail
price inflation at the beginning of each tax year, The present pension is
Pounds 54.15 for a single person.
2. It is paid only when a man has reached 65 or a woman 60. You cannot take
a basic state pension if you retire from your job early but you can defer
taking it until 70 for men and 65 for women.
3. For married couples, if one partner retires and the other is not working,
an extra Pounds 32.55 is paid. If that partner is over the relevant
retirement age, it will go to them direct - otherwise, it goes to the
partner who has reached retirement age.
One further complication: if you retire but your partner is still working,
then the extra pension is not payable until they do retire. The maximum a
household can receive under this system is a less-than-princely Pounds 86.70
per week, or Pounds 4,508.40 in a year.
Additional pension
Whether you are in Serps might well depend on your employer. Large companies
tend to 'contract out' and provide their own pension scheme. But many small
companies cannot afford the commitment of funding their own pension scheme,
so rely on Serps to do the job for them. Self-employed people do not have
the option of Serps.
So, if you work for a company and have not signed up for a 'contracted-out'
pension scheme, you are contributing towards Serps by default. Whether you
should be doing so is another matter.
The basic promise of Serps is to pay 20 per cent of your average earnings as
a pension once you have retired. These are adjusted for inflation, and
include every year between the age of 16 and state retirement age.
Thus, under the present system, a man needs to start work at 16 and pay
National Insurance contributions for 49 years to be entitled to the full
Serps pension. Employers also pay NICs on their employees' behalf towards
Serps.
The scheme has become a political football, though. When introduced under
Labour in 1978, it offered to pay an income of 25 per cent of the average of
the 20 highest-paid years of employment. But there are complications.
Ammendments introduced by the Conservatives in 1988 are being phased-in
gradually over 49 years. Those retiring on or before the 1998-99 financial
year will have their pension based on the more generous Labour system.
Anybody reaching retirement age after 2037-38 for men, or 2032-33 for women,
will be on the new system. All those who fall in between will be paid their
pension via a hybrid system.
A further qualification is that the earnings to which the scheme is related
are not total earnings but only an employee's earnings between two strict
bands. The lower earnings limit is Pounds 54 a week while the upper limit,
or 'cap,' is Pounds 405, equivalent to Pounds 21,060.
Even if you earn Pounds 100,000 a year, your entitlement will be worked out
on the assumption that you earn Pounds 349 a week (the difference between
upper and lower limits). Similarly, those paid under Pounds 54 a week have
no access to Serps.
Finally, if you were working between 1961 and 1975, you might qualify for a
small 'graduated pension' worth up to Pounds 5.50 a week. This system was
replaced by Serps.
As with the basic scheme, Serps' pensions cannot be taken until 60 for women
and 65 for men. Pension payments then are index-linked.
Serps can thus be described as a safety net - although barely adequate  -
for those who are employed and cannot be bothered to take any action over
their pension. NICs to fund it are not tax-deductible and income tax is
payable in the usual way on the pension you get in retirement. So, this
arrangement has no claim to 'tax-efficiency' and does nothing for the
self-employed.
Many people effectively will contract-out of Serps when they sign up for a
company pension scheme. If you do not belong to such a scheme, but still
leave Serps, the government automatically will pay money into an appropriate
personal pension set up by an insurance company or fund manager (of which
more later in the series).
Contracting-out is done year by year, so you can contract back in. Then,
when you retire, you would be paid income in differing proportions by the
government (for the years when you were contracted-in) and by the personal
pension provider.
Ultimately, Serps should be regarded only as a very basic building block for
your pension. You need added options, which we start to cover next week.
But even with the vast funds at its disposal, the problems the government
has in funding pensions should make painfully clear that planning by the
individual is not easy.

Equitable Guide to Saving for Your Retirement, by Eric Short, published by

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Flat-fee Pep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARTIN CURRIE has followed Foreign &amp; Colonial in launching a flat-fee
investment trust personal equity plan, writes Philip Coggan. It is linked to
four trusts managed by the group, Securities Trust of Scotland, Martin
Currie Europe, Scottish Eastern and St Andrew. The initial fee is Pounds 50
plus annual membership of Pounds 60, at Pounds 5 a month. The charge for
transferring an existing Pep is Pounds 15, plus the initial fee. Subsequent
investments, or withdrawals, cost Pounds 20.
The plan is most beneficial to those who can invest the annual limit of
Pounds 6,000. At that level, a higher rate taxpayer investing in the
Securities Trust of Scotland (yield 6.6 per cent) would save Pounds 158.40
in income tax, earning back the charges within a year. But a basic rate
taxpayer investing the minimum of Pounds 2,000 in Martin Currie Europe
(yield 0.4 per cent) would save just Pounds 2 in tax a year. It would take
55 years merely to earn back the first year's charges.

FT  26 SEP 92 / The Long View: Biggles flies east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENT SYMBOLISM has been offered this week by the mooted departure to
Taiwan of most of the residual operations of one of British aviation's most
famous manufacturing units, birthplace of the Tiger Moth, the Mosquito and
the Comet. The parent company British Aerospace, the country's biggest
manufacturer, is valued by the stock market at below Pounds 500m, a lot less
than MFI Furniture, say, or Welsh Water.
Such developments may say as much about the emergence of new economic
powerhouses around the globe as about Britain's absolute decline. Meanwhile,
however, the country's obsession with financial manipulation has never been
more in evidence: the current economic crisis, for instance, has revolved
entirely around exchange rates and interest rates. In a rational world
financial policies would surely be designed to create a stable framework for
the real economy, but instead the real economy has been asked to 'adjust' to
rigid financial conditions laid down for various political reasons. Part of
that adjustment is taking the form of a flight abroad by high-profile
segments of Britain's manufacturing base.
Elsewhere the fascinating raw material of the week has come not from
Thursday's emergency debate in Parliament - although I will come to that in
a moment - but from routine economic releases on trade and gross domestic
product.
The August balance of payments figures were shocking: a current account
deficit of Pounds 1.1bn for the month, in the middle of a serious recession.
We are now heading for a deficit of Pounds 12bn for the year, almost twice
as much as forecast by the Treasury in March. Recently import volumes have
been running nearly 6 per cent higher than a year ago, even though domestic
demand has been flat. Exports have dropped a little compared with last
summer (the Treasury forecast that they would be rising by 3 1/2 per cent)
and plainly there now has to be a big shift of economic effort into exports
and import substitution.
As for GDP, it fell marginally in the second quarter, when political
euphoria and recovering confidence were supposed to have caused an economic
rebound. True, excluding North Sea oil there was a 0.1 per cent upturn; but
the evidence is that the downwards momentum has resumed in the current
quarter.
For all the tales of economic gloom, however, the statistics suggest that
the general public have barely suffered yet - unless, of course, they have
lost their jobs. Real GDP is now running at roughly the same as it was back
at the beginning of 1988 (and about 4 per cent less than the quarterly peak
attained in April-June 1990). But real average employee earnings have risen
by 6 1/2 per cent in the past 4 1/2 years, and real personal disposable
income is 5 or 6 per cent higher than in 1988 (although consumer expenditure
has scarcely risen, because more of the income is being saved).
The stock market is already beginning to look forward to better times for
the corporate sector. But in the personal sector the worst is yet to come,
with sharp cuts in real incomes becoming inevitable (that is what
devaluation is all about). The question is whether this can be achieved
smoothly or only through an inflationary crisis.
An alternative agenda is beginning to surface among the backbenchers of both
major parties. On Thursday the Labour Economy Policy Group published a
robust pamphlet written by Austin Mitchell MP. 'What industry needs is a low
exchange rate, low interest rates, and an accommodating monetary policy . .
. moderate inflation is much better than no growth . . . outside the ERM
interest rates could be reduced to at least the rate of inflation, if not
well below . . . without growth, redistribution becomes too painful to be
sustained." For growth, read inflation. For moderate, insert your own
figure.
The investment markets are starting to take some of this on board.
Index-linked gilts have had a particularly good week and since sterling came
out of the ERM ten days ago the real yield - then a highest-ever 4.76 per
cent - has tumbled by more than half a percentage point. Meanwhile the yield
on long-dated fixed interest gilts has gone up, but quite modestly, from
8.96 per cent to about 9.35 per cent.
One implication is, of course, that the market is gloomier about inflation.
The gap between the two yields (not quite the implied market inflation
expectation, but something close to it) has risen from 4.2 per cent to 5.1
per cent. The relative stability of fixed interest gilts, however, means
that there is expected at the same time to be a fall in real yields outside
the ERM. There would be nothing surprising if this were to happen. For much
of the postwar period up to about 1980 the real returns on gilts were nil.
Indeed, lower real interest rates may be a precondition for an economic
recovery.
The Mitchell-type strategy involves a big inflation tax on the holders of
monetary assets, this being used to cushion the blow for average wage
earners as wealth is shifted into investment (or maybe into subsidies). To
be a practical proposition, however, this would need to be backed up with
exchange controls to prevent a flight of capital and a collapse of the
floating currency. It is not such a fanciful idea given that Spain, Portugal
and Ireland have reimposed exchange controls this week.
In Parliament the focus was not on any of this but on the Germans and the
Eurocrats. Maybe that is fair enough, because it would be wrong for new
domestic policies to be cobbled together in undue haste. But unless this
rather dim government produces some really tough and imaginative measures
quite soon the British economy is bound to drift into its unhealthy old
ways.
Norman Lamont had to admit on Thursday that the markets had driven the
willy-nilly UK out of the ERM, and they will go on determining government
policy if they are allowed to. That would not be at all bad for index-linked
gilts, or for Austin Mitchell.

FT  26 SEP 92 / A tender trap for Our Man in Berlin: For a decade, the East
German secret police watched Leslie Colitt's every move. His newly-opened
file reveals a tale of suspicion, treachery - and farce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHE WAS raven-haired and dark-eyed, as attractive a woman as I had ever seen
in Saxony, a region extolled for its beautiful maidens by no lesser
connoisseur than that old philanderer, Goethe. Her name was Beate and I
first met her when she was scrubbing the hallway of her Leipzig flat.
She gazed at me, her pretty features twisting into a scowl. 'What do you
want?' I explained that the accommodations office for journalists had given
me her registration card and that I needed a room for a few days. She
grudgingly obliged and her mood gradually improved. A few years later when I
was visiting the city, we became friends, swapping criticisms of the East
German Communist authorities and discussing the rise of the Solidarity
movement in Poland. We visited the Falstaff restaurant, where her enticing
gaze - and a prodigious amount of drink  - soon took effect. We returned to
her flat, and I succumbed to her charms.
BEATE was a Stasi informer. Every word we exchanged, every move I made, was
dutifully reported to the East German secret police. My thoughts, business
trips, meetings, indiscretions; all - except, as I later discovered, that
fateful night in the Falstaff in 1981 - were added to the voluminous file
the Stasi was collating on 'Caesar', alias Leslie Colitt, the Financial
Times' Berlin-based correspondent for East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary since 1972. I was suspected of enough anti-socialist crimes to land
me behind bars for years if the authorities so desired.
Only now, poring through the newly-released two-volume, 278-page file kept
on me for more than 20 years by the Ministry of State Security of the German
Democratic Republic, do I realise how dangerous the Communist security
police thought I was.
I was code-named 'Caesar' in the early 1970s when I was placed under OPK,
Operative Personal Control (surveillance). I was pursued by a secret police
organisation numbering 100,000 officers and more than 200,000 informers. Yet
in spite of the terror the Stasi aroused, the omnipresent eyes of the
'shield and sword of the Party' are now revealed to have been
extraordinarily, appallingly near-sighted.
My file, released by the German Federal Office Administering the Stasi
Documents, shows that I was suspected by the secret police in Berlin, Prague
and Budapest of 'hostile and subversive activities in obtaining
information', of 'influencing the political underground' and 'other forms of
state crimes.' The files say my reporting for the FT was
'negative-defamatory.' Like its Soviet model, the Cheka, the Stasi saw
treason and counter-revolution lurking everywhere. It believed I was a
probable spy for an 'imperialist' intelligence agency.
At the time I tried not to worry about surveillance, as I was busy fighting
battles to obtain visas and interviews with political officials. I thought
anyone - including the Stasi - could discover virtually everything of
importance I knew simply by reading the FT.
Now, even though the Stasi is dead, I find I am strangely flattered and
repelled by an informer's remark that: 'he is self-assured, always friendly
and modest' - and a border controller's comment after searching me: 'He was
very well-groomed, clean and modernly dressed.'
For some years the surveillance was relaxed but I came under intense
scrutiny again after the rise of the Charter 77 civil rights movement in
Prague. In January 1977 I spent two emotion-charged weeks in Czechoslovakia
interviewing Charter's first spokesman, the ailing Professor Jan Potocka and
its founder, Vaclav Havel. Potocka died a few weeks later after
interrogations by Czechoslovak STB security officers.
On my return by train to Berlin in February I was searched by Czechoslovak
border officials at the Decin crossing point. All 90 pages of my notes and
my tapes were confiscated, in spite of my protests against this violation of
the Helsinki Accord. I spent the night under East German custody in the
Mitropa restaurant at Dresden railway station. In this bizarre setting,
interrupted only by occasional Soviet military policemen, I managed to
reconstruct the notes of my conversations with the dissidents.
STB never forgot the prominence my case was given by the Western media.
Since I am a US citizen, the State Department protested to Prague. The
secret police in Prague warned the Stasi, which issued 'search number
222959' and ordered that I be watched by the counter-espionage branch
whenever I entered the eastern sector from my office in West Berlin. My file
says:
Excerpt from a report by HA II under General Gunter Kratsch:
'17 December 1982: Unofficial indications suggest that Colitt has access to
information of the most internal nature on the economies of the European
socialist states and CMEA (Comecon). Our experts estimate they could only be
surreptitiously obtained. Furthermore, we understand that the British secret
service uses Colitt's articles as a basis for gathering further
information.'
Kratsch was arrested only last month on charges of directing senior Stasi
agents in the West who betrayed top-secret West German and Nato defence
documents to East Berlin and Moscow.
I was amazed to discover that several years before I was accused of being a
probable spy, the Stasi's powerful espionage wing, HVA, led by the legendary
General Markus Wolf, had unleashed a swarm of IMs - informers - on me. They
were to gather as much information as possible to see whether I could be
used in East Germany's interest. But this plan failed ignominiously. The
files reveal that the chief IM, code-named 'Bertram,' lied outrageously to
the Stasi officers about the success he claimed to have had in gaining my
confidence.
General Wolf, who was also deputy Stasi chief under the aged Erich Mielke -
himself on trial in Berlin - faces similar prosecution. Meanwhile, he is
confined to his flat less than 1km from where I am writing this in my office
in east Berlin.
'Bertram' and all the other informers who reported on me each had a weakness
which the Stasi was able to exploit - they could not escape. Yet, perhaps
because they were forced into it, they were often filing information of
amazing triviality:
16 March, 1978, 11:28am - 'Caesar' goes to ticket window 20 (of Leipzig
railway station) where he buys a ticket to Erfurt.
11:44am - 'Caesar' buys a packet of biscuits from a wagon and again proceeds
to platform 11.
11:47am - 'Caesar' enters express train Krakow-Eisenach, car no. 34 and
walks through several cars before taking seat in non-smoking section of car
28.
11:52am - 'Caesar' departs on the express train for Erfurt.
14:09pm - 'Caesar' leaves express train at Erfurt main station in direction
of exit. Along the way he throws a plastic bag in a refuse basket. After
approx. 15 metres he turns, walks back to the refuse basket, and removes
from it the plastic bag he previously threw away.'
This was analysed to be a clever means of 'control' on my part to check
whether I was being followed. In reality, I had not a clue that I was being
shadowed and merely thought I had forgotten something in the bag.
Unknown to me, on that particular trip to Erfurt I walked into one of the
most dangerous situations of my years in the East. This is what my Stasi
tail reported:
14:30pm - 'Caesar' enters Burgerhof restaurant but leaves although there
were empty tables. He (14:32pm) enters the Winzerkeller restaurant opposite
and sits down at an empty table. 'Caesar' orders a Margon mineral water
without flavour and one portion of chicken hearts.
14:50pm - a Lieutenant of Air Defence Command enters and approaches
'Caesar's' table to ask if there is a seat empty. He is given code-name:
'Himmel' (sky). 'Himmel' sits down and they begin to converse. The
conversation gets livelier and more intense. They drink several cognacs and
'Himmel' also has several beers. The following words of their conversation
could be overheard: ' . . . political instruction, bill of sale, show exit
pass at the gate . . .'
In fact, my Stasi tail appears to have seriously misunderstood our
conversation or wilfully made up these fragments in order to advance his
promotion to a desk job. The officer, tall, uniformed and in his mid 20s, at
first assumed I was an East German. He told me about his father, who had
served with the Wehrmacht in Italy, and believed it was 'Italian cowardice',
not the Wehrmacht's fault, that Italy fell to the Allies. When he discovered
that I was an American he became uneasy. We shook hands and parted
strangers.
This chance encounter, which the Stasi thought virtual proof of espionage,
almost got us both arrested. My file reveals that a tail was put on this
hapless officer after we departed.
'Himmel' drank several beers and liquor on the train to Leipzig where he got
drunk in the railway station restaurant. At 8:20 pm he was joined at his
table by two 'female persons.' At 11 pm 'Himmel' bought a bottle of Sekt
which they drank and at 11:45pm 'Himmel' bought a box of chocolates at the
bar.
Just after midnight 'Himmel' and the two ladies took a taxi and vanished.
The report ends by giving 'Himmel's' real name and unit which, however, were
blackened out in my copy of the file.
Only after prolonged investigation was 'Himmel' cleared of the suspicion of
being a spy. I was then returned to the status of suspected agent. By
September 1980, however, the Stasi was forced to concede that 'until now
this suspicion could not be hardened.'
The Stasi pulled out all the stops for my twice-yearly visits to the Leipzig
Fair, where I always lived with private families who were officially
permitted to rent to Westerners. One of them, Frau M, a teacher with whom I
shared many insights on the Communist system, gave exhaustive information
about me to a fulltime informer.
She could hardly have refused, as she, like hundreds of thousands of other
East Germans, was listed by the Stasi as a GM, or 'Social Contributor'.
Besides, her son was in prison - she was in no position to turn down a Stasi
'request' to turn informer. What she told them was essentially true:
'He told my husband that after visiting the Akademixer cabaret he asked
young people what they had personally gained from detente. They replied only
that they were still unable to travel where they wanted.'
She described interviews I had conducted among private tradesmen and
shopkeepers in her neighbourhood and my questions to her about the hard
currency the repairmen demanded. I was also particularly interested in
'heavy machinery', she asserted, with gross exaggeration.
When I visited Frau M last year I found a personal tragedy. She had joined
the many losers of German unification for which she had demonstrated in
Leipzig in 1989. Her son was free but had lost his job, while she was
rapidly sliding into economic poverty and ill health.
By the late 1970s my surveillance by the Stasi attained new heights of
intensity and absurdity.
Leipzig, 6 September, 1978 - 2.24pm - After getting off the tram he walked
purposefully to Fair building 17.
3:16pm - 'Caesar' left the above-named exhibitor and walked to the snack
stand next to the Fiat exhibit. He bought roast chicken and stowed it in his
bag.
3:36pm - 'Caesar' left Fair stand 4 and went to the toilet for about five
minutes.
It was at that time that I first met Beate. She told me she had attended one
of the GDR's only schools for classical Greek and Latin. She was employed as
a German-Russian translator; her flat had belonged to her father. She was
divorced and had a small son. We swopped experiences about Russia and
Eastern Europe and parted as friends but no more.
I returned to stay with her two years later, in 1981, after assignments in
Poland reporting on the rise of Solidarity. I told her about the
exhilaration of being in the midst of a revolution which I was convinced
would sweep to victory in Poland and of Communism in Eastern Europe. By this
time she had probably applied to leave East Germany and was told by the
Stasi that she stood a chance only if she became an informer. She reported
on my every move. Intentionally or not, she managed to relay to the Stasi
the message that Solidarity was going to prevail:
'18 March, 1981 - 'Caesar' has close contacts with the Solidarnosc trade
union movement in Poland and had several interviews with Walesa. He also has
extensive ties to the intelligentsia and to the unions in key factories
whose names were not revealed. 'Caesar' is convinced that Solidarnosc will
prevail. Large numbers of Communists (Party members) have deserted to the
union. According to him Poland is virtually a free country.
She also reported that she was with 'Caesar' in the Falstaff restaurant
until 11:30pm - but of the events later that night, there was nothing.
We met again by chance last year with her parents in Leipzig during a
demonstration against east Germany's economic collapse. Beate told me she
had married and joined her husband in Belgium, where she was working as a
translator. Did she get out with the help of the Stasi before the Wall was
opened in November 1989, I wondered.
'It's awful what is taking place here,' she remarked. 'This is not what we
demonstrated for in 1989,' her father said, sadly. I looked at Beate, but
she lowered her gaze.
My Stasi file was closed and sealed on October 9 1985 for lack of evidence.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Strains over Europe test Tories: Commons dissatisfaction
puts prime minister's leadership in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE Party unity yesterday again came under strain over Europe as a
Commons motion welcoming sterling's departure from the European exchange
rate mechanism continued to attract support. More than 60 backbench MPs have
already signed it.
Dissatisfaction with the government's performance over the past few weeks
has even led some senior backbenchers to acknowledge publicly that Mr John
Major's leadership is now in the spotlight.
Some have also called for ministers to provide more direction and to
present, with more style, 'newer and tougher' policies.
Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers, delivered a thinly-disguised warning, when he emphasised the
pressures that Mr Major had been under in recent weeks and expressed the
hope that he would be 'refreshed' when parliament resumed its normal session
next month.
The broad contentment among backbenchers at the floating exchange rate
policy was reflected as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, won a warm
reception at a private meeting with Tory MPs for his caution about the
prospect of sterling's return to the ERM, as well as for his commitment to a
strong anti-inflationary policy.
No longer subject to speculation about his immediate future, Mr Lamont used
his opening remarks to the meeting to highlight Mr Major's achievement in
the general election and to stress how much the prime minister deserved the
loyalty of the party.
Mr Lamont also signalled yesterday that he would use his annual Mansion
House speech on October 29 to set out the monetary framework the government
now intends to follow.
As party managers welcomed the MPs' support for controls on public spending,
fresh evidence of the hard decisions these will mean came as Mr Kenneth
Clarke, home secretary, cancelled plans for the new prison service
headquarters in Derby. The contract for the new building was signed
recently.
Yesterday's meeting of the cabinet committee on public spending examined an
'illustrative break down' of the ways in which the Pounds 244.5bn spending
target could be met.
Earlier, some 70 to 80 backbenchers applauded Mr Lamont as he stressed the
need for the government to maintain its anti-inflationary credentials and
emphasised the role that tight controls on spending would have in that,
especially with sterling outside the ERM.
Euro-sceptic MPs claimed that the Commons motion welcoming the 'abandonment
of fixed exchange rates' was charting the way forward.
Moving to play down talk of division, ministers emphasised the similarity
between the terms of the motion and the government's approach as set out by
Mr Major and Mr Lamont in Thursday's emergency debate.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said on BBC radio: 'We are all agreed
that we want to see a Europe in which more emphasis is put on the
development of co-operation between national governments rather than doing
things through centralised bureaucratic structures'.
There are signs, however, that the Euro-enthusiasts among the Tories are not
prepared simply to concede to the Euro-sceptics the argument over where
government policy should be going.
In a speech to be delivered today, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign
office minister, will say that the government would have no truck with the
'political nihilism' involved in tearing up the Maastricht treaty.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Smith reshapes party policy-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, has redrawn the party's policy-making
machinery, with himself at the head of a pivotal new committee that will
greatly reduce the powers of the long-planned National Policy Forum.
The changes, outlined in an appendix to Labour's Agenda for Change strategy
document, are likely to provoke controversy among delegates at this year's
annual conference, which opens in Blackpool on Monday. They put Mr Smith at
the centre of a core policy group of senior party figures and transform the
still-to-be-created NPF from the party's key policy-making body to a largely
consultative role.
Under the revised plan, agreed by the national executive this month, the
crucial decisions will now rest with a Joint Policy Committee which will
also determine priority proposals.
The JPC will comprise less than 20 members, 16 of them from the national
executive and the shadow cabinet, and be chaired by the party leader.
The new slimline body is commended as cheaper and more flexible than the
unwieldy NPF model. But it also centralises decision-making, concentrates
authority in the party leadership and ensures that policy plans opposed by
Labour's senior figures will be dropped without wider debate.
The Forum - originally proposed to diminish the ability of the conference to
damage Labour's image by springing policy U-turns on the leadership - will
be slimmed from 200 to 100 members and will meet once next year and not
quarterly as originally planned.
Charged with acting as a steering group and policy co-ordinator to the
Forum, the JPC will also commission and vet policy positions drawn up by
seven subsidiary Joint Policy Commissions, with sectoral responsibilities
covering issues such as foreign affairs, economics, tax and benefits and
constitutional reform.
While the NPF will be able to recommend changes to proposals to the national
executive - the ultimate authority - it loses its capacity to initiate
policy.
A party official said this week that the eventual powers of the NPF will
depend in large part on the effectiveness of its chairman and the quality of
its proposals.
Explaining the changes, the Agenda for Change document says the new format
will increase flexibility, allowing Labour to respond rapidly to Tory
initiatives and to devise new thinking on the party's future.
The move has also been justified as a necessary response to Labour's Pounds
2.2m overdraft and annual overspending that last year reached Pounds 1.3m.

FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most UK property men must have started turning the lights out 10 days ago
when they heard that interest rates had been raised to 15 per cent to defend
the value of the pound. Now that monetary policy has been reversed - so
quickly in fact that they were able to flick the switch again before going
home - the quoted company sector has again shown signs of life. Property
shares have outperformed the market by some 8 per cent with sharp percentage
gains for leaders like MEPC and British Land, as well as for selected second
liners like Frogmore and Peel.
Sentiment, of course, has had a lot to do with it. Falling interest costs
are positive for cash flow and tenant demand, but most of the majors (except
British Land) have their debt at fixed rates. The letting of half of one of
the City's biggest white elephants - the Alban Gate development at London
Wall - is a relief to its landlord MEPC. But it hardly compensates for the
deep-rooted structural problems in the City where 22 per cent of space is
still unlet.
Still, even a sniff of the good old days could raise hopes for an imminent
deal or two in a notoriously gossipy industry. With shares so depressed
after the last two years, the current rally may even have further to run. On
a longer term view, however, it is hard to get excited. Banks are
desperately trying to reduce their exposure to property, not increase it.
Rents have gone firmly ex-growth. Weakness at the long end of the gilt
market, moreover, will hardly help.

FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's US economic data make gloomy reading, with the country
apparently heading towards a third leg of the recession. The brightest spot
was the 0.1 per cent fall in August personal expenditure. After allowing for
distortions from Hurricane Andrew, that indicates a boost to the economy
from consumer spending. However, consumers have been running down savings to
pay for spending in recent months. They may not be able to keep that up: the
data also showed personal income falling by 0.5 per cent. Not surprisingly,
financial markets are looking towards a Federal Reserve rate cut after the
release of September's employment report next Friday.
Even if that happens it is difficult to see the economy turning up soon.
Companies have little reason to invest when both presidential candidates are
offering an investment tax credit next year. Consumers may now also defer
spending until the election result is known. And while US goods are cheap in
world markets, even after the recent rally of the dollar, slow growth around
the world means poor export prospects. Wall Street may take some heart from
third quarter results which show companies increasing earnings by cutting
costs. Yet without a recovery, these savings may be viewed as a one-off
gain, making current earnings multiples look too high.

FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Index-linked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One might have expected index-linked gilts to perform well after a
devaluation. And so they have, with a rally that matches the performance of
equities. Long dated index-linked bonds offered an unprecedented real return
of 4.75 per cent on the morning sterling left the ERM. A correction of this
riskless rate was overdue. Ditching the D-Mark parity is, after all, a
policy aimed at reducing real interest rates.
But the fall in index-linked yields stands in contrast to the apparent
equanimity with which holders of conventional long-dated gilts have viewed
events. The message from the former is that the market is anticipating a
sharp fall in real interest rates, from the latter that there is to be no
substantial rise in long-term nominal rates. The anomaly is all the more
puzzling since the difference between conventional bond yields and
index-linked yields - a measure of the market's inflationary expectations -
has widened. From almost 4 per cent immediately before ERM exit, the yield
differential reached 5 per cent by the end of this week. Arithmetic dictates
that conventional gilt yields will simply have to rise next year if the
differential is to return to the levels seen before sterling was hitched to
the D-Mark in 1990.
By raising over Pounds 1bn from sales of index-linked paper last week the
government was quick to spot the funding opportunity. Even so, the sector
may continue to lack liquidity. Index-linked bonds have certain tax
advantages for UK retail investors. Overseas investors gain no protection
from the ravages of inflation as expressed through the exchange rate.

FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Devalued dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perfectly understandable that the knee-jerk response of the equity
market to devaluation should have been to mark sharply equities higher.
Equally understandable is that the rate of advance should slow as investors
start to take stock. The market managed to put on only 32 points over the
past week. Obviously recovery is going to be a slow process. While the
outlook for corporate earnings is better than it was before, it is still for
fairly modest growth through next year. Dividends may rise more slowly
still. At around 1.8 times, average dividend cover for the market as a whole
is well below the 2.5 level regarded as normal during the 1980s.
The devaluation effect on earnings will scarcely be immediate, even for
export companies, as these frequently hedge their exposure in advance. There
may be some instant relief on the interest bill. Otherwise the outlook for
the rest of 1992 has barely changed. It would take a pretty strong recovery
next year for earnings to rise as much as 20 per cent. Even then companies
would then have to confine dividend growth to around 7 per cent to bring the
payout ratio back over 2.
Some companies that might otherwise have been expected to cut their payout
may now maintain it. The signal function of dividends could become doubly
important when earnings figures are distorted by the new accounting rules.
There is also an argument that companies can afford to live with a low
payout ratio in a period of relatively high growth and rising prices. That
theory may be tested eventually, but there is unlikely to be much economic
revival in the air when final dividends for 1992 are declared next spring.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Texan marauder keeps everyone guessing
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monday night television football game has become an American
institution. This will not be the case next Monday because the Los Angeles
Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs simply cannot compete with the ultimate
Texas Marauder who is going to be on another channel.
Mr Ross Perot - for it is he - will, yet again, be on Larry King Live. This
is the talk show programme on which he declared his prospective independent
candidacy back in February and on which he has ruminated endlessly since
about what is wrong with the country.
The little billionaire from Texas could say absolutely anything. Yesterday
the Los Angeles Times solemnly reported he would announce that he would
formally enter the race, and it may well be right. He has already this week
issued the shocking confession that he 'made a mistake' in terminating his
non-candidacy back in July.
He will certainly report that his 'volunteers,' whom he meets in Dallas this
weekend, have told him that only he, and not President George Bush nor
Governor Bill Clinton, can take on the awesome task of cutting the federal
budget deficit. It has emerged, however, that most of the leading volunteers
have been pretty much handpicked by Mr Perot himself.
He will definitely brandish his new book, modestly entitled United We Stand,
America, which is also the humble name of his movement. This contains his
programme, which he somehow was never able to produce while he was a
non-candidate, probably because some of its ideas - big increases in petrol
taxes, cuts in social security and so on - are not calculated to win friends
or votes.
The official body politic is, reluctantly, preparing itself for the return
of the nativist. James Baker, who runs Mr Bush's campaign, has talked to him
twice in the last week.
Senator Al Gore, Mr Clinton's running mate, muttered through clenched teeth
yesterday morning that Mr Perot had the sort of record and experience that
might make him a qualified cabinet member.
Those running for nothing, however, are more blunt. A M Rosenthal's New York
Times column yesterday concluded that 'listening to Mr Perot now stirs the
same stomach quease as listening to a lecture on moral principles from a
defrocked clergyman.'
The newspaper Mr Rosenthal used to edit was just as polite. The Perot effort
was just 'tease, tantalise, talk'. Having dumped his supporters once, 'why
should they now, with the cake nearly baked, invite him back into the
kitchen when they know he can't stand the heat?'
The trouble with this sort of language from the establishment is that it is
a red rag to the Perot bull. He might be about to charge.

The Cuban bill is strongly opposed by the US's partners, who see it as
unjustified extraterritorial interference.

A GREEK newspaper publisher was yesterday sentenced to six months in jail
for defying an anti-terrorist law which bans publication of guerrilla
statements, Reuter reports from Athens.
Mr Christos Tegopoulos was also fined Dr5m (Pounds 15,400) for publishing a
statement by the leftist November 17 guerrilla group in his newspaper,
Eleftherotypia, in 1991.
Under Greek law Mr Tegopoulos may buy off his sentence at a rate of Dr1,000
a day and it was said to be unlikely he would go to jail. He was absent from
the trial.
The ban on publishing guerrilla statements, part of a 1990 anti-terrorist
law passed by Greece's conservative government, has touched off a battle
over censorship with the Greek media.
Seven publishers were sentenced to jail in September 1991 for violating the
ban.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW broke out yesterday over German plans to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the first launch of Hitler's 'wonder weapon', the V2 rocket
that was supposed to humble Britain, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Critics say the celebration on October 3 in the former rocket base of
Peenemunde is in poor taste, because the supersonic V2 killed thousands of
British civilians, while 20,000 concentration camp inmates died making it.
The organisers of the event say the V2 launch represents 'the first step
into space'. After the war the V2's inventor, Werner von Braun, was put in
charge of the US space programme that put the first man on the moon in 1969.
'Werner von Braun's achievements are fantastic but you have to relate them
to Nazi crimes,' said Mr Gunther Gottmann, director of Berlin's Museum of
Transport and Technology.
The reception in Peenemunde is funded by Germany's aerospace industry and
will be attended by senior company and government officials.
The organisers say there is no reason to feel ashamed of von Braun's
achievements, even though the engineer ignored inhuman conditions in an
underground factory in the Nazi concentration camp Dora.
'One shouldn't poke around in these old wounds,' said Mr Peter Profe, who
runs the V2 museum in Peenemunde.
The row over Peenemunde could revive tension between Britain and Germany
over the war.
German officials protested in May when Britain erected a statue to General
Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, who initiated the carpet bombing which destroyed
Dresden and many other cities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is likely to sign into law a nine-month moratorium on
US nuclear testing and a 1996 halt to the testing, congressional and
administration sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
But Mr Bush is likely to sign that law with a clear understanding that he
will try to revise it later to allow US nuclear testing beyond 1996, the
sources said.
They said congressional Democrats manoeuvred him into accepting the nuclear
test ban by attaching it to a Dollars 22bn (Pounds 12.8bn) energy
appropriation bill funding a huge supercollider scientific project in Texas
that Mr Bush wants.
He could not veto the test ban without also vetoing Dollars 517m in the bill
to continue construction of the supercollider.
Congress approved the bill with the nuclear test ban and sent it to Mr Bush
on Thursday night.
The House approved it 224-151 and the Senate approved it by voice vote.
It would suspend US nuclear testing for the nine months ending July 1 1993,
and then halt all testing by September 30 1996, unless any other country
conducted a nuclear test after that.
Between those two periods 15 US tests would be allowed to assure that new
safety devices on nuclear weapons work.
Though the nine-month moratorium would begin next Thursday, October 1, Mr
Bush would have years if he is re-elected president to try to get Congress
to soften the 1996 US test halt and allow testing after that.
Supporters of the test ban said it was needed to win an international
nuclear test ban preventing any further nuclear weapons development around
the world.

GENERAL Motors, the troubled US automobile company, suffered blows on two

possible down-grading.
Moody's review includes the company's commercial paper, which is an
important source of cheap funding for General Motors Acceptance Corporation
(GMAC), the largest non-bank finance house in the US.
GM's commercial paper currently has the top rating, Prime-1, and a downgrade
would lose the company many institutions whose investment guidelines
preclude them from buying paper lower than P-1.
GM would then have to find alternative sources of short-term funding.
Analysts speculated yesterday that it would probably turn more to the
asset-backed securities market.
Meanwhile, 4,200 workers at the GM plant in Lansing, Michigan, which
assembles the popular Pontiac Grand Am, went on strike yesterday morning in
a long-simmering dispute over job cuts. The stoppage immediately closed down
an adjacent chassis plant. The two sides will meet to discuss the issue
today.
Little more than two weeks ago GM suffered a 10-day strike at its Lordstown,
Ohio, stamping plant which idled eight more factories.
While the disputes are not ostensibly connected, analysts believe the United
Auto Workers union is trying to soften GM up as the company seeks to shut
down 21 plants and sharply cut its manpower in an attempt to restore its
loss-making North American operations to profit.
Moody's cited the danger of further union disruption as one of the factors
prompting its review. It said this would focus on 'GM's ability to turn
round its US automotive operations and rebuild its financial flexibility
given the mild recovery in auto demand, GM's relative weakness in certain
product categories, and potential impediments to the timely implementation
of cost reduction programmes in the company's North American operations.'
GM shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 32 in a generally falling
market.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Strains over Europe test Tories' fragile unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative Party's fragile unity over Europe came under strain again
yesterday as a Commons motion welcoming sterling's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism continued to attract support beyond the
more than 60-plus backbench MPs who had already signed it.
Dissatisfaction with the government's performance over the past few weeks
has even led some senior backbenchers to acknowledge publicly that Mr John
Major's leadership is now in the spotlight. Some have also called for
ministers to provide more direction and to present, with more style, 'newer
and tougher' policies.
Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers, delivered a thinly-disguised warning, when he emphasised the
pressures that Mr Major had been under in recent weeks and expressed the
hope that he would be 'refreshed' when parliament resumes its normal session
in October.
The broad contentment among backbenchers at the floating exchange rate
policy was reflected as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, won a warm
reception at a private meeting with Tory MPs for his caution about the
prospect of sterling's return to the ERM, as well as for his commitment to a
strong anti-inflationary policy.
No longer subject to speculation about his immediate future, Mr Lamont used
his opening remarks to the meeting to highlight Mr Major's achievement in
the general election and to stress how much the prime minister deserved the
loyalty of the party.
Mr Lamont also signalled yesterday he would use his annual Mansion House
speech on October 29 to spell out the monetary framework the government now
intends to follow.
As party managers welcomed the MPs' support for controls on public spending,
fresh evidence of the hard decisions these will mean came as Mr Kenneth
Clarke, home secretary, cancelled plans for the new prison service
headquarters in Derby. The contract for constructing the building was signed
only recently.
Yesterday's meeting of the cabinet committee on public spending examined an
'illustrative break down' of the ways in which the Pounds 244.5bn spending
target could be met.
Earlier, some 70 to 80 backbenchers applauded Mr Lamont as he stressed the
need for the government to maintain its anti-inflationary credentials and
emphasised the role that tight controls on spending would have in that,
especially with sterling outside the ERM.
Euro-sceptic MPs claimed that the Commons motion welcoming the 'abandonment
of fixed exchange rates' was charting the way forward for government
economic policy.
Moving to play down talk of division, ministers emphasised the similarity
between the terms of the motion and the government's approach as set out
byMr Major and Mr Lamont in Thursday's emergency debate.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said on BBC radio: 'We are all agreed
that we want to see a Europe in which more emphasis is put on the
development of co-operation between national governments rather than doing
things through centralised bureaucratic structures'.
There are signs, however, that the Euro-enthusiasts among the Tories are not
prepared simply to concede to the Euro-sceptics the argument over where
government policy should be going.
In a speech to be delivered today, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign
office minister, will say that the government would have no truck with the
'political nihilism' involved in tearing up the Maastricht treaty.
The Euro-sceptics insist, however, that they all agree not only that
sterling should not return to the ERM, but also that the Maastricht should
not be ratified.
The Euro-sceptic campaigners intend to use next month's Tory conference to
press their case.
Lord Parkinson, a former Tory party chairman, highlighted the pressure on Mr
Major when he warned about the dangers of a 'vacuum of leadership', though
he insisted that the prime minister still had 'enormous credibility and
support in the party'.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Take your pick of English vineyards -
What is on offer for budding vignerons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OMENS are good for grapes on the south-facing slopes of England and
Wales; the darling buds of May set earlier than usual and 1992 could produce
a bumper crop. But, although vines in many parts of England are groaning
under the weight of seven or more tons to the acre, compared with the usual
two or three, it remains to be seen whether 1992 will be a vintage year.
Many vineyards are feeling the pinch, with stocks left over from last year.
The public's perception of English wine is, alas, as fickle as the climate.
But the welcome renaissance of viticulture continues apace and this summer
saw the sale of the vineyard that started it: Hambledon, birthplace of
English cricket and, in 1951, site of the first new vineyard since the first
world war.
There are now 440 commercial vineyards in England and Wales, plus hundreds
of hobby enterprises.
Not that there is anything new about English wine. The Romans made it, even
up near Hadrian's wall; and more than 400 vineyards were recorded in the
Domesday survey.
It is a sign of the growing importance (and quantity) of English wine that
this year sees the introduction of a quality testing scheme. Only those
passing a stern examination will receive the 'quality wine PSR' (produced in
specified region) label.
Hambledon vineyard was established in 1951 by Sir Guy Salisbury Jones, the
father of modern English wine. It was sold six years ago to John Patterson,
of Dateline International, who increased the planting from seven to 15
acres. All the vines are French varieties including Chardonnay, Seyval Blanc
(the most a successful variety yet grown in the UK), Pinot Noir and Pinot
Meunier. Production in a good year should exceed 50,000 bottles.
Patterson recently put Hambledon on the market again. The estate has a main
house with seven bedrooms, a second house and a cottage, plus the vineyard
and winery, covering 19 acres in all.
It caught the eye of Canadians Margaret and James Rock who were renting a
house nearby. They had already fallen in love with the village; now, they
have decided to buy the estate, paying close to the Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
guide of Pounds 750,000.
Close to Kingsbridge, in south Devon, Loddiswell vineyard attracts 15,000
visitors every year to its 14 acres. The vines produce about 17,000 bottles
of wine annually and facilities include a tea room, children's playground
and picnic park.
Owners Reg and Betty Sampson have devoted the past 15 years to establishing
and developing the vineyard and are now calling it a day. This beautiful
corner of the South Hams is being offered by Luscombe Maye for Pounds
495,000.
Theobald's Westbury vineyard, in Wiltshire, which covers about 16 acres, is
also up for sale. It is part of a 180-acre farm that also has three lakes.
The land, gravel over chalk, is perfect for viticulture. More than 20
different wines are produced there, all surely better than that made by the
Romans at Tidmarsh, just one mile away. Savills is selling the house, farm
and vineyard, suggesting a price of around Pounds 650,000.
Finally, in Saffron Walden, Essex, a Victorian house called The Vineyard and
five acres are for sale. Hamptons says there are no grapes there now, but
its location, on Windmill Hill facing south, indicates that it must at one
time have supported vines.
The house has been on the market for a year or so and the original guide
price of Pounds 1m has been reduced to Pounds 795,000.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: For sale, lives of loneliness -
Solitary souls might like a taste of island life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TAKES a very special type of person to carve a life on an island.
Resourcefulness is the prime requirement as I discovered when last visiting
Ramsey, 625 acres off St David's Head, west Wales, more than 11 years ago.
There I met the sole inhabitant, 19-year-old Tom Sutton, whose daily routine
included collecting driftwood for the fire, mending the radio or generator,
treating a goat for mastitis and nursing an injured peregrine.
On Ramsey, as with all small kingdoms, one is both liberated and imprisoned;
I remember Tom telling me that he sometimes dreamed of steak and chips as he
watched the lights of the mainland during long winter evenings; but he just
turned up the volume on his Gilbert and Sullivan records and got on with the
chores.
The island is now for sale again. Tom does not live there any more but he
still takes control of the bird counts, including the chough and that
harbinger of spring, the wheatear.
Ramsey's sole inhabitant for much of the year is Sue Ward, whose grown-up
family lives on the mainland across the treacherous Ramsey sound where tidal
currents are so strong that white water boils around and over the sharp
pinnacles of rock known locally as The Bitches.
Ramsey is one of a host of islands that have come on to the market. Many are
off the Scottish coast, where islanders sow and reap according to the
season, their daily lives ordered by the sun.
Islands are cheap today, although not quite the bargains they seemed before
the second world war when places such as Tanera Mhor, the largest of the
wild and beautiful Summer Isles near Ullapool, changed hands for Pounds 1 an
acre.
Today, both Ramsey and the 800-acre Tanera Mhor can be bought for
considerably less than Pounds 1,000 an acre. Both have solid, comfortable
houses and good outbuildings.
Humberts has invited offers of Pounds 550,000 for Ramsey and Savills, which
has been seeking a buyer for Tanera Mhor for more than three years, has
reduced the guide price from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 450,000 (there is a
rental income from a fishing enterprise of Pounds 45,000 a year).
As usual, the sale of an island generates many inquiries; several parties
have expressed interest in Ramsay and a sale is expected soon.
Savills reported considerable interest in the 3,400-acre Scottish isle of
Gigha (pronounced Ghia), for which offers of more than Pounds 2m were being
sought. In 1989, I flew there by helicopter, skimming across Arran and the
Kintyre peninsular to land in the middle of Sir James Horlick's rhododendron
garden.
Some of the 160 inhabitants have never felt the need to leave the island;
most have several jobs, including Seamus McSporran whose 14 include postman,
fireman, harbour master, policeman and undertaker.
Gigha - which has a tiny satellite, Cara, populated only by otters, seals,
wild goats and birds - has six farms, a fish farm, an award-winning hotel
(closed at present) and a small golf course. The buyer also inherits a
baronial title.
Step forward Derek Holt and his wife who have just paid the asking price to
the owner, the Interallianz Bank of Zurich. The Holts own Holt Leisure Parks
based in Greenock, near Glasgow. Their daughter and her husband - both with
tourism and farming experience - will live with their baby in Achamore
House, the island's main residence.
A new career awaits whoever chooses to live on Arran, 'the peaked island'
off the Ayrshire coast dominated by Goat Fell. In a tranquil, wooded valley
beside a rushing stream, Ronald Stewart and his wife, Barbara, built a
splendid business at the Lagg hotel. Now they have new plans and the hotel
and its 15 acres, plus consent for 10 four-bedroom houses, is being offered
through Glasgow solicitor Turner MacFarlane Green, with a guide price of
Pounds 550,000.
Still in the Western Isles, Strutt and Parker is selling most of Rona's
1,600 acres of rugged and beautiful land; only 142 acres owned by the
Defence Research Agency is not included. The guide price for this little
kingdom, between Skye and the mainland, is just Pounds 200,000.
One of the most beautiful of all islands is Garinish, 57 acres in the
Kenmare estuary off Ireland's County Kerry. The island and its six-bedroom
house, plus 30 acres and a pier on the mainland, are being offered by Knight
Frank and Rutley with Dominic Daly of Cork; the guide price is IPounds 1.2m.
Knight Frank and Rutley also is seeking a buyer for Lihou, the smallest
inhabited Channel Island off the coast of Guernsey. The guide price is
Pounds 850,000.
Across in Alderney, also famed for its wild flowers and colonies of gannets,
John D. Wood is selling the home of John Arlott, the late cricket
commentator. The house is chiefly 19th century, bounded by a high wall
giving shelter and privacy. The guide price is Pounds 650,000.
Other islands for sale include Spit Sand fort, one of four built in the
Solent in the 1860s to defend Portsmouth. The fort, with 15 ft walls, 50
rooms and a maze of passages, was offered for Pounds 675,000 last summer;
Humberts says it will consider any reasonable offer.
Friday island, on the Thames, is offered by Hamptons. Just downstream from
Old Windsor lock. There is a little cottage there, but some work is
required. The price was reduced recently to Pounds 125,000.
Osea island, in the Blackwater estuary, near Maldon, Essex, was bought in
1906 by Frederick Charrington, of brewery fame, after he saw a young mother
pleading with her drunken husband for money to feed their children.
Charrington set up a temperance community on the mile-long island.
The house and chapel has been converted into five houses and seven flats.
Savills offers them for between Pounds 57,000 and Pounds 140,000, with the
assurance that new owners can drink without let or hindrance.

WHAT joy the old roundels at Kent's oast kilns must have given returning
soldiers after distant campaigns. Together with ancient smock windmills,
they symbolised the tranquillity and continuity of the English countryside,
writes David Hoppit.
But east Londoners no longer go to Kent at picking time. Neither do
labourers toil in the dusty kilns, drying the fragrant cones that flavour
the very beer that once quenched their thirst after evensong.
Most roundels are now houses despite their shape, which makes furnishing
difficult and such things as radiators hard to fix. Conversion is not easy,
though: none was built with a damp course and installing windows is tricky.
Moreover, local authorities (quite rightly) insist upon retaining and
restoring the lucarne (hoist) and the huge dunce's-cap cowls, some 10ft
high, atop the circular roofs of tapered tiles. But painting them is no
problem: Kent authorities have decreed that any colour is acceptable so long
as it is white.
Most of the roundels of Kent and Sussex were built between 1850 and 1900,
owners believing them to retain heat better than the traditional square
kilns. But the south-east did not have a monopoly on them. Worcestershire
has many hop gardens and cider orchards, and the co-operative kiln at
Suckley, not far from Leominster, was still being operated early in the
1960s.
Now, it has been converted into a large house with the ground floor used for
business purposes. Altogether, there is 11,000 sq ft of floor area and the
gardens of nearly an acre have views of the Malvern hills. Agent Andrew
Grant (0905-24477) suggests a price in the region of Pounds 365,000.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Great houses, even better prices -
Top-range homes, whether London penthouse or country retreat, are
historically 'cheap'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE has never been a better time to pick up bargains in the property
market. At best, UK homes are worth some 5 per cent less than they were a
year ago - and much less than they were three years ago. This is depressing
news for property-owners with large mortgages, but it is extremely
encouraging for any would be buyers unencumbered by a property bought in the
late-80s.
In counties such as Devon, some property is changing hands at about half
1989 values. Distress sales, coupled with a general loss of confidence and
fears of redundancy, are to blame. Both estate agents and builders of new
homes are cursing building society valuers, most of whom are down-valuing
everything from semi-detached houses to castles and basing their judgment on
forced sales and repossessions.
While there is good value to be found at every level of the market, it seems
the bigger the house the bigger the bargain; castles and great houses are
relatively cheap today. Take, for instance, Heveningham Hall, in Suffolk.
Just to build it, were such a task possible, would cost more than three
times the Pounds 4.5m asking price - and that excludes the value of
outbuildings and the Capability Brown estate.
The floor area of the mansion is more than 30,000 sq ft. If you estimate
Pounds 500 a sq ft as the cost of rebuilding, you would be getting Pounds
15m worth of mansion for your money.
Herstmonceux Castle, the moated Sussex mansion that housed the Royal
Greenwich Observatory until four years ago, is on the market again. The
castle has nearly 50,000 sq ft of floor area. There are also farms, offices,
lodges and the domed equatorial telescope buildings so beloved of Patrick
Moore and other astronomers, who tried to buy them three years ago.
Two years ago, Ian Tegg's company, James Developments, paid well in excess
of Pounds 20m for the castle; now, according to Strutt and Parker with
Savills, it could be yours for a quarter of that.
So, who is in the market for these great houses? Geoffrey van Cutsem, of
Savills, says: 'There are overseas buyers around, from the Pacific basin,
some Scandinavians and a few Americans - art patrons who want somewhere to
show their collections. There are multi-national corporations who may see
the house as the perfect place for business entertaining.
'Then again, in the case of Heveningham, there might be some form of
heritage solution whereby the government might give tacit support to some
money-raising scheme to keep the house for the nation. It is in good order
and there is bound to be some way of producing an income from it, perhaps
with corporate hospitality such as that provided by Broadland Property at
Hever Castle.'
In London, only the very best property is attracting wealthy buyers.
According to Tony Lassman, of Lassmans, clients from Europe (especially
Italy and Scandinavia) and the Middle East will spend money only if the
house is special - say, something like a Nash terrace in Regent's Park or
perhaps a Mayfair property. It must, of course, have accommodation for the
butler.
If the property is in a prime location, there are wealthy individuals
willing to pay big money. John D. Wood and Savills have just sold Foliejon,
a mansion with 550 acres on the edge of Windsor Great Park, west of London.
The guide price was Pounds 12m, realistic a year ago in view of the Pounds
15m thought to have been paid for nearby Ascot Place and its 370 acres.
Knight Frank and Rutley introduced the Foliejon buyer, said to be an
international businessman who is planning to use it as a family home. But
the sum paid is rumoured to be not much more than half the guide price.
Several parties viewed the Grade II mansion and its estate, which is just 20
minutes from Heathrow airport. Among them were Middle Eastern families, one
or two wealthy Britons, and an English consortium representing a US client
who wanted to build two or more golf courses on the estate.
Most planned to demolish the 20,000 sq ft of laboratories adjacent to the
house which were built by the previous owners. But the new owner could have
a bargain on his hands because consents have now been given for a golf
course and converting the mansion into a club-house.
In central London, several houses sold for prices above Pounds 1,000 a sq ft
in the peak years of the late 1980s. If the property is exceptional, it
could still realise such a price, although a more realistic figure is Pounds
600.
Lassman recently sold what he described as the 'flagship of the Grosvenor
estate' - a large, first-floor flat with balconies on the north side of
Eaton Square, Belgravia. The price worked out at nearly Pounds 1,250 a sq ft
even though the lease had only about 20 years left. The company also sold
Ionic Villa in Regent's Park for the Crown Estates and that, too,
represented more than Pounds 1,000 a sq ft.
Flats at the Kensington Palace Green development by Regalian, which includes
a Pounds 13m penthouse, were being offered at more than Pounds 1,500 a sq ft
but prices have been reduced considerably.
All these figures make Belgravia's 22 Wilton Crescent sound positively
cheap. Built in the 1820s by Thomas Cubitt, and used in recent years by the
French consulate, the house has been painstakingly restored.
Solland Properties had the property - in one of the capital's finest Regency
stone-fronted crescents - gutted completely; at one time, only the facade
and party walls remained standing. Now, the finished product would appeal to
the most fastidious viewer. John C. Vaughan, who is joint agent with
Savills, says the house has a floor area of around 8,000 sq ft. The price of
the 44-year lease is Pounds 4.85m, or about Pounds 600 a sq ft, and that
includes most furnishings.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Private View: How Beauty was defiled by the Nazi Beast -
Film-maker Leni Riefenstahl was the darling of Hitler and Goebbels. She is
still trying to explain why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS the woman Hitler embraced on the beach one night in 1932, and at
whose feet Goebbels grovelled with unrequited lust. Here is the girl who
danced for Max Reinhardt, the film actress who drove men to the verge of
suicide, who got Marlene Dietrich her role in The Blue Angel, and whose
talent secured her one triumph after another . . . until her illusions and
career were shattered by war.
Leni Riefenstahl, one of the cinema's greatest documentarists, this week
published the English edition* of her memoirs, five years after their debut
in Germany.
Visually inspired she may be, but one reads her written testament - nearly
700 pages - with mounting incredulity. The style is breathlessly banal, the
narrative self-obsessed, the vision monocular. Even the hairsbreadth escapes
 -Leni falling off mountains and ice floes, her flying accidents, her car
crash - read like fiction. Her publisher's choice of title, The Sieve of
Time, seems cruelly appropriate.
Leni Riefenstahl, harried and maligned even after the Allies exculpated her
of any complicity in Nazi crimes, emerges on paper as her own worst
advocate. In person, now 90, she is much more plausible but no less
startling. She was wearing skintight black leggings and a blue shirt with
gemstone buttons. She dabbed at her lips with a handkerchief. She looked
nervous and frail.
But Riefenstahl is no poor old lady. She had just returned from a diving
trip to the Maldives with her long-standing boyfriend, Horst Kettner. He is
40 years her junior.
Persuaded it was safe to be left alone with me, Riefenstahl, in poor but
adequate English, became passionate and confiding. Occasionally she extended
a bony finger to tap a point home. But what she confided was what she has
been saying for nearly 47 years.
I commented that the book read like a protracted defence.
'Naturally. It must be a defence. I have to do this. But that was not the
reason I wrote it. The reason was that I can't inform hundreds of
journalists about my life. Now I can say to them 'read my memoirs''.
Did you not write it also to explain your life to yourself?
'No. I had only one idea. I had to write the truth. What really happened. I
am not a good writer. My gift is my eyes, the picture, film. I hated
writing. I wanted to explain my feelings and the difficulties I have had.
Because of the attacks after the war I was not able to make films and that
was so hard for me, because my life is in my art. If you take a fish from
the water and put it in the sand, the fish can't die and he can't live. It
was so hard. What I read after the war about me - none of it was Leni
Riefenstahl. It was a different person.'
Did you not discover a different view of your past?
'I don't think so. How can I change my opinion? People and journalists say
'She won't say she's guilty.' But, please, what have I done that is bad?
Tell me what I have done]'
You could be accused of being very naive.
'No. I don't think that I am naive. The only thing to make clear was at the
beginning one admired Hitler, yes? But I have admired him along with
millions of others. How am I guilty and the others not? That is one thing.
For this I can't say I am guilty, because all around me were enthusiastic.'
I thought of her frequent meetings, public and private, with Hitler,
Goebbels and other Nazi henchmen. Wasn't she different?
'Look,' she interrupted. 'The second thing is only my film, The Triumph of
the Will. There were not even any Jewish laws at this time. In my film there
was not one word of Nazi ideology, only the documentary pictures of what
happened. Nothing was said against Jewish people.'
I had seen Triumph of the Will, her film of the 1934 Nuremberg rally.
Cinematically, it is stunning, and it led to her equally stunning record of
the Berlin Olympics two years later.
Riefenstahl says she made Triumph, her two other films of rallies, and even
Olympia, under duress. But to claim that Triumph is neither political nor
propagandist is so brazen as to be absurd. The film is a passionate,
unremitting distillation of the Nazis' mawkish, brutal, supremacist fantasy.
I remembered, too, her account of Hitler coming to tea and flipping through
her copy of Mein Kampf with her critical notes in its margins.
But you had read Mein Kampf, I said.
'Ja. But not the whole book; only some chapters before '32.'
So you knew what Hitler's ideas were?
'Yes, but, look. I will tell you. Only people who have lived in this time
are able to understand the time. Because Germany was so poor, so lost, all
its people unhappy, six million without work and hungry on the street. I
didn't admire Hitler for his ideas; no, it was only for his social policies.
It was as if someone in England promised . . .'
Yes, I understand. But you say yourself you realised Hitler could be
dangerous.
'I was not sure.'
I'm not passing judgment, Frau Riefenstahl. I want to know whether now, at
90, you think you made a mistake in approaching Hitler, in writing that
letter to him.
'Why? I was very happy to meet him. I was in the beginning like other people
impressed by him. How can I change my feelings? If I would say now I am
guilty, I am unhappy, I made mistakes, then I would be a liar.
'All people in Germany say: 'Nobody was a Nazi. Nobody did like this (she
half-raised her arm in the Nazi salute). I was never there, I was against
Hitler.' I am one of the rare people who has the courage to say the truth.
And I think that is important. It is better than lying.
'It would have been better for me to say I was guilty, that I made a
mistake. Then I would have no problems now. But why I don't say this is
because it is not true. I didn't think for one moment that he would do the
things he did later against the Jewish people and so on.'
You suffered a lot after the war because of your association with top Nazis.
'Naturally.'
And you have been suffering until . . . I don't know when you will be free
of this.
'I will never be free. Never, in my life. Because I can't understand why
they want people to say what is not true.'
I suggested that, like Marlene Dietrich, she could have gone to America.
Riefenstahl corrected me. Dietrich had to go to the US for her career and
denounced the Nazis from there because she had been better informed of the
truth by her circle.
Riefenstahl's own Jewish friends - they loyally defended her later - had
initially been impressed by Hitler and advised her not to leave Germany, she
said.
You could have followed your instinct and kept away from these men.
'But it was too late.'
Riefenstahl did not join the Party, for, as she reports telling Hitler to
his face, she disliked his racism. According to her book, she lived 'as if
inside an egg'. So consumed was she by her art, she read nothing in the
papers, heard nothing on the radio - and there was no TV. The outbreak of
war took her by surprise.
The interview was turning into a fruitless interrogation, so I asked about
her art. You love physical beauty, I suggested.
She saw a trap. 'Beauty, not physical beauty,' she corrected. 'People say I
made my Olympic athletes so beautiful. I am not God. They were like that.'
When you were a girl, you loved fairy tales. Your films also have this air
of fantasy.
'You are right. It was very hard for me to adapt to reality. Then my world
was the dance. Nothing else existed for me.'
When I her asked her why she did not portray poverty or ugliness, she
replied that her films were a way of saying Yes to life. 'Poor people, ugly
people or sick people need hope, films that are positive. I think for an
artist it's much more difficult to make a good positive film than to make a
good negative one.'
Did Hitler share your ideal of beauty?
'Not one little bit.'
We discussed men. You've had many lovers, I said.
'Many? Not so much.' She laughed.
They were passionate affairs but often you were betrayed. Why?
'My profession. To make these very difficult films, to work 18 hours in the
cutting room, I had no private life. My life, my work, was always very very
hard. The men I loved wanted to sleep with me and I had to work.'
I thought of Goebbels' seduction attempts. Did you like Goebbels?
'Ugh] Never. From the first moment not. He hated me. If he spoke well of my
films, that is a different thing. But he hated me because I didn't love him,
didn't like him and he was jealous that Hitler liked me.'
After the war Riefenstahl was arrested, interrogated and freed. But her
career was blighted and she spent years fighting libel actions. Among the
accusations hurled at her were that she had witnessed a massacre of Jews in
Poland, that she used concentration camp inmates for her film Tiefland, that
she danced naked at the Berchtesgaden, that she was Hitler's mistress. All
this she sets down in the book.
Shunned in Germany, boycotted almost everywhere, she found refuge and
affection with a remote Sudanese tribe, the Nuba, whose primitive innocence
and naked rituals she has photographed. 'My Nuba', she calls them.
When I suggested that she never really understood other people she thought I
was accusing her of lacking sympathy for the poor. Then she declared: 'I
understand my enemies. I am not surprised. I understand that the Jews hate
me. The problem is they don't see the difference between the ideas of Hitler
and Leni Riefenstahl, and they are absolutely contraire.'
You had everything a woman could want, I said. Beauty, brains, artistic
sense, energy, discipline. (Riefenstahl smiled with pleasure). What are your
faults, do you think?
'Maybe I am too much of a perfectionist. And I am too concentrated on one
thing . . . egocentric. My desire to make a new work. Not to have success,
that's not so important. Money is not interesting.'
I asked her directly if she was not ashamed of her fascination with Hitler.
'It was a mistake]' Finally she had said it. 'Looking back I must say this,
but I can't say it was not true. It was a mistake and it disturbed my life.
It has disturbed my life.
'It is the story of my film The Blue Light. Junta (the heroine) loves the
blue light: it is like an ideal. Leni thought Hitler was an ideal. She
thought he was a good man who was bringing peace and then, like Junta, she
saw it was wrong. Junta dies. It is the same for me. This is my destiny.'
Every word of her memoirs may be literally true, down to the verbatim
reports of Hitler's conversations. And yet . . . something seems to have
slipped through the sieve of time. It is as if there is another Leni
Riefenstahl whom she is unable to face yet whom she must take with her,
resolutely, to the grave.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF YOU ask me, the wrong man jumped this week. David Mellor, Britain's
tousled Minister for Fun, resigned on Thursday - victim of the smutty and
vindictive malcontents who run the tabloid press - whereas John Major and
Norman Lamont, who have created a black hole where economic policy used to
be, did not. Mellor's behaviour - adultery and whatnot - was a tad
simple-minded. But it was definitely none of our business: not yours, mine,
or the smutties'. He should have stayed at his desk. His hounding diminishes
all of us.
Conversely, Major and Lamont, whose insouciance seems to soar the faster
they steer their craft into the heart of the black hole, are still in
business, still making totally useless decisions as they squirm from one
debacle to the next. It's a funny old world.
But help is close at hand. Their lives are being remodelled.
I was on holiday last week. Majorca, as it happens. In a villa above
Pollensa. Swimming pool. Gardens. A maid who called in daily. Among
Pollensa's attractions is the Restaurant Clivia on Avinguda Pollentia
(proprietors: Domingo y Joaquin) which I love like life itself. I was there
on Sunday evening, dining with Miss Lee, my executive assistant, when who
should sweep up to us but my good friend Wayne Talent. He was wearing an
aubergine suit with a carnation in each buttonhole, while his startling
array of caps (Harley Street: Pounds 18,000) caused glints of polar light to
flicker around our table in dramatic and eerie fashion.
'Thought I'd find you here,' said this aubergine apparition. 'Street guy
like you, knows where it's buttered.'
He barely glanced at Miss Lee. Wayne is the younger brother of Keith Talent,
the Notting Hill racketeer of Martin Amis's London Fields. Keith is still in
prison. Wayne, for his part, claims never to have heard of Amis or his
novels - 'sounds like a plonker' - though he keeps in touch with Keith.
Wayne is a friend of Dorothy's: 28-ish, gaunt, street-wise - rich. Quite
extravagantly rich. Money just sticks to him. Like most of the rich I know,
including numerous sheikhs, Wayne is using the present hiatus in the global
economy to buy assets at bargain prices, mainly property and art. 'Goya,
Luti, Clave, Hockney, Borofsky, porcelain, carpets, jewellery - anything at
all, Mike - Rollers, racehorses, stud farms, watermills. Stands to reason,
dunnit? Rock-bottom prices. Time to make a killing. You can't beat basic
assets.'
'Is that why you're in Majorca?'
'Only briefly, Mike. I own a few farms here. Also three hotels. I could let
you have a farm, Mike, rustic on the outside, gold taps inside. The sort of
thing you like, Mike, street guy like you, wasn't born in a stationery
cupboard. The peseta's ducking and diving. Time to plunge in, Mike. Call it
fifty thou.'
'Fifty thousand sterling?'
'Sterling would be all right.'
'But the markets are quaking and heaving.'
'Don't worry about the markets. All you have to do is watch your basic asset
prices indexed in Swiss francs. I'll give you a ready reckoner. It's how the
rich stay rich.'
'But what about John and Norman? Won't they be the ruin of us?'
'Remember what I told you, Mike, just before the election. I asked you what
the difference was between Tories, Labour, Liberals. I said: 'The only
difference between them, Mike, is 175 Footsie points, maybe 200 - peanuts,
cashew nuts.' On the other hand, Major and Lamont have clearly got to go.
That's what I've been fixing, me and various sheikhs, plus the Palma
authorities.
'Here's how the deal looks. We'll give you a farmhouse here, though we'll
show it on the books as a sale at fifty thou. We'll include some Goya
etchings, plus a Hockney and a Roller. And we'll throw in a couple of staff
 -a gardener and a handyman. They'll have authentic Spanish passports, fresh
sets of fingerprints - completely new identities.
'They'll live in a little cottage by the side of your farmhouse and will
work from morn to night. They'll be called Gabriel and Sebastian. Gabriel
wears glasses and likes to watch cricket. Sebastian has funny hair. You will
keep an eye on them. If they try to run away, shoot them with a shotgun. But
we're not expecting trouble. From what we all know of them, they'll be happy
to hoe and plough until there is nothing left but dust.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / An uncivilised, unpleasant degree of hypocrisy: David Mellor
is the victim of cant and envy from MPs and the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A CERTAIN amount of hypocrisy is necessary in any civilised society,'
pronounced the writer Michael Wharton in his autobiography published - to
insufficient acclaim - last year. Wharton - better known as the Daily
Telegraph columnist Peter Simple - is undoubtedly right. However the key to
Wharton's wisdom lies in the qualifying phrase 'a certain amount'. A
generous amount of hypocrisy is certainly not necessary to any civilised
society and in the case of David Mellor we have endured an excessive amount
of hypocrisy.
I am not sure how the former Secretary of State for National Heritage felt
in the House of Commons yesterday as his colleagues on the Tory back benches
hear-heared in sympathy. I should have felt nauseated, knowing that the same
voices in less public rooms in the Palace of Westminster had sounded the
death-knell of my ministerial career.
There will be a lot of muttering among Conservative MPs in the next few days
about how a good man was bought down by the tabloid press. That is
double-barrelled Home Counties cant. If a large number of Tory backwoodsmen
had not, of, their own volition, decided that the parvenu ex-grammar
schoolboy from Dorset should go, he would not have gone.
This is not to say that the press itself is free of hypocrisy in the sad
case of David Mellor. As has been written elsewhere there are some
journalists who have managed happily to combine a highly colourful lifestyle
with a very demanding job, and who have nonetheless found it quite
impossible to concede that Mellor should be allowed to share the same
combination of private and public pleasures. Then there are those who have
not enjoyed such a potent mixture of experiences. This is envy, rather than
hypocrisy, and much the worse for that.
In so far as the affair with the actress was concerned, it was completely
self-serving for the newspapers, either tabloid or broadsheet, to pretend
that the matter was one of public interest.
It was claimed by the newspaper which broke the story that the public
interest consisted in the fact that Mellor was unable to do his job
properly. That could only have been demonstrated by an analysis of his
output as a minister.
Tape-recorded conversations of lovers' conversations demonstrate nothing
except possibly a man's suitability as a lover. It must, I suppose, be
stated wearily yet again that the overriding motive of the down-market
tabloid press was to see which could titillate its readers the most as part
of a brutal circulation war in a declining market.
Then there is the question of Mellor's free holiday , or rather the free
holiday of the Mellor family. The allegation of the newspapers is that
Mellor had somehow been 'bought', that he would in some unspecified way have
returned some ministerial favour to the provider of the holiday.
Do you ever wonder why the travel sections of the newspapers are always so
full of uncritical crooning descriptions of exotic holidays which few can
afford? Because the journalist, and sometimes his immediate family, has been
paid for by the travel company involved.
This is absolutely common practice among our national newspapers. Indeed I
would not be overwhelmed with surprise if it turned out that one or two of
the leader writers who condemned Mellor for his free holiday, had in the
past, themselves been the recipient of one of these professional gifts. The
only difference is that Mellor did not subsequently take the opportunity to
write that others should consider going to the same place for their holiday,
and but pay for it.
But my gold award for hypocrisy must go to Bryan Gould, who rejoices in the
title of Shadow Heritage secretary. On Wednesday Gould pronounced that
Mellor was a disgrace to his office and should be dismissed. On Thursday,
once his wish had been granted, Gould sanctimoniously declared that Mellor
was a great loss to his ministry and would be impossible adequately to
replace.
A certain amount of hypocrisy is indeed necessary in any civilised society.
But how much is necessary to render society uncivilised?

FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: After Columbus - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLUMBUS's Atlantic crossing is being treated politically, romantically and
imaginatively, but nowhere quite so inimically as in the World Service's
six-week series, The Invaders' Legacy. Presenters Ruth Hogarth and Phil
Gunson have visited six South American nations, and hated all of them.
This week they told about the Cerro Rico, the 'rich hill', at Potosi in
Bolivia. It is said you could build a bridge from Potosi to Spain with the
silver mined from Cerro Rico. It is also said you could build the bridge
with the bones of the peasants that died there, and indeed they still work a
week of six 12-hour days. Modern open-cast techniques could improve things,
but they are excluded, for the hill shelters Potosi from the cold North
winds. The Bolivian government says that colonialism is ended, but
legislation favours the middle-classes, never the peasants. Tomorrow's
programme deals with Colombia, a nation of drug-dealers, left-wing
guerrillas and opposing paramilitaries. The President's new constitution
aims at halting the violence, even at helping the peasants, of whom 25 per
cent live below the poverty line.
Half-hour visits to troubled nations can be interesting even if inadequate.
We have had the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Mexico, and next week will
end with Peru. At least it was Pizarro, not Columbus, that overthrew
Atahualpa and the Incas. The Radio Times will help you find the World
Service in the current issue, a service it offers only once a month.
A happier anniversary is Alfred Tennyson's, who died in 1892, and is
generously remembered by Radio 3. On Monday there was a recorded
introductory talk by the late Sir John Betjeman, and some splendid readings.
Dame Peggy Ashcroft gave us the whole of The Lady of Shalott, and In
Memoriam was shared between C. Day Lewis, Robert Donat and Sir John Gielgud.
It is the fashion in some quarters to belittle Tennyson; but spoken so
beautifully, many lines displayed a golden touch.
Radio 3's Sunday Play was Eduardo da Filippo's Napoli Milionaria, a
sentimental look at wartime Naples, revised into Northern English by Peter
Tinniswood for the RNT. Richard Eyre's stage production was directed for the
radio by Jeremy Howe. Sir Ian McKellen was the contented Gennaro, who
mid-war left his family for a while and returned to find his elder daughter
pregnant by an American, his younger daughter fatally ill, his son a thief,
his wife unfaithful. He did well under his disguise, Francis Barber too as
his wife Amalia. The radio script by Chris Barton was long and repetitious.
The most enjoyable item this week was an interval talk in last Saturday's
Radio 3 relay of Verdi's Force of Destiny. It was about St. Petersburg and
Italy, and its special charm came not only from the close knowledge of the
city's growth under the Tsars, but to the outstandingly pleasant delivery of
the presenter, Svetlana Lloyd - a former Dior model born in Kiev, brought up
in St. Petersburg, and now possessor of the perfect English broadcasting
voice.
The talk glittered with the names of Italian architects, sculptors,
ballerinas and so on, But Svetlana Lloyd may talk on any subject she
chooses, and I shall try to listen.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: Inside Buddhism - Sacred Tibetan art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEET YAMA, Lord of Death, who is a blue, buffalo-headed monster. He prances
on the back of Ignorance, symbolised by a bull raping a dying man. Meet
Diamond Sow, a lady naked except for festoons of jewels and skulls. She is
first seen dancing with the pig's head of Delusion projecting from her
cranium. Later we find her clinched in yab-yum (ecstatic Mother-Father
sexual embrace) with her three-eyed consort, Rakta Yamari. Yab-yumming close
by with the Conqueror of the Lord of Death is Diamond Zomby.
That is a pretty crude introduction to the divine beings represented in a
mere half-dozen of the 160 paintings and sculptures displayed in Wisdom and
Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet at the Royal Academy. Small wonder that
the Europeans who first came across such images concluded that Tibetans were
devil-worshippers.
Small wonder, moreover, if Western, non-Buddhist visitors to this exhibition
succumb to feelings of bewilderment and intimidation long before getting to
grips with the myriad lamas, arhats, sky-walkers, Eight-Armed Wrathful Green
Tara, and tongue-twisting (ours, in this case) Ushnishasitatapattra. Not
that being able to spot who's who in these works of art really hits the mark
either. To take things more seriously means entering into the states of mind
which Tibetan artists meant their creations to instill.
Wisdom and Compassion is more than the most comprehensive exhibition of
Tibetan art ever seen in the West. It is laid out as a guide to the history
and tenets of Tibetan Buddhism, the faith which for almost 1400 years has
animated an extraordinary and now threatened culture. From first to last the
emphasis is on the sacred import of that art, not whether we westerners find
the images aesthetically appealing.
Judged, then, from a purely pragmatic viewpoint, Wisdom and Compassion
offers any person ordinarily curious about the world a quick and relatively
painless introduction to one of the world's four great religions. But even
so, this is that risky enterprise - an art-show which demands effort from
its visitors.
At which point I will come clean. From my first visit I emerged with
feelings of bewilderment verging on panic. What was I going to say to the
FT's readers? Of course, one can always talk in general terms about the
show, about the fact that it is huge affair with loans from private and
public collections all over Europe, the US, and Russia.
Then again, there are the interesting political undertones, even a Hollywood
touch. The exhibition was originated in the US by groups lobbying for Tibet,
most notably the actor Richard Gere, a practising Buddhist and founder of
Tibet House in New York. At the British Museum in 1985, London's last big
show devoted to expounding Buddhism, Tibet's fate was euphemistically
summarised as 'now secularised . . . an autonomous Region of the People's
Republic of China'.
Seven years on and post-Tiananmen Square, Wisdom and Compassion adopts a
sharper tone. The excellent film made by a Tibetan states baldly enough the
facts of China's invasion of Tibet in 1949. Switch on your Acoustiguide
Walkman, and you will hear at the close of the commentary a tribute to the
faith which sustains Tibetans under persecution, and of their longing for
freedom and the return of the Dalai Lama to Lhasa.
I must admit that it was the Acoustiguide which made the difference to my
understanding, and hence enjoyment of, this exceptional show. How helpful,
for example, to be told that one scholar has compared the many different
paths, sects, and orders of Buddhism with airlines using different routes to
reach the same destinations. This is not to slight the heavy (in both
senses) catalogue, but at Pounds 20 it represents pricey enlightenment.
In a large sculpture Vajrapani looks ferocious, but one point made early on,
and repeated, is that in fact he is not, any more than say, an image of St
Michael spearing a dragon. Vajrapani too is a guardian figure, his dynamic
power a reassurance to believers that he will protect them against perils.
And that, surely, is the kind of simple point which starts subtly to alter
our perception of initially disturbing or revolting images.
On one 17th-century tangka (or wall-hanging, designed to be rolled up) we
see Peden Lama, who is the same as the terrifying Shri Devi, the black
goddess of India who is also a Special Protector of Lhasa. Her mule has a
saddlecloth make of her own son's skin. It is worth remembering that
Christian iconography has its horrible images too, like St Bartholomew
holding up his flayed skin.
Mandalas present visually the least interesting, least penetrable aspect of
the show. In a room painted the most intense deep blue three monks from the
Namygal Monastic University at Dharamsala are creating a sand mandala.
Wordlessly they rasp their metal horns, the grains of coloured sand trickle
into a fantastically complex pattern which each holds in his mind. Another
monk stands close by, beside a fantastic wall-hanging like the most
sumptuous tie-rack you have ever seen. He is there to answer your questions.
This exhibition, too, exists to answer questions. It is a noble enterprise,
and takes its part in the long history of western and eastern scholars
struggling to interpret Buddhism in such a way that occidentals will
understand.
But I promise you, with only a modicum of effort it is possible to take
pleasure and amusement from the tales of Milarepa and his fellow saints, and
then come at the end to delight in painted visions of saints in bliss in the
Pure Land of the celestial Shambhala - better known to the bungalow dwellers
of the English south coast as Shangrila.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: Swan Lake or Swan Fake .. - The latest staging of this
perennial favourite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is always Swan Lake. There is, I often think, only Swan Lake. 'Give
them anything', says the box office, 'but call it Swan Lake'. So, of course,
as the resoundingly titled National Ballet of St. Petersburg embarks upon a
regional tour - in a first visit to Britain - its calling card is the
inevitable outbreak of feathered mopery.
I don't know what audiences expect from a company presenting one-night
stands of this celebrated trap for the unwary, but the troupe comes from
Russia, there is Tchaikovsky emerging from the pit and girls in white tutus
on stage exemplifying the hoariest of dance cliches, so probably all's for
the best in the best of balletic worlds.
The idea of Swan Lake as the summum bonum of dance-going is promoted by far
too many companies. The Royal Ballet will open its autumn season with swans;
English National Ballet announces a new staging next year; Northern Ballet
Theatre will show an idiosyncratic version in a forthcoming visit to London.
The result has been, unsurprisingly, to debase and denature a prime example
of Imperial Russian ballet-theatre.
Swan Lake was, and remains, a grand spectacular, demanding massive opera
house forces and the most refined and noble dance-style to sustain it, with,
at its heart, a true ballerina - no-one else will do. The debilitating
nonsense propounded by many ensembles under this title is an affront to the
work itself, and to the ideals of classic ballet which it enshrines. Swan
Lake becomes Swan Fake.
What then of the National Ballet of St. Petersburg, and it offering? The
company was formed in 1947 as the Leningrad Ballet, and embarked upon a
touring existence in the Soviet Union. The dancers are identified in the
programme as being graduates of the Vaganova Academy. The production, by
Viktor Korolkov, director of the troupe, contains elements from the
Mariinsky original, with the usual massive emendations (including that
bloody Jester) owed to Gorsky's Moscow stagings, and the statutory Soviet
happy ending.
It is ballet on short commons, efficient in view of the restricted numbers
of the ensemble, and hideous to look at. Contemporary Russian design for
dance has an affection for lurid colours, skimpy fabrics, and far, far too
much metallic thread: when, in the new Russia, they get around to
drag-queens, this is what they will wear. Oleg Averzhanov's decorations are
lamentable in their flimsiness and rampant improbability. The staging offers
little resistance to this visual inadequacy.
No less dispiriting the music for the evening. The score is performed by the
State Radio Symphony orchestra from St. Petersburg - some 30 musicians who
are amplified so that chamber texture becomes louder without gaining body.
Stanislas Gorkovenko elicited a loving account of the overture, but
thereafter, the need to whip up a musical storm meant that sensitivity was
at a premium.
The ensemble of swans at the Bristol Hippodrome on Tuesday, when I saw the
staging, were well-drilled, and this may count as the chief virtue of an
evening that otherwise looked artistically impoverished, and would have
seemed more so were it not for the presence of artists from the Kirov and
Bolshoy troupes as guest principals. The central role was split between
Nadezhda Pavlova, as Odette, and Lubov Kunakova as Odile, with Alexander
Bogatyrov their Siegfried. Pavlova gave a more touching interpretation -
pure, eloquent line; silken phrasing - than I have ever known from her
before. Kunakova came on stage in the third act as a firework display of
bravura steps - and these were the best Kirov pyrotechnics. Bogatyrov, with
little apparent physical power left, remains a wonderfully believable hero,
noble in bearing, sensitive, and amid the optimistic brouhaha of the court
scenes, seeming a prince indeed.
It is extraordinary, and illuminating, to watch artists of the calibre of
Pavlova, Kunakova, Bogatyrov, in these reduced circumstances. They do not
know how not to perform Swan Lake. The music sounds, and their bodies and
temperaments respond with actions that compel belief in the idea of a great
and beautiful ballet having this title. The dance is clear; the drama
touches us; classic ballet lives. And so, with them, does Swan Lake.
Swan Lake will tour Britain until October 10. The visit is sponsored by KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: Farewell to David Mellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY ARE so many crocodile tears being shed over the departure of David
Mellor, the erstwhile minister for the national heritage? While no one can
defend the way in which he has apparently been hounded from office by gossip
in the tabloid press, it is equally hard to find support for all the sudden
praise that has appeared about his brief sojourn as a cabinet minister.
Mellor knew before the election that he was going to be offered one of the
most interesting new ministries in the Major government. On a plate he was
given the chance to re-define government attitudes to the arts and heritage.
At the most fundamental level, because of his previous experience as chief
secretary at the Treasury, he knew how the rules were applied when it came
to public spending. He could have achieved the impossible and changed the
way the Treasury funded the arts. There is no evidence that he was beginning
to do this.
At a meeting of a prominent arts organisation which was in progress when
Mellor's resignation was announced, a loud cheer went up. Why? Because they
had suffered for too long from a minister who had completely failed to
impress on any level as an arts and heritage minister. He appeared to many
to be a man who relied on a unique combination of arrogance and ignorance.
Since the election he had failed to weld together his civil servants into a
coherent department. He even failed to make a decision about where his
ministry should be located. It was always difficult to get clear answers
from his office and he had a reputation for nearly always being late or
failing to arrive at meetings.
His office has no records of his speeches - they were, we were told,
delivered off the cuff. Certainly the major speech he made at the Royal
Academy Dinner this year was one of the worst speeches that I have ever
heard about the visual arts. It was worse than bad because in tone and
content it showed contempt for the audience of distinguished artists and
curators.
So what did David Mellor achieve as a minister? The answer is nothing. He
was offered remarkable opportunities. Take the European Arts Festival, which
had full Government backing: could anyone say that it had any serious
impact? Mellor had every card in his hand but his activities remained
partial and compromised. It is hard to find convincing evidence that he
established his new ministry on the cultural map in any objective way. His

THE VOLCANO LOVER by Susan Sontag Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 419 pages
FATHERS AND CROWS by William T.  Vollmann Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 990
pages
THE PROMISE OF LIGHT by Paul Watkins Faber Pounds 14.99, 218 pages
IN A time when so many novelists are raiding the history books for subject
matter, you would have hoped that at least Susan Sontag, a writer
unsurpassed at tackling the major cultural questions of our time, would use
a foray into fiction to take an incisive look at the way we live now. No
such luck. Her third novel, The Volcano Lover, is a rich, intelligent,
historical romance that turns out to be little more than a prolonged
meditation on dormant themes.
The novel, set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, tells the story of
Sir William Hamilton, his wife Emma and her lover Lord Nelson. Sir William
is the effete English ambassador to Naples whose main interests lie in
collecting art and studying Mount Vesuvius, active during his tenure in
Italy. After the death of his first wife he marries Emma Hart, a beautiful
yet coarse woman who in turn falls in love with Nelson, fresh from his
victories over Napoleon on the Nile.
I read the book in the hope that at some point it would erupt into
significance, that it would shed the quaint fabric of historical romance to
assume a more timely garb. But Sontag plays it pretty straight throughout,
using her skill to examine the political turmoil, aesthetic obsessions and
emotional dilemmas facing her largely frivolous characters.
It is a lively and erudite read, though nothing distinguishes it from the
glut of other recent novels that seem to grow more out of assiduous research
than any attempt to unravel the tangled knot of our times.
Another writer who has made good use of his library card is William T.
Vollmann. At 32, Vollmann stands as a living reproach to slothful young
writers everywhere, having already published something like 5,000 pages of
fiction. Fathers and Crows is the second in his seven-volume fictional
history of North America. It deals with the French Jesuits' conquest of
Canada and its indigenous population in the 17th century, giving us tales of
a continent's worth of priests, explorers and native people, most
interestingly one Catherine Tekakwitha, an Algonquin convert beatified by
John Paul II in 1980.
There is no doubting that Vollmann has a brain the size of Saskatchewan, and
that he is not afraid to have fun with history. He also possesses a
narrative skill that surfaces on occasion amid the welter of detail. But, in
the end, the book proves too dense a forest for the casual walker to find
his way through. The central narrative is complicated by numerous
geographical and temporal digressions, as well as enough personal and place
names to fill a phone book and an atlas. Strictly for the reader with a
specialist interest in the history of Canada, or those possessing a
Jesuitical temperament.
Another chasteningly productive young writer is 28-year-old Paul Watkins.
His fourth novel, The Promise of Light, is, like his earlier work, a
coming-of-age story cloaked in the guise of an adventure yarn. Set in 1921,
it follows young Ben Sheridan as he travels from his native Rhode Island to
Ireland after learning that the couple who raised him were not his real
parents. As he searches for his true identity he soon finds himself enmeshed
in the horrors of the Civil War, eventually forced to fight with the IRA
against the Black and Tans. As in all Watkins's work, the hero is forced to
undergo a bloody rite of passage before his true nature can be revealed.
Watkins's writing is as terse and lively as ever, employing a precision that
is often cinematic, particularly in the combat scenes. Unfortunately, the
story itself is somewhat predictable and superficial, draining the taut
prose of much of its narrative drive. One gets the feeling both Ben's and
Ireland's searches for selfhood are little more than pegs upon which the
author hangs daring midnight raids and heroic slogs across the bogs. And the
ending is informed more by the ethos of the B-Movie than serious fiction.
Watkins is a talented writer who should perhaps think of changing to a less
frenetic gear.

THE INVADERS by John Rowe Townsend Oxford Pounds 8.95, 221 pages
THE ISLANDERS by John Rowe Townsend Oxford Pounds 8.95, 190 pages
'I've always loved boats and islands. Any boat trip to an island is an
adventure. Every island is magical in its way - some, of course, more
magical than others. And an island is a lovely setting for a story: you can
concentrate so much action, so much emotion, in a small space.'
The veteran children's novelist John Rowe Townsend is of course claiming
imaginative kinship with Robert Louis Stevenson, Jonathan Swift, Daniel
Defoe and other authors of island stories. Townsend's particular island is
an imaginary one, but its geographical location and its physical features -
bleak, treeless, volcanic - help us to locate it somewhere in the south
Atlantic, somewhere, in fact, like Tristan da Cunha.
His first attempt to present the island's history came with The Islanders,
first published in 1981 and reissued as a companion volume this month. That
book described the life of a small, hard-bitten community that followed its
own peculiar customs and traditions, one of which was never to help a
stranger. It ended with the islanders being obliged to reject this age-old
tradition, - and thus learning new truths about themselves.
Now John Rowe Townsend has returned to that same pitiless spot in a sequel
entitled The Invaders, and the task he has now set himself is to describe
what would happen if that same small community, generations on, were to find
itself face to face with some of the problems and challenges of life in the
20th century.
It begins once again with the arrival of a stranger from the Mother Colony,
an orphaned boy who claims kinship with one of the island's families. The
boy's grandfather had described the place to him as a paradise of sorts, but
Cyril finds it a windswept, desolate spot and the inhabitants with whom he
claims kinship unwelcoming. He is obliged to share his first night's
sleeping accommodation with a goat, and to eat fish and potatoes, the
islanders' staple diet, day after wearisome day.
But soon all begins to change - and at a fearful pace. The boy introduces
the islanders to some of the marvels of the present age - including the
wireless set that he has brought with him. And it is thanks to this wireless
that the islanders learn that their time-honoured way of life is soon to be
destroyed forever by invading forces from the nearby Republic of Santa Cruz.
At this point parallels with the Falklands conflict begin to come at us
thick and fast; the dictator of Santa Cruz, Gomez, lays claim to the island
and threatens occupation, a bravura gesture that is intended as much to
impress his enemies at home. The Mother Country sends a garrison, led by the
vociferous Brigadier Culpepper whose head is stuffed with the manners and
vocabulary of the Great War.
But the colonial regime is short-lived. The Mother Country's garrison
withdraws, and the island is soon occupied by a contingent from Santa Cruz.
The island is renamed Gomez, and the Mother Country, surprisingly, seems
quite indifferent to its fate. And throughout all these fearful,
tension-racked months modernity continues to creep up on the inhabitants:
the young people learn rebellion; the old discover what it is to deal with
benign enemies and seeming friends. In short, they learn lessons in politics
and duplicity. The climax comes with the hair's breadth escape of the
Brigadier, his daughter and the remaining islanders as the island's volcano,
long dormant, erupts into destructive life.

THE BUNDESBANK: THE BANK THAT RULES EUROPE by David Marsh Heinemann Pounds
18.99, 354 pages
ONE EVENING in the late 1970s, as a guest of the President of the Berlin
Landeszentralbank, I sat in on a discussion between him and a very senior
trade union official. The argument was whether the money supply target for
the ensuing year should be 3.5 per cent or 4 per cent. The trade unionist
lost, of course. But what struck me was the seriousness of his belief that
the argument mattered: that a half per cent more or less on the target would
affect the wage settlements he would be able to achieve.
One of the many merits of David Marsh's excellent (and wonderfully timely)
book is that it spells out clearly and convincingly the point implicit in
that evening in Berlin: though statutorily independent, the Bundesbank rules
by consent. It is as much an emanation of German attitudes as a controller
of them.
History and a determination not to repeat it have been fundamental. Warned
by the past and deeply conscious of its responsibilities, the Bundesbank has
built itself into legend. Dedication and professionalism have played a large
part in this. The consistent application of rigid dogma has not. In the
Bretton Woods years the Bundesbank fiercely resisted a revaluation of the
deutschmark despite the inflationary consequences of maintaining the parity.
In the 1970s came an intellectual conversion and the preference for an
upward floating mark, a preference partly modified by the experience of the
ERM.
Money supply targets have been important policy tools since 1974. But they
are often over-shot and often over-ridden. Karl Otto Pohl, president of the
Bundesbank from 1980 to 1991, once said a central bank only takes its money
supply targets seriously when seeking excuses for a decision to put up
interest rates. He is known for flippancy, but here is current president
Helmut Schlesinger, the who is not: 'Pragmatic monetarism as accepted in the
Federal Republic must not be confused with adherence to scholarly doctrine.'
Even the Bundesbank's stated target for its fundamental objective - a long
term inflation rate of around 2 per cent - is refreshingly practical and
un-messianic.
The Bundesbank has indeed often been surprised by the extremism and dogma of
British policy, especially on the exchange rate. Both in 1980 and again on
the UK's entry to the ERM, it regarded sterling as seriously over-valued.
The Bundesbank has made itself greater not only than any particular one of
its policies but also than any of the individuals within it. The institution
moulds its leaders, whatever their past. It is nice to learn that within the
Bank they describe as the 'Becket effect' the process whereby the loyalties
of the friends of politicians appointed to the Council are unreservedly
transferred to the Bundesbank.
But the Bank is not homogenous. Dr Schlesinger - serious, didactic, formal -
contrasts sharply with his predecessor Pohl - informal, urbane, amusing and
fond of parading a semi-feigned idleness. Many of the Land Presidents are
card-carrying politicians from different parties. All are strong and
opinionated.
This can lead to fierce arguments which the President, with only one vote,
may find hard to resolve in the direction he wants. And as usual when
collective responsibility enforces a decision against the wishes of a
minority, there is a tendency to use the safety-valve of individual public
utterance.
Marsh is concerned that since the Bundesbank's power rests so heavily on its
reputation, the consequences of a blow to that reputation could be
disproportionately severe. He sees particular dangers in German and European
monetary union.
On German monetary unification, the Bundesbank was not listened to, was
proved right and is now blamed. Kohl seized his political opportunity like a
statesman but undermined his own triumph by major economic miscalculations.
Since 1990 it has been the Government's fiscal policy which has led to the
Bundesbank's interest rate policy.
On plans for European union, the Bundesbank was slow to realise that an
important reason for EMU is to reduce, not strengthen, the power of the
Bundesbank. Now that the Germans are fully alerted, Marsh believes that EMU
is unlikely over the next decade. But he is concerned that geopolitical
pressures on the Bundesbank will grow (we saw some last week) and prove hard
to handle without damage to its standing. That would be a loss for Europe as
well as Germany.
This book deserves a wide readership, both among those who see the
Bundesbank as a dragon which has just brought down St George; and among
those who, as other nostrums fail, reach for an independent central bank to
perform the elusive economic miracle. It would indeed be better if the Bank
of England were independent of the Treasury, but hopes not informed by a
full understanding of the historical, political and institutional context
will again end in tears.

THE HEATHER BLAZING by Colm Toibin Picador Pounds 14.99, 245 pages
THE END OF THE CENTURY AT THE END OF THE WORLD by C K Stead Harvill Pounds
14.99, 220 pages
ENNISCORTHY is a small, unassuming town in south-east Ireland, inland from
the relative metropolis of Wexford. In Colm Tobin's fictional universe,
however, it sits at the very centre of things. In his first novel, The
South, it exerted the main gravitational pull; now it is the hometown and
point of moral reference for the main character of The Heather Blazing -
Eamon Redmond, respected judge in the Irish High Court, devoted husband and
perplexed father.
Redmond struggles to disentangle his past from his present. He is a pillar
of the legal establishment, buoyed up by his respect for the law and the
Irish constitution; every summer he leaves Dublin to return to his roots and
increasingly to worry away at the events that have shaped him. These twin
narratives unfold in parallel. The death of Redmond's mother when he was a
child, the painful final illnesses of his father and uncle, his own climb up
the legal ladder, his marriage, are all counterpointed with the realisations
and reconciliations forced upon him in old age, as he comes to terms with
his daughter when she becomes an unmarried mother and as he faces up to his
life after his wife's death.
Tobn writes with marvellous, cool precision. The quiet desperation of his
characters and the exactness with which he describes their most mundane
activities recalls John McGahern's equally laconic prose. Redmond's survey
of his life is etched against minute descriptions of place; the sea gnaws
constantly at the Wexford coastline, and the houses and farms that framed
Redmond's childhood slip remorselessly down the cliffs. The pulling together
of the threads, the naturalness with which the judge is finally allowed to
make his peace with the world, are achieved with an eloquence that takes one
by surprise with its intensity. In its understated way, Tobn's art as a
novelist is both supremely confident and hugely accomplished.
CK Stead's multi-layered story is a similar interweaving of private and
public, but set against the background of New Zealand politics over the last
quarter century. Its leading players, former lovers and alternate narrators,
are Dan Cooper and Laura Barber, he a former radical and now a Labour
minister, she a former tennis champion and now a mature student working on a
monograph on the shadowy life of a local novelist. They set out on adulthood
at the height of 1960s optimism, and now suffer the disillusions of 1990s
middle age, watching marriages founder and friends slip away.
Stead's burrowings into the minds of his characters and the neat switches of
perspective, from one narrator to another and from one version of past
events to its polar opposite, are the book's strengths; its evocations of
the 1960s, studiedly ironic, are the weakness. At times it seems to be
conceived as an intricate game; distinctions between fact and fantasy,
between the novel itself and the novel Laura begins to write, are
self-consciously blurred. Somehow, though, an awful lot rings true.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: A candle-lit gala and student workshop - Music in
Italy / Palladio provides the venue for Paul Driver while in Ischia David
Murray enjoys opera and exotic plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Euganean Hills lies the little town of Bagnolo di Lonigo, and hard
by, but not so very easy for even a seasoned coach-driver to find, one of
Andrea Palladio's earliest villas, built between 1542 and 1544 for the most
powerful family on the Veneto mainland, the Pisanis. It is not to be
confused with the celebrated, sublimely palatial Pisani residence on the
Brenta Canal at Stra. The Lonigo property is by comparison a bluffly
domestic proposition, a cubical construction with rusticated triple arch
entrance. The River Gua, hedged off, flows past the doorstep.
Alone of Palladian villas, this one has remained with the family for which
it was designed, but until recently has been mouldering in disuse. Now the
present owner, Marchesa Lepri, has seen to an accurate restoration of the
building and the 16th century frescoes (by an unknown artist) which adorn
its fine central sala. The Queen Mother paid a visit there a couple of years
ago, and the public has at last been let in, albeit paying some Pounds 200
for the privilege.
The occasion was a gala concert given in aid of the United Nations' 'Decade
of the Disabled', the second (sponsored by Tamoil) in a series of annual
events under the artistic direction of the violinist Andrea Cappelletti and
named 'The Lost Palaces of Europe' in reference to the public
inaccessibility of its chosen venues. The villa proved difficult of access
in the purely physical sense - no outing, this, for the disabled - but if it
could not quite count as a palace, it certainly offered an image of magical
resplendency, candle-lit as it was in the balmy twilight at the head of a
great sweep of candle-lit lawn. From the point on the lawn at which we had
scramblingly entered, the refurbished, illuminated frescoes were already -
and breathtakingly - visible through the semi-circular 'thermal' window of
the sala.
That room proved to be of more than domestic size and consequence - an
interestingly cruciform and barrel vaulted structure, whose frescoes seen
close-to were charming but no more, and whose acoustics were awkwardly
reverberant. The concert suffered also from poor lighting, except when made
periodically over-bright by the television crews. But the audience was there
as much for the sense of place and the anticipation of a handsome candle-lit
supper as for the concert itself, which, by a familiar law of the gala
event, became something that might almost have been left out.
Nevertheless, it made its plea. The young players, notable for eager
sonorous freshness rather than finesse, of Interpreti Veneziani and their
conductor Paolo Cognolato gave us a brashly arresting Rossini overture - Il
Signor Bruschino - and accompanied Signor Cappelletti in Mozart's A major
concerto, K. 219. He produced a lustrous stream of sound from his 1727
Stradivarius, the instrument's historical interest and great price nicely
fitting in with the tone of the evening. Finally came Domenico Cimarosa's Il
Maestro di Cappella (1791), a little one-act lampoon of the conductor's
role, and effectively the first-ever young person's guide to the orchestra.
Baritone Maurizio Muraro, costumed in brocade, goaded and cajoled his unruly
musicians and skilfully entertained us. Then followed a couple of not too
long speeches - and a shimmering supper.
MORTELLA means 'myrtle', which as a name for the late Sir William Walton's
garden-estate on Ischia is a kind of joke. There is myrtle, along with other
Mediterranean natives - citrus trees heavy with fruit, waves of
bougainvillaea, a secret alley of camellias; but also hibiscus and cactus
and strange Antipodean shrubs, banana-trees and luxuriant palms, eerily
cylindrical trees with bark that feels like living hide. Where paths cross
there are fountains, and down a main artery trickles a slender watercourse,
Alhambra-style.
Amid the heady scents of this densely exotic mondello, one might expect
tropical birds too. Instead there are the distant cries of sopranos in
rehearsal - at least in September, when the Fondazione Walton funds an
intensive master-course for chosen young singers. Lady Walton is no less
intent on making La Mortella a nest for musical development than upon
cultivating her marvellous garden, onward and (especially) upward.
It burgeons from a long chasm in the lava-based ground, rife with
horticultural vitamins. In horizontal terms the acreage is not enormous, but
obliquely it stretches up and up. The Walton house is built into the cliff,
like the more recent Walton museum cum recital-room and the Tea-House;
thence paths ascend toward Sir William's memorial rock, a serene 'Crocodile
Pool' and a topmost pond inhabited by a single, gigantically swollen lotus
plant.
For students and lucky guests there is also a swimming-pool with a matchless
view from a great height - echoing the crater-lake atop the extinct volcano
in the middle distance. The hard-working students need it, for their course
is strenuous. Last year it was devoted to Lieder, especially Hugo Wolf's
Italian Songbook. This year the group was chosen through auditions in
Florence and London to make up a cast of six for Cimarosa's Il matrimonio
segreto.
They were outnumbered by their teachers, led by the producer Colin Graham
and Glyndebourne's distinguished Head of Music Staff, Martin Isepp. While
they were coached rigorously in Italian diction as well as singing,
rehearsals for the Cimarosa proceeded. I watched Graham getting them to
extract the maximum dramatic sense from the recitatives, instead of gabbling
through them. It wasn't exactly a process of discovery, for he told them
repeatedly what their characters were feeling; but it was an object lesson
in faithful, practical attention to the text.
Earlier there was a concert in the gardens which let the young singers show
their paces. It included a performance of Walton's Facade, brightly
conducted by Susanna Pescetti, and declaimed with the utmost verve and
clarity by Lady Walton herself with Graham.
The promising Rossini bass on the course, Antonio Abete, had to sing in a
Parma competition that night; but the singers' complement was made up by a
remarkable new contralto, Anna Maria di Micco. Her confident, impassioned
delivery of a Tancredi aria foretold a brilliant Rossinian future for her.
In Donizetti and two of Roger Steptoe's 'Chinese Lyrics', the soprano Anna
Maria Panzarella sang with as much skill and charm as in the Royal College's
Fille du Regiment this summer.
Also from the RCM, the mezzo Susan Legg was staunch and affecting in Walton
and Jonathan Harvey. The Guildhall's Simon Thorpe, whose English 'Count' in
the Cimarosa was developing nicely, shone in Vaughan Williams (less in
Wagner); Maurizio Dalena, from Bari, displayed a stylish tenor that wants
more variety of colour yet. Maria Angela Spotorno wields not only a
well-formed soprano, but the knowing allure of a much more experienced
performer; we shall see much more of her.
As summer schools go, the one at La Mortella is sui generis, not least
because of its extraordinary setting. The gardens are open to the public
several times a week (ring Ischia 081-986220). Meanwhile, La Mortella's
Matrimonio segreto will have a British performance on October 14, in Lady
Aberdeen's Haddo Hall.

BRITONS: FORGING THE NATION 1707- 1837 by Linda Colley Yale Pounds 19.95,
421 pages
THIS IS a very ambitious book, long awaited by Professor Colley's
colleagues, admirers and friends. It is based on a remarkable range of
scholarship - not archival, for there are few new manuscript sources used in
its making, but her knowledge of printed sources is majestic, especially of
articles, seminar papers and Ph. D. theses. However, almost all post-date
1970; yet the subject of her book - the transformation of England from being
a European power of moderate substance to Great Britain, the greatest
imperial power in the world - has not been neglected since the days of
Macaulay, let alone Lecky and others. But even though Professor Colley's
theme is commonplace, her approach is in many ways very original and novel,
and more often than not carries conviction.
The book consists of eight major essays - Protestants; Profits; Peripheries;
Dominance; Majesty; Womenpower; Manpower and Victories. They are held
together by a kind of chronological structure and by the internal logic of
their subjects. Each chapter could easily be expanded into a book; for,
constrained by space, there are at times there is a sense of elision, of
interesting facets remaining unexplored. The overruling impression of the
book, however, is one of weight and importance. The subjects of these essays
are central to an understanding of the greatest transition in our history.
Professor Colley is right, too, to stress Britain's role as the bastion of a
protestantism that was also xenophobic to a degree. The Pope and all his
works belonged to a world of ignorance, deceit, cruelty and despotism. She
makes great play with Hogarth's print of The Calais Gate. Hogarth's violent
hatred was a common attitude. Indeed, Roman Catholics were anathema to most
English; not surprisingly, the most destructive riots of the 18th century
were those against Catholics: the Gordon of 1780.
This loathing, however, had one benign side effect not mentioned by
Professor Colley - the Jews escaped the fate they usually suffered elsewhere
in Europe, pogroms;. they began to be integrated into English society very
fast in the last decade of the 18th century. A more serious criticism is the
absence of any discussion of the great changes in English protestantism in
the 18th century, both intellectual and structural.
'Protestants' is followed by an admirable chapter on 'Peripheries' -
Scotland mainly, but much wisdom and insight is shown into the career of
John Wilkes (although a surprise to find him in this chapter) and she is
excellent, too, on the struggle for American Independence (I was delighted
to discover that Professor Colley agreed with my view , adumbrated some 20
years ago, that many Americans and Britons viewed the conflict as a civil
war at least until the French intervened). Her treatment of the 1760s and
1770s is quite splendid in this and subsequent chapters, although the very
slight treatment of Ireland creates an uneasiness. It is not enough to say
they never took to 'Britishness.'
Fully into her stride, Professor Colley covers an increasing range of
subjects: sharp vignettes of people and stimulating insights into the
complex nature of patriotic belief and its rationale (or lack of it) gather
pace, yet the whole is varied in quality - 'Womenpower' weak, 'Manpower'
truly excellent, and so on. It is an amazing panorama, a little chaotic at
times, disputable at others, as all bold historical work must be. The
general reader cannot fail to enjoy it and the professional historian will
be stimulated by it.
It is a book of great merit, yet, good as it is, it seems to me to have two
major weaknesses. Economic history, the growth and spread of British wealth,
is largely ignored; referred to certainly but never investigated, yet the
growing patriotic optimism about, and confidence in, Britain's greatness
derives from industrial supremacy as well as military victory. Britain was
in the forefront of industrial technology and that counted.
And, secondly, although there is a short paragraph on the subject, the age
structure of the British population between 1800 - 1820 merits a more
extended treatment. The young men, blazoned with Union Jacks, tattooed on
almost every available inch of skin, who create mayhem every weekend in
Europe or Britain (or the neo-Nazis viciously attacking refugees in Rostock)
are all contained within the age group 17 - 24. At any period patriotism
seems to seize that age group like a fever - and that was the overwhelmingly
dominant age group in late Georgian England when blatant patriotism was more
prevalent than it was to be again for nearly a hundred years. Indeed, the
adolescent population may have been a great factor in forging not only the
British but also the French nation.
Professor Colley's book will stimulate debate as well as research and it
certainly confirms her position as an historian of distinction.

EPSTEIN: ARTIST AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT by Stephen Gardiner Michael Joseph
Pounds 20, 532 pages
STEPHEN Gardiner's new biography of Epstein (1880-1959) is a rich and
monumental history, compressing into the life of this extraordinary,
immensely energetic man a vivid slice of some of this century's most
important social and artistic history.
We begin in New York with Epstein's father, a Polish immigrant who changed
the family name from Barntovsky to Epstein and made his fortune as a
property developer. From sketching the multi-racial characters of the Lower
East Side, Epstein moved to Paris, where he befriended Modigliani, Brancusi
and Picasso, and learned to sculpt. It was the British Museum's Egyptian
collection, which was to inflect Epstein's work with some of its most
ethereal images, which finally made him settle in London. Here he made
friends, with Augustus John, Matthew Smith and TE Hulme, as well as enemies.
Scandal never left him. His first big commission, the Oscar Wilde tomb in
the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, was covered and put under arrest by the
gendarmerie upon its unveiling in 1914. It was Epstein's first encounter
with the philistinism which was to plague his career, leading to regular
defacings of his sculpture, anti-Semitic attacks in the press, even to his
works appearing among the shrunken heads and Siamese twins of a freak show
on Blackpool pier.
Professional jealousies were another discomfort, especially from London's
artistic old guard. Epstein was good but, with typical chutzpah, knew it.
While still in his early thirties he had finished the Wilde tomb; unveiled,
to howls of abuse, his frieze of nude figures on the new BMA building in the
Strand (now Zimbabwe House - the figures were destroyed by the Rhodesian
High Commission in 1936); and was the most sought after avant-garde sculptor
of the day. He was harried mercilessly, not least during the First World War
when opposition in the highest circles to his being exempted from the Front
as a war artist led to his conscription, his desertion, and a nervous
breakdown on Dartmoor.
Gardiner, who knew Epstein in later life, carries on the family feuds with
Eric Gill, with Roger Fry and the Bloomsbury Group, who looked down on this
working-class American Jew and never gave him a good review, and with Henry
Moore who, encouraged by Epstein early on, never returned the compliment and
obstructed many posthumous installations of his works.
Epstein single-mindedly followed his artistic destiny while his personal
life went mad around him. Margaret Dunlop divorced her husband to care for
him. She took in and accepted the human menagerie of models, mistresses and
artist friends which enveloped Epstein wherever he went and which
scandalised polite society as much as his sculptures. His great passions
were first for Meum Lindsell-Stewart, a delicious blonde by whom he had a
daughter, and then Kathleen Garman, who remained his constant companion
throughout his life. Unlike his other models, his love for Kathleen proved
so threatening to his wife, who was slowly dying from heart disease, that
she shot her with a pistol, only for them both to make up and continue with
their menage a trois for the sake of Epstein's genius. He had four children
by Kathleen and one by an unknown woman.
But what of his work? It was a career which took in numerous portraits,
religious works such as the Lazarus now in New College Chapel, Oxford, and
the Saint Michael and the Devil at Coventry Cathedral, the pagan hymn to
life of the Bowater Group in Knightsbridge, the abstract Rock-Drill which
inspired the Vorticist movement of Pound and Wyndham Lewis, and many
remarkable drawings. Why was it that Epstein's work evoked, and still
evokes, such powerful reactions of admiration or disgust? Gardiner is
brilliant at communicating the power and message of Epstein's best work, but
he unhelpfully passes over the work which fails to succeed. There are also
too few photographs to help the reader decide. In other words, this is not
the true critical biography it should be, but it is a unputtable-down,
absorbing tribute to one of the greatest artists of modern times.

Bertrand Russell

BERTRAND RUSSELL: A LIFE by Caroline Moorehead Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20,
572 pages
IN THE 17 years since Ronald Clark's biography of Bertrand Russell, much new
material about Russell has appeared, making a new biography both possible
and desirable. Clark wrote largely about the public Russell; for the private
man Russell's own story had to be accepted. Now Caroline Moorehead has given
us a marvellously revealing new portrait of Russell which takes us deep into
his personal life.
Russell was a Victorian aristocratic inhabiting the 20th century. He was the
grandson of a Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, and was raised and
privately educated in the austere atmosphere of his grandparents' house. In
1890, aged 18, he went to study mathematics and philosophy at Cambridge.
There he experienced for the first time the exhilaration of intellectual
companionship and personal freedom.
So began an extraordinary career. It lasted until Russell's death in 1970 at
the age of 97 and ranged from abstract work in logic and philosophy to CND
demonstrations in Trafalgar Square. Russell twice went to prison: in the
First World War for his pacifism, and in 1961, aged a sprightly 88, for
demonstrating outside the American Embassy in London. He lectured in China
and America, wrote many popular books on social, political and educational
issues, and because of his views on sex was regarded as an ogre by puritans
everywhere. As a result, in 1940 he was banned from lecturing in New York,
on the grounds that he was likely to corrupt the morals of the young -
exactly the same charge levelled at Socrates.
His greatest intellectual achievements were his work on the foundations of
mathematics, and his development of logical techniques in philosophy. Both
have contributed hugely to the character of analytic philosophy. But he was
equally, if more diffusely, a force in the liberalisation of social morality
in Britain and elsewhere. Changes in attitudes since 1945 stem in no
inconsiderable part from his unwearying assaults on humbug and moral
conservatism.
Starved of affection in youth, Russell married early and unwisely. His first
wife was a Quaker older than himself, from whom he soon became estranged.
His first genuine experience of love came when he met the flamboyant Lady
Ottoline Morrell in 1911. 'You have released in me,' he told her,
'imprisoned voices that sing the beauty of the world.' Russell was 40 years
old, and the experience changed him fundamentally: thereafter he had
relationships with many women, and married three more times. His last and
longest marriage, to Edith Finch, was happy; but most of his relationships
ended bitterly, and some of Russell's children seem blighted by his
overwhelming and sometimes icy effect on their lives. Yet he was also
capable of charm and fun, and no-one who met him could disagree with
Virginia Woolf's comment, 'I should like the run of his headpiece]'
Moorehead recounts all this with great skill and readability. She is a
talented biographer, and writes especially well of the people and
relationships in Russell's life. The story unfolds with a compelling
narrative richness, explaining the historical events which prompted
Russell's political work, and making vivid the great throng of supporting
actors around him. A life so huge in so many ways is difficult to write, but
Moorehead does an admirable job, distilling from a mountain of sources a
remarkable and absorbing story. Her portrait of Russell is unflinchingly
just: she illuminates both the best and worst of him as a man, never
exaggerating or extenuating, and in consequence brings the engaging,
sometimes disagreeable, elfin figure - in his own words clutching 'cold
steel in a hand of passion' - strongly to life.
There are, however, two flaws in Moorehead's book. The more serious is that
her understanding of Russell's logical and philosophical work is hopelessly
inadequate. If she can get something wrong, she does; the book is dotted
with (mercifully brief) examples of the worst sort of scratchy undergraduate
essay, cobbled without understanding from cribs. A second edition must put
this right; for the time being readers are advised to ignore the
philosophical bits entirely.
The second flaw is a characteristic one for Sinclair-Stevenson books: sloppy
editing. Russell, Moorehead says, sought to "balance a life of action with
one of scholasticism'; she means "scholarship', of which scholasticism is a
degraded species. Ludwig Wittgenstein appears disguised as "Ludwig von
Wittgenstein'. And so on for many similar careless slips which editors - at
least in other publishing houses - are paid to help authors avoid.
But these cavils should not be allowed to detract from the praise otherwise
due to Moorehead for her achievement. This is a fresh, thorough and
perceptive account of an extraordinary life, the best we have on its subject
to date. It richly deserves to be read.

THE CHILDREN OF MEN by P D James Faber Pounds 14.99, 239 pages
ALTHOUGH PD James has her regular police-detective Adam Dalgliesh, she does
not flog him to death in book after book. Adam does not appear at all in her
latest novel, The Children of Men, set in the future. PD James has never
been content, like many of her colleagues, merely to repeat a well-tried
formula in a familiar setting. When he is not on the job solving crimes, her
criminal investigator writes poetry. This clearly responds to the two sides
of his creator's character - the organisation woman and the creative artist.
While always scrupulous in fulfilling the requirements of the genre - a
suspenseful mystery that is cleared up in the last chapter - PD James has
made several attempts to extend its frontiers. Her models are writers like
Poe, GK Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers and in this latest book the 'holy
'tec' writer Charles Williams, rather than Agatha Christie. PD James has a
taste for the ghoulish, for gallows-humour and macabre liturgical setpieces
that Poe would have relished. At times she resembles a nursing sister who
allows you your sweetie only when you have swallowed the bitter spoonful of
medicine. 'The whole earth is our hospital', said TS Eliot, 'Endowed by a
ruined millionaire,/ Wherein, if we do well, we shall/ Die of the absolute
paternal care/ That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.' If not
true absolutely, that is certainly a very accurate description of the world
of PD James.
Unfortunately her maternal evangelism swamps this story, which is one of her
weakest. It is set in the year 2021 but in spite of this can hardly be
classified as science fiction. Science in any shape or form is no part of
this author's repertory. There is little attempt to make an imaginative leap
into what life might be like at that period in terms of scientific advance.
Sources of energy remain the same, cars seem to have gone back to the time
when they regularly got punctures on bumpy roads, some food is still sold in
tins and opened with an old-fashioned tin-opener. All this in a cosily
crumbling England represented by the city and county of Oxford where many of
the ancient buildings and institutions survive (though someone should have
explained to PD James that they do not teach undergraduates at All Souls).
It is not any kind of progress we experience in the book but deliberate
regress. The country is in a condition of terminal decline. It is run by a
single party government whose central committee is obedient to the will of a
dictator known as the Warden. He is one of those charming, well-born,
extrovert, English public school specimens of leadership, the type much
admired by bachelor-novelists of an earlier generation like EM Forster and
LP Hartley, and as in that tradition alternately loved and hated by the
narrator. The rivalry of these two men, originating in their childhood, is
the only convincing human factor in this novel.
The premise of the plot is that human fertility - the ability of women to
bear children - seems completely to have ceased. The last generation of
children was born in the year 1995. These Omegas, as they are called,
frustrated by their sterility, have become a sinister group within society
practising primitive tribal rites and responsible for frequent outbreaks of
murderous violence. For the rest what is depicted is a largely geriatric
community in which mass suicide is encouraged by the authorities. We watch a
ceremony known as the Quietus whereby senior citizens are rowed out to sea
in leaky boats and are abandoned as they start to float to their watery
graves. Any non-conformity is punished by exile to an off-shore penal colony
administered by its own mafia. Shakespeare's other Eden has turned into one
big, cruelly run, old people's home.
This state-of-the-nation metaphor is promisingly Orwellian, but it is
squandered. A small dissident group of Christian activists, meeting secretly
in disused museums and churches, attempts to overthrow the central
government. Their efforts read for the most part like a true-blue Girls' Own
yarn as they steal a car and flee from their pursuers through rural
Oxfordshire. The narrator is dragged unwillingly into the conspiracy and
falls for the heroine who shares a man's name - Julian - with an English
mediaeval woman saint. When this Julian begins to grow round-bellied, her
fellow-outcasts are incredulous. Could she be . . ? If so, hers will be the
most wanted pregnancy of all time save One. Read on - if you dare. Meanwhile
let us pray for the return soon of Dalgliesh.

this thought-provoking biography of Benjamin Britten

<TEXT>
BENJAMIN BRITTEN: A BIOGRAPHY by Humphrey Carpenter Faber Pounds 20, 680
pages
NOT MANY composer biographies generate the amount of advance publicity
already notched up by this one. Humphrey Carpenter's Benjamin Britten shows
every likelihood of becoming that exceeding rarity, the bestseller from the
world of 'serious' music.
The obvious reason, crudely put, is that it is a beans-spiller and its
chosen subject is full of beans. This is the first full-scale Britten
biography. More to the point, it is the first to explore realms previously
familiar only to various coteries and interest-groups in the music world
(and then mainly in the form of rumour and gossip).
What Carpenter has done is to probe, with a well-trained biographer's
microscope, into areas previously largely unexamined: the full picture of
childhood and youth (always publicly depicted by Britten as idyllically
happy); the affairs; the many examples of cruelty to friends and colleagues
(often prompted by Peter Pears, lifelong muse and partner, who emerges as a
distinctly equivocal figure); the anxieties and morbid sensitivities; the
possible biographical parallels for and sources of the artistic obsessions.
If that were all he had done, though, his book would rate no higher than,
say, Joan Peyser's portraits of Boulez and Bernstein - assiduous in
muckraking concerns, of very limited insight into the man-as-great-artist,
and therefore unputdownable and distasteful in equal measure. It is by no
means all Carpenter has done; and his Britten rates infinitely higher.
Indeed, it must be judged one of the year's, if not the decade's, most
completely engrossing and thought-provoking biographies of any stamp.
As readers of his Auden will expect, it is laid out with unfailing lucidity
and sense of direction. There is a purpose behind the accumulation of every
detail; the author does not indulge in tittle-tattle in the act of asking
his thorny questions (many of them, he is at pains to admit, capable of no
more than a cautiously hedged answer).
Above all, he never forgets that it is because Britten is one of the
geniuses of music - and one who developed and triumphed in an often
philistine, hostile environment - that the questions arise in the first
place. The difficult, irresolvable and yet crucially illuminating links
between the life and the art of such a genius make up the central issue at
stake in this biography; and Carpenter confronts it with an impressive
combination of frankness, determination and taste.
The thorniest question is the one that has already gained the book most
publicity: was Britten raped by a master at school? And, if so, might this
'provide explanations for the recurrence in his operas of the subject of
innocence violated'? It is raised via Eric Crozier, librettist of Herring
and Billy Budd, who claims that Britten told him as much; and it is
supported by the testimony of Beata Sauerlander, member of the family with
whom Britten and Pears resided during much of their wartime American
sojourn.
Others respond to the matter with extreme scepticism; but the theme it
engenders surfaces most fascinatingly in Carpenter's discussions of Budd and
Turn of the Screw, in a way that suggests he himself attaches some credence
thereto. Like much else that is essentially speculative in the analysis of
Britten's psychological makeup, it is at the very least plausibly argued.
So are the dominance, at once encouraging and suffocating, of Britten mere
(whose alto singing voice one friend from childhood reckons to have been
'fantastically similar' to Pears's tenor) and the shadowy role of Britten
pere (who may have been a homosexual and who 'used to send (the young Ben)
out to find boys' - this is another piece of fascinating hearsay, offered
via Myfanwy Piper, a later Britten librettist).
The early chapters are particularly gripping for the glances they afford
behind the facade of Lowestoft bourgeois respectability. In its cosiness but
also in its tensions and pretensions the Britten household as portrayed here
could have been invented by Betjeman, Rattigan and Orton in collaboration.
Carpenter is also notably vivid on the years of burgeoning creativity, the
lessons with Bridge and Ireland, the like-minded young artists among whom
Britten began to spread his wings. He keeps in clear focus the tendencies to
form amities amoureuses with boys (early demonstrated, and inevitably
dissipated when the boys in question became mature teenagers) and to regress
in life - though not in art - to an insulated world of games, nursery food
and unruffled domesticity.
In this latter respect, the personalities of Auden and Tippett provide gusts
of fresh air each time they enter the picture. Auden counts as the earliest
of what came to be known, in Aldeburgh parlance, as Britten's 'corpses' -
those close associates later cast by him into outer darkness for having
committed some offence, frequently slight, for having performed below
standard, or simply for having outlived their usefulness.
The numbers of these grew in proportion to the success of the Aldeburgh
Festival: the already-mentioned Crozier, Lord Harewood, the conductors
Mackerras and Del Mar, the singers Jennifer Vyvyan (an especially grisly
case) and Robert Tear, and many others. At a certain point I began to regret
a degree of over-documentation: too many corpses' tales, perhaps even too
many episodes of young boys fondly fancied, pad out the book's later stages.
And while I also appreciated the discussion of each of the major works at
the psychologically relevant juncture in the narrative, I came to feel that
the method of treatment does not always shed light on the purely
instrumental works.
In the end, a still larger doubt about the book needs to be tackled head-on:
the danger it raises (in the words of Donald Mitchell, Britten scholar and
executor) of fostering an 'enormous superstructure of speculation' on the
basis of juicy but unprovable biographical assertion, and of promoting the
belief that such assertion 'provides us with a key to, a readymade (sic)
'explanation' of, the music. It doesn't'. For myself, I think that in
Britten's case it is a danger worth risking - partly because in his own
lifetime his public image was too hagiographically presented, more because
the music is surely strong enough to permit such an angle of scrutiny, but
most of all because Carpenter's justness of viewpoint provides its own
system of checks and balances.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Travel: The rebirth of a bombed-out city - James Bentley
visits Dresden and discovers that it is fast returning to its Baroque
spleandour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING THE second world war the citizens of Dresden considered themselves
deliberately spared from the worst effects of the conflict. They welcomed
refugees, evacuees and the wounded. Then, on the night of February 13 1945,
allied aircraft turned the city into a fire bomb. Perhaps 60,000 people
died, perhaps 130,000. Sixty per cent of the city was destroyed.
For two days after the bombing the heat remained so intense that survivors
dared not emerge from their cellars. The Frauenkirche - its 95-metre baroque
dome was part of the characteristic silhouette of Dresden - remained
standing. But inside, the eight columns supporting its roof were melting.
After two days the church collapsed.
What was saved of the city was cherished, even under communist rule. As soon
as the communists departed, the pace of restoration quickened. The communist
regime had decided to preserve the Frauenkirche as a ruin, a memorial to the
bombing. Now Dresden plans to restore it to its original baroque splendour.
Dresden is no longer a symbol of second world war devastation, nor of
communist dreariness. The Georgij Dimitroff bridge, named after an obscure
socialist theoretician, has been given back its proper name and is once more
the Augustus bridge, named after Augustus the Strong, who had it built.
So many street names were changed after the Russians departed that the joke
was you went to bed in one street and woke up in another. Four years ago,
industrial pollution had covered much of the city in a crust of soot. Today
the pollution is no more and once again Dresden gleams. It is an east German
city reborn.
Augustus the Strong gave Dresden its baroque face. He also sired 17
legitimate children and several hundred illegitimate ones. A Protestant, he
turned Roman Catholic when elected King of Poland in 1697. His gilded statue
stands at one end of the Augustus bridge, an elegant structure with long
arches and bastion-like refuges where you can pause to admire the River Elbe
and the celebrated Canaletto view of the far side of the river.
Across the bridge rises his sinuous court church, commissioned from the
Italian architect Gaetano Chiaveri and built in the Italian late-baroque
style. Ruined in 1945, its interior once again glitters, especially the
ceiling frescos, the gilded pulpit and above all Gottfried Silbermann's
3,000-pipe organ. Its tower is scaffolded, soon to be restored to its former
splendour, to rise above the building as it did from the early 18th century.
Since most of Augustus the Strong's Dresden subjects remained Protestant,
this court church is an oddity, designed so that on feast days the Catholics
could process inside the building, to avoid being stoned by their religious
opponents if they ventured outside.
The court church also incorporates the royal mausoleum. The mortal remains
of the Saxon royal house lie in bronze tombs. Only Augustus's heart is here,
in a bronze container. It is said to flutter whenever a pretty woman passes
by.
West of the church stands Dresden's greatest treasure, the Zwinger palace.
This, too, was built because of a conflagration, an earlier one than that
caused by allied bombing. Dresden was gutted by a disastrous fire in 1685.
Among the architects brought to rebuild the inner city by Augustus the
Strong was the brilliant Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann. Augustus made him
sculptor-architect to the court in 1704.
Work began on the Zwinger in 1709. Initially, Poppelmann intended a much
larger palace. What he left is an outdoor theatre: a square court, the ends
U-shaped and closed with glass pavilions. Poppelmann seductively alleviated
the severity of this design with luxurious curves, balconies, staircases,
urns and statues.
No-one ever lived in the Zwinger. Its purpose, quite simply, was to serve as
a royal playground, its orangery to store in winter the plants which in
summer would grace the grounds. Here were mounted dances, tournaments, opera
 -any form of royal entertainment.
Immense damage was inflicted on this palace in 1945. It has been almost
completely restored. Go through the archway of the town pavilion
(Stadtpavilion) and immediately turn round to spy a Glockenspiel whose bells
are made of Meissen pottery. Augustus commissioned it, but no-one managed to
create it successfully until the 20th century. The crossed swords carved
above the Glockenspiel are the symbol of Meissen porcelain.
Poppelmann was exceptionally fortunate that one of his collaborators was the
Bavarian sculptor Balthasar Permoser. The statues of the Four Seasons on the
Kronentor, or Crown Gate, as well as the drummer sculpted on its internal
face, are his work. But you see him at his most brilliant in the rococo
fountain of the three nymphs in the Zwinger palace. Here, out of stone,
Permoser created diaphanously-clad luscious ladies.
Since in winter the water freezes, the fountain of the nymphs has to be
turned off. To cope artistically with this, Permoser and his assistants
carved on its basin seaweed, moss, fishes and stones which appear to drip
with water even when none is flowing. Not long ago all this was sootily
black. In the past three years it has been exquisitely cleaned, another part
of Dresden reborn.
Poppelmann planned to create what he himself described as 'a stroll in the
middle of the city which would delight the most refined ladies and gentlemen
of the court.' But he never finished the Zwinger palace. His style fell out
of favour, and work ceased in 1732. The north-east wing, the picture
gallery, was added only in 1847 by the classical architect Gottfried Semper.
Today it houses one of the most important collections of old masters in
Germany.
At the other side of the bridge, Augustus and his prancing steed look along
pedestrianised, sensitively rebuilt Hauptstrasse, which is flanked with a
startling number of bookshops, as well as foodshops, clothes shops and
restaurants. Trees shade statues of artists, gods and goddesses. On the left
are some surviving houses of the original street.
In spite of its reputation as a pariah because of the second world war and
communist neglect, Dresden today is a green city. Here the meandering River
Elbe is some 130m wide, and on either side parks and gardens add to the
ambience.
Some of the suburbs are superb. Hellerau, to the north, for instance, is
celebrated as the first German garden city.
Dresden's finest and largest park, the Grosser Garten, laid out in 1676, is
traversed by a little train, and houses a zoo with some 2,000 animals of 450
varieties, a baroque palace of 1683 and a couple of lakes.
Further afield, the city is surrounded by mountains and castle-topped hills.
One such castle defends the exquisite porcelain city of Meissen. The river
winds its way below slopes covered in vineyards. This is a shallow river,
but when there is enough water such lovely hotel ships as the Elbresidenz
and its sisters, the Clara Schumann and the Theodore Fontane, cruise to
Saxon Switzerland or as far as Magdeburg or Prague.
At night, as you eat on board, moored beside Dresden, the great black river
is streaked with gold from the city lights.
James Bentley flew to Dresden with Lufthansa. In Dresden he was a guest of
the German national tourist board at the Maritin-Bellevue hotel. Double
rooms cost DM488 (Pounds 192.10). Tel: (010)-49-351-56620. Eastern Germany
is still short of hotels, but for a small cost many local tourist offices
will find visitors well-appointed and reasonably inexpensive bed and
breakfast rooms.
James Bentley is writing a Viking/Penguin guide to eastern Germany.

most provoking] There is nothing for it but to make the best of things. We
started at a little after 9.30am in the carriage. It was blowing fearfully,
almost a hurricane, and the stream was very full. Leaving the carriage we
set off on foot at 11am and, although the ground was soft, we soon reached
the track running alongside the loch.
The native pines are very fine here. The ascent is quite stony and the path
winds along, climbing higher and higher and passing small waterfalls which
are quite magnificent. We lunched at a little after 3pm.
The sun struggled through as we passed beneath Lochnagar and, although we
sometimes had to walk through old snow drifts, it was fine. Arrived home at
6.30pm and dined at 8pm.
SO MIGHT our day around Loch Muick have been recorded in Queen Victoria's
Highland Journals, had she been with us. She would probably have included a
note about the several red grouse which leapt from our feet in a flurry of
wings.
She might have added reference to the herd of 90 or so stags which shifted
almost imperceptibly up the steep, dark brown, heather-covered hillside away
from us as we crossed the foot of the loch.
But the frogs in the shallow ditch beside the track would have played no
part in Victoria's diary. They were too small to have been noticed by the
royal passers-by.
Victoria was the first reigning British monarch to visit Scotland for any
length of time since the days of Charles I, and Deeside only became a
regular royal venue after Victoria and Albert acquired Balmoral and built
the new castle there in 1855.
The benefits from the sudden arrival of royalty on their doorstep were not
lost on the canny Scots, and a number of 'By Appointment' crests hangs over
the shop fronts in nearby Ballater.
Royal Lochnagar Distillery above Balmoral was also graced by the presence of
Victoria and her prince, and today's visitors probably see little change in
most of the processes there.
In addition to the castle, Victoria built two houses at Loch Muick. The
first, with Albert, was at the foot of the loch while the second, Glassalt
Shiel, was built after his death: Victoria could not contemplate living in
the first house again because of the memories it had for her.
She called the new building the Widow's House, and it stands at the head of
the loch overshadowed by dark mountains. We passed it on our walk and could
well imagine an estate agent today presenting it (with some accuracy) as a
substantial double-fronted stone house with six bedrooms, four reception
rooms and fine views over the loch. In Victoria's book it is 'a compact
little house (but with only one staircase)'.
How she would have described the comfortable four-star Craigendarroch Hotel
in which we stayed just outside Ballater, with timeshare lodges scattered
among the trees in its 28 acres of grounds, is impossible to say.
Among the outside activities offered is horse riding based just a few miles
away down the Dee Valley from the hotel in Glen Tanar. Suitably mounted on
pleasantly responsive ponies, we climbed up into the hills, hacking along
forest tracks, fording streams and even riding along the Queen's Drive, so
called because Victoria and Albert passed this way on one of their 'great
expeditions'.
At the time these excursions would have been exercises in logistics almost
as complicated as modern-day Himalayan expeditions. Using carriages on the
roads and crossing moors and mountains on foot or on the backs of local
ponies, the royal party would cover 40 or 50 miles in a day and stay away
from home for two or three days at a time.
They climbed over mountain ranges through weather which was often inclement
and without the comfort of modern hill walking clothing and equipment. On
the far side, frequently cold and soaked through, they would be met by
waiting carriages which would take them to a local inn. Victoria delighted
in staying incognito, although one gets the feeling from her journals that
she half wanted to be recognised.
As the discovery of their true identity followed the royal party, so they
left a trail of carved memorial stones and name changes behind them. Once
sampled by Victoria, an ordinary water source became the Queen's Well.
Perhaps the most notable is at Fettercairn, which marks one end of the
Victorian Trail produced by the Kincardine and Deeside tourist board. The
Queen spent the night here but the villagers only discovered the visitors'
identity after they had left.
Almost, one suspects, as an act of penance they constructed a large,
pinnacled gothic archway over the road.
The cost to the local inhabitants must have been enormous. However, the
value of the penance to the village is now becoming apparent, for heavy
lorries - unable to pass through the arch - are forced to divert around the
village centre.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Fashion: Suit yourself for Pounds 50 - or 13 times as much -
Daniel Green dresses up - and down - to discover the details that make
tailoring for gentlemen a potentially costly affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN What they Don't Teach You at the Harvard Business School, Mark McCormack
says: 'It is desirable to have your business dress say nothing about you -
other than perhaps that your clothes fit.' If that is so, the grey suit
should be the perfect business dress. But why pay Pounds 700 for a designer
label when a discount shop will give you something that fits for less than a
10th of that figure?
At stake were some hefty reputations. Could the seamstresses of the eastern
bloc match the couturiers of Paris? Could the buying power of Marks &amp;
Spencer compete with the delicate touch of Savile Row? I needed help.
Enter Henry Rose of Rose, Kent and Stephens, a man with 32 years in Dover
Street and, latterly, Savile Row, a man who could assess a suit if anybody
could. We took four off-the-peg, single-breasted grey suits ranging in price
from Pounds 59 (two for Pounds 100) to Pounds 735.
The Yves Saint Laurent, the most expensive, was dark grey with a subtle,
almost invisible check that Henry called 'window pane.' The jacket had the
fashionable three buttons, rather than the two on the other suits.
The cloth was the softest of the four and felt expensive. Henry warned that
softer cloth wears out faster and does not hold a crease long. Apart from
that, he was ecstatic: 'I'm gobsmacked. This is the kind of suit that
worries tailors.'
He praised the materials (cotton for pockets, rather than nylon) and the
care taken in putting the suit together. The check lined up precisely at all
seams and the pleats were folded towards the fly in the classic Savile Row
English style. Details not on the other suits included an inside pen pocket
and D-shaped stitching to reinforce pocket corners.
More sober was the stolid dark grey of Austin Reed 'hand tailored by Chester
Barrie.' At Pounds 625 it was a decent suit, said Henry, made of 'bread and
butter Savile Row cloth.' He liked the well-finished buttonholes, precise
cut of the sleeves and the underarm triangles of cloth to absorb
perspiration. But the rest of the cut did not please him. 'The trouser
pleats are too close together; it gives a feminine look.'
The cost-cutting measures, too, were disappointing: the buttons looked like
a bit like plastic and there were only three on each cuff. The worst
criticism was that the jacket pockets did not have 'jets' - a strip of cloth
above the pocket flap that looks neat if the flap is pushed inside the
pocket. And the lapels were last year's width. 'Not a young man's suit,' was
Henry's verdict.
Marks &amp; Spencer was next: a mid-grey herringbone at Pounds 160. 'You
wouldn't have got quality like this for the price five years ago,' said
Henry, running his thumb over the edge stitching along the lapel. The
trouser pleats, a masculine distance apart, met with his approval, as did
the fake horn buttons. But there were signs of cheaper manufacture.
The jacket cloth was 'fused' - that is, the two layers of cloth were glued
together to add stiffness and make sure they fell into shape when the wearer
stood up. 'The Yves Saint Laurent and Chester Barrie are well enough made
not to need fusing,' said Henry.
The suit felt bigger to me then did the first two, even though I had asked
for the same sizes from each supplier. 'Marks usually cuts them generously.
They play it safe with a lack of shape,' said Henry. He also pointed out
that the material was bunched at the shoulder. 'There should be more cloth
just at the shoulder.'
Finally, it was the turn of a 'Ronnie Wiseman' Bulgarian-made suit at Pounds
50 apiece (if you buy two) from Hadleigh, Cheapside, in the City of London.
'Amazing,' said Henry, 'You can't get a metre of cloth for Pounds 50 in
Savile Row.'
Costs clearly were cut in several places. There were no trouser pleats and
the jacket was fused, while viscose lined the breast pocket. 'But these are
just details,' said Henry. And the side pockets were jetted, unlike the
Chester Barrie.
It felt a tough beast, a mixture of polyester and wool with a vaguely
canvassy touch. The style was hardly chic, but I did not feel I looked like
a newly-arrived east European emigre.
After three hours of exhaustive study, we totted up the results. Henry and I
agreed that while Marks &amp; Spencer and Chester Barrie were safe bets for
those with the McCormack tendency, we were more impressed with the very
different efforts of Yves Saint Laurent and Ronnie Wiseman.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Fashion: Masters of the sweater game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAND-KNITTED sweaters are one of the great collectables. Many designers
bring out a new - and, of course, 'exclusive' - creation every year which
aficionados simply MUST have.
From Ralph Lauren to Krizia, it has proved a masterly way of persuading
their followers that last year's sweater simply will not do and another
investment has to be made.
Joseph, of Joseph Tricot fame, has a knack of making any of his designs a
must-have. The year of the rose-embellished sweater saw most fashionable
girls around town prepared to do without almost everything else provided
they could raise the Pounds 250 the garments cost.
Joseph's fans might like to know that this year's collectables sport either
a Moroccan theme or the perennially popular rose. Such are the hard times
that prices remain around the Pounds 250 mark.
At Ralph Lauren, this year's themes are reindeers and snowflakes. Those with
around Pounds 460 to spare seem to think the investment worthwhile.
Jamie &amp; Jessica Seaton are another of the big names. They started by making
richly-coloured, intricately hand-knitted sweaters but found the market was
limited, not only by price but also by the numbers they could produce.
For all who have longed for one of their designs, but have not been able to
afford it, they now sell 11 of them in kit form. This means that anybody
with the skill and patience to tackle the knitting themselves can have a J.
&amp; J. Seaton sweater for a fraction of the usual price.
The kits vary from Pounds 42 to Pounds 69 for the most elaborate, and
designs range from roses to diamonds and tigers. All look - and are -
special. For a folder with coloured photographs of the complete range, write
to J. &amp; J. Seaton, Goetre, Llanfynydd, Carmarthen, Dyfed SA32 7TT.
The ready-made versions are available at prices from Pounds 250 to Pounds
500 at exclusive shops up and down the UK. In the West End of London, these
include Liberty of Regent Street and Browns of South Molton Street.

<TEXT>
IT IS NOW some five years since Zeev Aram of Aram Designs, appalled at the
way British industrialists seemed not to know what a fund of creative talent
was emerging from our art schools, determined to make it easier for them.
Alone - 'like Richard the Lionheart' as Joycelyn Stevens put it in his
opening address - he has spent each of the last five summers scouring art
schools from Plymouth and Brighton to Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The best and most promising work he brings to London, lays out at his own
expense in his centrally placed showrooms in Covent Garden and hopes that
some of the great and good might find the time to see what the brightest and
the best of the young designers are up to.
To say that he has been disappointed is an understatement - few of the
industrialists seem able to make it to Kean Street in Covent Garden. Whilst
foreign companies trawl our art colleges like hungry crocodiles, snapping up
our young designers as they emerge ready-trained at the taxpayer's expense,
many British companies seems reluctant even to come and look at what they
are doing.
So, this is a plea for all those industrialists who are in dire need of new
ideas and innovative products to make it to Kean Street before the
exhibition closes on October 8 and take note of all the talent that is
about.
The range of designs is vast - from Jeni Lennox's seductive velvet shoes to
Oliver King's award-winning microwave. There are marvellously simple objects
such as Stephen Huane's radiator key (sketched below right) - a little tube
attached to the key catches the water that leaks from the radiator as you
bleed it.
Pictured top right are Suzanna Watson's hat boxes - not amazingly
innovative, perhaps, but fun, sturdy (they are made of bent plywood with
soft kid leather tops and turned handles) and a better way of storing hats
than the average cardboard box.
Photographed near right are Jeni Lennox's cupboards - as Zeev Aram puts it:
'She has brought a fresh approach to a boring subject and used a wonderfully
basic material like lacquered MDF with ash frames to produce three pieces of
storage (hanging space, drawers and shelves) that are simple and work well.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IF YOU thought artificial flowers were the sort of naffery that went with
flying ducks, garden gnomes and dear little knick-knacks all over the place,
then you should hurry along to Pulbrook &amp; Gould where there are silk flowers
to make you think again.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould is that most establishment, most revered of florists, and
when it decides to do something it does it properly - nothing but the best
silk and tender hand-painting for them. Roses, hydrangeas, daffodils,
tulips, polyanthus . . . almost everything the garden has, Pulbrook &amp; Gould
now offers in silk.
Some prefer silk flowers to look as real as possible, and P&amp;G has these in
splendidly realistic ready-made arrangements. Personally, I think they look
best when used as a witty conceit, when their artificiality is all part of
the fun. The tulips planted in strict little rows, like the ones in the
picture above, work, to my mind, better than the large mixed bunches
pretending to be real.
But each to his own taste - Pulbrook &amp; Gould will sell the flowers singly
(medium tulips Pounds 10.50, large Pounds 12.50) or make up arrangements in
customers' containers or to suit customers' own colour schemes.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould is at Liscartan Houses, 127 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS.

FT  26 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: New look, new label for Harvey Nichols -
The London store's revamped image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARVEY NICHOLS has long been acknowledged as London's one really glamorous
store. Others might be bigger, quirkier and less damaging to the pocket but,
when it comes to sheer knock-out glamour, there has not been another store
to touch Harvey Nichols.
The irony has been that in spite of its vertiginous reputation, high-profile
customers and royal patronage, it never seemed to produce the kind of
figures that its profit-driven masters had in mind. It lost Pounds 3.5m in
its last 13 months as part of the Burton Group and it is no secret that
Burton was mightily relieved when Dickson Poon, from Hong Kong, took it off
its hands for Pounds 57m.
The problem now for Dickson Poon is that he has somehow to make his
investment pay in some of the worst trading conditions anyone can remember.
All the signs are that he does not seem short of ideas. His feet were hardly
under the boardroom table before Amanda Verdan, director of fashion buying,
was despatched to put together a collection of Harvey Nichols own-label
clothing - everything the fashionable woman-about-town might want to wear at
affordable prices, was the brief.
Last week it hit the Knightsbridge store and this Friday it goes into a new
Harvey Nichols store in the Landmark Building in Hong Kong. One does not
need to be a business genius to see what Dickson Poon has in mind - if the
own-label collection works (and I believe it deserves to) then this just the
beginning. Harvey Nichols' label may well be seen in a great many places
besides Knightsbridge and Hong Kong.
It is, by any standards, a desirable collection - filled with everything the
snappy dresser could hope for. All the season's must-have pieces are there -
the long sarong, wrap-over skirt in wool crepe, the cigarette pants made out
of men's tie material, the long over-sized coat for wearing over the new
long skirts, the perfect satin evening trousers, the black cashmere
'bodies'.
Amanda Verdan has aimed at the sophisticated woman who has some know-how at
putting a wardrobe together. The idea is to build a wardrobe out of classic
basics and then to put them together in different ways. There is lots of
black and navy and an edited selection of key accessories - the essential
beret (see it sketched right), the stunning leather belt with a great big
buckle, the man's silk scarf (particularly good in navy and white spotted
chiffon), the good handbag. Most of the clothes are meant to be worn with
flat shoes or wedged platforms and opaque tights.
There are also a few magic pieces which are not essential but for those who
can afford them give life and lift to a whole wardrobe. The printed silk
coat, (sketched here right) is worth enduring a month of baked bean dinners
for. The brown suede jacket may seem expensive at Pounds 600 but given the
quality and what it could do for the most basic of wardrobes you could
easily kid yourself it is a snip at the price.
It is a tight collection, beautifully thought out, so that almost everything
in it can be worn in one way or another with other pieces in the range. It
is particularly strong on evening wear with lots of sophisticated, seductive
little black dresses.
Notions of what is affordable, of course, vary - one person's idea of
affordability is is another's extravagance. Those used to shopping in High
Street stores and middle-market chains will find the prices high. Those
accustomed to trawling through the big designer names should be happily
surprised. There are satin-backed trousers at Pounds 160, lined wool crepe
skirts at Pounds 250, cavalry twill ones at Pounds 150, and an over-sized
black or navy coat at Pounds 390. The knitwear - all cashmere with silk and
cashmere mixes mooted for the spring - averages Pounds 200 a piece. The
dresses are mostly around Pounds 260 and jackets start at Pounds 250.
The collection is on sale now on the first floor. Anybody who feels in need
of a little help in putting the whole look together should ask for Kim, who
is there to help do just that.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Sport: Ibrox blueprint for the people's game - Soccer / The
Glasgow Rangers vision of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL MATHESON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS DANISH champions Lyngby ran out on to lbrox Park for the first leg of
their European Champions' Cup encounter, the hostile growl that is Rangers
supporters' customary greeting for visitors was tempered by apprehension.
The Light Blues have won four successive Scottish Premier League titles.
These give them entry to the European Cup. In the first three campaigns they
were embarassed, failing to get beyond the second round. This time Rangers
won 2-0, but Lyngby did enough to suggest that the second leg this Wednesday
will be no formality.
European cups which follow a knock-out format no longer make sense to large
clubs like Rangers who do not enjoy being booted out in the early rounds of
a lucrative competition. That is why Rangers championed the league system
that UEFA - the European football governing body - introduced in the
European Cup last season. If Rangers can survive the first two rounds they
are guaranteed six money-spinning matches against top European clubs in the
third round. Rangers hope this reform foreshadows the creation of a European
league.
Success in Europe is vital for Rangers. They need the minimum of Pounds 3m
that reaching the third round brings; their overdraft stands at Pounds 10m
and since they also believe their future lies outside Scotland. They have to
be capable of matching the best Europe has to offer.
In Scotland, football is a matter of great national pride. Scots think they
taught the world how to play the game and Rangers represent a particular
sub-set of national identity: proud, superior, Protestant and establishment.
They are the True Blues, the West of Scotland's Finest. Goals for Rangers
can trigger off the chant, 'We are the people.'
Rangers see themselves as the most progressive force in UK football and they
have radical plans for the 'people's game'. These could show up the new
English Premier League for the holding operation it is.
Rangers have gone as far as they can under Scottish football's current
set-up. They are, says John Lambie, the manager of Partick Thistle, one of
Rangers' Scottish rivals, 'the one class outfit in the game today.'
Rangers dominate the Premier League with a team assembled for Pounds 18m.
The outlay on Thistle's current squad has been less than Pounds 500,000.
Not only have Rangers spent money on players, but they have also bought
themselves a stadium, 'a five star hotel without the bedrooms', which is
unsurpassed in the UK and which must be the envy of many English clubs
struggling to meet the government deadline for all-seater grounds.
Rangers, says Bob Reilly their commercial manager, have been transformed
from an 'old fashioned Institution with a capital 'I', a sleeping giant,
into a highly successful commercial and business operation.'
Off-field finance has been the key to the three phases of Rangers' revival.
The first seed was sown back in 1964 with the establishment of Rangers
Pools. For 20 years, this, the most successful club pools operation in the
UK, was Rangers main source of off-field income. Since 1969, it has raised
some Pounds 22m (Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m in today's money) through a variety
of schemes including a spot-the-ball competition and a lottery based on
football scores. Today 200,000 people participate every week but at its peak
700,000 played. Changes in the gambling law in 1985 sharply reduced prizes
and profitability, but Rangers were developing other sources of income.
After the Ibrox disaster in January 1971, when 66 fans died in the crush on
Stairway 13, Rangers transformed their stadium. Using the income from the
pools, the club built three new stands between 1978 and 1981 reducing
capacity from 120,000 to 44,000 in line with a general decline in
attendance. That was phase one of the Rangers reform.
Poor results in the early 1980s meant Rangers could not even fill their
smaller stadium. Enter Graeme Souness as player manager in 1986 to start
phase two: the transformation of the team itself. Souness, a combative Scot,
had been the midfield force in Liverpool's European Cup winning teams in
1978, 1981 and 1984.
The pools money, enabled Souness to transform the thinking of the club. He
reversed the traditional footballing trade imbalance with England. Top
Scottish players have always headed south and Scottish football had always
believed that this was the natural order of things. Souness changed that
thinking. He could outbid English clubs and he was able to persuade English
international players such as Terry Butcher and goalkeeper Chris Woods to
come to Glasgow.
Overnight, Rangers became a force in the international transfer market.
Souness also bought Mo Johnston, to break a long tradition at the most
Protestant of British clubs of not signing Catholics. In year one of
Souness, Rangers seized their first Premier League title in nine seasons.
Reilly says no one could have had more impact than Souness: 'The image of
the team was soaring. We had broken the parochial mould, which was
important. And the club was coming up with a product - by that I mean
performances on the park - that could attract commercial enterprises and
sponsorship.
'Prior to his advent, our season ticket holders numbered 7,000 or 8,000.
With the emergence of his internationally- concepted team that more than
doubled. Even when he left (to manage Liverpool), we were able to build on
the image he had created. Today, because of it, our season ticket holders
number 30,000, probably the largest in Great Britain. That gives us a very
solid base.'
Having built an excellent stadium and a team to fill it, Rangers entered
phase three of their transformation when they were bought for Pounds 6m in
1988 by David Murray.
Murray is an Edinburgh businessman with interests in steel and property. He
is the most powerful chairman Rangers have ever had. He owns over 63 per
cent of equity and his power is absolute at Ibrox.
Murray is not a man for committees. He emerged from the inevitable Ibrox
power struggle earlier this year with the right to oust other board members
without putting it to shareholders vote.
Those who criticise him as a dictator are given the statistics. In four
years, annual turnover has risen from Pounds 5.5m to more than Pounds 13m.
Revenue from sponsorship, contractual deals, corporate hospitality, catering
(including Rangers Chardonnay), publishing and stadium rentals is up from
Pounds 1m to Pounds 6.3m. A new deal with Adidas, the sports equipment
manufacturer, should generate Pounds 12m-Pounds 18m over the five years.
Murray, supported vigorously by Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Heart of
Midlothian, the biggest Edinburgh club, is forcing through proposals for a
Scottish Super League. Murray is behind an attempted break-out from the
strength-sapping 44-game grind of the current Scottish Premier League, where
12 teams play each other four times a season and blunt their skills and
appetite for the game in doing so.
Murray has persuaded nine other clubs to back the plan. They are threatening
to break away from the Scottish Football Association which bitterly opposes
the plan. Murray wants a reduction in the number of domestic league games to
18, which would leave his club free to play midweek in as yet unformed
British or European leagues. The league, set to begin in 1994, will also
concentrate revenue among Scottish football's elite.
Murray's aims include eliminating European knock-out competitions in Europe
and ensuring a steady supply of money-spinning games at Ibrox, which will
have the added benefit of raising the level of his team's performance
against sophisticated opposition.
'Rangers are looking beyond Scotland,' says Bob Reilly. 'That's where the
future lies. We are probably one of the few clubs in Great Britain who are
ready to operate within a larger scenario because of the standard we've set
in terms of stadium and commercial control. But we know one very important
thing: the product has to be good or we can't sell it and go on to better
things.'

<DATELINE>
   TELEVISION is said
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
endlessly - to have made the world smaller. At noon today the BBC's cameras
will broadcast live from the Solent the start of the British Steel round the
world yacht race. The success of the event owes a good deal to Chay Blyth's
1989 announcement on News at Ten, a British TV news programme, that he
planned to send 10 identical yachts crewed by amateurs racing around the
globe. Blyth was overwhelmed by volunteers clutching cheques for the
required Pounds 14,850.
Yet the 130 crewmen waving to the watching millions will not be watching
much television for the next eight months. Nor, after 28,000 miles against
the prevailing winds and currents, will the world seem so very small. 'They
are going to be cold, wet and tired most of the time,' predicted Pete Goss,
the former Royal Marine who trained the crews and himself skippers one of
the yachts. Some challenges never diminish in size.
All summer the small but voluble network of professional yacht-racers based
around Cowes, Lymington and the Hamble have been disparaging the British
Steel Challenge. These tanned, cynical veterans who can round the Horn on a
can of Fosters and a muesli bar say that the amateurs are under-experienced
and naive about what awaits them.
'We're all learning together and the whole first leg will be part of the
training experience,' conceded Vivien Cherry, the only woman skipper in the
fleet. 'Except for two, none of my crew have been at sea for more than five
or six days. It'll be a nasty shock, I think.
'Reality will suddenly hit them when we're two weeks out and they think
'Ugh, we've got another three weeks before Rio and God knows how long at sea
after that.' Keeping the concentration to run the yacht efficiently will be
difficult.
'All you can do is get them to push the boat, look after the boat, look
after themselves. Nothing else exists. There is no point in worrying about
house, family, friends. You're just there,' added Cherry, who has competed
in a solo transatlantic race and several Fastnets before taking the wheel of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand in this event.
It is my hunch that two things will protect these gutsy people, seeking only
more adrenalin than normal life usually supplies, from harm.
The first is that the 67ft yachts themselves were designed and built to be
virtually bullet-proof. Steel hulls constructed by former frigate-builders
at Devonport dockyard are not going to start shedding layers in the Southern
Ocean - as some hi-tech Whitbread boats have been known to do.
Masts more like industrial I-beams than the spindly antennae usually found
on racing yachts are not going to topple in mid-Pacific. The modest sail
plan is split into three via the cutter rig, giving greater flexibility and
safety since crews on deck are always handling smaller sails than would be
the case with a single headsail. High freeboard means the yachts should stay
dry much of the time rather than the continual paddling pool which is the
cockpit of a Whitbread racer - surfing downwind at double the speeds the
Challenge yachts will average.
Caution is the second safety factor. Most accidents happen when racers push
themselves beyond prudent limits because of the desire to win. No
professional sportsman lacks that drive, although some control it better
than others. These crews are not professionals and are dancing to a
different drum. Ken Parson, the Welsh dairy farmer, has cows to come back
to. Caroll Randall will return to deadlines on the Harborough Mail which she
edits.
Every one in the fleet has their own agenda. The racing will be competitive
and spirited but in the end, whether Heath Insured, say, beats Commercial
Union into Hobart (the second stop-over) is only a sub-text to the main
story.
Except, perhaps, to some of the sponsors, their names are up there in lights
and commercial giants that play hard do not want to be at the back of the
fleet. Fury erupted among the amateur crews a week or two ago when it
emerged that the Rhone'Poulenc yacht had smuggled professional
round-the-world racer Lionel Pean aboard the boat for the Ushant / Fastnet
training race, in defiance of the rules.
There were angry scenes on the dock at the finish. The then skipper of
Rhone-Poulenc, Alec Honey, has since found that his wife's illness obliges
him to resign his command. It was an extreme case but other yachts have
found their sponsors willing to pay for coaching - above and beyond the
normal training programme - from professional sailors, particularly those
with Whitbread experience.
David Alan-Williams, a designer and four-time Whitbread veteran, trained the
crew of Nuclear Electric in Southern Ocean techniques. Paul Standbridge,
late of Rothmans, performed similar evolutions for other yachts. There is
more to this race than just a spot of character-building.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Motoring: Volvo that feels like a Saab
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU always knew where you were with Volvos and Saabs. Volvos made in Sweden
were square in shape, built solidly and rear-wheel driven. Saabs were shaped
aerodynamically, built solidly and front-wheel driven.
Volvo upset this neat and tidy arrangement last year by introducing its
first all-new, Swedish-built car for a generation, the 850GLT. It still
looked exactly like a Volvo but, under the sheet metal, it could easily have
been a Saab. Its five-cylinder, 2.5-litre engine was mounted transversely
and drove the front wheels through a very compact five-speed manual or
four-speed automatic transmission.
When I tried it on its home ground, I found the all-independent suspension
gave an excellent ride on anything from motorway to unpaved track. Its
handling was predictable enough to suit the safety-minded Volvo owner; but I
thought its sharpness - revealed when driven hard on a private test circuit
 -would have pleased a Saab buyer who enjoys getting a move on.
As luck would have it (I would have liked to say it was all down to
meticulous forward planning), I spent a week recently driving a Volvo 850GLT
on British roads, followed immediately by a fortnight in a Saab 9000 2.0t
EcoPower. Both were automatics.
The 2.5-litre, multi-valve, five-cylinder engine of the Pounds 22,680 Volvo
and the two-litre, multi-valve, light-pressure, turbo-charged, four-cylinder
power plant of the Pounds 20,215 Saab had much the same output (170 and 165
horsepower respectively), although the Saab's torque (pulling power) was
nearly 20 per cent greater. But the Saab, tidied-up at both ends for 1993,
looked more elegant and far more up-to-date than its new rival. Visually,
the Volvo could easily have been a 1982, not a 1992, model. Its dull and
angular shape must rank as a great styling opportunity lost.
On the road, it was their similarities I noticed, not the differences. The
Volvo has softer seats than the Saab although both proved comfortable over
long distances. Both have excellent driving positions, with controls easy to
reach and instruments visible clearly, although the Saab's fascia is the
more attractive.
Can a four-cylinder engine be as smooth as a five-cylinder? Really, without
lifting the bonnet you would not have known which car had which. A moderate
degree of turbo-charging smooths out a four-cylinder as well as boosting its
output.
In many ways, this kind of engine is ideal for powering a large car. When
driving gently, the turbo-charger does little work. Only when full power is
demanded does it force more fuel-air mix into the cylinders.
A heavy-footed driver can, of course, make a turbo-charged car very thirsty
indeed. Keeping the engine constantly 'on the boil' by accelerating hard
from a standstill, and kicking down into a lower gear every time when
overtaking, will ruin fuel economy. The secret is to exploit the
turbo-charger's boost not as a habit but only when really necessary.
Although conceding a half-litre in cylinder capacity to the Volvo, the Saab
matches its performance. Claimed maximum speeds (134 mph/216 mph) are
identical.
The Saab is slightly, but not significantly, quicker off the mark. Both
should reward economy-conscious drivers with close to 30 mpg (9.4 l/100km)
on a journey.
Is the Volvo 850GLT likely to seduce traditional Saab buyers out of their
9000s? I doubt it. Excellent car though it is - the best that Volvo has ever
made - its face is not its fortune.
Over the years, buyers of the big Swedish-made Volvos have said, in effect:
never mind its looks, think how strong and safe it is. Saab buyers also go
for strength and safety but like a touch of sportiness, too.
Were they to try a Volvo 850GLT, they would probably be surprised how good
it is. But I reckon its staid, quintessentially Volvo styling would be
enough to put them off buying one.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Carving profits from the ancient
limestone - Clive Fewins visits an ancient quarry which is suddenly chic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEEPLY rutted lane with grass in the middle so high that it scrapes the
bottom of your vehicle. Skylarks flutter overhead and the odd hare scampers
away from the motor car.
There is one other noise, however, that can just be heard in the quiet of
the Gloucestershire countryside when the car's engine is switched off. It is
the sound of stone being sawn. Round the next corner and you will be
confronted by Farmington quarry, worked on the same site - perhaps
continuously - since the Romans built sections of the nearby Fosse way from
its Cotswold limestone.
There is stone everywhere - mountains of it, honey coloured and coarse
grained, from huge two ton blocks waiting to be sawn into slabs, to walling
stone being laboriously hand prepared by masons.
The pristine stone looks as if it was laid down yesterday, not 200m years
ago. Most of it comes from just below the surface, with reserves so vast
that no member of the Barrow family that has owned and worked it since 1902,
has bothered to estimate their extent.
They have not needed to. Until five years ago the quarry was a quiet
sideline to the Barrow's 1,000 acre farm, keeping half a dozen men employed,
serving as home to around 50 cats, and managed by a long-serving character
called Sam.
'Sam was a very efficient manager. He ran the quarry expertly for 35 years,
trading with the people he chose to and making a 20-25 per cent profit,'
said Captain John Barrow, the present head of the enterprise.
However things are very different now for the soldier-turned farmer-turned
quarryman.
Sam's retirement coincided with a sticky time for the Barrow family's
farming fortunes. Growing corn was rapidly proving unprofitable and John
Barrow decided to reduce gradually the workforce on the farm from 20 to two,
increase his flock of sheep and take a set aside payment on 500 acres from
the European Community, under the Common Agricultural Policy which pays
farmers to not use land.
His really big decision, however, was to expand the quarry side of the
business by joining forces with a masonry company in Bristol which would
provide a ready buyer for the expanded output of stone he planned to extract
from the quarry.
At the same time he ploughed much of the family's accumulated wealth into
new quarry buildings and cutting equipment which cost a total of nearly
Pounds 500,000.
Life thereafter became somewhat troubled when, after only 18 months, the
arrangement fell apart following personal differences and Barrow found
himself without a partner, with the new building and most of the new
equipment onstream, and no obvious large outlet to sell to.
He decided to buy out the Bristol company. Fortunately, as head of a wealthy
family, he possessed the Pounds 500,000 to do it. He hired an accountant,
Martin Robins, to help him run the company, moved the entire operation to
Farmington and took on a number of apprentices under the guiding hand of
master mason Peter Lee, who has been with the company 39 years.
'It was the biggest decision I have yet had to face. But we were more than
halfway through the expansion programme, the recession had not yet hit us,
and there was a big comfort factor in the form of a Pounds 750,000 contract
(on a large Bristol development) that was very profitable,' Barrow said.
The only way to go therefore was forward, and Barrow braced himself for the
looming recession.
If necessary, family wealth - the Barrows own most of Farmington village as
well as the estate - would doubtless have cushioned any blow. But changing
fashions worked unexpectedly in their favour.
'By 1989 we were living in greener days and already there was a demand from
many architects - particularly those working for some of the large retailing
and supermarket groups - for a return to real stone in many of the buildings
in new shopping developments,' Barrow said.
'In a number of cases we were actually able to persuade architects to
specify real stone rather than the reconstituted material that had been in
vogue for so many years,' said Barrow. Barrow and Robins, the accountant,
set up a contracting company, Ferris Stone and Barrow also started a design
and drawing section in temporary buildings at the quarry.
From the base of the five large portable buildings the staff of 35 now runs
two companies with a combined turnover of well over Pounds 2m.
Ferris Stone, with a turnover of Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.5m soon overtook
Farmington Stone, with its Pounds 750,00 turn over - hardly surprising as it
is a contracting and stone fixing company that, using largely subcontracted
labour, carries out site work all over the country.
In spite of the recession, which is especially bad in the building industry,
business has held up well. Remarkably, Barrow and his staff have been able
to produce artefacts such as architraves, fireplaces and garden ornaments in
stone at the same price, and in some cases cheaper, than their imitators in
artificial reconstituted (moulded) stone.
There have been two reasons for this. The first is the high cost of making
moulds for the artificial material, particularly for one-offs and small
runs, and the other is the company's current policy of going for maximum
volume and low profit margins.
'This policy makes us very competitive with artificial stone producers but
at the wrong margins,' Barrow said.
'However we shall be in a strong position when the recession comes to and
end. We have three apprentices nearing the end of their training, ample
capacity - our plant is about half used at present - to cope with the
upturn, and of course, virtually infinite resources in terms of our
wonderful raw material - golden Cotswold limestone.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / As They Say in Europe: 'It is not a war yet'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'AT THE outset, small calculations, children of the short term, of
circumstances and of the vanity of a head of state; at the end, an historic
event which transcends France but with a result sufficiently narrow that
nobody, from one side or the other, can evaluate it.'
Serge July's summing up in Liberation (he was writing about the outcome of a
referendum in France last weekend, by the way) showed the crisp, modern side
of French journalism. A more traditional approach appeared in Les Echos:
'Voila, France has spoken. Everyone illuminates with their own commentary
this morning the historic choice they have just made . . . This choice
having been expressed, France finds itself more than ever facing herself.'
That piece was signed with the pen name Favilla. Favilla's piece last Monday
was, as usual, faintly at odds with the resolute 'Oui' policy of Les Echos.
In the paper of the Communist Party, L'Humanite, there was no room for
divergent opinions: 'Those who constitute the living forces of the country -
the world of work - in the majority said No. The proof is in the result of
the cities and regions where communist influence is strong: the opposition
to Maastricht achieved impressive results.' The trouble is that those
regions also are those where the right-wing National Front has influence.
France-Soir, surprisingly, took an international approach. 'Europe, Francois
Mitterrand and the cream of the political class just about got away with it
. . . But the battle is not yet won because Maastricht has now to cross the
channel, chased by the waves of the pound sterling . . .' That was before
the pound bumped into the franc going the same way.
The British provided a lot of material, both in connection with the treaty
and other matters which seem to have generated another round of that genial
contempt their neighbours often reserve for them.
The London correspondent of La Tribune wrote that the French referendum
result would not make things easy for John Major. 'On the positive side, it
can be said that the concern dear to the prime minister's heart - to put the
United Kingdom 'at the heart of Europe', even though he signed a treaty
specially amended for Great Britain - has not led to an impasse. On the
negative side, the cabinet has no choice now but to pursue ratification of
the treaty in the House of Commons.'
We might very well have seen the end of 'John and Helmut' as a result of
recent events. Everybody noted how the Germans and the British had fallen
out over the manner in which, with one bound, the pound leapt free from the
fetters of the ERM. It then achieved the triumphant collapse advocated by
Lady Thatcher and her friends. Things got so bad at the IMF-World Bank
meetings in Washington that a Bundesbank official was heard to say: 'Es ist
doch kein Krieg' ('It's not a war yet').
In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jochen Rudolph wrote at length under
the headline, 'The pound on the defensive.' He discussed the long opposition
to Britain's presence in the ERM and predicted it would not be back again
for many a long day. 'Once,' said Rudolph, 'it was the 'ugly gnomes of
Zurich' who were publicly blamed for the weakness of the pound . . . Then
the Germans became the main culprits for the misery of sterling. And,
ultimately, they were blamed for not having taken over the role of
'locomotive' in the world economy.'
WHEN THE French finance minister, Michel Sapin, gave a briefing to French
reporters in Washington as soon as the referendum result became known, he
was asked by Paul Fabra of Le Monde why so many had voted No. 'Oh well, you
know, many people are unhappy about social problems, unemployment. Others
are concerned about agriculture.'
Fabra, possibly the most respected journalist in France, replied: 'I am
perfectly happy, I have no social problems, I have a job, I don't care about
agriculture and I voted No.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / The bargain masquerading as a cut-down: Computing - The
latest spreadsheet program offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH 18m users in 65 countries, Lotus 1-2-3 is the best-known spreadsheet in
the world. It comes in two versions. 1-2-3 release 3.1 is a multi-page
version for specialised applications; the basic version, which will satisfy
most of us, is 1-2-3 release 2.3.
Release 3.1 is priced at Pounds 475; release 2.3 at Pounds 395. In June,
Lotus announced 1-2-3 GO, priced at Pounds 149 and available through Dixon,
Ryman and Wilding as well as specialist dealers.
Lotus modestly describe 1-2-3 GO as an 'easy to learn introduction to 1-2-3'
designed for 'home and small business users'. But this is marketing
flim-flam to persuade corporate users to keep buying the full-price
versions. If (if]) you are content to accept inferior packaging and the
demeaning 'cut-down' tag, in return for paying a half or a third of the
price you receive the full-strength package minus a few bells and whistles.
So it proved with 1-2-3 GO. In fact, after going through the menus in detail
I found it indistinguishable from 1-2-3 release 2.3, which I use myself. The
only regrettable omission seems to be that of the 'Viewer' facility. This is
based on Lotus' wonderful 'Magellan' file manager, and allows you to find
your way around a disk full of files with ease.
For documentation Lotus has rebadged a self-teach book called The 10 Minute
Guide to Lotus 1-2-3. Unlike the standard reference manual it is clear and
readable, but at 138 pages is a mere introduction to a massive and highly
sophisticated package. Be prepared to go out and buy yourself a more
detailed guide from Sybex or Que. Alternatively, a reader has strongly
recommended to me Spreadsheets for Business Readers by C West of the Bristol
Business School.
Installation was mostly a matter of pressing the Enter key to accept the
suggestions ('defaults') offered by Lotus. However, part of the procedure is
very confusing. 1-2-3 GO only appears to work with Diablo, IBM and
'unlisted' text printers. After talking to Lotus support staff I chose
'unlisted' and also the 'Extended' font set for my dot matrix printer.
Everything worked OK, but Lotus needs to clarify this.
In accordance with current GUI fashion, 1-2-3 GO automatically starts itself
in graphical 'WYSIWYG' (What You See Is What You Get) mode.
I wonder how many people use Windows software without realising that they do
not have to put up with the slow response time and the faint and scrawny
characters you often get under WYSIWYG. I run 1-2-3 on a portable and the
display under WYSIWYG is so poor that I have removed it and do all my work
in character mode, which is clear and chunky. Instructions on how to turn
off WYSIWYG are on page 85 of the manual.
1-2-3 GO is a top-of-the range product which, amazingly, turns in a
respectable performance even on a basic XT machine like the Amstrad 1640.
But competition in cheap spreadsheets is strong, with Quattro Pro SE selling
at Pounds 69 and Supercalc at Pounds 79.
Why pay the extra for 1-2-3 GO? One very good reason is Budget Express, a
1-2-3 'add-in' package from Symantec. Budget Express brings to 1-2-3 an
'outlining' facility; that is, it enables you to present data in summary
totals at the top level, then to explode these totals down in increasing
levels of detail. This facility (also called 'drill-down') is essential in
any financial reporting system.
Suppose, for example, you are budgeting next year's profit and loss account
for your 15-person company. Best practice is to budget wages separately for
each employee, necessitating 15 lines in your budget, plus a 'Total Wages'
line.
But this level of detail makes for a very long spreadsheet. Even for a
company turning over only Pounds 1m or so, the budget profit and loss
account can easily grow into three or four pages.
Your bank manager or investors are not interested in this level of detail -
they just wants the total wages figure in a one-page summary 'profit and
loss'. With outlining you can instantly 'collapse' a lengthy detailed budget
into a one-page summary, and back again.
Once you have used Budget Express you wonder how on earth you managed
without it. Not only that, but the manual is intelligently written by
someone with wide experience both in using 1-2-3 and in budgetting. If only
all software manuals were like this] This then is the reason for choosing
1-2-3 GO - that it lets you get your hands on Budget Express.
1-2-3 GO is available at Pounds 149 plus VAT. Budget Express is available at
Pounds 99 plus VAT from 4-5-6 World, telephone: 0206-44456.

FT  25 SEP 92 / EC move over attacks on aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN justice ministers meeting in London next week are to consider legal
action against Yugoslavia over the shooting down in January of an Italian
helicopter attached to the EC monitoring force.
The Yugoslav federal air force was blamed for the attack, in which six
people were killed.
The proposal, under discussion by ministers at the request of Italy, is for
the Community to sue what remains of the Yugoslav state for damages in the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
There is no precedent for legal action by the Community as a whole in this
type of case, and ministers have to decide whether the EC has the right to
launch legal proceedings in the International Court.
It is thought the Italians may also want to widen the scope of the action to
include the shooting down at the beginning of September of an Italian relief
flight to Sarajevo, in which four crew were killed.
Ministers also hope to reach agreement on extending the jurisdiction of the
European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
The CFI, which was set up in 1989 to ease the workload of the mother court,
the European Court of Justice, deals only with competition and EC staff
cases.
Several member states, including Britain and Germany, want to cut delays in
the EC's legal machinery by transferring jurisdiction over anti-dumping,
state aid and agricultural quota cases from the ECJ to the CFI.
The move is opposed by Italy, Spain and to a lesser extent by France and
Greece, largely, it is believed, because they do not want the handling of
anti-dumping cases speeded up.
Challenges to the imposition of dumping duties by the European Commission
can take up to two years to be dealt with by the ECJ. This delay offers
considerable protection from competitively-priced imports from outside the
EC during that time.
The two-day meeting will also discuss an initiative from Britain to set up
an independent EC law reform body to undertake the consolidation and
clarification of Community legislation, much of which is inaccessible and
unnecessarily complex.
The Commission is expected to oppose this initiative because of fears it
could threaten its role as EC policy maker.

FT  25 SEP 92 / British aid linked to debt payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will press Russia to begin repaying bad debts to unlock British aid
of up to Pounds 280m (Dollars 478m), when Mr Michael Heseltine, president of
the Board of Trade, visits Moscow next week.
'It is a very important part of the confidence-building process to raise the
concerns of creditors before we incur new debts,' Mr Heseltine said.
Debts to UK exporters are understood to amount to about Pounds 100m. Mr
Heseltine said he was not expecting immediate repayment in full, but
insisted the Russian leadership 'must have regard' for this issue.
'A key aim is to encourage Russia to eliminate the various obstacles
currently standing in the way of much-needed western private sector trade
and investment,' he added.
The British minister will be accompanied by executives from leading British
exporters to eastern Europe, many of whom are impatient with the government
for delaying disbursement of aid funds, and for its refusal to provide
export credit insurance for contracts to Russia.
During the visit, Mr Heseltine will co-chair the first session of a new
steering committee on Trade and Investment, a 'business-oriented body'.
He wants Russia to clarify its priorities for use of the Pounds 280m export
credit, which was announced by Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister,
early this year. Resort to the funds has been blocked by delays in Russia
agreeing with the IMF a structural adjustment programme, by confusion over
Russia's investment priorities, by difficulties in pinpointing a Russian
financial guarantor, and by the debts issue.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Reinsurance yesterday reported a strong increase in profits for 1991
and announced plans for a SFr300m (Dollars 229m) rights issue and a
simplification of share structure.
The company, number two in the world reinsurance ratings after Munich Re,
said net profits rose by 23 per cent to SFr266m in 1991 and that as a result
it would be stepping up its dividend from SFr45 a share to SFr48.
Swiss Re had forecast improved results for 1991 following weak earnings in
the previous year when its performance had been depressed by a strong Swiss
franc and a slump in world stock markets.
Unveiling plans for a one-for-10 rights issue, the company said it would
accompany the share financing with a simplification of its share structure
and an opening of its share register. It gave no additional details.
Terms for the rights issue are to be announced on November 20. Prices of
around SFr1,500 per registered and bearer share, and SFr300 per
participation certificate, are expected. The issue would raise around
SFr320m, Swiss Re said.
Last year, gross premiums rose by 17.3 per cent to 17.45bn.
In non-life insurance, the underwriting loss rose to SFr781m from SFr717m,
due to the generally poor climate in business overall.
Swiss Re said the growing number of damage claims plus a catastrophe in
Japan also hit the result.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Scots nationalists attack Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH National Party got into the stride of its conference yesterday
with attacks on Labour, which it must defeat if it is to become the dominant
party in Scotland.
'Our real enemies in Scotland are the Labour party,' said Mr Gordon Wilson,
a former leader of the party. 'The Tory government relies upon the grace and
favour of the Labour party.'
Underlying the debate was the question of the extent to which the SNP should
work with Labour in Scotland United, a pressure group for constitutional
reform. Mr Wilson described Mr George Galloway, a Labour MP particularly
involved in Scotland United, as one of the SNP's enemies.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, the SNP parliamentary leader, warned: 'A vote cast for
the Liberal Democrats or the Labour party is the same as a vote for the
Tories. These are unionist votes, used by the present government to justify
the implementation of its policies in Scotland and Wales.'
She attacked Labour for failing to deliver its promises: 'Vote for us, they
said, and a Scottish parliament will be along in a tick. I say that the
Labour party has, for far too long, lived on tick in Scotland - your credit
has run out.'
The SNP later postponed having to make a clear decision on its own political
direction. A motion declaring its the philosophy of the SNP to be 'based on
social justice, economic progress and a commitment to democracy in the
mainstream of the European social democratic movement' was remitted to the
national council for further consideration.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Clean-up campaign at DG Bank -
David Waller on the tough task faced by the German institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernd Thiemann has, on the face of it, a modest objective at the Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank (DG Bank), the Frankfurt-based institution he joined as
chief executive last summer. He wants the bank again to be a respected and
uncontroversial member of the German banking community.
But, as Mr Thiemann readily admits, the task is difficult. For, by the time
he took over, DG Bank had become a by-word for over-expansion and financial
imprudence. Through its role in a cross-border imbroglio involving DM6bn of
government bonds, it had succeeded in blighting Frankfurt's reputation as a
European financial centre.
The bank, the six-largest in Germany on balance sheet, announced last month
it expected to break even for 1992 - a step towards normality following big
difficulties last year. It also received support for its second substantial
cash injection from shareholders within a year, taking the total raised
since Mr Thiemann's arrival to DM3.2bn.
The DG Bank occupies a special role within the German financial system. It
is the central bank for the country's network of more than 3,000
co-operative banks, also DG Bank's principal shareholders. If the assets in
the organisation's 20,000-plus branch offices were added together, they
would amount to some DM919bn, bigger than those of Germany's top three
bank's put together.
DG Bank's problems date back to the 1980s. Then, it set out to become a
universal bank, providing a full range of banking services for the
co-operatives, entering the equities and government bond markets in its own
right, and building up a network of 13 overseas offices. It also tried to
buy up the five regional co-operative central banks, which alienated the
co-operative movement.
This era came to an inglorious end in early 1990 when it emerged that the
bank's chief bond trader had entered a verbal agreement to buy back DM6bn of
German government bonds sold to nine French banks as part of repurchase
agreements.
When the the price of bonds fell, the DG Bank refused to buy them back,
arguing that the head trader - subsequently dismissed - had exceeded his
authority. Four other traders were arrested following a criminal
investigation. They are still in prison.
The affair became an international incident, with the French Finance
Ministry protesting to Germany's banking authorities about DG Bank's refusal
to pay. It embarrassed the Frankfurt financial community, foreshadowing the
insider dealing scandals of the following summer in that it raised questions
about the lack of regulation in German financial markets and lack of
controls at one of Germany's larger banks.
DG Bank had to take the bonds back on to its books in March of 1990 and, in
November last year, it gave up all its legal claims against the French
counterparties. Meanwhile, Mr Thiemann replaced Mr Helmut Guthardt as the
bank's chief executive.
'I knew full well that it was a 'clean-up' commitment when I took the job,'
said Mr Thiemann, who joined after 10 years as chief executive of
Norddeutsche Landesbank, one of Germany's larger public sector banks. 'There
was a gigantic hole in the balance sheet and it was clear that the bank
faced at least 25 major business problems,' he said.
The balance sheet hole was plugged by a DM1.4bn capital-raising exercise
last autumn and, one by one, the litany of business problems is being dealt
with. The bank is carefully unwinding what Mr Thiemann calls a 'mismatched
position of grandiose proportions' between assets and liabilities.
With the help of the Boston Consulting Group, new computer systems and
financial controls are being put in place. The scale of provisioning against
problem country loans is being bolstered.
The bank's personnel is to be cut by 800 from the current 5,500 and, in
June, the bank announced the closure or sale of six businesses as part of a
general restructuring of its overseas activities.
Mr Thiemann is confident that the shadows of the past are shortening. He
draws a distinction between the two capital-raising measures of the last 12
months. 'The first one last autumn dealt with the past,' he argues, while
'the second prepares us for the future'.
This summer's DM1.8bn will strengthen the balance sheet and allow the bank
to meet tough new capital adequacy requirements, which take effect next
year.
The next step on the road to normality will be a marketing offensive
designed to intensify the ties between DG Bank and the co-operative banks,
its natural customer base.
But Mr Thiemann admits that it will be a long haul. DG Bank will signal its
return to full normality only when it pays its shareholders a dividend, and
that is not likely to happen for another four years.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Danieli slightly ahead at L45bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANIELI, the Italian heavy engineering group which specialises in mini-mills
for the steel industry, raised net group profits to L45bn (Dollars 36m) in
the year to June 30, from L44bn in 1990-1991.
In spite of the slight profits rise, the company said difficult market
conditions required a reduction in the dividend to L180 for ordinary shares
and L200 for savings stock from L220 and L240 respectively. The company
explained that the move was necessary to build up resources.
Turnover, affected by the worldwide crisis in the steel industry, fell by
1.7 per cent to L759bn from L772bn in 1990-1991. The latest reduction in
sales and earnings continues a difficult period for the group, which has
seen earnings slide for the second year running after reaching L61.5bn in
1989-1990.
Danieli gave no indications about the current state of its business, beyond
saying that new orders were in line with expectations. In January, it won a
L780bn deal from Iran to modernise the country's biggest steel plant.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Snatching the future from the
lap of luxury - Ian Rodger, Angus Foster and Philip Gawith scent success in
Richemont's recent diversifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER, ANGUS FOSTER and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE DAYS, a sophisticated investor coming across an industrial group
controlled by South Africans, with headquarters in Switzerland, dividends
paid from a Luxembourg subsidiary and accounts presented in sterling, would
almost certainly run the other way.
Such a group would have the smell of what bankers burned by Mr Robert
Maxwell and others now call 'the tycoon factor'. For most banks and
investors that smell is not pleasant.
But in the case of Richemont, the Rothmans tobacco and luxury products group
controlled by the Rupert family of Cape Town, this suspicious-looking
structure has a clear rationale and, so far, has been advantageous to all
shareholders and, possibly, to employees as well.
Attributable earnings last year of Pounds 197.3m (Dollars 331.4m) were
double the 1989 level, and the bearer share more than trebled in value in
that period to a peak of SFr16,375 (Dollars 12,596) earlier this year.
Whether Richemont can maintain this pace remains to be seen. Mr Johann
Rupert, its rather un-tycoon-like managing director, is doubtful, and warns
shareholders of tough times ahead.
'We cannot manage the Richemont group of companies as if an economic
disaster will occur. We do, however, manage it as if one might occur,' he
wrote ominously in last year's annual report.
Investors seem to have got the message because the shares have tumbled to
the SFr12,000 level recently.
Mr Rupert, now its driving force, is nervous about the prospects for luxury
products in the recessionary 1990s and is diversifying the group into the
mail order business and satellite television to participate in what he calls
the franchises of the future.
Until Richemont's 1988 launch, all the Rupert family's worldwide interests
were owned ultimately by the quoted South African company, Rembrandt. But
the family was worried about the risks of nationalisation in South Africa
and ostracism from some western markets.
Mr Rupert drew up and executed a plan for hiving off all the non-South
African assets to Richemont, then a holding company for its Swiss interests.
Since Rothmans International of the UK formed a large part of the new
group's assets, it made sense to keep Richemont's accounts in sterling.
Since most of the shareholders were in South Africa, it did not make sense
to have dividends paid by the Swiss company. Switzerland has a 35 per cent
withholding tax. Hence the Luxembourg subsidiary.
Richemont's strong earnings performance has been buttressed by steady
results from Rothmans and buoyed by the 1980s boom in luxury products. Its
portfolio includes such gems as the French Cartier Monde group (77 per cent
owned), Alfred Dunhill (36 per cent) and the Swiss watchmakers Baume &amp;
Mercier and G. Piaget (65 per cent).
Mr Rupert has an ambivalent attitude towards the luxury goods business.
While he believes in brands and that they must be built up and supported
over a long period, he is nervous about how they will fare in a recession.
'I have been preparing shareholders for four years to recognise that the 38
per cent average annual growth we had over nine years is not sustainable.
But the business has been remarkably resilient in the past two years,' he
says. 'I would not have believed it. A French friend tells me that once
people use real silk and high-quality leathers they never go back. I hope he
is right.'
Richemont has continued to acquire luxury goods lines and Mr Rupert says he
will buy more if the price is right. He has also shown he is not willing to
sell a luxury goods business, even at a spectacular price.
Three years ago, he was approached by an intermediary for Japanese investors
ready to pay Dollars 6bn for Cartier. At the time, that represented a
staggering 40 times earnings.
'I laughed at him, I was convinced it was not a serious offer,' Mr Rupert
recalls ruefully. Three months later, he discovered that it had been
serious, but it was too late.
'Obviously on financial grounds, in a case like that you should sell. But,
on the other hand, we do not buy and sell companies. We try to build up
long-term relationships with our companies.
'I did not want to leave our people at Cartier in the lurch. I told them
about the offer a few months later, and they laughed at me and told me I had
been stupid. But what would we have replaced it with?'
In the past two years, Mr Rupert has been restructuring Rothmans' tobacco
business and finding new businesses for Richemont.
Rothmans International, in which Richemont has a 62.5 per cent holding,
accounted for 70 per cent of group sales and 63 per cent of operating profit
last year. However, Rothmans' main markets are in western Europe, North
America and Australia, where demand and profits have been declining.
In Canada and Australia, it has only minority stakes in the quoted operating
companies, and performance in Australia in particular has deteriorated.
A new chief executive has been installed at Rothmans International in London
and the group is setting up a 'more integrated form of management
structure'. It is concentrating on Asia, and Mr Rupert admits a priority is
to develop a flagship American blend cigarette, something the group lacks
but the market wants.
The Ruperts' first international investments outside tobacco and luxury
goods in the mid-1980s were in TransAtlantic, a holding company for 25 per
cent of Sun Life Assurance of the UK and 75 per cent of Capital &amp; Counties,
and in North American Resources, a speculative oil and gas venture. These
followed the family's preferred pattern of taking on partners for its
businesses. 'We like partners, and we are known as management friendly,' Mr
Rupert says.
The TransAtlantic stake was sold last year for a Pounds 33.7m profit, while
North American, in which Richemont has a 50 per cent stake, is distancing
itself from oil and gas and concentrating on Horn and Hardart, the former
New York fast food company that became a mail order business.
North American rescued Horn and Hardart last year from a failed leveraged
buyout and is in the process of refinancing it. Cash-flow is said to be very
high, and Mr Rupert, who is not given to optimistic forecasts, predicts it
will soon become the number one direct retailer in the US.
Whether this will form the proverbial third leg that Richemont appears to
want is not clear. Mr Rupert seems restless and argues the company should
keep trying to update its product portfolio.
'My job is to snatch bits of the future and try to position the company in
areas where it can manufacture products that my children will be interested
in,' he says.
He dislikes high-technology products. 'You have to invest so much to keep
up. When do you cash out? I would like to buy real franchises, but we cannot
afford ones that have already been built up, like Coca Cola. So we try to
build little franchises.'
His latest purchase, together with a South African media group, was the
Scandinavian satellite television company, FilmNet. Each party paid Dollars
75m for 50 per cent stakes, and they have recently sold 10 per cent to RTL
4, the Luxembourg broadcasting group.
FilmNet, set up in 1985, provides a subscription television service to
Belgium, the Netherlands and in Scandinavia. It concentrated initially on
pornographic and violent films and was not a success.
Mr Rupert says he became enthusiastic about satellite television after
studying Britain's BSkyB. The key, he says, is to have control of subscriber
decoders. This enables the operator ultimately to negotiate with producers
to charge customers for individual programmes. 'It is the box office of the
future,' he says.
He cheerfully admits that it will be a long haul, but has already taken the
first step by getting rid of the pornography.
EVEN if you like Richemont, its shares tend always to be more expensive than
those of comparable tobacco or luxury products groups.
This is because South African investors, who have access to the shares
through a depositary arrangement, are willing to pay a premium for them as a
hedge against the rand.
South African investors also tend to hang on to the shares, which means that
there is very little liquidity in them in their home market of Switzerland.
This is more than a minor inconvenience for Swiss investors because
Richemont is one of the largest Swiss quoted companies, with a market
capitalisation of nearly SFr7bn, and figures in the SMI index of leading
shares.
Next month, following the implementation in July of a revision to Swiss
company law, Richemont will join many Swiss companies in splitting its
bearer shares 10-for-one, although analysts doubt that this will make much
difference to the liquidity.
The group also seems to have taken to heart the trend among Swiss companies
to be more transparent about its activities, and has published a highly
detailed 60 page report for 1991.
But Mr Johann Rupert, chairman, says there is no intention to change the
two-class share structure under which his family has voting control with
only 10 per cent of the share capital. Mr Rupert says the Rembrandt minority
shareholders unanimously endorsed the family's lopsided voting power when
the overseas assets were hived off to Richemont.
Occasional rumours that Richemont might consolidate and spin off its luxury
products subsidiaries, some of which are owned partly by Rothmans, into a
separate group, are also misplaced.
'There is certainly a sound managerial reason for doing it, but I have not
found a tax effective way,' Mr Rupert says. The key problem is that any
restructuring would trigger capital gains tax on the Cartier business, now
worth substantially more than Richemont paid for it.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: United Newspapers achieves 20% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Newspapers, publishers of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday
announced a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 46.5m in the
first six months of the year.
Lord Stevens, chairman, noted yesterday that the improved trading
performance had been achieved in the absence of any economic growth.
'The results were due to the resilience of strong market positions and
stringent management of costs,' he said.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said the results showed that 'we really
can manage this business in difficult times and we really ought to have
credit for that'.
Apart from general pressure on margins United Newspapers was helped by a 25
per cent drop in interest charges from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 11m.
About three quarters of the reduction was the result of lower interest rates
on US debt with the other quarter coming from a reduction in debt level. The
newspaper group also benefited from reduced newsprint prices.
There was also considerable progress in national newspapers. In the six
months to August, the Sunday Express - which went tabloid in July - showed a
year-on-year increase of 6 per cent in circulation in a Sunday market which
fell by 2 per cent.
The Daily Express maintained its share of a market which shrank by 2 per
cent. Overall an increase in advertising revenue helped Express newspapers
to a profit improvement of about 50 per cent.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, said
yesterday: 'Overall you have to call this a good result.' It was as if, he
believed, the company had finally fought free from what he believed were the
expensive acquisitions of Fleet and Extel.
With 55 per cent of its revenue advertising dependent United was now 'a
textbook recovery story, as and when you get a recovery.'
Mr Terrington says he is now expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 96m for the
full year.
Turnover rose marginally from Pounds 411m to Pounds 416m. Earnings per share
rose from 11.8p to 14.2p and the interim dividend is unchanged at 7.5p.
Lord Stevens said he believed the overall performance was good in such
difficult circumstances.
'It is too early to take a view about the results for the year as a whole
but if we continue to trade as successfully as in the first half then it
should be possible to improve on last year's second half performance,' Lord
Stevens said.
The company was not assuming any growth this year either in its UK or US
markets.
The shares rose 16p to close at 425p.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wm Morrison rises 34% to Pounds 36.2m -
Slight reduction in margins confirms Tesco's view of recession hitting
grocery sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM Morrison Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, continued its
resilient run of results by posting a 34 per cent increase to Pounds 36.2m
in interim pre-tax profits.
The improvement from last time's Pounds 27m resulted from the contribution
of three stores opened during the period and a Pounds 4.5m reversal in its
interest position, from Pounds 2.7m payable to Pounds 1.8m receivable,
following the cash inflow from last year's Pounds 97.6m rights issue.
Sales in the 26 weeks to August 1 grew 17 per cent to Pounds 623.5m.
However, net operating margin dropped a shade to 5.8 per cent as increases
in staff costs and overheads outstripped the rate of sales growth,
confirming the view given earlier in the week by Tesco that recession has
finally caught up with the food retailing sector.
Mr Ken Morrison, chairman, continued to adopt a cautious stance in view of
the low level of food price inflation and the general state of the economy.
'I believe it is prudent to regard the present conditions as likely to be
with us permanently and face up to the situation and manage our business
accordingly,' he said.
During the period Morrison opened superstores at Beverley, Walsall and
Mansfield and will open another three in the second half.
The company's existing 53 stores contributed 4.3 percentage points to the
overall 17 per cent sales gain.
Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said staff costs as a percentage of
sales had increased from 8.9 per cent to 9 per cent and overhead costs from
4.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent as the company strove to maintain its standards
of service.
'We always work on the basis that however tough it is it is going to get a
bit worse,' he said.
Next year Morrison will continue its aggressive opening programme with seven
superstores expected to come on stream with eight more in 1994. Morrison is
adding new space as a percentage of its total selling area at a faster rate
than a any of its bigger national rivals.
The company's depreciation charge rose by 43 per cent as the company became
the first food retailer to begin depreciating the value of its sites.
Borrowings stood at Pounds 19.8m at the end of the period with gearing
having fallen from 48.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 3.03p. The interim
dividend is lifted 20 per cent to 0.16p.

FT  25 SEP 92 / ICI, Du Pont close to deal with Brussels on assets swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont of the US are close to a
compromise with European Community competition authorities which would allow
both companies to proceed with a planned swap of worldwide chemical assets.
The outline agreement has been negotiated between senior executives of the
two companies and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner. It will
be discussed by advisers to the 17 commissioners today and put to the full
commission on Wednesday.
Two weeks ago, the EC's merger task force, which reports to Sir Leon,
concluded that the ICI-Du Pont deal would have to be blocked, on the grounds
that it would give Du Pont a dominant position in the Europe nylon carpet
fibre market.
The deal involves ICI swapping its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's
acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash.
The companies had argued that it would be difficult to meet the task force's
objections by divesting ICI's nylon carpet fibre business, because this is
closely integrated with the rest of its fibre production.
Sir Leon is understood to have agreed a compromise solution involving ICI's
fibres factory in Germany, one of three European plants to be transferred to
Du Pont.
The compromise is thought to fall short of a requirement that the factory be
sold to a third party.
The commission has been discussing with the two companies the possibility
that part of the factory's capacity could be given up to a competitor,
together with related research and development facilities.
A compromise should get the commission out of a tricky political situation
at a time when Brussels is under pressure to rein in its powers.
The commission has only blocked one of the 120 mergers which it has examined
since a new community merger regulation came into effect two years ago.
Commission officials said yesterday that they thought it very unlikely Sir
Leon's colleagues would oppose his recommendation.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Wm Morrison
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is surely something to ponder at Westminster that the market
capitalisation of a regional UK supermarket company is now twice the size of
one of Britain's leading exporters. Comparisons between Wm Morrison and
British Aerospace, however, are only of limited curiosity value in the City.
The relevant peer group for investors includes the likes of Tesco and
Sainsbury, which in share price terms the West Yorkshire-based group has
outperformed by 112 per cent and 35 per cent respectively since the start of
1991.
At the current rate of progress it will be only a matter of time before
Morrison becomes the fifth food retailer in the Footsie (assuming, that is,
it does not replace a struggling competitor). The shares are on an
ostensibly dizzy earnings multiple - equivalent to the mighty Sainsbury and
20 per cent higher than the market - but fans insist this is down to highly
conservative accounting policies. Yesterday's announcement of a 34 per cent
increase in interim profits came despite a 43 per cent jump in the
depreciation charge. As the modest decrease in operating margins
illustrates, though, even Morrison cannot buck the consumer's tendency to
trade down; staff costs in the period, moreover, rose faster than turnover.
That said, there is nothing in yesterday's figures to suggest that
management is loosening its grip or that the company's low price/good
service formula is losing its appeal. There may be reason to worry about the
whole sector's expansionism, but Morrison's secret is that it requires just
7 or 8 store openings a year to keep up the pace against the 25 to 30 needed
to keep the momentum going at its bigger rivals. The ability to finance them
largely out of cash flow is just an additional trick.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When United Newspapers produces a 20 per cent increase in interim profits,
the market has to ask itself whether it has been too niggardly in putting
the company on a multiple below its peers. The answer could be a cautious
yes. True, the first half interest charge benefited from lower US rates,
over which the company has no control. Newsprint costs may also not remain
so favourable. The sterling price of paper will have to reflect the stronger
dollar despite the glut. The company is conspicuously silent about the
fortunes of the Daily Star, but the remarkable turnround at the Sunday
Express has helped produce a sharp increase in display advertisement
revenues, and costs throughout the group have been held in rigorous check.
This forms a good springboard from which to reap the benefits of economic
recovery, especially for a company that derives over half its revenues from
advertising. There are two caveats, though. First, the bunching of capital
spending in the second half of this year makes a further reduction in
gearing unlikely. It will only be from next year onwards, when spending
returns to more normal levels, that debt will start to drop significantly.
Second, last year's dividend cover was only 1.3. The chances are that the
payout will grow more slowly than earnings in a recovery.

FT  25 SEP 92 / People: Troika beavering away at the Industrial Society
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Beaver, director of corporate affairs at National Westminster Bank
until he left abruptly in March, has turned up in the new position of
marketing director at the Industrial Society.
A registered charity training between 20,000 and 30,000 people a year, the
Society has had a new lease of life since the arrival last year of Rhiannon
Chapman as director. Beaver says she, finance director Andrew Cameron
(formerly of RTZ) and he make up a 'troika leading a quiet but determined
revolution'.
Keen on words like 'empowerment', Beaver thinks the organisation, which in
the past few years had rather lost its way, can return to the excellence in
training it enjoyed in its heyday under John Garnett who stepped down in
1986 after 24 years as director. 'Lots of people go to work in fear; they
ought not to. Lots of people are cynical about their work; they shouldn't
be,' according to Beaver, who spends part of his free time as a Church of
England priest in Brixton. 'The idea is, we don't charge as much as Harvard
but we deliver the goods.'
Courses range from teaching small business how to cope with EC regulation to
such 'grown-up' subjects, as Beaver puts it, as helping women to deal with
the 'glass ceiling'.
A 46-year-old American who says that while he sounds as if he is 'just off
the boat yesterday', is in fact British-trained. He studied Imperial history
at Oxford, and later worked for JWT in the UK and then Barnardo's (where he
'took the Dr out of Dr Barnardo's'). Next he moved to AGB Research; some two
years after he joined, it was acquired by Robert Maxwell's private group of
companies, and he became the tycoon's chief of staff 'for three whole
weeks'. He stayed at NatWest for 18 months.
*****
Body Shop International, the 'green' personal care products group, has
appointed Michael Ross to the main board as international director
responsible for supporting the operations of the company's overseas
franchisees.
Body Shop is continuing its rapid overseas expansion and further diminishing
its reliance on the UK market, which has been hard hit by recession in
recent months.
Ross, 38, previously ran the company's Soapworks factory in Glasgow which
was intended as an exercise in improving community relations in a depressed
region as well as manufacturing most of Body Shop's soap needs.
Before joining Body Shop, Ross gained international business experience in
the oil and gas industry.
*****
Liam Strong, the recently-appointed chief executive of the struggling Sears
retail empire, has moved to shake up the company's sports and leisurewear
businesses, including Olympus and Millets, which have performed
'disappointingly'.
Alan Vickers, the division's managing director, will leave the company to
'pursue other interests'. He will be replaced by John Fallon, previously
finance director of British Shoe Corporation.
The division will also be strengthened by the appointment of Kevin Gunter,
currently operations director of the Budgens grocery chain, as retail
operations director.
Fallon will be succeeded as finance director of BSC by the financial
controller, Peter Ellis.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (15): Guild remains confident on
growth - Silver jubilee of a British organisation which is the driving force
behind European body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Guild of Business Travel Agents celebrates its silver jubilee this year
against a background of some of the toughest trading conditions that its 41
members have ever experienced. Yet the guild remains confident that the
future for business travel remains strong - helped by such factors as the
deregulation of European frontiers from next year - even amid the present
economic uncertainty.
'There is no doubt that companies will continue to need to spend money on
business travel in the 1990s as the pace of international business picks
up,' says Mr David Whittaker, joint managing director of The Travel Company
and current chairman of the guild.
So confident are guild members of the growth of business travel, especially
on a pan-European basis, that it has been the driving force behind the
formation of the Guild of European Business Travel Agents, an umbrella body
for the fledgling business travel agency associations that the British guild
has helped nurture across seven other European countries.
The European guild's objective is 'to speak and act in unity for the benefit
of the business traveller and the member agents who serve him or her'. Its
200 or so members have a combined turnover of some Dollars 10bn - giving
them substantial clout in the increasingly global world of suppliers such as
airlines, hotel chains and car rental companies.
Members of the UK guild alone generated an annual turnover of Pounds 3.4bn -
almost Pounds 10m a day - from over 1,900 outlets in Britain. They were also
collectively responsible for handling over three-quarters of all air traffic
generated by agents in the UK.
The scale of the guild members' operations in the 1990s would seem almost a
dream in 1967 to the half-dozen travel agents specialising in business
travel who banded together to form the guild, believed to be the first such
travel trade association of its type in the world. At that time, for
example, British Airways did not exist - it was still in the days of BOAC
and BEA - and Concorde had yet to fly. The two airlines between them handled
some 9m passengers - compared with the 25m carried by BA now.
What prompted the formation of the guild 25 years ago was the feeling that
the Association of British Travel Agents was more concerned with the
interests of leisure travellers rather than of those travelling on business.
The specific concerns of business travellers were sometimes lost amid Abta's
concern for the blossoming package holiday trade.
The guild's early days were concerned with fighting the uphill battle of
getting a better deal for business travellers - especially in the days when
business class cabins were unheard of. Moreover, hefty price discounting by
the airlines in the mid-1970s prompted the guild to launch its own
'bucket-shop' type of discounted fares operation for members, which has
developed into a more structured system now called Guildfare.
The growing demands of the guild's members in the 1980s saw it turn itself
into a limited company in 1987, controlled by a 12-strong board of
directors. Mr David Reynolds is now the guild's full-time chief executive,
enabling the elected chairman to concentrate on the lobbying duties which
form the backbone of the guild's operations.
'There are many important issues that concern business travel agents and
their customers and we spend a great deal of time and effort trying to sort
out the problems before they arise,' explains Mr Whittaker.
One recent concern, for example, has been the plans by the European
Commission for member states to impose VAT on air fares at a rate of not
less than 5 per cent. 'We've been fighting this one all the way and we hope
that they are now beginning to see sense,' says Mr Whittaker. 'It's
incredible that there should be moves to put up air fares by imposing VAT at
the same time as the whole issue of the level of European air fares is under
review.'
The EC, as well as the UK government, is also being lobbied by the guild
over the proposed directive on package holiday travel. As presently worded,
the directive, which comes into force next year, would bring business travel
within the directive's remit as well as package holidays.
The guild is also concerned over the delays about the planned expansion of
Heathrow airport which it believes will enable other European airports to
win business away from the UK. It would also like to see greater efforts
made by the BAA, which owns Heathrow and other major UK airports, to enable
business travellers to have the fastest possible transit through airports.
'Since the business traveller already has to cut a swathe through the
tourist throngs at Heathrow, we want to see a clear plan for reducing
terminal congestion while we await the new terminal five,' says Mr
Whittaker. 'But the noises from the BAA are not encouraging so far - in fact
they seem to be giving even more space to shopping areas.'
The guild is also putting pressure on the government to speed up immigration
queues at Heathrow which, it believes, are offputting for regular business
travellers.
Apart from its lobbying role, the guild has been active in two other key
areas of interest to good business travel management.
Firstly, it has spent considerable effort to improve the quality of training
among business travel staff. It believes that organising the best deals for
corporate travel requires a higher level of expertise than is usual in high
street holiday travel agents. Hence, the guild has worked with Abta's
national training board and the City and Guilds examination board to
establish a four-stage level of training for agency staff which will enable
them to claim the professional qualification, Certificate of Business
Travel.
The second area where the guild has played an active role is in the
development of the computer-driven technology which is rapidly changing the
way agents do business.
'Without this new technology, business agents would not be able to keep pace
with the growing demand from companies for a global travel service,' points
out Mr Whittaker.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (14): Keeping in style in the
harsh 1990s - David Churchill looks at how hard-pressed executives can get
the best from their travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMEMBER the British Airways television commercial of a few years ago that
had an executive flying on the 'red eye' to New York and arriving in top
shape - much to the consternation of the people he was doing business with
who thought he would arrive tired and bedraggled?
That commercial neatly summed up the benefits of flying Club Class in a
world where the high-flying executive was king.
In the heady days of the late 1980s, nothing was apparently too good for the
business traveller as he (or she) forged new business overseas.
But in the harsher business world of the 1990s, business executives are
increasingly told by their companies that they must fly at the back of the
aeroplane, stay in a (not that convenient or comfortable four-star rather
than five-star hotel, and drive a smaller hire-car.
Yet, all is not lost. The savvy business traveller knows how to get the best
of a bad deal; how to exploit the opport- unities for travelling in style at
an economy price.
Here are a few of those ways.
1. Accept the company diktat to fly economy - but get an upgrade. Easier
said than done, but with the mass of coach class travellers on budget
tickets, full fare-paying economy ticket holders are usually first in line
for an upgrade to business. It is essential, however, for men to wear at
least a jacket and tie (preferably a suit) and for women travellers to be
smartly dressed.
2. Ask politely at the check-in desk if an upgrade is available - hint at
wanting to do some serious work aboard. If no luck at the check-in, ask the
chief purser when on board the aircraft: he has the authority to upgrade you
if space is available.
An alternative is to fly Virgin Atlantic which has introduced a new Mid
Class service on its flights. This gives full-fare paying passen- gers the
equivalent of a business class seat on any other airline; Virgin's Upper
Class seats (which sell at business class prices) are the equivalent of
first class seats on other airlines. Downgrading from upper class to mid
class will, for example, save the travelling executive over Pounds l,500 on
a round trip to Tokyo. The drawback to the mid class service is that the
food is the same as in economy, although there are separate check-in
counters and priority baggage handling.
3. Join an airline club which provide a range of extra services and
facilities for frequent flyers. Most airlines will either charge a fee for
joining or limit membership to executives who have flown a certain number of
miles with that airline. British Airways, however, has adopted a diff- erent
approach: everyone who flies on a paid-for ticket with BA can qualify for
member- ship of the first tier (blue) of its executive club. This provides
few real benefits - no access to lounges, for example - but puts you on
course (according to how many Club Class flights you make in a year) for
silver or gold membership where the real perks are. Apart from lounge
access, silver or gold members are usually first in line for an upgrade.
4. Use a specialist business travel agent to organise your business travel
needs, rather than just asking the local agent - who primarily handles
holidays - to make the booking.
Specialists buy a lot of travel, not just for you but for their other
clients as well, and this gives them access to some of the best discounts
and special offers available. Using a recognised business travel agent (most
are members of the Guild of Business Travel Agents) can also help get an
upgrade: the airlines are willing to do this on occasion for their best
customers, but obviously not always as this would discourage business and
first class bookings.
5. Small companies and individuals who want the benefits of bulk buying and
other perks can join a special- ist members-only travel club, such as Wexas
or the Internat- ional Airline Passengers Association. Wexas Gold Card
membership at Pounds 148.53 a year, for example, offers personal travel
consultants, discounts on business and first-class fares and access to the
cheapest economy fares, and free ticket delivery in central London. IAPA,
whose membership costs a basic Pounds 45 without any travel insurance or
upwards of Pounds 59 depending on the level of insurance cover, also offers
substantial discounts on car rental and hotel prices. (Wexas: 071 589 3315;
IAPA: 081 681 6555).
6. Hotels, squeezed by the recession, have been looking for ways of offering
better value to business travellers. Hyatt, for example, allows all guests
to enrol as members of its Gold Passport programme - after that they
accumulate points according to how much they spend in the hotel. These
points can then be used to obtain room upgrades and discounts on
accommodation and meal costs.
The Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong has introduced a 'Business Bonuses' prog-
ramme: those paying the pub- lished room rate (as opposed to a heavily
discounted price) get a free limousine to and from the airport, room
upgrade, and other benefits including a free laundry service. Even some of
the Savoy Group of luxury London hotels - including Claridge's, Berkeley and
the Savoy - are wooing Aus- tralian and American guests with car transfers
and free golf at the Wentworth Club.
7. Car rental companies have been having a pretty torrid time with the
recession and rates have become very competitive. But if you want a better
service, then join a club such as the special Avis Club, membership of which
is free. This guarantees members the best possible deal around, along with
extra discounts in certain circumstances plus an upgrade.
These are some of the tips to make the best of the current squeeze on
business travel.
However, Mr Ron Spiers, publishing director of the ABC World Airways Guide,
who is a frequent business traveller clocking up an average of 120,000 miles
in travel a year, believes the savvy traveller should look for some of the
hidden drawbacks of international travel as well.
'With trips to the Far East, for example, I have found it really pays to
check total elapsed time carefully, as a number of cheaper long-haul flights
include multiple stop-overs which can add several hours to the journey, and
in effect lose you a whole working day,' he says.
His main cause of frus- tration, however, is the inflexibility of some
tickets. 'There can be few things more aggravating than to rearrange your
flights and to find you have to pay a significant premium to change your
flight,' he says.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (12): Cost-efficiency of the
corporate card - Companies can save 10 per cent of their travel and
entertainment spending, it is claimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE recession biting deep into UK corporate budgets, the main players
in the corporate cards market believe that their hour has come round at
last.
The logic is simple. For years American Express and Diners have been arguing
that a corporate card is not a licence for employees to spend money but a
cost-efficient way of enabling the accounts department to monitor travel and
entertainment (T&amp;E) spending, detect possible delinquencies and, above all,
to identify areas where savings can be obtained by negotiating bulk purchase
deals with airlines and hotels.
Now they believe that many companies are beginning to listen more
attentively. T&amp;E is the second largest expense for many corporations after
the salary bill. The sums involved are formidable. In Japan, annual T&amp;E
spending is around Dollars 35bn (Pounds 17.7bn) a year, and in Britain it
will be around Pounds 18bn this year.
The 1991 figure reflects the impact of the recession. Budgets are shrinking.
Last year the UK total expenditure for T&amp;E was Pounds 20bn.
Corporate eagerness to cut spending has enhanced potential appeal of the
information management functions of business card schemes.
'More and more corporations are looking closely at their expense base and
trying to cut back, perhaps by booking economy tickets instead of business
class or business class instead of first class. That means they want good
quality information to enable them to make their purchases better,' says Mr
Jim Jamison, vice-president of travel management services at American
Express.
Amex claims that its corporate card services, linked to its other travel
facilities including its travel agency operation, can enable companies to
shave between 10 and 30 per cent off hotel bills and air tickets. By itself,
the corporate card scheme should be able to save companies at least 10 per
cent on their T&amp;E spending.
'That implies that there is a potential Pounds 1.8bn saving in the British
market alone,' says Mr Jamison. 'The link between travel services and the
payment instrument is going to become more and more critical for many
companies.'
A separate trend in the market is that more companies these days want their
on-line information, so that it can be easily integrated with other
computerised cost-control operations, and fewer prefer data on paper.
A related development is the steady growth of lodge card services in which a
corporate charge card issuer, Diners Club or American Express, links up with
a travel agency to provide an integrated service to a corporate client.
Gray Dawes, a London travel agent, says that about 53 per cent of all the
air tickets it sells to companies are now issued on the lodge card system.
All the tickets issued are charged to a lodge card held by the travel agent
on behalf of the company. 'The benefit to the client is that the lodge
account improves his or her cash flow. We would normally be able to offer
only 10 days' credit by ourselves. But with billing from Diners, companies
can get up to 54 days' credit on average,' says Mr Ray Hopkins, Gray Dawes
managing director.
The client can also benefit from Diners' ability to offer worldwide
facilities such as airport lounges and to supply detailed management
information reports splitting up T&amp;E expenditure into cost centres and
enabling companies to track the way that their staff use money and to
negotiate concessions.
Why use Diners rather than Amex for the lodge card? One reason could be that
travel agents do not easily forget that Amex itself is the largest travel
agent in the world. Amex lodge card facilities are available when customers
want them.
Diners Club has also made impressive progress in the co-branded card, a
route which American Express (apart from cards which share branding with a
bank) has so far refused to go down.
By combining the Diners card with a British Airways affinity branding,
clients have been provided with some impressive additional benefits which
Diners Club could not have offered alone: priority wait-listing on British
Airways flights, upgrades at British Airways partnership hotels and car
rental discounts.
'Our aim has been to generate high volume accounts and offer multi-user card
products,' says Mr Tony Stuart, general manager of the British Airways
Diners Corporate card scheme. More than 500 companies, with annual T&amp;E
budgets of more than Pounds 500,000, now use the card.
Plans to develop it further over the next 12 months focus mainly on helping
companies improve their administrative control over their T&amp;E budgets. In
the longer run the British Airways Diners Club Corporate Card will be
integrated into the British Airways Executive Club, offering an even greater
range of enhancements.
In terms of numbers of cards issued, the corporate card business is still
overwhelmingly dominated by American Express, with Diners Club recovering
some ground through its lucrative niche in the co-branded airline cards.
In the UK, Amex's market share appears to be around 50 per cent of the
total, though the company declines to give a figure for 1992, saying merely
that corporate cards make up a large chunk of the 1.1m UK American Express
cardholders and that even many of the personal cards are mostly used for
business spending on T&amp;E.
Visa business cards are making strong inroads at the lower end of the
market. Company Barclaycard has been growing steadily since its launch two
years ago. There are now 216,000 Company Barclaycards in circulation and
Pounds 670m worth of goods and services was purchased with them last year.
One advantage a Visa corporate cardholder has over those using Amex and
Diners is the much greater range of outlets - 360,000 in the UK and 8.2m
worldwide. By contrast Diners has 120,000 UK retail outlets and Barclaycard
can streess that its use is not just confined to T&amp;E purposes: the company
is pushing it for the purchase of office supplies and equipment in place of
traditional petty cash advances.
For Amex, charges begin at Pounds 37.50 for a personal card but drop sharply
per card if a company issues a large number of cards to its employees. For a
company with more than 1,000 cards issued, Amex would charge Pounds 9 per
card. Larger than that and the company would probably negotiate a flat
management fee.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (13): Advantages of an implant -
Case Study / Gray Dawes and Lloyds International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE at last paying as much attention to their travel budgets as
they have traditionally lavished on their advertising expenditures or their
vehicle fleets.
Lloyds Bank spends around Pounds 5m a year on travel, with just over Pounds
2m going on air tickets and almost Pounds 3m on hotel accommodation. Last
year, just as companies ask for speculative pitches from advertising
agencies, so Lloyds asked for proposals from 10 specialist companies on how
best to run its travel purchasing. The winner would set up an implant, a
four-strong travel agency, plus a messenger, inside Lloyds Hay's Lane
building to handle the travel needs of the entire Lloyds group.
After viewing four presentations, Mr Glyn Farrell, who manages Lloyds
Personnel and Travel Services, chose Gray Dawes Travel.
It was hardly surprising. The City-based Gray Dawes had first started to
work for Lloyds International on an ad hoc basis 10 years ago. Five years
ago it established its own team inside Lloyds.
After inspecting the field Mr Farrell stuck with the travel specialists he
knew. In three years' time he will keep Gray Dawes on its toes by repeating
the trawl.
Mr Farrell reckons that by using a specialist implant travel bureau Lloyds
both saves money and operates more efficiently. Apart from local trips of up
to about 40 miles, all the travel needs of Lloyds managers go through the
Gray Dawes team, which issues tickets, makes hotel bookings, arranges
currency, renews passports and obtains visas from an office alongside that
of Mr Farrell. Soon there might be satellite offices which might also be
capable of issuing tickets, etc.
In his latest review Mr Farrell examined the cost of reviving an internal
department, or of putting travel needs out to an outside agency (where there
is the danger of being just one client among many) and concluded, as more
and more large companies do, that the implant system is the most efficient.
As well as the expertise of the travel team seconded to it, Lloyds saves on
the personnel costs, such as pensions and financial perks, of employing its
own staff. And if for any reason a face does not fit, Gray Dawes can switch
the employee to another client.
Mr Farrell might well see some of the airline or hotel representatives who
visit him with tempting discount offers and pass on their suggestions to
Gray Dawes, but they handle all the arrangements. Each month he is provided
with a detailed computerised breakdown of Lloyds travelling expenses, which
enables him to pinpoint which executive went where and at what cost. Over
the years the travelling has increased but the budget has stayed roughly the
same.
Obviously, the recession has hit the airlines and the hotels hard and they
have responded by chasing business customers with attractive offers. But not
that attractive. Lloyds and Gray Dawes work with a limited number of
airlines in order to secure discounts from achieving target expenditures
but, on air travel, discounts rarely top 5 per cent of the listed price,
although competition is forcing them marginally higher.
However, Gray Dawes attempts to exploit all the Apex savings available from
early booking. Currently British Airways, United, and Virgin (its new mid
class is deemed attractive to executives) serve Lloyds' transatlantic
requirements. For Europe the need for speed and the general absence of
discounts mean that the most efficient flight is booked irrespective of the
carrier. The opening up of the skies over Europe could greatly reduce
business travel costs on the Continent.
Like most companies, Lloyds is cutting back on first-class and business
class travel. It not only saves money but conveys an appropriate cost
trimming image for the times. Only 150 Lloyds executives are frequent
international travellers and around 30 can expect to go first-class.
In the last five years the company has reduced first-class travel by around
20 per cent. Expenditure on business class travelling has also been curbed,
although if an airline makes a special promotional offer of upgrades for
frequent business fliers (and the new American airlines crossing the
Atlantic are particularly inclined to do so) Lloyds is happy to take
advantage of the deals. It allows its executive to discover his or her good
fortune on arrival at the airport. It does not want to encourage an upgrade
mentality in the company.
In the current business climate discounts of up to 50 per cent on hotel
accommodation can be secured by Gray Dawes, and not only by dealing with the
big international hotel chains. However, if executives complain about a
hotel, it is quickly dropped from the schedule. Mr Farrell believes that
many companies keep a close watch on their travel costs but waste money on
the more expensive area of accommodation.
It is not the travel department's task to fix the budgets: the various
departments in Lloyds know their travel needs best. But Mr Farrell helps to
police them and to ensure that they stay within the fixed limits and take
advantage of any special offers that come on to the market. By having a
travel company working exclusively in-house on its behalf, Mr Farrell
believes that expertise, efficiency and effort are as good as doubled.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (10): Why the implant could be on
its way out - Does it pay for a company to have a travel agency on its
premises?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN UPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGUMENT for employing a travel agency implant to organise your travel
is weakening as new technology reduces the need for specialist staff to
occupy your premises. It will not be long before all arrangements can be
handled over the telephone, writes Gillian Upton.
The arrival of screen-based information and satellite ticket printers (STPs)
for those companies with a large requirement for ticket issuing has made the
difference. STPs allow airline tickets to be printed and issued remotely,
negating the need for in-house agents to print them.
Large companies with a high number of frequent travellers, a significant
travel budget and demand for last-minute arrangements have been driving this
segment of the market but their needs could be satisfied out-of-house. But
what cannot be satisfied is the face- to-face interaction between travellers
and travel staff and the emotional reassurance that often brings with it.
A travel agency implant is defined by the full-time use of something between
one and 25 travel agency staff subcontracted to your company and working on
your premises. On the plus side, it automatically releases a full-time
travel manager from day-to-day administration and leaves him or her to
undertake a more long-term, strategic role. It also saves on the payroll,
the implant staff can better integrate and become part of the culture of the
company and perhaps do a better job.
The business travel agents - American Express, Hogg Robinson, Thomas Cook
and Wagons-Lits - compete with each other for a slice of this market sector.
Those who dislike this arrangement point to possible security problems in
companies where the whereabouts of top executives may be sensitive
information, to the potential conflict of interest of the agency staff being
loyal to their agency rather than the client and the fact that implants take
up valuable floor space, although that has been less of a problem since UK
commercial rents nosedived. Space for an implant is usually provided free of
charge or well under the going rate to the agent.
The anti-lobby say that it is important that implant staff work under
supervision of a trained company travel manager whose goal it is to seek
money-saving opportunities.
Mr Norman Dickens, a travel manager from a large US oil company, has managed
an implant for his employer for many years and vigorously defends their
usefulness. 'We're in the business of energy, not in the business of running
a travel agency. The implant takes on all the responsibility of purchasing,
the electronics, training staff, and there are definite benefits.
'I make and maintain the standard of travel and do it as economically as
possible,' he adds. Thomas Cook runs the implant with four full-time staff,
handling 85 per cent of the client's UK business. The company spends Pounds
2m a year on air tickets.
In contrast, one division of BT (British Telecom) rid itself of a travel
agency implant some 15 months ago. Mr Jeremy Ing, BT Asia Pacific personnel
manager, explains: 'You lose the convenience of being able to wander down to
the department and fix an itinerary on the spot but the agent is only a
phone call away: we're getting better deals using an agent out-of-house.'
The agent in question, Thomas Cook, sends a courier two or three times a day
to drop off tickets and travellers cheques and each travelling executive
picks up the phone to pass on his/her requirements. 'The traveller is only
doing what they were doing previously, deciding where and when to go, so
it's no extra work,' says Mr Ing. 'We had a lot of resistance from the
travellers initially, but that was only to the change,' he adds.
The BT division, in Southall, Middlesex, employs 70 people, at least half of
whom permanently travel, predominantly to the Pacific region and to Africa.
The combined air and hotel spend annually of this division is around Pounds
4m.
BT has lost the shared overhead of a travel manager, gained the floorspace
the implant took up and is now reaping the benefit of getting the rebates
previously passed direct to the implant.
Mr Ing and his counterpart in finance share the in-house responsibility but
he admits that very little of his time is spent on day-to-day liaison. 'It's
been a gradually improving service over the 15 months,' he says, explaining
that he can exploit Cook's larger network of hotel discounts and airline
deals.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (9): When agent steps on
manager's toes - Responsibilities are shifting in the industry as the
customer-supplier relationship changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ARE TRAVEL managers a dying breed? As recession grips more and more
companies, the specialist function of travel manager is slowly being
absorbed by some companies into other administrative functions and the bulk
of the responsibility is being contracted out to travel management
companies.
Travel purchasing in larger companies over the last five years has been
disappearing into general purchasing departments or financial departments.
In contrast, smaller size companies - which do not have the attendant big
bureaucratic set-ups of their larger counterparts - are generally keeping
this function with, say, the managing director's secretary.
Travel managers have always been the central purchaser of travel as a means
of controlling travel costs. The argument went that one person who centrally
bought travel could therefore have the buying muscle to negotiate more
competitive prices. This has not changed; but it might be a travel agent who
becomes, in effect, the travel manager, reporting to a purchasing manager at
his/her client company.
Any large organisation which spends large sums of money getting its
executives from A to B should procure that travel by a purchasing
specialist. The establishment of such a function within or outside a company
not only creates opportunities for negotiating bulk-buying terms but it also
contributes to the streamlining of administrative procedures which conserve
executive man-hours.
The advantages of such an arrangement are obvious, travelling executives are
relieved of time-consuming chores such as obtaining and checking tickets,
making hote1 reservations, updating passports and processing visa
application forms. The travel manager or travel agent can also organise a
business trip in collaboration with airlines, hoteliers, car hire companies
and travel agents to ensure that the executives arrive comparatively free of
frustration and in optimum working condition.
New technology coupled with a trend of company divestment is now turning the
traditional role of travel manager on its head. The advent of sophisticated
management information captured at point of sale by computer reservation
systems (CRSs) had turned traditional business travel agents into travel
management companies as they try to win business on the strength of having a
better handle on travel costs
It means that, in some cases, the travel manager is reduced merely to
administering the customer-supplier relationship as there is no longer an
in-house travel department. This takes up 30 per cent of a purchasing
manager's time or of that of someone who has a clerical function.
'A comparison can be drawn with the gradual disappearance of in-house
advertising departments in the 1960s, leading to a functionary such as a
marketing manager/director having the customer/supplier relationship with
out-based advertising agencies and media buyers,' explains Mr Richard
Lovell, managing director of business travel agent Wagons-Lits UK.
What has fuelled this trend is those companies divesting themselves of
non-core business. 'It's a way for a company to strip out as much cost and
overheads as possible,' explains Mr Michael Cleeve, former business travel
manager at British Telecom and now head of his own consultancy advising on
travel and expense management.
Business travel agents, or travel management companies as they prefer to be
called nowadays, have picked up new business but they are not all the way
there yet and even some agents would admit that.
'There's a bit of a vacuum left when the travel manager goes and the travel
agent isn't doing all his or her work. There are gaps, particularly in the
processes which link the business traveller with the travel management
company,' says Mr Cleeve.
One problem area is effective communication of the various deals that have
been worked out with the travel suppliers. A generous route deal with an
airline will be lost if none of the travelling executives patronises that
airline. Communicating such deals to large companies with several sites
around the country is difficult.
Mr Cleeve argues that business travel agents should refine a company travel
policy, help build some synergy between the company and itself and
communicate it effectively. 'So often the travel policy and desired practice
are remote from the traveller,' says Mr Cleeve.
As a general rule, travel agents welcome this new-fangled customer-supplier
relationship as it can lead to a clearer definition of responsibilities and
service standards and also clarify how an agent will be paid.
Traditionally, travel agents make their living from commission earned when
booking travel products. But with large accounts, say, those over Pounds 1m
a year and which are simple to manage, a fee-based payment system is often
better. Under this arrangement, an agent invoices his or her customer for
airline tickets, hotel bills and car hire net of commission and instead,
charges a service fee. The fee is a percentage of sales. Alternatively,
companies might find it easier to pay their agent a transaction fee for each
booking. It will all depend on the size of the account.
Clearly, the world of travel management is in upheaval but the increased set
of options spell good news for any company trying to make sense of
containing travel costs.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (11): The luxury of staying at a
small hotel - Nicholas Lander looks at a new phenomenon that has brought
fresh blood into the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH THE British Hospitality Association, the voice of the hotel
industry, is eager to emphasise the importance of the large hotel c o r p o
r a t i o n s - Hilton, InterContinental or Forte - it is also keen to
stress that, despite these major players, most of the hotel industry remains
small-scale and personal.
Of the hotels in the UK, 62 per cent have fewer than 10 bedrooms and remain
privately-owned.
The vast majority of these hotels not only provide their owners with an
income but also, invariably, a small part of the hotel to call their own.
Over the past 20 years, however, there has developed a new phenomenon in the
hotel market - the small luxury hotel.
These have attracted new blood and new finance into the industry. Today, the
most successful count as their managing directors a former TV presenter and
an ex-management consultant.
Some have been purchased with the proceeds from the sale of former
businesses, some with the help of banks keen to lend on what seemed to be
ever-increasing property values, others as a result of business expansion
schemes.
This new blood has also led to far more sophisticated marketing techniques.
In the early 1980s, when the market was booming and Americans were eager to
spend money in British hotels, restaurants and antique shops, many small
hotels began to seek some form of association merely to handle bookings more
efficiently.
The year 1985 was the highpoint but there followed a series of events which
shook the hotel industry: the bombing of Libya, Chernobyl, the Gulf War and
now the recession.
Today, the small luxury hotels need one of the three major marketing
associations to massage the slowly reviving American market and to search
out new customers from Europe and Asia.
Of the three, Pride of Britain is the youngest. Formed in 1982 at the
instigation of Mr Gerald Milsom, proprietor of Maison Talbooth in Essex, it
now boasts 31 hotels and 13 restaurants, all based in the UK. Its emphasis
is on small hotels with 30 rooms or less, which are in private hands and
retain a strong degree of owner-involvement.
From its inception, Pride of Britain targeted the American market via an
association with Abercrombie &amp; Kent, the upmarket British travel agent based
in the US. Every year Mr Tony Elliott, Pride of Britain's chairman, and Mr
Michael Yeo, its chief executive, join the A &amp; K 'roadshow' which over three
weeks takes them round the travel agents of 12 big US cities.
Annual subscription for those accepted into Pride of Britain is around
Pounds 7,000. The main marketing tool is a full colour brochure, which this
year, its 10th anniversary, boasts a foreword by the prime minister. Some
150,000 copies are printed, of which 40,000 go to America and the rest to
representative offices around the world. The association's London flagship,
the Beaufort, received 10 per cent of its bookings last year as a result of
its membership.
Established in 1954, the Relais and Chateaux group is larger and more widely
established - it boasts a print run of 1m copies for its guide and 387
member hotels and restaurants in 40 countries.
Its French origins and its five guiding principles - Character, Courtesy,
Calm, Charm and Cuisine - do mean however that for a small hotel membership
can require considerably more capital investment.
Once accepted, membership can be very influential. At Gidleigh Park in Devon
the guide brings in 13 per cent of their resident business (worth about
Pounds 120,000) compared to a total of 15 per cent as a result of inclusion
in all other guides.
The annual cost depends on the number of rooms and the shield rating (a
highly complicated system based on size and facilities). At Gidleigh Park,
with 15 rooms and a yellow shield, it is approximately Pounds 7,000; at
Chewton Glen in Hampshire, with a gold shield and 58 rooms, the cost is
Pounds 9,000 a year.
Nor is this investment instantly rewarded. Last year when the Capital Hotel
in London joined the group, Mr David Levin, its owner, was told that it
could be three years before he noticed any new business as a result.
Small Luxury Hotels of the World is an organisation which today represents
over 80 hotels around the world as a result of the marriage in 1991 between
the British-based Prestige Hotels of Europe and Small Luxury Hotels and
Resorts of North America.
Of the three organisations Small Luxury Hotels places the strongest emphasis
on marketing to meet changing consumer demand. Its latest catalogue not only
includes a number of cruise ships, an offer of special packages with travel
incentives among member hotels but also a clear listing of conference
facilities for their corporate clients.
There is a minimum initiation fee of Dollars 5,000 to join and a minimum
annual fee for hotels with fewer than 20 bedrooms of Dollars 7,500. All
rooms above 20 are charged at Dollars 285 a room to a maximum of 150.
Other small hotels have used the more personal marketing services of such
firms as Payne and Dagworthy (he ex-Ritz, she ex-Savoy) who will charge
Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 a year for their marketing services. And
others have gone more directly to s o u r c e. For instance, Hartwell House
in Oxfordshire has sought the advice of the Japanese Embassy in London not
only to attract new custom but also to ensure that Japanese guests are
treated as they expect to be with, for example, the men being served first
at the dinner table.
Price is another major marketing factor, but it is one less suitable for the
small hotels. In the bigger, more impersonal hotels there is little chance
of guests discussing their room rates but in the bar of a small hotel this
can only too easily happen and lead to irate customers.
But if discounting is not a viable proposition for the small luxury hotels,
then possibly all-inclusive pricing may be. This has been the policy at the
Beaufort in London since it opened in 1986: one price which includes bed,
breakfast, a free bar and a long list of personal extras such as a
restaurant guide compiled by the owner and membership of a local health
club.
Corporate clients over the past six months include IBM, N o m u r a a n d H
a n s o n. Naturally delighted with this trend, the Beaufort's owner, Ms
Diana Wallis, is only surprised that other hoteliers have not copied her.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (7): A story that ought to be
discounted - Hotel Deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE YOU heard the one about the man who walked into one of London's top
hotels, said he was prepared to pay no more than Pounds 50 a night and was
offered one of the best rooms in the house?
The story, or a variation of it (the man sometimes offers Pounds 75) has
been doing the rounds throughout the current recession. As in all the best
stories, however, the man who paid Pounds 50 a night is difficult to track
down. He is invariably a friend of a second cousin or a neighbour of a
colleague and his name proves oddly elusive.
Mr Michael Ball, marketing director of Utell International, which handles
sales and reservations for 6,500 hotels worldwide, says the wilder
discounting stories began to circulate during the Gulf War, when some
hoteliers began to panic.
But one of the remarkable features of 1991 as a whole was that while hotel
occupancies plunged, the cost of staying in them increased. Mean average
room occupancy in London hotels fell 11.3 points last year to 63.7 per cent
last year, according to a survey by Horwath, the hotel and leisure
consultants. But the achieved average room rate rose 9.5 per cent to Pounds
81.62.
Even in London's luxury hotels, where occupancy fell 14.9 points to 56.4 per
cent, average room rates rose 5 per cent to Pounds 175.06. In England as a
whole, room occupancy fell 6 points to 51 per cent. Room rates rose at a
slightly higher level than inflation, increasing 4.7 per cent to Pounds
51.79.
Although huge discounts might not be available, companies and travelling
employees should not regard the official rates as immutable. The Horwath
survey says: 'A discount culture prevails among consumers and published
tariffs continue to show significant disparities when compared with achieved
room rates.'
That many companies need to reduce their hotel expenditure is not in doubt.
Mr Peter Haigh, Marriott's sales and marketing director for the UK and
Ireland, tells the story of the corporate travel manager at a US bank who
has been instructed to reduce his expenditure by 40 per cent.
For US companies, the weak dollar represents an additional problem, with
managers who travel to regions with stronger currencies having to pay more.
Some hotels in the UK, which rely on the US for much of their business, have
attempted to make life easier for travelling Americans. The Savoy Group,
which gets 50 per cent of its customers from the US, began last November to
offer American guests rooms at a fixed exchange rate of Dollars 1.70 to the
pound.
Executives in the travel industry say there are several ways in which
companies can reduce the amount they spend on hotel bills. Mr J. J. Doran,
head of travel development for Asia, the Middle East and Africa at travel
agents Thomas Cook, says it is generally easier to cut hotel costs than to
reduce the cost of flying. Despite the range of air fares on offer, there is
a greater variety of hotel rates.
Mr Ball says all hotel customers should inquire whether hotels offer a
corporate rate, which can be 10 per cent less than the posted price. The
corporate rate is not only available to guests from large companies.
Increasingly, he says, the corporate rate is obtainable by 'virtually anyone
with a briefcase'.
Managers in the industry say that companies should also find ways of
maximising their bargaining power with hotel groups. Even relatively small
hotels now have computer systems which enable them to assess who their most
frequent and loyal customers are. These are the companies that get the most
attractive discounts and there are ways of becoming a favoured customer.
The more a company uses a hotel, the more likely it is to get a larger
discount. Mr Doran says companies should look at how many hotels they use in
each city. It is usually possible to reduce the number and ensure that more
employees stay at fewer hotels.
But Marriott's Mr Haigh says that the number of room nights booked by
companies is not the only factor that hotels look at when deciding how big
the discount should be. Another important factor is when the customers use
the hotels. Companies which book their managers into hotels during busy
periods only are not as attractive as those who travel all year round.
December and January are lean times for hotels. Companies that use the hotel
during these months and other quiet periods can usually strike good deals
for the year as a whole.
Whether or not companies should decide to eschew expensive hotels altogether
is a more difficult decision. Some worry that customers and potential
customers will not take company managers seriously unless they are staying
in a leading hotel.
Tourist industry officials, however, say that many visitors are staying at
cheaper hotels than they might have used in the past. Mr William Davis,
chairman of the British Tourist Authority, says: 'There is a notable
tendency to trade down. Many overseas visitors are looking for cheaper
accommodation, cutting their length of stay, or even staying with friends
and relations.'
Although the last option is probably not open to many corporate customers,
the Horwath survey also found evidence of business travellers staying in
cheaper hotels.
Mr Doran says companies should decide which of their travelling employees
need to stay in expensive hotels and which could stay in cheaper
establishments without affecting the standing of the company. Less high
profile employees might not need the status and services of a luxury hotel
and might, in any event, welcome the opportunity to stay somewhere less
pretentious and more comfortable.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (8): Hotels must catch up -
Computer Reservations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFORMATION technology for hotels is an immature, fragmented market with
great scope for growth and the refinement of existing products and services.
According to a Mori survey carried out this year for International Business
Mach- ines, the largest hardware supplier to hotels using computers, 70 per
cent of the hotel chains polled were not linked to a computerised reser-
vation system. The survey, of 100 British IT and marketing managers, also
found that only slightly more than half the respondents were taking
advantage of property man- agement systems - those that allocate rooms to
guests and keep track of housekeeping, maintenance and supplies.
'The industry has a bit of catching up to do,' comments Mr Richard
Horsfield, IBM UK's hotel services group manager.
To the extent that the technology is not taken up, travellers are deprived
of the efficiency gains that computers can bring to itinerary planning.
Hoteliers forgo added precision in their management accounts.
Where computers are used, improvements are taking place at the point at
which the customer usually makes his first contact with the electronic net -
the airline- owned ticket reservation systems which also accept hotel and
car hire bookings. Hotels are beginning to opt for direct on-line links with
these systems. Such direct links allow hotels to sell rooms off their own
bat and in tandem with the intermediaries, such as Utell, which market a
substantial portion of some inventories.
'In three years, at the outside, all the leading hotel chains will have such
direct links,' says Mr Carl Holton, head of marketing for the UK arm of
Galileo, the reservation system owned by 11 US and European airlines.
With a direct link, confirmation of room requests is instantaneous, and
elim- inates the potential for lost fax and telex messages which some travel
agents say still adds an element of uncertainty to room bookings.
'We're looking to the day when we can book a hotel room by computer and know
that it is as secure as an airline ticket issued the same way,' says Mr Neil
McNair, information and technologies manager at The Travel Company, a travel
agency.
Another place where more direct computer access is being applied is in the
central reservations systems operated by the hotels themselves. When fully
automated, these process bookings for a whole hotel chain or group at a
single office and send them down the wire to individual properties. Forte
Travelodge takes 12,000 to 14,000 reservations a week on such a system
designed by Innsite, the largest of the hotel software suppliers with 1,500
installations worldwide.
Suppliers appear to be striving hard to match products with hoteliers'
perceived needs. Last year, 98 suppliers (only a fifth of them specialists
in the sector) launched a record 31 new software products into a UK market
worth Pounds 30m, according to a report by Hill Associates, the consulting
firm, in conjunction with the trade journal Caterer &amp; Hotelkeeper. This
effort was probably stimulated by feedback from systems buyers who gave
availability of software to fit their particular business as the single most
important influence on their buying decisions - before price, range of
system features and speed.
Even so, more than a quarter of the hotel and catering businesses analysed
in the Hill report - 74 per cent of whom said computers were essential to
their work - said there was a gap between needs and available systems. 'This
suggests there is a considerable opportunity for further product
development,' the report says.
The future holds the promise of higher spending by hotel groups on
computers. The IBM survey notes that 46 per cent of IT managers intend to
spend more on computers this year than they did in the 12 months to
February.
Holiday Inn is already undertaking a 2 1/2 -year Dollars 60m upgrading of
its hardware and software with the aim of refining its ability to balance a
room rate with vacancies and guests' length of stay. The old system
registered no vacancy if a room at the desired rate was not available on the
first night. The new system will check whether the right type of room is
free on subsequent nights, then pull up a different room (but at the same
price) for the first night. Holiday Inn estimates the new system will
staunch the loss of Dollars 125m in US revenues caused by the old's
inability to factor in guests' length of stay.
When one considers that 45 per cent of all hotel rooms in the world are in
the US, and 53 per cent are in Europe, international sales to North America
and the Continent will be of ongoing importance to IT suppliers in the
sector. At least half a dozen systems designers and software specialists
offer service support in at least one foreign language.
Technology notwithstanding, the hotel business remains one of service and
personal relations. As Mr Marty Silverman, an IT specialist with management
consultants Booz Allen, told an industry conference in London in April: 'IT
won't deliver sustained competitive advantage to the hotel sector unless a
lot of things change around it - the features you advertise, the liaisons
you forge, the way you train your staff.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (6): Fewer suits, fewer hassles -
The Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WENDY SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE aftermath of the Gulf war and a well-entrenched recession which
have dealt hammer blows to the airlines, business travellers are still
taking to the skies in vast numbers on overseas corporate trips. Britain's
Guild of Business Travel Agents, whose members reputedly handle more than 75
per cent of all business air traffic, has announced a Pounds 3.6bn turnover
for 1991, a 4.3 per cent increase on the previous year.
The same story is reflected in the performance of individual airlines. Dan
Air, for example, has announced a 27 per cent increase in its July-August
1992 figures for business travel over the year before.
But what the statistics do not reveal are the marked changes in the profile
and demands of the business traveller in the past couple of years. These
changes have been brought about by shifts in work style and company
structure, the globalisation of industries and, inevitably, tougher controls
on travel budgets.
According to Ms Fiona Stewart of the Henley Centre for Forecasting, there
has been a decline in the 'macho' approach to air travel. 'We are no longer
going to have business class full of grey-suited business men. Today people
are more casual in their dress, there are more female business passengers,
more vegetarians and less interest in the glass of champagne and bag of
goodies.'
Ms Stewart believes that the airlines need to look very closely at these
changes, not only with regard to in-flight service but also on the ground
where the need for convenience also has to be recognised. 'People want a
hassle-free journey to the airport and through the airport,' she says.
But it is not just the profile and requirements of the business traveller
that have changed. The type of person making travel arrangements inside
organisations has changed too, according to British Airways research. 'The
decision in terms of what travel policy should be implemented may previously
have been made by a travel manager or even the personnel department,' says
Mr Kevin Hatton, BA's general manager for UK and Ireland sales. 'But today,
as companies tighten their belts, that same policy will be set by people far
higher up the corporate structure.'
Recession-survivors in an airline industry which has suffered heavy
casualties have responded to a tougher, more demanding marketplace with a
variety of products and services. New technological developments such as CRS
systems have helped corporate clients to manage their travel arrangements
more swiftly and effectively with payments facilitated through a bank
settlement plan: this ensures that the travel agent presents the company
with a single bill while the bank settlement plan sees that all other
parties are paid.
L a r g e r c o m p a n i e s w i t h a guaranteed number of business
passengers can also exercise buying leverage. Many of the airlines admit to
being prepared to offer a favourable rebate: this can be as little as 2 per
cent but in some cases as much as 10 per cent of the bill. According to
Business Traveller magazine, the best deals are to be had on the long-haul
routes where there is more competition between airlines than on short-haul
flights in and around Europe.
Despite the bargaining element that has emerged in the business travel
market, companies such as British Airways and American Airlines are keen to
emphasise the importance of maintaining a good yield on ticket sales to
protect their long-term business. 'We want to be able to secure the best
yield possible,' says Mr Brandon O'Reilly of American Airlines. 'We don't
want the average ticket value to go down and leave us in the position of not
being able to reinvest in our product and service.'
Mr Hatton of BA claims that his airline has turned away business from
companies which has been motivated purely by cost. 'We won't always go to
the bottom rate as it just is not good for us. Without the margin we can't
reinvest.'
The airlines also claim success in doing their homework on what both
business travellers and their employers want from carriers. Virgin Atlantic,
for example, says it has emphasised product value with its Upper Class fare
 -claimed to be first-class travel at business class prices with a free
limousine thrown in - and Mid Class category to appease the traded-down
business class passenger who found himself paying a full economy fare.
Service on the ground has not been neglected, either. KLM has recently
opened a new Pounds 500,000 business class lounge at Heathrow's Terminal 4
complete with fax, phones and free drinks. And the business class traveller
flying between Dubai and the UK with the E m i r a t e s airline will get
free chauffeur-driven car transfers from three British airports. (Emirates,
incidentally, plans to introduce satellite telephone communications for
passengers in its wide-body aircraft.)
Japan Airlines has announced a range of value-added benefits in a bid to win
the loyalty of travellers on its key routes. Its Big Express services
available to first and executive class passengers will include special
baggage arrangements, improved in-flight services and, on arrival, a free
phone loan and priority baggage service.
Gatwick-based Dan Air, meanwhile, is also targeting improvements for the
business traveller. Its Class Elite service offers dedicated airport
lounges, wider seating on the aircraft and priority disembarking. As many as
45 per cent of Dan Air's scheduled flights are business travel. This makes
it a highly important market sector for the airline.
Mr Robin Wilkins, Dan Air's general manager, believes his company's ability
to sustain customer loyalty lies with the provision of more flights at more
convenient times and more support on the ground. 'It is the interchanges in
air travel that cause the problems. Our aim is to be able to provide a
seamless service,' he explains.
American Airlines, which claims to be the largest US airline operating in
the UK, also lists a wide range of business travel benefits, from a special
Admirals Club equipped with personal computers, fax machines, telephones and
meeting rooms to an air miles credit scheme and priority baggage handling.
Across the board, the picture is that the airlines have become serious about
meeting the needs of the business traveller and the companies which foot the
bill. But are they getting the complete package right? Mr George Paton, a
member of the Guild of Business Travel Agents, believes they are: 'The
airlines are aware that we are in an age of the consumer and that they have
to produce a product to suit a market and attitude that wasn't prevalent 15
years ago. The airlines have very sophisticated marketing policies. The ones
that will succeed are those who truly understand the market.'
Travel agents are, of course, the first link in the chain for the business
traveller. A good one will be able to secure the best deals and negotiate a
path through the maze of special prices, exclusive lounges and bonus
incentives on the ground and in the air. The choice is becoming more complex
and bewildering all the time as airlines fight for market share and premium
yield on tickets. But on long-haul flights at least, the bargains are out
there.

DO YOU know your company's policy towards travelling on business? Does it
even have a formal travel policy?
For many executives, the answer to both questions is decidedly in the
negative. While business travel and associated costs such as entertainment
and lodgings represent significant expenditure for companies large and
small, the approach to controlling these expenses has been largely dilatory
over the past decade.
'Business travel is more often than not a company's third largest
controllable expenditure after information technology and salaries,' points
out Mr Graeme Payne, director of Reed Travel Training, which runs courses in
business travel planning for secretaries and in-house travel organisers.
'Yet in spite of the recession, corporate travel policies are still much
less in evidence in Europe than America,' he adds.
But Europe is catching up. The latest biennial American Express survey of
corporate travel practices - the fifth in the series - reveals that for the
first time a slight majority (52 per cent) of the 400 companies surveyed had
a formal written travel policy. A further 43 per cent said they had informal
guidelines only, while one in 20 of those surveyed had no travel policy at
all.
Analysis of the Amex survey shows that over a quarter (29 per cent) of
companies with 20 or more employees who travel regularly on business had a
formal policy, rising to 71 per cent for companies with 50 or more
travelling staff. By type of industry, the Amex survey shows that service
companies are most likely to have a formal policy, while distribution
companies are least likely to have one.
Formulating a travel policy is, according to the survey, usually done by the
board or management committee - cited by some 62 per cent of companies
sampled by Amex. In larger companies, however, it is sometimes an
administration or personnel function which formulates the policy.
Top management support is vital for having a successful policy. 'This
support can be gained in many ways, although the most effective is to carry
out an audit of the company's expense claims and travel and entertainment
expenditure,' points out Mr Jim Jamison, Amex's executive vice-president for
travel management services. 'By auditing a random sample of reports, the
company will have a far better picture of current travel practices, areas of
waste or abuse and opportunities for cost savings.'
But he warns of the danger of operating a travel policy half-heartedly.
'Many companies make the mistake of wanting to save travel costs but not
being willing to make any real sacrifices to achieve this. Such indecision
can render any travel policy unworkable.'
Moreover, when formulating a policy it is important to gain the support of
all those involved in the travel management process - including travellers,
secretaries who book travel, managers who authorise the expenditures and
personnel, finance and audit staff. Many policies fail because they are
imposed from above without any reference to those actually involved in the
travel.
Of course, the biggest drawback to a policy working successfully in practice
comes from business travellers themselves. As more and more companies
attempt to restrict travel in business and first-class on airlines, for
example, so executives seek ways round the policy.
'Travel is a highly personal business and nearly every executive has
personal views and preferences about the type of hotel airline and so on,'
points out Mr Richard LoveIl, managing director of Wagons-Lits Travel,
formerly Pickfords Business Travel.
He cites the example of companies which restrict all air journeys of six
hours or under to economy class, except where the traveller has a medical
reason such as a bad back to fly business class. 'This has led to a
proliferation of bad backs in the business world,' he suggests.
Flying is one of the major direct costs of business travel and therefore an
area where travel policy is most keenly applied. Some three-quarters of
companies in the Amex survey with a formal travel policy also exercised
control over employees' air travel.
However, that can be the area of management control which most irritates
executive travellers. Why, they argue, should they be increasingly forced to
fly economy class when this leaves them exhausted on arrival from coping
with cramped seats, noisy children and 'back-packing' tourists? This is an
issue where excessive concern with controlling costs can sometimes work
against the effective carrying out of business.
But there is a further complication. Many airlines seek to avoid corporate
travel policies by selling direct to a traveller who has the incentive, for
example, of a free economy ticket if a business class seat is booked. 'Such
methods are a source of considerable irritation to much of travel management
since it is well nigh impossible for a company to benefit from these
incentives,' points out Mr LoveIl.
Moreover, there is the incentive of frequent flyer programmes. Many
executives insist on flying with a particular airline to gain benefits such
as Air Miles (from British Airways) or those schemes offered by US carriers.
Few companies, it seems, ask their executives for the frequent flyer points
to be allocated to the company.
A travel policy, however, should not be viewed as just a means of
determining the class of airline flight or quality of hotel. The policy
should cover all aspects of travel management: from the planning of the
journey, through to those making the actual arrangements, on to the funding
and payment systems used, and to how the expenses are reconciled.
It is also important to ensure that all those involved are given a written
copy of the policy: where companies rely on 'word of mouth' to spread the
policy, then misinterpretations easily (and sometimes intentionally) arise.
The policy should also, where feasible, be given to any regular travel
suppliers, such as hotels, car rental companies, and travel agents. It
should be regularly monitored - often with the help of management
information supplied by business travel agents or charge card operators  -
and regularly reviewed, perhaps on an annual basis or more often if market
conditions are changing rapidly.
Perhaps the most important point about a travel policy, however, is
identified by the Amex survey. This emphasises that a travel policy will
only bring about cost savings if it is actually applied in practice. The
survey found that 51 per cent of companies claimed to have negotiated
special rates for hotel accommodation - yet only 39 per cent actually
stipulated which hotels their staff should use. American Express said it was
'puzzled' why a 'sizeable number of companies do not insist on employees
using the very hotels for which favourable rates had been specially
negotiated'.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (3): The route to Atlantic
discounts - Case Study of Lilliput Lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR TOO many chief executives of small and medium-sized companies, a travel
policy goes no further than asking a secretary to book a hotel and an
aeroplane ticket. This is both inefficient and expensive. The competition
currently gripping the airline and hotel industries has flushed out plenty
of bargain deals aimed at businessmen, who have the reputation of being
frequent travellers with generous budgets.
Mr John Russell runs Lilliput Lane, a Penrith-based company with a turnover
of Pounds 12m. Its business is manufacturing small model houses - English
country cottages, Scottish castles and the like - for the gift and
collectables market. There is a growing demand for such decorative
accessories, especially in the US, and turnover has grown steadily in the 10
years of trading.
Around 30 per cent of sales are overseas, mainly to the US, which means that
Mr Russell travels the Atlantic every other month. Until 1989 travel was
arranged on an ad hoc basis but then, through social contacts, he signed up
with North Shields based specialists Dawson Sanderson, through which he now
funnels all his travel and accommodation needs. Lilliput Lane gets discounts
on its travel - and a much more efficient service personally handled by a
senior executive in the travel agency.
Lilliput Lane is a beneficiary of the arrival of new US carriers flying the
Atlantic, in particular American Airlines. Since its arrival over two years
ago, it has attempted to build up regular clients by offering companies like
Lilliput Lane discount deals, which are unavailable on British Airways for
companies of this size.
Mr Russell spends around Pounds 150,000 of his total annual travel budget of
Pounds 250,000 on crossing the Atlantic and touring the US, mainly flying
from Manchester. By hitting fixed expenditure targets, he qualifies for
discounts on American Airlines which can be taken in the form of free
tickets. The fact that the deal covers travel inside the US helps boost his
mileage.
He could use the bonus for upgrades, but prefers to stay in business class.
Sometimes junior executives fly economy on the bonus tickets. On routes to
Europe and south-east Asia, where competition is less intense, there are
fewer opportunities to save money.
Mr Russell has discovered, through Dawson Sanderson, that discounts are
readily available in hotels. So intense is the competition in the US that
savings of up to 50 per cent can usually be found in the cities he visits on
business. The agency uncovers the best room rates. Of course on arrival
individual hotels, now often run on a franchise basis, would probably be
prepared to offer even greater discounts if there are rooms available. But
most businessmen do not want to get involved in haggling at the desk.
Dawson Sanderson acts as a catalyst for Lilliput Lane. It is the go-between
on the arrangement between the company and American Airlines, but Lilliput
Lane also shares in the discounts that the travel agency obtains through its
contacts and working arrangements with other carriers flying to Europe,
south-east Asia and elsewhere. So there are one-to-one deals and general
discounts to be gained from the relationship.
Another tangible benefit for Lilliput Lane is that its employees can enjoy
savings on their holiday travel by booking through Dawson Sanderson - the
service covers the entire workforce.
And all this costs nothing. Dawson Sanderson takes its profit from the
carriers and the hotels. Indeed, Mr Russell is starting to receive discounts
from the travel agency in recognition of the amount of business he is
putting its way. Mr George Paton, who runs Dawson Sanderson, acknowledges
that the business travel agency world is becoming as competitive as the
transatlantic air trade and that loyal clients should enjoy some of the
benefits from the deals available.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (2): The aim of a global ring -
Computer Reservation Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER RESERVATION systems are helping to change the way that business
travel is organised. They are a crucial marketing tool for the airlines
which own them and they help travel agents provide more flexible, efficient
and global customer services.
Increasingly, they also supply the data needed to operate, analyse and
oversee corporate travel policies.
From their origins in the US in the 1970s, computer reservation systems
(CRSs) have evolved into far more than electronic airline timetables. Today
a travel agent can call up a customer's 'profile' on a system's central or
'core' computer, check late seat availability on different airlines, arrange
a complex itinerary, print out tickets, book hotels and car hire - and do it
all from a desktop personal computer plugged into a telephone line.
To provide this level of features and sophistication, CRS operators have had
to assemble some of the most powerful and expensive non-governmental
computer centres in the world.
For example, Air France, Iberia Airlines of Spain and Lufthansa German
Airlines invested Ecu 450m in start-up costs for Amadeus, the European CRS
which began commercial operations at the end of last year. Amadeus itself
has spent a further Ecu 400m on buildings, hardware and software.
This year Amadeus expects to break even with about 100m bookings, having
reached the requisite 'critical subscriber mass'. But even before Amadeus
began full operations it lost one of its shareholders when Scandinavian Air
Systems decided to pull out.
Inevitably, with entry costs on this scale, and the continuing demands of
travel agents for expanded global coverage by system operators, there has
already been some consolidation among the competing CRSs.
Last autumn a planned partnership between Sabre, the world's largest CRS,
which is owned by American Airlines, and A m a d e u s fell apart
acrimoniously because of last-minute disagreements, described by Amadeus at
the time as 'fundamental differences of strategy'.
Subsequently two other CRSs, Apollo of the US and UK-based Galileo,
announced plans to merge, forming a new Dollars 1.5bn company called Galileo
International owned by 11 airlines including BA, United Airlines, KLM,
Swissair and Alitalia.
Then earlier this month Amadeus, Worldspan, owned by Delta, Northwest and
TWA of the US, and Abacus, owned by five Asian airlines, announced a
co-operation agreement under which they will interconnect their respective
computer reservation systems. (Worldspan and Abacus also have stakes in each
other.)
'No system has the capacity or resources to be competitive on every
continent,' explains Mr Miguel Vermeheren, Amadeus' director of corporate
communications. But travel agencies are increasingly forming international
groupings, so CRSs must follow suit.
Initially, this technical link will enable travel agencies with branches or
affiliations on different continents to share customer records with their
partners abroad. Agencies with authorisation will be able to look at a
booking record made on any of the three systems, and make out a new booking
if necessary. Eventually, travel agents will be able to transfer and change
an original customer booking record if, for example, a traveller alters
plans while en route.
'The connection  .. is a major breakthrough in Amadeus' strategy to achieve
a global ring of computer reservation systems which can fully cover the
requirements of travel a g e n c i e s and t r a v e l l e r s worldwide,'
says Mr Jose Antonio Tazon, Amadeus' chief executive. 'We believe that the
demands of today's travel industry need fuller coverage than is presently
provided.'
Indeed, business travellers are increasingly demanding one level of travel
management across the globe, and using technology is often the only way
smaller travel agencies can deliver it. Many travel agents also believe
that, even after the recent flurry of mergers and agreements, further
consolidation among the CRSs is likely.
Mr Don Lunn, chairman of the UK-based Guild of Business Travel Agents' t e c
h n i c a l working party, says: 'It has always been my view that ultimately
we will see just two global systems, and they will also have to 'talk' to
each other.' Indeed, many industry analysts believe the number of CRSs could
shrink to two or three as soon as 1995.
Like most other travel agents, Mr Lunn would prefer to see some competition
maintained between systems, if only to provide some negotiating leverage on
charges.
Using a PC to access a modern CRS such as Amadeus, which is connected to
airlines' own computer systems by high speed data links, provides the
business travel agency with other competitive advantages.
For example, providing the CRS can provide direct 'real time' access to an
airline's internal reservation system it is possible to check late seat
availability and make immediately confirmed bookings.
But as Mr Malcolm Grubb, technical director for Wagons-Lits Travel, says:
'It also allows us to p r o v i d e a very tailored service to traveller and
client.' The travel agency can build up corporate and customer profiles held
in the CRS, for example detailing what company policy is on flight class or
airline, and whether the traveller is a smoker or requires special meals.
By adding in its own management information system software running on the
PC travel agents can also capture data from the CRS and then manipulate and
analysis it on behalf of a corporate client. In some cases they may be able
to use the data to negotiate better deals with airlines or other service
providers.
CRSs also play an important role in what their airline owners call
'inventory control' or maximising revenues from each seat, a vital ability
in the fiercely competitive air fare market.
For example, airlines struggle each day to cut prices enough to sell seats
on transatlantic flights while keeping them high enough to make money. The
dividing line between success and failure is very fine. American Airlines
has said that one extra passenger on every flight adds Dollars 114m to
revenues and almost that much to profits.
Established successful computer reservation systems, such as American's
Sabre, can also be an important source of airline revenues in their own
right. Sabre takes bookings for 1.6m flights daily and handles 20 times that
many inquiries on 740 airlines. Last year Sabre's turnover was about Dollars
550m - more than American Airline's entire cargo operation - in spite of the
Gulf War and recession-induced slump in air traffic.
The attractions of owning and operating an established CRS have helped make
them targets for scrutiny by rivals and by regulators - spurred on by
allegations of bias in the way systems display data.
Early CRSs in particular were built around an airline's internal computer
reservation systems. Not only did these 'hosted' systems list the parent
airline's flights first, something which has now been outlawed by the
regulators, they also only provided real time or live access to flight
information from the parent airline. Information from other competing
airlines, although shown on the system, is only as good as the last update.
These and other concerns about competition were behind a vote last month in
the US House of Representatives which approved legislation aimed at
weakening the grip of American and United Airlines over CRS flight bookings
in the US. About 70 per cent of US flights are currently booked through the
systems owned by the two airlines.
The bill, which is opposed by the Bush administration, would make it easier
for travel agents to switch to other systems and require that travel agents
be able to book, with equal ease, flights on any airline regardless of whose
system is being used.
Proponents of tougher CRS supervision on both sides of the Atlantic say
legislation is necessary to prevent CRS owners from using their control to
undermine airline competition.
Although all CRS owners are adamant that their own systems have no
favourites, their critics are unlikely to go away. The pressures on airlines
to dilute ownership through further CRS mergers, or set up their systems as
independent companies, are therefore likely to grow.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (4): VAT refunded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY companies are unaware that they may be entitled to a refund of taxes
paid when their employees travel in Europe for business purposes. If a
company has one or two business trips a year, in all likelihood it is
missing the opportunity to recover substantial amounts of money to which it
is legally due.
In the past two years, many European countries - specifically, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK - have
adopted legislation allowing foreign corporations to obtain a refund of VAT
paid on business-related services used by their employees travelling for
business reasons. These services include hotel accommodation, meals, car
rentals, conferences and trade shows. All these countries have also set up a
retroactive claim period, allowing a company to go back six or 12 months
(depending on the country) for refund purposes.
To date, few companies have taken advantage of the opportunity to reclaim
because of the complexity of the rules and the time-consuming tax refund
application process.
However, Meridian Reclaim Services claims it can make the process simple. It
offers to handle all the necessary paperwork to process a VAT refund
application, including assisting companies in organising past claims as well
as setting up procedures to enable them to recapture future VAT
expenditures.
The service is cost-free to the company if Meridian fails to obtain a
refund. All the work is done by Meridian, so the company has nothing -
neither time nor money - to lose.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (1): Controlling costs - While
business travel shows some signs of increasing in spite of the recession,
companies are still under increasing pressure to control travel costs. David
Churchill reports on how the lifestyle of the travelling executive is
changing
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DILEMMA for hotels, airlines and other suppliers of the business travel
market at present is that while there are signs of a greater volume of
executive travel, there is consistent and steady pressure by companies to
reduce their travel costs.
After a decade when travel has grown to become one of the major, but least
controlled, costs of doing business - British companies are estimated to
spend more than Pounds 18bn a year on corporate travel and associated costs
 -the impact of recession is forcing virtually all companies to impose a far
stricter form of travel management than ever before.
The impact of tighter travel management at a time when more executives are
actually having to travel to win new business means, for example, that
hoteliers are seeing their achieved room rates significantly below published
rack rates and airlines face a declining yield on seats filled.
'There is no doubt that the demand for business travel has increased
significantly this year in spite of the recession,' says Mr David Whittaker,
chairman of the Guild of Business Travel Agents.
'But, equally, companies are looking hard at ways of getting the best buy
and so some executives may not be travelling in the comfort they are used
to.'
Mr Eric Brannan, American Express's general manager for travel in the UK,
reports a general trend by companies to drive down costs while recognising
in some cases that this can lead to tired and disgruntled executives. 'One
major company has told all its managers that while they can now only travel
economy class anywhere in the world, they can allow for an extra two nights'
hotel accommodation to take account of jet lag and tiredness,' he says.
This drive to reduce corporate travel costs is echoed by Wagons-Lits
Business Travel, part of one of the major travel groups in western Europe.
Its analysis of business travel spending by companies shows that since May,
there has been a fall of between 2 and 4 per cent in such expenditure.
'Many large companies are radically cutting the amount of money spent on
travel,' says Mr Richard LoveIl, managing director of Wagons-Lits Business
Travel. 'This does not mean they are travelling less; rather, it shows the
impact of downgrading from business class seats to economy on aeroplanes,
staying in cheaper hotels for less time, and hiring smaller and cheaper
cars.'
Wagons-Lits says there has been a continuous decline in the average
corporate spend on all areas of business travel since the middle of 1991 -
with the exception of rail travel in the UK. 'This could be due to
executives switching from domestic air travel to rail,' adds Mr LoveIl.
For the hotel industry, hoteliers have been encouraged this year by a rise
in occupancy levels but at a cost of reduced room rates. This is the reverse
of last year's experience, when occupancies fell but rates remained firm.
'The industry reports better occupancy figures but margins are under
pressure from companies trying to secure the best deals,' says Mr Geoff
Parkinson, managing director of Horwath Consulting, a leading hotel
consultancy and a division of Stoy Hayward.
Hyatt International, one of the main worldwide hotel chains aiming at the
business market, reports a marked change in the attitude of the
international business traveller. 'No longer are they just picking up the
phone and booking their favourite hotel,' says Mr Allan Edgar, Hyatt's
marketing director for Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 'Instead, they
are doing a great deal of research, looking for tactical offers and
promotions which may be available.'
But trading down by executives is not all gloom for the travel industry. Mr
Bryan Langton, chief executive of Holiday Inn Worldwide, the world's largest
hotel group owned by British brewers Bass, says that Holiday Inn's
mid-market appeal has helped boost occupancy levels and margins this year.
'As major companies worldwide look to cut their travel costs, their
executives are moving from the luxury market to mid-priced properties which
offer everything they want at a price they can afford.'
International airlines have also been badly affected by the corporate moves
to curtail travel costs by trading down. While international passenger
numbers so far this year are some 8 per cent higher than last year's Gulf
War-affected market, there is still excess capacity forcing airlines on
competitive routes such as the North Atlantic to discount prices to fill
seats, reducing the yield from the flight at the same time.
Even though economy seats may not be the most convenient for business
travellers, because of the restrictions on their use, the airlines are
worried about their uptake by executives under cost restrictions. Hence the
continued strenuous attempts to woo business class passengers (many airlines
are virtually giving up trying in first class, where it is said that less
than one in five of the seats is filled by a full-fare paying passenger).
Cathay Pacific, for example, has just increased the size of its business
class seats and is one of many airlines now offering a free limousine
service to, as well as sometimes from, the airport.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic has tried another approach: it now
provides full-fare paying economy passengers - typically business travellers
who need the flexibility of a full-fare ticket - a special Mid Class seating
section. These seats are as spacious as most other airlines' business class
seats, but the food is economy standard.
But trading down from luxury to budget hotels or business to economy class
on airlines is only a short-term solution to the pressure on travel costs.
In a crisis many executives have no option but to toe the company line: yet
most companies know it does not take managers long to find loopholes in the
system.
Hence moves by companies to develop a more structured approach to travel
management, thus controlling costs in the long term, rather than by
short-term blanket restrictions. But according to a recent survey by
American Express of over 400 leading British companies, nearly half still do
not have a formal travel policy which tells staff the type and cost of
business travel they can undertake. In contrast, most US companies have some
sort of formal travel policy.
Not surprisingly, effective travel management is a niche which the large
business travel agency chains are keen to promote. They increasingly offer
even more sophisticated management information systems to help companies
monitor and control travel costs.
While most of these systems have been aimed at large-scale corporate
purchasers of travel, Thomas Cook has recently specially targeted medium to
smaller sized companies - which spend Pounds 600,000 or less a year on
business travel.
Yet the trend in the 1990s in travel management is towards globalisation of
the business. 'Major multinational companies increasingly demand from their
travel agencies a global network so that they can arrange, monitor and
control their travel costs worldwide,' points out Mr Whittaker from the
GBTA. Hence the moves by the leading travel groups - such as the world's top
five, Amex, Carlson, Wagons-Lits, Thomas Cook and the Japan Travel Bureau -
to establish international networks through acquisition.
New technology may be the key to such globalisation of business travel
management - in particular, the development by airlines and hotels of
sophisticated computer reservation systems. Mr Roy Burnham,. managing
director for the Worldspan CRS operation, one of a number of competing
systems, points out that 'the average time it takes at present to organise
one business travel arrangement is 20 minutes and that usually means at
least four telephone calls'.
But, he adds, a computer reservation system can cut that time and cost down
significantly and give more information. 'When corporate travel buyers are
linked to it electronically via a travel agent or through their own
computers, they can check information about flights, hotels and car hire and
can make bookings quickly and easily.'
Yet while more effective travel management has been given a boost by the
recession, there remains the danger that in the corporate enthusiasm to
control costs, the purpose of travel may be forgotten. Travel, even at
executive level, is tiring and stressful; company accountants and travel
managers would do well to remember that at the end of the day it is on its
business travellers that the fortunes of the company often depend.

Winner: Stephen Bullock, managing director, Action International Marketing
Services.
Venture capital backer: Tim Levett, Northern Venture Managers, Newcastle.
Action International Marketing Services, has a record for pioneering new
marketing techniques in the highly competitive field of pharmaceutical
marketing. Starting in 1989, the company now has a strong client list, which
includes such big names as Roussel-Uclaf, Parke-Davis, Pfizer and
Schering-Plough. Strategically located near Heathrow, it derives roughly
half its turnover from overseas business. The company is confident it can be
in the top five medical communications agencies in Europe in terms of market
share by next year
Large start-up
Winners: Jamie Gibson and Adrian Breger, joint managing directors, Breger
Gibson
Venture capital backer: Philip Goodwin, 3i, Manchester.
Breger Gibson produces a range of innovative baby's nappy products and has
risen in only six years to number one position in the UK private label
sector, supplying a number of big supermarket and drug store chains. An
exciting new product is due for launch shortly which should see the company
gaining further market share.
Management buy-in/turnaround
Winner: John Shannon, executive chairman, Country Casuals.
Venture capital backer: William Brown, Invesco MIM Development Capital.
Following a management buy-in from textile group Coats Viyella in 1989, a
new management team has managed to turn around the trading performance of
the womens fashion retailer,increasing profits each year despite the severe
retail depression. The company has been given a strong design philosophy and
a clear target market has been identified.
Small management buy-out
Winner: David Mace, managing director, Sealife Centre (Holdings).
Venture capital backer: Michael Killingley, KPMG Peat Marwick, Southampton.
From one centre opened in Oban in 1979, the Sealife Centre concept has
spread to eight other locations around the British coast, attracting in 1991
a total of 2m visitors. The centres have broken new ground by producing
imaginative and innovative marine life displays which aim to educate and
involve as well as interest and excite visitors. Plans include possible
moves to the Continent with joint venture partners.
Large management buy-outs
Winner: Richard Atkinson, managing director, Eurocamp.
Venture capital backer: Leslie Allan, Barclays Development Capital.
Eurocamp has prospered in the tough travel business by offering a
tailor-made service to holidaymakers looking for a top-quality campsite
holiday in fully-equipped tents or mobile homes. It now offers its 300,000
customers, 40 per cent of whom come from outside the UK, a choice from more
than 250 sites. Founded in 1974 and based in Knutsford, Cheshire, the
company was acquired by Combined English Stores in 1981 and then passed into
the ownership of Next when it bought CES. In 1988 the opportunity for a
management buy-out presented itself, since when turnover has increased by 85
per cent and profits have doubled.
Expansion
Winner: Peter Hall, chairman and chief executive, Industrial Control
Services.
Venture capital backer: Robert Lucas, 3i, Cambridge.
Industrial Control Services operates in the hostile environment of the North
Sea. Founded in 1968 the company's products monitor continuous industrial
processes for faults, fire, gas and variances against acceptable
performance. Some 80 per cent of the installed safety systems in the North
Sea has been manufactured by the company and its technology is now gaining
widespread acceptance in shore based petrochemical and other industries.
The company - which employs more than 1,000 people - obtained a listing on
the stock exchange in May this year and has built up exports to more than 30

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (13): An entrepreneurs' guide - Raising
Capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST fund-raising proposals put to venture capitalists end up in the waste
paper basket. If the venture firm is not too cramped for office space, they
may survive, stacked up in the cellar. The problem investments (many made
during the late 1980s) have made venture capitalists even more cautious
about backing untried ventures.
A management background is usually required - entrepreneurial enthusiasm is
no longer enough - and most venture capitalists are happier providing
established businesses with expansion finance than with backing entirely new
ventures.
Many venture capitalists claim that their best deals come through personal
contacts and professional networks. If you have built up a reputation in
your industry or cultivated members of the venture capital community, so
much the better. Use these contacts to the full, if only to obtain an
informal assessment of your business idea.
If you have not established such contacts, your first approach to a venture
capitalist may have to be by means of your business plan, sent through the
post.
Individual venture capitalists estimate that they only back between 1 and 2
per cent of the business plans they receive, so your plan needs a lot of
thought.
Firstly, make it easy for the venture capitalist to read. Preface your plan
with a two-page summary which will allow him to get the feel for your
proposal and tell him how much money you need. Do not burden your plan with
excessive detail.
Computers have made it only too easy to compute endless 'what if' scenarios,
but as every venture capitalist knows, forecasts can be made to come up with
any result the forecaster wants.
The plan should tell the reader what you are going to do; who is going to do
it; how you are going to do it; why you will be doing it that way; and when
you will do it. To put it more technically, the plan should explain the
product or service, the background and experience of the managers, the
market, the operational structure and the financial history and projections.
Where some entrepreneurs go wrong is to explain the product or service in
great detail, but to ignore the people who will be carrying out the plan.
Tell the venture capitalist about yourself and your team. Good managers can
do a lot with an indifferent product or service: poor managers can fail with
the most brilliant of innovations.
By the same token, clever technical people can become absorbed by the
features of the product they intend to launch and completely ignore the need
for marketing expertise or financial management skills. The team and the
plan must show a balance.
WHO should write the plan? Some would-be entrepreneurs hand the whole thing
over to their accountants. The result may be financial models of exquisite
beauty but a lack of 'heart.' No entrepreneur can expect to defend a plan
drawn up by someone else when the venture capitalist makes his inevitable
criticisms.
Use your accountant to help out with the financial projections but make sure
the plan reflects your personality and ideas.
Who should you send the plan to? The proliferation of venture capital
companies (temporarily arrested by the recession) has made it difficult to
identify the most suitable recipients. But it is important that you target
only those venture firms most likely to respond positively. A bulk-mailing
to every one on the British Venture Capital Association's membership list
will not add to the credibility of your proposal.
Venture capitalists are sometimes willing to express a preference for
particular industry sectors (see table, page six), but few are willing to
specialise in too narrow a field for fear of piling all their fledgling
companies into one nest.
The terms of the deal which the venture capitalist offers may well be an
overriding consideration if you are lucky enough to receive competing
offers. But other, less tangible factors should also carry considerable
weight. Does the venture capitalist have experience of investing in your
type of business? Does his firm have the skills to provide back-up if things
go wrong? And does he have the resources to provide follow-up finance?
Of crucial concern will be the value that the venture capitalist puts on
your company. This will depend on the stage it is at - valuing start-up
companies involves a large amount of guesswork - and the degree to which it
already possesses tangible assets.
In calculating a price/earnings ratio, the venture capitalist will make
deductions because your business is unquoted (and hence not readily
saleable); because your business will lack the product and geographical
diversity which cushions more established companies; because the business
has a shorter track record; and because the management is probably less
experienced than that of a larger, quoted company.
He will increase his estimate of its value if the product or service has
bright prospects; is positioned in a fashionable sector; and he faces
competition from other venture capitalists.
By calculating the value of your company, the venture capitalist can then
work out his projected return, usually referred to as his internal rate of
return or IRR.
His IRR calculation will depend on the risk associated with the business
proposal; the length of time his money will be tied up; the ease with which
he believes he will be able to realise his investment; and the existence of
competing venture capitalists.
Raising the funding, however time-consuming and exhausting, is only the
start of the venture capital relationship.
Once the contracts are signed, you must come to terms with the fact that you
have committed yourself to following an agreed strategy and business plan;
to reporting regularly to one or more outside shareholders; to providing
your investor with an ambitious return; and to getting on with a new board
member with a different set of expectations and responsibilities.
And you thought the bank manager was difficult]

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (12): Still doing good business despite the
recession - UK Regional Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS difficult to find any gloom among venture capital providers outside
London and southern England. Britain's regional network of funds has been
doing good business throughout the recession because it is well suited to
what market there is to work in.
These are the tiddlers of the industry: funds are small, but so are deals.
Regional funds stepped into an equity gap too small for high-overhead London
funds to fill. Moreover, most regional deals require the sort of local
knowledge and contacts that national or international London-based funds do
not have.
In the recession, strong trends have emerged in the regions' favour. They
show in the figures: excluding 3i, about Pounds 1.42bn was invested at the
1989 national market peak, but this dropped to Pounds 989m last year, a
plunge of 30 per cent.
Since the number of deals fell by only 8 per cent - from 1,302 to 1,196 -
there had to be a fall in the value of investments made by each fund. This
amounted to 24 per cent - from Pounds 11.5m in 1989 to Pounds 8.7m last
year.
Of the Pounds 989m invested last year, 28 per cent was in the Midlands and
north, or Pounds 277m. This was up on the 1990 figure (Pounds 256m), itself
representing a national share of 23 per cent. However, from the volume point
of view, the same regions' share of the 1,196 deals in 1991 was 34 per cent,
or 406. The comparative figures for 1990 were 29 per cent and 354.
The trend, therefore, is for more deals in the regions where recession has
not impacted as badly as in the south, but at lower individual value.
The difference this represents on the recession of 1980-82 is that there was
no regional venture capital network at all in those days, apart from 3i's
branch offices.
Indeed, our listing on this page shows more than 60 sources of funds in the
regions, most of which have come into being only since the mid-1980s. Most
are small, having only Pounds 5m to Pounds 20m each to invest. This in turn
means that none is likely to put more than Pounds 1m - 5 per cent of a
Pounds 20m fund - into any single deal.
However, most of what deals there have been in the last year have nearly all
been within range of funds this size. Moreover, the way the bulk are now
clustered around the emergent regional financial centres of Manchester,
Leeds, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow means they can easily syndicate
quite large deals among themselves.
None of these centres needs to go anywhere else to raise Pounds 20m now,
while even five or six years ago they would have had to have help from
London.
As the London-based Mr Charles Sherwood of Schroder Ventures, puts it: 'If
you have a small deal in, say, Leeds and don't need anything more than
generalised venture capital skills, why even think of taking it outside
Yorkshire?
'We don't have the ability to respond quickly to deals outside London and we
don't have enough regular contact with intermediaries in regional centres to
develop trust between them and our funds,' he adds.
Figures from 3i reinforce the general picture. North-west investments by 3i
were Pounds 44m in 1991-92, compared with Pounds 12m the previous year.
The respective figures for Yorkshire and Humberside were Pounds 29m and
Pounds 18m, and for the north-east, Pounds 18m and Pounds 13m.
Mr Charles Richardson, 3i's director for the north and Scotland, says there
are three reasons for the growth. Prices are more realistic and lower, large
companies have become keener to dispose of non-core activities as the
recession has deepened, and there has been an increase in management buyouts
and buy ins from parent companies in receivership.
3i says there has also been a shift in attitudes favouring equity capital,
especially with the banks reluctant to lend and many companies wanting to
avoid the mistakes of the 1980s by becoming overgeared and incapable of
responding to upturn.
One of its bigger regional deals was the Pounds 27m buyout of Standard
Fireworks of West Yorkshire from Scottish Heritable Trust. Less spectacular,
but no less important, was the purchase by its management of Samuel Banner,
a Liverpool solvents and chemicals blender.
Other deals included the Pounds 15m buyout of Mark Birkbeck Holdings, a
Lancashire retailer and wholesaler of natural fibre leisurewear, and the
buyout of the Cheshire-based Taco Holdings, one of the UK's largest
independent manufacturers of polythene film.
Mr Jonathan Diggines heads Murray Johnstone's Manchester office, which also
manages Ventures North West, the investment capital fund of the Greater
Manchester Pensions Authority - 'our experience shows good deals can be
done, even in deep recession,' he says.
He was involved in the 3i-led support of the management buyout of
housebuilder George Langdon from Whitecroft, the Wilmslow conglomerate,
which has been restructuring to get through the recession. The housebuilder
is doing well because northern prices never bubbled and have not declined
significantly - in sharp contrast to the south.
Murray Johnstone's biggest deal this year was the purchase of the
Salford-based Canadian Pizza from its north American parent. It underwrote
more than Pounds 9m of funding and has happily hung on to Pounds 7.5m of
investment after letting other funds in on the deal.
Ventures North West even achieved its first successful exit, following the
return to successful health of Alexander Drew, a textile finisher bought out
from the failing Coloroll group in 1989 in a deal that also involved Morgan
Grenfell, Charterhouse and Deutsche Bank.
Mr Edmund Johnston runs one of Britain's smallest regional funds, Ulster
Development Capital in Belfast, which is backed mainly by two Dublin pension
funds and four British insurance companies. It has been revolving its
returns since starting in 1985 and has done 20 deals from a base fund of
only Pounds 1m.
'Admittedly it's from a low base, but we are finding more activity and
optimism. There's not much new stuff: likely deals are usually linked to
some sort of reconstruction, such as buyouts or buy ins, or some sort of
change of ownership of a business for one reason or another,' says Mr
Johnston.
NATIONAL Pressures are even encouraging reconstruction of the venture
capital industry itself. The most significant example so far came at the end
of May, when Schroder backed the purchase of Sumit Equity Ventures, one of
the oldest regional groups of funds, from AE Sharp, the Birmingham-based
stockbroking and financial services company.
Sumit has three funds worth Pounds 43m, including a publicly quoted
investment trust of Pounds 10m. It will now be run by Mr Lyndsay Bury,
previously a founder of Apricot Computers and a founder director of Allied
Dunbar Bank.
AE Sharp retains 10 per cent, but Mr Bury's other shareholders will be
Schroder Ventures and Mr Peter Folkman's Pounds 20m North of England fund,
which Schroder also backs.
Sherwood says the industry is now mature and is segmenting. The strength of
London funds is in big, complex, international or specialised, high
technology deals.
He sees Schroder's tie-up with Mr Folkman - a former 3i director - and Mr
Bury as akin to a franchising operation, with London money made more easily
available for medium-sized or bigger deals in the regions.
This sort of thing should enable regional funds to trade their local
knowledge and contacts for access to London money, some hundreds of millions
of pounds of which are uninvested at present. The tiddlers of the industry
may well have more national bargaining power than they realise.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (10): The jargon explained - A glossary of
venturespeak, from 'burn rate' to 'vulture capital'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY trade has its own jargon and the venture capital industry is no
exception.
The venture capitalist hopes that his plums will more than outweigh the
lemons in his portfolio and help him get over his hurdle, writes Charles
Batchelor.
The entrepreneur meanwhile must keep a wary eye open for the vultures who
may attempt to deprive him of the sweat equity he needs to make the deal
worthwhile.
Some of the more colourful expressions which crossed the Atlantic along with
the techniques themselves in the 1970s have fallen out of use - death valley
curves* and grey waves no longer form part of daily venturespeak - but a
flavour of venture capital's pioneering days remains.
(* Death valley curves means the decline in a start-up company's equity
base, as cash flows out and before profits start coming; grey waves refers
to a company or sector with such distant prospects that they will not be
realised before the investors' hair has turned grey.)
Here and on the following pages is a glossary of other terms:
Burn rate: this is the rate at which a business uses up the funds provided.
Business angel: a private investor who not only finances small companies but
who also gives them the benefit of his or her own expertise.
Most angels are retired executives or entrepreneurs who have sold their own
business.
Business Expansion Scheme: a scheme to encourage investors to engage in risk
investment by offering them tax relief at their top marginal rate, for up to
Pounds 40,000 invested a year.
There is now a Pounds 750,000 annual investment limit for each investee
company to channel investment to smaller businesses. But recent cuts in tax
rates have reduced the attractions of the BES for investors while special
encouragement for investments in residential property have diverted funds
away from non-property ventures.
The Treasury's long-running dislike of the scheme finally carried the day in
the March 1992 budget and the BES will come to an end in December 1993.
Business plan: the document put together by managers to justify their
application to financiers for backing. A business plan should contain
summaries of past and projected profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and
cash flows. It should also have details of products and services, markets,
future strategy and profiles of the managers - but don't get too carried
away: most financiers will not go beyond the two-page executive summary.
Captive funds: venture capital organisations which form part of larger
financial services groups. Usually they do not raise their own discrete
funds but draw on the resources of their parent groups.
Carried interest: shares or an option on shares taken by the venture
capitalist in the investee company as part of the financing agreement.
Usually the stake taken is 20 per cent. See also 'Hurdle rates,' explained
on the facing page.
Corporate venturing: this is the practice of a large company taking a small
equity stake or establishing a joint venture with a smaller business to
benefit from the smaller firm's specialist expertise.
The large business can provide finance, management back-up and distribution
outlets which would not be available to the smaller partner. The small
company brings its innovative skills and allows the big company a ringside
view of the new products and technologies it is developing.
Corporate venturing links can lead to the bigger partner acquiring the
smaller. Many US and some Continental companies have practised this
technique though it has failed to appeal to large British companies.
Deal flow: the number of investment propositions which come to the venture
capitalist.
Development capital: later stage venture capital invested after two or three
years when the business has become established and needs extra funds for
expansion. Most venture capitalists are in fact providing development
capital. The rewards are lower but the risks are correspondingly less than
for early stage investments.
Exit: the point at which the venture capitalist realises all or part of his
investment by either arranging a flotation of the company or, more commonly,
selling it to another company or 'trade buyer.' A growing range of exits is
becoming available and the list also includes a refinancing of the company
by another g roup of venture capitalists or the purchase of all the shares
by the company's own management.
Hands on/hands off: some venture capitalists take a very close interest in
their investee companies and will provide management expertise to help them
get started and in times of difficulty. It is rare to find a venture
capitalist who does not claim to be 'hands on,' but many, in moments of
honesty, will admit to being 'hands off' or passive investors.
Hurdle rates: institutional investors have grown restive at the fees venture
capitalists earn and have started to insist that funds achieve a basic
return before managers can claim their carried interest. They often set
hurdles based on a return on gilts or one of the leading stock market
indexes.
Independent funds: these do not form part of larger financial groups. They
raise their money from institutional and other investors.
Internal rate of return (IRR): different people calculate this in different
ways but it basically means the compound annual rate of return to the
investor. It includes dividend distributions and profits from disposals or
the profits shown on a fair valuation of an investee company. Inevitably,
venture capitalists differ over when investments should be written down, up
or off so the figures are rarely strictly comparable. Most venture
capitalists set themselves a target IRR of 30 to 40 per cent on their
portfolios though the return to investors may be much lower.
Lemons and plums: bad investments invariably go wrong before the good ones
produce the profits. The lemons usually ripen before the plums.
Living dead: a portfolio company which is just about trading profitably but
which shows little sign of ever meeting the venture capitalist's early high
expectations.
Management buy-in: the purchase of a business by an outside manager or team
of managers with the help of a group of financial backers.
Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its existing management
with the help of a group of financial backers. Buy-outs are funded largely
by loans secured on the assets of the company itself. Most of the equity
comes from the venture capitalist or other financial backer. The management
puts up a small amount of finance for a disproportionately large percentage
of the equity.
Management fee: an annual charge normally amounting to 2 1/2 per cent of the
sum invested. Some investors have insisted that the larger funds making
later stage investments should charge less because their portfolio companies
are less time-consuming. Others argue that the fee should decline as a fund
matures and fewer new investments are being made.
Recovery or turnaround financing: supplied to companies in difficulties
where the venture capitalist sees an opportunity to beef up or change the
management and return the company to profits. Some venture capitalists have
employed insolvency specialists to identify and manage such investments.
Refinancing: can be a sign of either failure or success. If a company
performs poorly it may need an extra injection of funds. Equally, if it does
very well, the management may decide to refinance the business on terms more
favourable to themselves with their original venture capital backers or
sometimes a new team of financiers.
Replacement capital: funds provided to allow an existing shareholder to sell
some or all of his shares.
Second-round financing: venture capitalists rarely expect the first
injection of funds to meet a business's needs. A second or even a third
round of funding will almost certainly be needed later as the business grows
or unforseen problems arise. At this stage the original venture capital
investor may reduce his holding and bring in others to spread the risk.
Seed capital: usually quite small amounts of capital provided to turn a good
idea into a marketable product or service; the riskiest form of venture
capital since the concept, the technology, the entrepreneur and the market
are all unproven. For this reason, seed capital has been in very short
supply. Some venture capitalists argue seed capital should not really be
necessary since most people should be able to raise, say, Pounds 25,000 from
savings or bank borrowings secured on their home.
Spin-out: a new company set up by a larger established group to exploit new
developments or fresh market opportunities and in which the management team
and a venture capital backer also take equity stakes.
Star: A company which is so successful that it pays
for all the failures and
humdrum performers in the venture capitalist's portfolio.
Sweet equity: the extra percentage of a company's equity which is allocated
to the managers over and above the shareholding their own relatively modest
financial investment would qualify them for. The extra shares are seen as an
additional motivation and reflect the fact that it is the managers' hard
work which will ultimately make the venture succeed. Sometimes also referred
to as 'sweat equity' to reflect hard work by the managers.
Trade sale: the sale of a company to a corporate buyer. This is the most
common exit route (qv) for venture capital backed companies.
Venture capital: Equity
finance provided usually to young, unquoted businesses to enable them to get
started or to expand. Equity funds provide a basis for the company to raise
further bank finance and provide a cheap source of funds in the early stages
of the business because dividends can be delayed until the company starts
making profits.
Venture capitalists say they bring not only money but also management and
industrial expertise to their investee companies, but see Hands On.
Vulture capital: the derogatory term applied to an offer of funds or a deal
which gives the venture capitalist an unfairly large equity stake in a
company.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (8): Impetus for industrial renewal -
Buy-outs still dominate the UK venture capital industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUY-OUT continues to dominate the UK venture capital industry despite a
two-year fall in the level of activity. For some observers, this represents
a diversion of venture capital from its 'true' role of backing the start-up
business; for most participants it represents a sensible concentration on
what the industry does best.
There can be no doubt that the buy-out, and its derivative, the buy-in, have
established themselves as important methods of achieving industrial renewal.
Some companies still refuse to permit buy-outs from among their subsidiaries
and divisions but most see it as a valuable tool for restructuring.
Some idea of the scale of buy-out activity can be gained from the fact that
there were more buy-outs in 1991 than acquisitions of independent companies.
Total buy-out activity over the past decade has amounted to no fewer than
4,144 deals worth Pounds 26.3bn at current prices, according to Nottingham
University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research.
There has been a decline in buy-out activity throughout Europe over the past
two years from the feverish levels of activity in 1988-89. But buy-outs
still accounted for 55 per cent of all UK venture capital investments by
value last year and for 35 per cent of European venture capital spending.
The highly leveraged billion pound deals of the late 1980s seem unlikely to
return but the venture capital industry is now concentrating on small and
medium-sized deals valued at up to Pounds 100m. Most fall in the range
Pounds 1m to Pounds 20m.
The financial institutions which arranged the very large deals have
withdrawn; the quoted company boards which saw an advantage in taking their
company private, have thought again; and the banks which were prepared to
provide the debt finance have imposed far tougher lending criteria.
This has left the professional venture capital funds to concentrate on more
cautiously financed deals which require industrial rather than purely
financial engineering skills.
'We are confident that our niche in the buy-out market - for companies
capitalised at between Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m, sometimes going up to
Pounds 100m - is the correct one,' says Mr Ian Hawkins, of Phildrew
Ventures.
'Our strength is in buy-outs up to Pounds 100m-Pounds 125m though most of
our deals are worth Pounds 25m or less,' comments Mr David Shaw, head of
County NatWest Ventures.
In many respects the current depressed economic climate is ideal for
buy-outs, say many of the specialists.
High real interest rates, a nervous stock market and uncertainty about the
beginnings of an upturn have reduced the number of companies willing to bid
against management teams. Hard-pressed corporations are under great pressure
to dispose of under-performing or non-core businesses.
However, the same economic conditions and the depressed housing market mean
many managers are unwilling or unable to remortgage their home to finance a
buy-out. They are also less willing to risk damaging their careers if their
main board rejects a buy-out proposal.
Even when deals do get off the ground they are often far more demanding of
the venture capitalist than in the boom times of the late 1980s - 'we do
very few deals in the form in which we first see them,' says Mr David
Wansbrough of ECI Ventures.
'In the 1980s, deals would come in off the street. Now we might have to put
in three months work to turn something into a good deal.'
Venture capitalists are also finding that they are having to deal with a new
type of vendor: the receiver. Buy-outs from receivership accounted for about
20 per cent of all deals last year.
Receivers want to complete a sale as quickly as possible and are usually
unwilling to grant prospective purchasers an exclusivity agreement while
they carry out their financial checks. Nor will a receiver usually be
prepared to provide a purchaser with the warranties normally given when
businesses are sold.
Receivers also want cash for any sale. Quite often venture capitalists will
arrange for deferred payments or a retained interest when negotiating a
buy-out from a corporate vendor. And while some vendors are prepared to
favour a management buy-out because they wish to retain close links with the
buy-out company receivers are interested only in the highest bidder.
Some of these factors can work in favour of a buy-out team - managers with a
detailed knowledge of the business may be able to dispense with warranties
while an outside buyer could not take the risk - but they do require the
venture capitalist to modify his approach.
An important concern of receivers and of other vendors is that the
management team and its venture capital backer can actually provide the
finance for a deal.
To meet this requirement venture capitalists have had to gear themselves up
to be able to provide a 'bought deal,' taking the entire value of the
buy-out on to their own book either permanently or with the aim of
syndicating it later.
'Vendors often want to talk to a financial buyer, not to the management,'
says David Shaw of County NatWest Ventures. This development reflects
practice in the US leveraged buy-out market where the buy-out specialists
play a far more active role in putting deals together, frequently bringing
in management at a very late stage in the transaction.
The vendor's preference for talking to the money-men, rather than managers
has co-incided with a tightening of the syndication market. Deal leaders
will now only deal with other venture capitalists they can trust following
problems in some of the larger syndicates.
3i and Prudential Venture Managers, two of the biggest players, took this a
stage further when they announced in June that they would collaborate on the
joint underwriting of medium and large buy-outs and buy-ins.
The aim of this initiative was to make it easier and quicker for managers to
put together the funding of deals worth Pounds 15m and more, the two
companies said.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (9): Only a small slice of the UK investment
cake - Technology-Based Companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a tiny fraction of the Pounds 1bn a year invested by the venture
capital industry goes to start technology-based companies - and that
fraction has fallen further during the current recession.
According to the British Venture Capital Association, the total investment
in start-up and other early stage companies fell by 55 per cent from Pounds
128m in 1990 to Pounds 55m last year.
The BVCA figures do not break down the start-up investment figures into
different industrial sectors, but the analysis of the overall Pounds 1bn
investment tells a depressing story.
Medical and biotechnology investments have fallen by more than half from
Pounds 49m invested in 51 companies in 1990 to Pounds 23m in 43 companies in
1991. As the BVCA annual report notes, 'a high proportion of investments in
this category tend to be start-up and early stage.'
UK venture capital investment in most other technology based sectors fell
last year too, though not as steeply as biotechnology.
The exception was electronics, where venture capitalists put Pounds 36m into
80 companies in 1991 - up from Pounds 25m and 61 companies the year before.
In the computer-related sector (mainly software and services) venture
capital investment fell from Pounds 74m in 1989 to Pounds 67m in 1990 and
Pounds 65m in 1991. The communications sector has shown a particularly steep
decline: from Pounds 29m in 1989 to Pounds 17m in 1990 and just Pounds 6m in
1991.
Altogether, UK venture capitalists put a total of Pounds 130m into 250
technology-related businesses last year - accounting for about 21 per cent
of companies financed and 13 per cent of the total amount invested by the
industry.
In the US, in contrast, more than half of venture capital is invested in
technology.
Such statistics provide ample ammunition for critics who accuse venture
capitalists in the UK of failing to nurture nascent high-tech entrepreneurs
in the same way as their US counterparts.
'There is evidence that good technology-based projects are failing to secure
the necessary investment because of a lack of entrepreneurism on the part of
the UK financial industry,' says Mr John Allen, chief executive of Newtech
Science Park in Clwyd, north Wales, and author of Starting a Technology
Business, an excellent new book published this month.* 'There's no venture
at the moment in venture capital.'
As Mr Allen points out, there are few hard statistics to illustrate the size
of the problem, 'since firms that are repeatedly spurned by venture
capitalists either give up, increase their bank loans to unwise proportions
or limp along, never achieving their true potential for themselves or the
national economy.'
But he quotes a survey of 284 technology-based companies which showed that
only 3 per cent of start-ups and 8 per cent of growing businesses were
financed by venture capital.
To illustrate the problem, Mr Allen gives the example of a 'soundly based
and growing firm in the medical and health care field' which he was helping
to acquire about Pounds 500,000 growth phase finance.
'I contacted a venture capital company whose stated interests were in health
care and technology and whose preferred level of investment ran 'from Pounds
0.5m to Pounds 2m for all stages of company growth.'
'I was told that they in fact rarely invested less than Pounds 0.75m, and
only in businesses that were already profitable, with an established market.
'Technology was currently 'out.''
Mr Allen adds that the company eventually found the Pounds 500,000 it needed
 -from an international pharmaceutical group, based overseas.
The preference of the venture capital industry for large individual
financings and its reluctance to make investments in the Pounds 100,000 to
Pounds 300,000 range - the main requirement for new technology businesses in
the UK - is perhaps the most frequent complaint by high-tech entrepreneurs.
There are countless stories of science-based companies being told that they
have a good business plan but the amount of money they are seeking is too
small for the venture capitalist to bother about.
This attitude is understandable in a way, because the cost to a fund, in
terms of management and time, of assessing potential investments is largely
independent of the amount of money required. Indeed the management needs of
a small new company may be even greater.
However, Mr Allen points out that venture fund managers can reduce the cost
of assessing small-scale proposals if they do not look at every project that
comes their way.
Instead, they should build up more long-term relationships with people
running enterprise agencies, science parks and business innovation centres,
whom they could trust to act as filters, passing on only the more promising
projects.
'This filtration would not, of course, abrogate the venture capital
company's observance of due diligence on behalf of its shareholders, but it
would reduce the number of total non-starters submitted in the first place,'
he says.
The venture capital industry has responded to a limited extent to the need
for small-scale finance, by establishing a range of 'seedcorn funds'
designed to get high-tech businesses started. But the demand far exceeds the
funds available.
At the same time, science parks are establishing specialised local funds for
their own high-tech entrepreneurs.
One of the pioneers was Aston Science Park's Birmingham Technology (Venture
Capital) Ltd.
Mr Harry Nichols, its chief executive, has an attitude quite different to
the 'short-termism' that is associated, rightly or wrongly, with many
British venture capitalists.
'We expect to take seven years on average before we get realisations;
allowing for lead times and some failures, this may mean 12 or 13 years
before the fund is fully mature and it becomes reasonable to evaluate
performance - a very long time by most standards. However, this is a 10 to
15-year development business, as experience in the US has shown,' he says.
Some universities also have specialised funds to help exploit research by
their academics. Indeed, Cambridge has two: Cambridge Research and
Innovation Limited (CRIL) and the Cambridge Quantum Fund.
A different sort of gap in the way Britain finances high-tech companies is
identified in another new book, Company and Campus Partnership by Ms Jane
Bower of Heriot-Watt University Business School.**
In the US, she says, the main providers of start-up finance are not the
well-publicised venture capitalists but small informal groups of local
investors - 'this is the category which is conspicuously lacking in the UK,
and this may hold the real key to future success.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (6): Painful adjustments may be needed -
Valuation and Performance Measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN venture capital industry is adjusting to the idea of
performance measures with the dogged determination of the patient aware that
a rather bitter medicine will do him good. While many venture capitalists
remain cautious of the validity of interim valuations, pressure from
investors is forcing them to be more open about their performance.
Four years after the publication of the first comparative study of venture
capital performance in the US, the British Venture Capital Association
(BVCA) has begun a pilot study of fund performance while the European
Venture Capital Association is engaged in a similar project in continental
Europe. The Dutch venture capital industry produced its first annual study
of the performance of 'realised' investments last year while a small study
of French venture funds has also been completed.
Interest in valuation and performance measures has been fuelled by the
resistance venture capitalists have encountered in raising new funds.
Institutional investors have seen their hopes of high returns from venture
capital dashed and have become reluctant to commit more money.
If venture capital is to establish itself as a separate asset class in the
minds of institutional fund managers it must be able to provide an objective
measure of performance. At present, venture capital investments are often
lumped together with 'cash' or 'other investments,' notes Mr Robert
Drummond, BVCA chairman.
A standardised performance measure will allow investors to compare the
performance of their funds with other funds of the same vintage, says Mr
John Hustler, a partner in accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. It will also allow
the comparison of venture capital with other forms of investment such as
equities and bonds and will strengthen the hand of the industry when
lobbying government, he adds.
'It is incredibly important for the industry in Europe to focus on
performance,' says Mr Rhoddy Swire, chairman of Pantheon Ventures (formerly
GT Venture Management). 'We get much more open reports from the US.'
The only true measure of performance comes when an investee company is sold
or floated. But by putting the spotlight on performance the industry will
help managers concentrate on the need to achieve 'exits' for their
investments. In the past, UK venture managers have sometimes appeared
reluctant to seek an exit, he says.
In the US, the annual Investment Benchmarks Report, compiled by Venture
Economics, a specialist consultancy, measures the implied internal rate of
return (IRR) to the limited partners in venture funds by year of fund
formation or 'vintage.' The first study in 1988 analysed 175 funds. The 1992
study compared 403 funds which had been established between 1969 and 1990.
In the UK, the BVCA has begun a pilot study of six funds also aimed at
comparing performance by vintage year. It hopes to have the first results by
the middle of next year. Despite these efforts considerable suspicion
remains that crude performance comparisons might work to the disadvantage of
funds investing in early-stage companies which take longer to generate
returns.
'What is difficult is ensuring that the different fund structures and types
of performance are recognised,' says Mr Ian Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures.
'One good investment could distort a fund's performance. How a fund draws
down its money can also affect performance.' This has not prevented the more
confident UK funds from measuring their performance against other forms of
investment.
CINVen, the second largest UK venture fund, claims a return of more than 30
per cent on its investments between 1980 and 1990 compared with less than 20
per cent on UK equities and under 15 per cent from UK bonds.
The Dutch Venture Capital Industry Association's performance study of
realised investments between 1986 and 1990 records an average return on
venture capital of 13 per cent compared with 4 per cent on equities, 2 per
cent on bonds and 6 per cent on deposits. These percentages do not take into
account the higher costs of managing a venture capital portfolio compared
with the other forms of investment, the association notes.
A performance measure, of course, can only be calculated on the basis of a
standard method of valuing investee companies. The BVCA is currently
reviewing the valuation guidelines it introduced in early 1991 to ensure
greater consistency.
There are still important areas of valuation which rely on opinion in, for
example, judging when to make provisions for a permanent drop in value or in
estimating prospective earnings. The BVCA expects any changes to its
guidelines to be relatively minor but wants to ensure that judgments are
based on realistic assumptions.
Investors should be able to judge whether valuations are reached on a
prudent basis if funds show how realisations compare with the last published
interim valuation, according to Mr lain Tulloch of Murray Johnstone, who is
carrying out the review.
Some venture capitalists are becoming more open about these numbers. 3i, the
largest UK venture capital company, reveals in its most recent annual report
that realisations were twice net book value in 1988 but that the premium had
fallen to 39 per cent by 1992.
County NatWest Ventures says recent realisations have been 40 per cent above
interim valuations while Phildrew Ventures reports internal valuations are
less than half realisation values. Given the leeway in the BVCA's valuation
guidelines, these percentages may not be directly comparable.
But the effect of the publication of the guidelines has been to establish a
framework and to focus the industry on a narrower range of valuations - 'one
or two of the cowboys have been found out,' says Mr Hawkins of Phildrew
Ventures.
Many venture capitalists acknowledge that they had to make small changes in
their valuation procedures to bring themselves into line with the BVCA
guidelines though their impact on some of the quoted investment trusts was
dramatic.
Some of the trusts, which had long been regarded as taking a more generous
view of valuations than the unquoted venture firms, were forced into making
substantial write-downs of their portfolios.
3i, which is preparing itself for a public flotation, has also carried out a
review of the way it values its investments.
It has eased its criteria for valuing investments in two important areas.
It has reduced the illiquidity discount it applies to very small companies,
capitalised at less than Pounds 5m, from 40 to 30 per cent and it will no
longer apply a 20 per cent discount to Unlisted Securities Market stocks.
In the long-term, the valuation and performance information can only benefit
the venture capital industry. In the short-term, it may require some painful
adjustments.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (7): Sector faces big marketing challenge -
Surveys reveal contrasting perceptions on the role of venture capital
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a consensus among venture capital companies that they need to
market themselves more intelligently, but that consensus tends to fragment
when they tackle the multiplicity of methods available for marketing.
The British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) has stimulated the industry
debate over marketing, through the results of three surveys conducted on its
behalf in mid-1991 by the London Business School.
The results of the surveys disclosed a startling mis-match between the image
of venture capital companies - very positive - and their perceived
importance as a source of long-term funding - relatively low.
While the bulk of the entrepreneurs and intermediaries who participated in
the surveys described venture capitalists very positively - 'shrewd,
well-connected, approachable, experienced and creative' - those without
experience of using it ranked venture capital low on their list of preferred
sources of long-term capital, behind (in descending order) banks, individual
investors and corporate investors. But of those entrepreneurs who had used
venture capital, 98 per cent said they would recommend it as a first port of
call in future.
Helen Walsh, former marketing manager of County Natwest, now with the BVCA,
believes the venture capital industry in the UK is facing a series of
marketing challenges in its second decade, brought about by a variety of
circumstances, not least the recession.
'County Natwest Ventures in the first six months of this year had some 1,400
introductions, of which only 2 per cent were completed. That leads to huge
waste of time. For the industry generally, it is not the marketing of the
initial transaction which needs to be improve upon, it is the quality of the
deal. They need to work on marketing as an an educational task, to get
people to understand what venture capital is.
The three segments of the venture capital industry - the captives, the
semi-captives and the independents - have rather similar marketing tasks,
dominated by two concerns; attracting funds and attracting the right deals.
Fund-raising is less problematic for captives such as County Natwest
Ventures, but finding the right deals requires clever marketing; 30-40 per
cent of its deal flow comes from the National Westminster bank branch
network. It needs to be highly systematic in the way it markets itself to
branch bank managers, in order to sure that they will think of County
Natwest Ventures first when the top-quality deal passes across their desk.
Semi-captives, managing funds from both parent institutions and also funds
raised independently, fight on two fronts, as do the independents. Both need
to make sure they are listened toby the pension funds which source the bulk
of the investment.
Independents, generally with smaller staff levels, need also to ensure that
the indispensable personal networks of both intermediaries and pension fund
managers are with the right people, and, having located them, that such
networks are well-fostered.
Smaller venture capital companies, such as the captive Guinness Mahon
Development Capital, have as a priority not just avoiding time-wasting on
investigating deals which will not complete, but also to build a clear
identity as a niche-player; in its case, in publishing, educational and
merchandising. Guinness Mahon's team is also constructing other marketing
ploys as a means of defining itself, weeding out the obvious non-starter
deals, and concentrating both its and potential clients' minds.
For Christopher Woodward, marketing director of 3i, marketing is 'one of
those unfortunate terms that means a hundred different things to a hundred
different people. Particularly in the financial services sector, its
strategic role is often misunderstood - it's too often confused with 'let's
do some advertising.' But marketing has to start with an appreciation of the
marketplace, requiring quite a bit of research, going on to a segmentation
of the market - not being all things to all people.'
In one sense, 3i learnt about marketing the hard way; between 1945 and 1980
it faced little competition in the market, but very quickly in the 1980s
that competition boomed from being a handful to more than a hundred; 3i's
response was to rationalise its several businesses into one, develop a
corporate image and logo, and present a new, branded image to the world.
With hindsight, that was probably a triumph of style over strategy. In 1986,
Christopher Woodward joined 3i and insisted on the development of a strategy
 -'I said at the time that we had to develop a systematic rationale for what
we stand for, as opposed to others, and create in the minds of potential
users the belief that 3i is more likely to be a successful investment
partner than the others.'
Differentiation is thus a crucial marketing first step, no matter what the
size of the player. Advertising may play a part in that, but it can be a
gamble probably best left to the larger, more generalist players, such as
3i, who have the resources to cope with the flood of deal offers it is
likely to generate.
3i does about 1,000 deals annually, 500 of those new business. Christoper
Woodward reckons 3i needs about 50,000 inquiries a year to meet that target,
and many of those inquiries are inspired by 3i's direct mail marketing, via
its regular bulletin called QED, which goes out to 10,000 clients - 'if you
have established a target database, you must send out a message to that
database every six to 12 weeks, otherwise they forget you,' says Woodward.
So there are a few nuggets of guidance for the venture capitalists
considering the whys and wherefores of marketing
The whole purpose of marketing in this industry is to optimise quality
deal-flow. There are a lot of deals around, but the quality ones are
increasingly difficult to find.
Building a relationship with intermediaries while the deal is still just a
gleam in someone's eye can best be done by the 'softer' marketing methods -
arranging seminars, careful public relations, regular communications.
Venture capital is still a weak fourth choice for companies seeking
investment which have never used venture capital; but for those which have
used venture capital, it is a strong first choice. Bridging that perception
gulf is a big marketing task for any venture capital company.
Don't create unrealistic expectations - woolly marketing messages will only
disappoint all sides of the deal.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (5): Larger deals shrink by number and value
 -The Banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the UK economy sunk in gloom, the number of banks among the players in
the UK venture capital market has dwindled to a relatively select band. For
those that persist, there are still some pickings, but by the standards of
the 1980s they are pretty meagre.
Perhaps because there are fewer players fighting to share the cake, banks
generally agree that there is still a fair flow of business, despite the
recession. But there are clear signs of change.
Larger deals have shrunk by number and value - 'it is a very difficult year.
There is quite a lot of activity at the smaller or mid-corporate end, but
very little activity in the large transactions,' says Mr David Scholl,
managing director of County NatWest Venture Capital.
'We are investing about 80 or 90 per cent of what we did in the heyday of
the market, but now we do more transactions at Pounds 5m or Pounds 10m or
Pounds 20m and there are not many of Pounds 50m or Pounds 100m,' says Mr
Scholl.
Mr Gordon Bonniman, managing director of the venture capital division of
Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland says:
'The market has been sorting itself out. There have been relatively few
buy-outs. The criteria for returns have certainly come down from the
hysterical levels of the late 1980s.'
This year, Charterhouse handled the privatisation of the Medway ports - 'at
Pounds 40m, it was not a small deal, but in 1988 or 1989, it would not have
rated as a large buy-out,' says Mr Bonniman.
Development capital deals are enjoying a resurgence. 'Companies may have
soldiered on and survived the recession, but they perhaps need to reduce
their borrowing in order to take advantage of opportunities. Additional
capital can be used to finance plant and equipment,' says Mr Hollidge.
Among the banks still active, Lloyds, and Royal Bank of Scotland, (through
Charterhouse), have kept up an entrepreneurial interest in the venture
capital market in the early 1990s.
Lloyds maintains regional offices in Leeds and Birmingham to spot
opportunities, and says that a presence in the regions remains a priority.
'We have learned our lessons from two or three years ago and are were not
looking nowadays to pay high prices for the businesses we invest in. Rather,
we try to ensure that we put conservative financial structures in place,'
says Mr Hollidge managing director at Lloyds Bank Development Capital.
ONE striking feature has been the withdrawal of foreign banks which used to
play a role in creating some of the sell-down liquidity for some arranging
banks.
'The foreign banks have closed-up shop. That must be an object lesson about
fair-weather friends,' says one UK banker. The remaining bank players tend
to be much more cautious - 'we've learned the lessons of the last two or
three years and are not looking to pay high prices for the businesses we
invest in. And we do want to ensure that we put conservative financial
structures in place. Corporate vendors on the other hand often tend to be
looking to divest, but are still expecting very high prices,' says Mr
Hollidge.
Chris Gammon, executive corporate manager at Baronsmead which invests funds
on behalf of Barclays bank, says: 'We invest in businesses with a turnover
of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 20m, usually putting in between Pounds
100,000 and Pounds 750,000. In general, we're looking for profitable
companies with an established track record. We have about 30 investments in
the portfolio with an average size of about Pounds 400,000.'
The receiver's office may also be a source of business - 'we only look at
the profitable parts which were dragged down by cross-guarantees. We are
loth to look at a parent company which has gone into receivership,' says Mr
Gammon.
Baronsmead has helped in the buy-out of a small airline from part of the ILG
the leisure group which collapsed in the spring of 1991. Lloyds, too, has
handled two or three receivership transactions this year. Most are MBOs,
though Lloyds says that the deals tend to be 'bimbos' (buy-in and buy-out)
involving a combination of the existing management and the injection of new
management.
'We would ask why a business has gone into receivership. Perhaps it had an
overgeared financial structure and a management which has consistently
failed to perform,' says Mr Hollidge. Sectors which do not seem to offer
profit opportunities are property and financial services. 'We have tried to
analyse our successes and failures in terms of what is good for us.
Distribution businesses have been very good, and manufacturing generally has
a good track record, for example in engineering. But retailers are still
having a very hard time and things are difficult for some specialist sectors
like printing,' says Mr Hollidge.
Support often takes the form of beefing up the management team. County
NatWest keeps a data base of good managers suitable for parachuting into
companies.
'We receive CVs every day from managers interested in getting involved in
venture-backed business,' says Mr Scholl.
Baronsmead says that it will only put managers in if they help the company
concerned grow and manage its expansion. It prefers to agree the budget for
the year with the company and act as a sounding board for plans for
expansion.
'We are designing more conservative packages for those companies we do take
up, partly because the banks are not willing to put up more leverage than
they did previously but also because we are not sure when the recession will
end and we don't want more exposure. We like to think we are laying the
foundations for tomorrow's good businesses and a platform for profits in the
mid-1990s,' Mr Scholl says.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (4): Institutions impose tougher terms -
Investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE institutional investors, whose money funds the venture capital industry,
are enjoying their new-found power. After spending much of the 1980s feeling
they were being taken for granted, they now find themselves being courted by
venture capitalists desperate to raise new funds.
Frequently the institutions' response has been to refuse any further money
until they have evidence of the venture capitalist's performance. But they
have also used the shift in the balance of power to impose tougher terms on
the venture funds.
Most investors now expect their venture fund managers to jump a performance
hurdle before they can earn their carried interest; management fees have
come under pressure; and valuation guidelines have been introduced with the
prospect of performance measures to follow shortly, (see page four: Painful
adjustments to be made).
The institutions have established a forum for discussing their concerns
about venture capital in the Venture Investors Circle. This was set up in
1987 to give investors a single voice when dealing with the British Venture
Capital Association, which speaks for the venture capitalists.
The investors' circle now numbers about 25 fund managers who meet quarterly.
Increasingly, the institutions are making their own direct investments.
Some, like Legal &amp; General, a life assurance company, do all their venture
capital investing this way.
Others, like Postel Investment Management, which handles Pounds 20bn of
investments for four Post Office and BT pension funds, have established
direct investment teams as well as continuing to invest through funds.
Postel initially took the view that it would be difficult to incorporate a
venture capital team in the salary structure of a large institution. But in
the past two years it has set up Postel Development Capital to make direct
investments. Starting with a rump of unquoted investments transferred from
other Postel funds, the four-person team now manages an Pounds 85m portfolio
alongside the Pounds 175m which Postel has invested through funds.
'It gives us a different perspective and allows us to get a bigger return on
our investments because we don't have to pay the venture capitalist's
carried interest (20 per cent of the profit) or his management fee,' says Mr
John Brakell, in charge of fund investments.
Growing dissatisfaction with the returns delivered by the venture capital
industry has meant that even when institutions continue to invest through
funds they have become more selective. Postel expects to invest in two UK
funds a year compared with half a dozen funds a year in the late 1980s.
Having achieved an improvement in the terms under which they invest through
funds, the institutions are now seeking to improve the way venture
capitalists manage their portfolios.
'It is time for venture fund managers to concentrate on maximising the value
of their investments,' comments Mr Rhoddy Swire, chairman of Pantheon
Ventures (formerly GT Venture Management) which manages Dollars 450m on
behalf of institutions.
Pantheon, which selects venture funds for institutions in the manner of the
'gatekeeper' funds common in the US, believes UK venture capitalists prop up
investee companies for too long, often pouring in good money after bad.
Venture capitalists whose fees depend on the value of assets under
management are sometimes reluctant to write down poorly performing
companies, he says.
This call for more active portfolio management is echoed by Mr John Hustler,
venture capital partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick: 'Managers should
spend more time on the middle-ranking performers in their portfolios instead
of concentrating on the high-flyers and the poor performers,' he says.
'They need to be more active in selling and merging companies.'
Postel's Mr Brakell believes that UK venture capitalists should emulate
their US counterparts in looking more actively for 'exits' from their
investments.
'Managers get too attached to their companies and think they can make more
profit if they wait a bit longer. They should focus more on achieving a
return from their investment.'
Many investors take the view that if venture capitalists spent more time
improving the performance of their existing portfolios instead of attempting
to raise new funds as soon as they were fully invested they would have an
easier time raising money at a later date.
'They make a sacred cow of their deal-flow,' says Mr Ray Maxwell of Postel.
'They fear that if they don't have any cash to invest it will dry up. They
need to take a pause; deals would return once they raised new funds.'
Some of the larger funds must keep raising new money to cover their overhead
costs, he notes.
At the same time as they are increasing their pressure for better fund
performance, institutional investors are also pressing for a uniform method
of measuring performance. A start is being made at devising performance
measures in the UK and in continental Europe.
Ironically, while an early concern of investors was that venture capitalists
might be valuing their investments too generously, some now fear that the
pendulum has swung too far the other way.
Venture capitalists have been so cautious in their valuations that the
industry now appears to many outsiders to be performing far worse than it
actually is.
This is bad news for the venture capitalists who have to report back to
their investors and the fund managers who have to report back to their
management committees and their trustees.
'We would like a slightly earlier recognition of value in portfolio
companies,' says Mr Brakell. 'There was a significant over-reaction to the
economic climate in 1991. We are concerned that this will discourage
investment completely. We don't seek optimistic valuations, but we want
realistic ones.'
The British Venture Capital Association is keen to encourage its members to
tell investors the difference between their internal valuations and the
price achieved when investments are floated or sold.
Because internal valuations contain large discounts for illiquidity and no
account is taken of the premium which a buyer might be ready to pay for
control, they frequently under-state values by a considerable margin.
The institutions have made big strides in making the venture capitalists
more accountable in recent years.
But there is some concern that the measures which have been taken to curb
early excesses may now be damaging the soundly managed parts of the
industry.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (3): Shake-out continues - Players Under
Pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH venture capital industry faces a further round of closures and
restructuring as it adapts to the tougher operating conditions of the 1990s.
So far, the contraction of the sector has gone largely unnoticed as funds
move from active investing to managing their portfolios on a 'care and
maintenance' basis though there has been a growing number of more public
discomfitures.
Optimists in the industry regard the shake-out as an inevitable result of
the recession and the stage of maturity that the industry has reached.
Pessimists fear a further narrowing of the industry's focus - on buy-outs
and development capital - and permanent damage to the less fashionable
sectors such as seed funding and start-ups.
'The industry will shrink to a core group of half a dozen 'broad brush'
players alongside a number of niche funds,' says Mr David Wansbrough of ECI
Ventures.
'The weaker management teams with a poor track record and no deal-flow will
decline to looking after the rump of their portfolios,' comments Ian Hawkins
of Phildrew Ventures.
'That will concentrate activity among fewer funds. But venture capital is
still a young, cyclical industry.'
Four key factors are presently at work, taking their toll of some of the
marginal players. Their influence is likely to become more rather than
less-pronounced over the next two tothree years.
Firstly, those funds which have not performed well will be unable to raise
further rounds of finance. Funds which invested heavily at the top of the
market in 1988-89 in particular are showing very poor returns and may be
swept from the board.
Secondly, funds which have proved unable to manage problem portfolios will
find themselves shut out of future syndication deals. Some venture
capitalists have been deeply disillusioned by deal leaders who lacked the
skills to help out their portfolio companies when they ran into
difficulties. Co-investors found themselves called in to help sort out the
problems which should have been dealt with by the deal leader.
The more active players are now unwilling to take part in large syndicates
and prefer either to take the entire deal onto their own book or to put
together small syndicates consisting only of other venture funds they can
trust.
Thirdly, valuation guidelines introduced two years ago by the British
Venture Capital Association have exposed a number of funds with imprudent
valuation procedures.
Finally, both the British and the European Venture Capital Associations are
working on standardised measures of performance of venture capital
portfolios. These projects are at a very early stage and are not intended to
allow the direct comparison of the performance of different funds.
Inevitably though, they will shed more light on performance and weed out the
less successful.
AT THE seed and early-stage capital end of the market, Oxford Seedcorn
Ventures and JMI have both ceased making new investments and are now
managing their portfolios on a caretaker basis. Other small players such as
Birmingham Technology Venture Capital are almost fully invested while the
recently privatised British Technology Group says its venture capital
activities, never in the mainstream of the business, will be even less
important in future.
An ambitious attempt by Midland Bank to establish a nationwide network of
regional funds has fallen foul of investor caution and initial plans for 11
funds with Pounds 55m available for investment have been delayed. Midland
was hopeful of launching two of the funds, covering the east Midlands and
Yorkshire and Humberside this month but there is no immediate prospect of
the others getting off the ground. However, Midland also has plans to
provide small amounts of equity - of between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds
750,000 - to suitable banking customers through a separate Growth Capital
initiative.
Despite Midland's difficulties there is growing evidence that many of the
smaller deals are being financed in the regions by small local funds, often
with backing from the local authority, its pension fund or a business
support organisation such as an enterprise agency or a Training and
Enterprise Council. These organisations usually combine social with
commercial objectives.
There are also signs that 'business angels,' private investors usually with
a business background, are providing more funds to early stage ventures on a
local basis. Angels are sizeable providers of funds in the US. Local funds
and business angels both represent low-cost alternatives to the larger
venture capital funds which often have central London offices and
highly-paid teams of executives to support.
The largest single provider of small amounts of equity capital in recent
years has been 3i, currently preparing for a public listing in the form of
an approved investment trust. 3i's flotation plans have caused some concern
in the industry that institutions would channel all their venture capital
investments through 3i, cutting out the smaller venture funds.
There are also fears that pressure for dividends will force 3i to reduce
investments in smaller, riskier companies. Twice postponed because of the
seriousness of the recession, the listing is now planned for 1993.
THE SHAKE-OUT is concentrated on the smaller players but even
well-established firms have been hit by investments which have turned sour.
Sumit Equity Ventures, a Midlands venture group with more than Pounds 40m
under management, was bought out by Schroder Ventures and Lyndsay Bury, a
founder of Apricot Computers, after a sharp drop in the net asset value of
one of its funds.
Drayton Consolidated, meanwhile, became the latest investment trust
specialising in unquoted investments to be forced into making a savage
write-offs on its portfolio.
Drayton wrote off more than half the value of its unlisted assets - from
Pounds 87m to Pounds 40m - in the six months ended March 1992.
Until recently the general assumption in the industry had been that the
independent funds, which raise capital from outside investors, would be most
vulnerable in a shake-out. But the sudden decision by Hill Samuel, the
hard-pressed merchant banking arm of the TSB group, to put its development
capital arm up for sale, raised questions over the position of the
'captives,' funds owned by the banks or large institutions.
The decision to sell - Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures later took over
management of the portfolio - reflected a head office decision to
concentrate on activities with a shorter pay-off time than development
capital, rather than any problems at Hill Samuel Development Capital itself.
But with all the main clearing banks sitting on large loan provisions, there
is little doubt that they have been looking at all their non-core
businesses, including venture capital.
The result of all these developments is that a smaller, more profitable  -
but less diverse - venture capital industry seems set to emerge over the
next few years.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (1): The industry's focus is narrowing - The
swashbuckling days of the venture capital industry are long past. The shift
now towards larger deals and the emphasis on buy-outs means that even the
largest venture capital firms are being forced into alliances
</HEADLINE>

VENTURE CAPITAL is dead. Long live private equity. The strength of the
recession together with structural changes in the venture capital industry
have combined to bury the notion that the US venture capital model could be
exported to Europe in its original form. It is being replaced by a range of
equity investments which frequently owe more to the corporate finance skills
of the merchant banker than to the hands-on, industry-wise expertise of the
early US venture capitalists. It is not a risk-free activity but it seeks a
more stable investment climate than that required by the venture capital
pioneers who backed Genentech, Microsoft and Apple Computer. In the UK, the
most innovative European venture capital market, the dominance of management
buy-outs and later stage, development capital investments is so complete
that an early swing back to start-ups or early stage funding appears
unlikely.
'There was a naive belief that the US model could be repeated in the UK,
says Mr Ian Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures. 'But you are talking about a much
smaller economy with much longer lead times for companies to get
established.'
This narrowing of the focus of the venture capital industry has yet to
become fully apparent because many of the funds which have been unable to
raise further finance have simply gone quiet, managing their portfolios on a
'caretaker' basis. There is evidence though of an increasing casualty rate
among the early stage players, the poor performers and the peripheral funds
for which venture capital was not a mainstream activity.
Even the large funds which remain have been reducing the scale of activity
in tricky and less profitable areas of start-ups and technology businesses.
They now concentrate on buy-outs and on helping established, profitable
companies expand.
'There is a successful (UK) development capital industry, but how do we
address the early stage and seed capital investments?' asks Mr John Hustler,
venture capital partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Venture capital
has been good for part of the funding gap.'
The structural changes now under way in UK venture capital provide a sombre
backcloth for the government's declared enthusiasm for the industry. Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, noted approvingly in his 1992 budget speech
that Britain had a venture capital industry 'the equal of that anywhere in
the world, outside the US.'
Yet his remarks came at a time when the industry was retreating from backing
the small companies which formed the core of he government's enterprise
drive during the 1980s. His comments also highlighted a discrepancy between
stated government aims and its policies towards venture capital.
The abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme from the end of 1993 will
remove a tax-based initiative with the potential (never quite realised) to
help small firms raise equity. There are already calls for a replacement for
the BES to be devised but the government has shown a marked aversion to
tax-based incentives of this kind or of any pump-priming help for the
venture capital industry generally.
Amid the gloom there are signs that the smaller investments, those which are
uneconomic for the larger venture capital houses are being taken over by
small, local venture firms and groups of private investors or 'business
angels.' The local venture capitalists frequently have the financial backing
of a local authority or its pension fund or organisations such as enterprise
agencies and Training and Enterprise Councils.
There is some evidence that wealthy private individuals, usually with a
business background, are backing small firms, either individually or as part
of small syndicates. In the US, business angels are thought to provide two
or three times as much finance as the formal venture capital industry. The
UK government is currently sponsoring five pilot schemes to see how this
idea could be developed.
At the same time, attempts are continuing to make small scale venture
investments work. Midland Bank has unveiled a scheme to provide equity
finance to promising business customers while 3i is experimenting with
initiatives to cut the cost of small investments and to involve local
business support agencies in selecting companies to back.
AGAINST the background of these structural changes, the venture capitalists
have to continue to earn their management fees. UK venture capital companies
invested Pounds 1.15bn in 1991, a decline of 17 per cent on the year before,
while the number of companies backed fell by 11 per cent to 1,386, according
to the British Venture Capital Association. Funds raised also fell sharply,
to just Pounds 276m from Pounds 832m in 1990. The extent of these declines
is not quite as bad as it first seems because they suffer from comparison
with the late 1980s when the statistics were inflated by a small number of
very large management buy-outs and buy-ins. Even so, some venture
capitalists expect a further contraction of the UK industry this year.
With the recession less marked in continental Europe, European venture firms
(including those in the UK) increased investments by 12 per cent to Ecu4.6bn
(Pounds 3.2bn). The strongest growth occurred in France, Italy and Spain
though Britain remained the largest single market. Continental fund raising
also increased, by 14 per cent to Ecu2.9bn. In the US, meanwhile,
fund-raising fell for the fourth year running in 1991 to Dollars 1.27bn,
according to Venture Economics, a specialist publisher. Investment levels
fell to a 10-year low of Dollars 1.36bn.
But even recessions have their silver lining and the present economic
climate is a good one for making investments. Deals are more reasonably
priced though they frequently require far more work on the part of the
venture capitalist to bring together a good management team, finance and,
sometimes, a corporate partner, says David Wansbrough of ECI Ventures.
The shift towards larger deals and the emphasis on buy-outs has meant that
even the largest venture capital firms are being forced into alliances.
Companies disposing of parts of their business by way of a buy-out
increasingly want to deal with a financial purchaser rather than a
management team. At the same time many venture capitalists have grown wary
of participating in large syndicates.
It is this trend towards 'bought deals' which has led to 3i, the largest UK
venture capital group, joining forces with Prudential Venture Managers to
underwrite medium and large management buy-outs. Legal &amp; General, a life
assurance group which makes direct venture capital investments, meanwhile,
has announced plans to seek co-investors to provide half the finance for a
series of new funds which would raise Pounds 100m a year over the next few
years. Even the bank-owned 'captive' funds have begun to consider raising
outside finance. This has the additional advantage for them of avoiding the
need to take the investee companies onto their books as operating
subsidiaries - 'I would guess that we would raise capital in the market
place in about three years,' says Mr David Shaw, managing director of County
NatWest Ventures, part of National Westminster Bank.
RECENT events have shown it is not only the independent funds, dependent on
outside capital, which are vulnerable to swings in investor sentiment. Hill
Samuel, part of the TSB banking group, decided earlier this year to pull out
of direct venture capital investments in order to concentrate on activities
with a quicker return. Most banks have made large provisions for loan losses
and there can be few which have not looked at their venture capital
activities, as well as their other operations, to see if they were worth
continuing.
Much of the heart-searching which the venture capital industry is going
through is the result of the unexpectedly poor performance of many funds.
Early promises of high returns have not been fulfilled, particularly by
funds which invested at the peak of the economic cycle in 1988-89.
Yet, until recently, no serious attempt had been made to establish a
standardised method of valuing companies or of judging the performance of
funds. Valuation guidelines have now been agreed in the UK and in
continental Europe and work has started on comparable performance measures.
This is further evidence that the swashbuckling early days of the venture
industry are long past.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (2): Success in a highly competitive market
 -Venturer of the Year Award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THEY first met seven years ago, Adrian Breger (pictured left) was
production director of a medical and hygienic disposables company, and Jamie
Gibson the finance director of a children's clothing manufacturing company,
struggling against low-priced imports.
Today, they are the joint managing directors of their own company employing
around 310 people in Holywell, Clwyd, with a turnover in 1991-2 of Pounds
24m, making disposable nappies in competition with some of the largest
multi-national corporations.
They have the satisfaction, too, of being chosen as the third overall
winners of the Venturer of the Year Award, sponsored by the Financial Times,
Cartier, the jewellers, and the British Venture Capital Association. The
award, now in its third year, is for the individual who has made the best
use of venture capital funds.
Disposable nappies have been a fast-growing sector in recent years,
replacing terry nappies in all developed markets, including the UK, where
the traditional product is now down to 15 per cent.
Despite the dominance, however, of groups such as Proctor &amp; Gamble (which is
estimated to have about 60 per cent of the UK market through Pampers), and
the Swedish group, Molnlycke (which owns the other big brand, Peaudouce),
Breger and Gibson were convinced there was a profitable niche for a
manufacturer able to supply a high quality product to the own-label market.
Their vision was backed with an initial loan of Pounds 225,000 by 3i in
Manchester, which recognised the two men's complementary strengths. A
further Pounds l7m to finance equipment purchases came from the Christiania
Bank of Norway, enabling production to begin in August 1986.
By 1989, with the company growing fast, further funding was needed to
purchase new production lines and to enlarge the premises.
3i subscribed for nearly Pounds 1m of share capital with a private backer,
Michael lnnes, a former school friend of Jamie Gibson, also taking a
substantial equity stake, and the role of non-executive chairman.
At the same time, loan finance was provided at favourable rates by the ECSC
because of the contribution the company could make to employment in a part
of north-east Wales hit by steel, textile and other closures.
New loans totalling Pounds l84m were provided again last year by
Christiania, ECSC, and Hill Samuel, again mainly to finance new machinery.
Because of the delicate task it has to perform, the nappy requires
continuing high levels of performance, and what appears to have won for the
company increasing sales and a growing share of the market, while some other
small companies have disappeared, has been its ability to keep up, and, in
some cases, surpass the bigger groups in technical innovation.
Though basically a cellulose-based pad of fluffed paper, sandwiched between
an outer cover of polythene and an inner sheet (or coverstock) of
spun-bonded polypropylene, the disposable nappy has been subject to several
thousand worldwide patents and to big courtroom confrontations between the
big groups over alleged infringements of each other's trade secrets.
According to Breger, a 53-year-old South African who came to Britain 20
years ago, Breger Gibson has avoided becoming embroiled in these disputes by
using only proprietary technology, developed in conjunction with its
suppliers.
Innovations include an internal waistband system, a cuff to prevent leakage,
and a special design for the different anatomies of boys and girls - a
gender specific window in nappyspeak.
The company's initial breakthrough in 1986 was a contract to supply a budget
chemist private label brand, followed by deals with Toys 'R Us and other
stores. Important clients now include Asda, J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Gateway,
Safeway, Mothercare, and Aldi, taking the company to around a 40 per cent
share of the own label sector and 8 per cent of the market overall.
Profits to date, and hence the return to investors, have been relatively
modest with the company only managing Pounds l1m profits pre-tax last year.
With several years of heavy capital investment and research behind it,
however, the company is hoping for improvement over the next few years. When
its new fourth line is fully operational shortly, total capacity will be in
excess of 5m nappies a week.
Development is also nearing completion on an innovation which could be of
considerable significance. Space is running out in landfill sites in the US
and elsewhere, and the disposable nappy has for some time been under attack
from environmentalists because of the numbers involved, the product's
bulkiness - and its content. As a result, a race is on among manufacturers
to develop a biodegradeable product which will reduce disposal problems.
Breger Gibson claims to be well on the way to a solution, and believes this
could offer it the opportunity to increase greatly its market share.
With the UK market's growth likely to slow as terry substitution ceases, the
company is also planning to move into export markets, where its presence has
so far been limited - 'we concentrated initially on the home market where
import penetration was as high as 70 per cent. Europe now offers excellent
opportunities for growth,' 46-year-old Gibson points out.
Yet, while the company has been successful to date, there are risks in being
a small fish in a big pool. What would happen, as one of the award judges
questioned, if P&amp;G decided that Messrs B&amp;G 'were eating their lunch'?
Jamie Gibson does not under-estimate the determination or resources which
P&amp;G, which has itself built a new nappy factory in Manchester, could throw
into a battle with the company. Kimberley Clark, number two in the US, is
also building a plant in the northeast of England, possibly prior to
entering the European market. Gibson points out, however, that as it
presently stands, the British market, is unbalanced and smaller rivals are
needed to avoid the creation of a monopoly.
P&amp;G, too, has traditionally not supplied Breger Gibson's chosen area, the
own label market which research findings suggest will continue to grow at
the expense of brands.
Breger Gibson itself has a small branded range, but this is unlikely to be
developed substantially because of the huge marketing costs.
By contrast, because they can achieve a higher mark-up on own-label goods,
the big supermarket chains have been happy, according to Gibson, to promote
these against rival products, offering Breger Gibson nappies prime positions
in-store and supporting them with advertising.
The next stage of Breger Gibson's expansion, using a 20-acre site around the
existing plant, will be a move into other product areas to lessen dependence
on nappies. Though no decisions have yet been made, it is likely the company
will turn its attention to the incontinence market - growing as the
population of Europe ages - and to feminine hygiene products.
In these areas, too, the objective will be to develop proprietary products
competing on performance and quality.

FT  25 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bear raid depresses brewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLATILE trading in Allied- Lyons followed a rumour that the brewery group
was about to issue a trading statement. The misleading talk appeared to
originate in the options sector in early trading, but soon spilled over into
the equity market.
The shares, which had opened at 647p, tumbled 33 at one stage, with other
unreliable gossip resurrecting speculation about a rights issue. A downgrade
by Hoare Govett, although merely bringing the broking house into line with
the rest of the market, added to the negative sentiment.
However, the rumours quickly proved unfounded, with Allied denying any
trading difficulties. Dealers said the shares, which had been sparkling
performers in recent weeks, had been the subject of a bear raid. They later
recovered to close at 638p, a fall of 9 on the day. Turnover was a hefty
5.8m.
Vickers upset
News of a substantial cut in the dividend as engineering group Vickers
reported an expected poor set of interim figures caused a bumpy ride for the
shares.
The company posted a loss of Pounds 4.1m, in line with market forecasts, but
a worse than expected reduction in the dividend, from 3.7p to 0.5p. This
sent the shares tumbling to an eight-year low of 60p and caused a
backwardation - a situation in a fast market in which the bid price has
temporarily become greater than the offer price.
Nerves were, however, steadied at the analysts meeting that followed the
release of the results, with researchers particularly reassured by the
prospect of subsidiary Rolls-Royce Motor Cars breaking even next year. This
produced a sharp turnround in the stock which, also aided by the strength of
the general market, jumped to 84p for a rise of 5 on the day after turnover
of 2.4m.
Analysts downgraded their Vickers forecasts for the full year. Smith New
Court, which remains cautious about the prospects for Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars, changed its previous estimate of a Pounds 9m profit to a loss of
Pounds 14m.
Half-time results from United Newspapers were well received, with revenue
from the group's national newspapers being better than expected. There was
also a lower interest charge helping to give an Pounds 8m boost to profits
at Pounds 46.5m and a maintained dividend. Analysts are looking for
full-year profits in the Pounds 95m to Pounds 105m region. The shares rose
16 to 425p in turnover of 1.9m.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK securities house, was heavily involved in the
telecoms sector, recommending a switch out of BT and into Cable and Wireless
and Vodafone. The Kleinwort stories, plus news that County NatWest had taken
BT off its buy list and reduced dividend forecasts, prompted early weakness
in the BT shares, which fell to 357p, but they ended a shade firmer on the
day at 359 1/2 p. Turnover was 6.5m.
County cited continuing difficult volume trends and redundancy costs as
being behind its profits downgrade for this year from Pounds 2.8bn to Pounds
2.7bn and for next year from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 3.28bn, but it expects
BT to lift the dividend by 6 per cent to 15.25p this year and by 7 per cent
to 16.3p next year. C and W added 19 at 614p and Vodafone 3 at 328p.
Sustained strength by both classes of Securicor shares and Security
Services, Securicor's associate, was said to have reflected optimism over
the forthcoming battle for supremacy in the cellular phone business in the
UK. Securicor 'A', well supported all this week, climbed 9 to 554p.
Racal Electronics put on 2 1/2 at 69 1/2 p, albeit in disappointingly low
turnover of only 1.9m shares, while Racal Special-Ex firmed 3 to 145p on
630,000 traded and Chubb When Issued moved up 7 to 202p on turnover of
789,000.
Banks, regarded by analysts as one of the sectors most highly geared to
reductions in interest rates, raced higher, although traders said gains had
been exaggerated by a shortage of stock. Specialists also tended to play
down what they said were rather wild stories of huge profits for the big
international banks resulting from the recent turbulence in foreign exchange
markets. National Westminster leapt 20 to 373p on turnover of 5.4m.
SG Warburg surged ahead in early trading - with one buyer said to have paid
550p - as the stock remained buoyed by market suggestions that the merchant
bank, regarded by many as the UK's premier investment bank, could be the
target of one of the US banks. The stock finished the day 6 higher at 536p.
A merchant banking analyst said he discounted a full merger of SG Warburg on
the basis that the goodwill write-off involved in such a deal would be very
heavy and that the size of a potential deal - he said Dollars 1.5bn would
not be an excessive valuation - would most likely put off even the largest
predator. But the analyst did not rule out a co-operation deal. It was also
suggested that Warburg's corporate finance and securities operations would
do well from the sudden upsurge of business in markets.
Insurance stocks maintained their strong performances, reflecting the
beneficial effect on their balance sheets from the big gains in equities in
recent sessions.
Of the composites, Royal Insurance continued to bound ahead as Tuesday's
reduction in interest rates, and the increased prospects for further cuts in
coming months, reduced the expected impact of domestic mortgage indemnity
losses. Royal closed 13 higher at 184p. Sun Alliance, also heavily involved
in the mortgage indemnity business, rose 7 to 303p.
Dollar considerations helped some of the leading media and publishing
stocks. Pearson appreciated 29 to 398p and Reed International 13 to 578p.
Reuters gained 30 at 1248p, helped by a buy recommendation and upgrade from
US house Merrill Lynch.
Strong support from Smith New Court helped shares in Rank Organisation,
which strengthened 32 to 569p in 3.8m turnover. Thorn EMI, 29 ahead at 790p,
continued to benefit from buy advice from Hoare Govett and County NatWest.
Following news that its close season business had been better than expected,
Airtours gained 9 to 232p. Owners Abroad rose 7 1/2 to 59 1/2 p.
MEPC continued to attract attention on the back of its recent prime letting,
with some switching out of Land Securities, in a buoyant property sector.
The latter moved ahead 11 to 395p, MEPC 21 to 273p and British Land 15 to
155p.

FT  25 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities extend gains in late trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAVOURABLE reports of the speech by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, to
the House of Commons yesterday encouraged the London stock market, which was
already benefiting from the calmer performance by the French currency. Led
forward by the stock index futures, the FT-SE Index extended its earlier
gain to finish 40.7 points ahead at 2,621.2.
The first accounts of the parliamentary debate on the UK economy reached the
City of London only towards the close of the stock market trading session.
The rejection by the prime minister of the likelihood of early British
re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism reinforced the market's
confidence that domestic interest rates can be further reduced before the
end of the year. The Footsie gained a final 10 points to close at the day's
best level.
The heavy support operation for the French franc fuelled a new round of
speculation that the Bundesbank might yet agree to cut German interest
rates. This sustained the support for interest rate-orientated stocks in
London, inspiring further sharp gains in the leading store and retail
issues.
The US dollar rallied against the pound towards the close of trading,
putting renewed support behind the overseas earning stocks. With Wall Street
ahead by 11.62 Dow points in UK trading hours, some of London's nervousness
ahead of the US presidential election was relieved.
Although the influence of the poor trading results from British Aerospace
continued to overhang the engineering and aerospace sectors, the broad range
of the company reporting list was in better shape yesterday. In particular,
good results from United Newspapers provided a boost for advertising-related
and consumer issues.
Trading volume subsided a little in early deals as the stock market waited
to see how currency markets would contend with the continued activity
surrounding the French currency. Business in equities improved as currencies
settled down, however, and the day's Seaq total reached 671.2m shares,
compared with 735.4m in the previous session.
Wednesday's retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.4bn, the sixth
consecutive day of Pounds 1bn-plus retail volume, bringing to Pounds 11.7bn
the total of retail business in UK equities since Britain's withdrawal from
the ERM set the stock market's pulse racing - and underlining the presence
of the big institutions.
The strategy team at Smith New Court commented yesterday that the UK
government 'has been forced into a policy change that is very good for the
stock market', and that the combination of a cheap market, low inflation and
falling interest rates will be an explosive combination for equities.
Mr Nick Knight at Nomura, re-affirming his updated Footsie year-end
forecasts of 3,000 this year and 3,500 for 1993, said that takeover bids
could now re-emerge significantly in the London market. He added that, with
the bond/equity yield ratio back to around 1.9, the need on the part of fund
managers to sell equities has largely evaporated.

FT  25 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE towards the close enlivened an otherwise dull session in the
derivatives area, writes Joel Kibazo.
The December FT-SE futures contract opened 15 above Wednesday's close of
2,638, but the early strength soon faded, leaving the contract to drift down
for most of the session, with sentiment weakened by the dullness in the
fixed interest rate markets.
By 3pm the December future had fallen to 2,628, which proved to be the low
of the day. The closing of positions, mostly by independent traders, along
with light buying by some institutions in the dying minutes of the session
generated a squeeze, driving December forward and sending the underlying
cash market higher.
December closed at 2,683, up 45 from its previous close and around 22 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover, at 6,316
lots, was thin.
There was an improvement in volume in traded options, the total reaching
31,558 lots, although turnover in the FT-SE 100 option fell to 7,351
contracts. Food retailers led the way among stock options. Tesco recorded a
day's total of 2,046 contracts, and was followed by Asda, in which 1,735
lots were transacted.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on French franc eases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURE on the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism
eased yesterday, even though the scale of intervention by the Bundesbank and
the Bank of France to support the currency was small, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank intervened continuously on the foreign exchanges to support
the franc, but the amounts that were purchased appeared to be smaller than
in previous days. The Bank of France also bought francs after ERM trading
closed at 4pm London time as the franc fell below FFr3.41 to the D-Mark,
near to its floor of FFr3.4305. It later ended in London at FFr3.4010.
In US trading, the franc benefited from a wave of short-covering by
investors who believed that a devaluation might be avoided altogether, and
peaked at FFr3.3899.
Yesterday's battle to save the franc was a clear victory for the central
banks, even if the war to avoid a devaluation has not yet been won. The Bank
of France held the currency without raising its five to 10-day lending rate
any further and without pushing its intervention rate above 9.6 per cent. Mr
John Hall, international economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, said
that if the franc sees the other side of FFr3.38, the war will be won
altogether.
A more cynical view is that the franc and other ERM currencies are being
supported by the reimposition of exchange controls in several European
countries, a move with serious costs for the proposed timetable for European
monetary union.
Yesterday, Ireland followed Spain's lead in tightening exchange controls to
ward off speculators, forcing non-residents to get official approval to
engage in Irish punt swaps. Portugal also introduced exchange controls along
similar lines. There were rumours last night that the Bundesbank was asking
commercial banks to restrict the purchase of German Treasury bills because
overnight rates in the German money market had been at uncompetitively low
levels, although this could not be substantiated.
All these moves reduced the purchase of D-Marks, and pushed the escudo and
the punt higher. But the most seriously troubled ERM currency yesterday was
the Spanish peseta, which closed at Pta69.69 to the D-Mark, not far away
from its floor of Pta72.62.
The reimposition of exchange controls triggered a collapse in the Spanish
stock market, undermining confidence in Spain's economy. Traders reported
that spot exchange was the only operation possible in pesetas, punts and
escudos, and that forward markets had dried up.
The volatility was felt in Asia, with investors repatriating their European
investments and translating them into yen, which closed at Y120.6 to the
dollar in London.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Rates soften
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATES for short-dated money in the sterling cash market softened
yesterday after a Pounds 1.5bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was
removed by midday.
Otherwise, trading in both the interbank and futures markets was quiet after
the whirlwind of recent weeks. Dealers are still divided over whether there
will be another cut in UK base rates before the Conservative party
conference next month, and were waiting for the outcome of yesterday's
debate on the UK economy in the House of Commons before hedging new bets.
'The market will doubtless pronounce its view on Friday in some way,' said
one clearing bank dealer.
Now that the UK is out of the European exchange rate mechanism, a
two-pfennig fall of the kind that sterling suffered yesterday has limited
effect on the money markets. There is still no clear indication of how far
the government would allow the pound to drop before abandoning the idea of
another rate reduction altogether.
The only event in the currency markets to occupy the minds of dealers was
the battle to save the French franc from devaluation. Yesterday, the franc
traded more firmly against the D-Mark, but dealers believe that the
Bundesbank could reduce rates further in an attempt to save the exchange
rate mechanism.
Three-month money in the sterling cash market softened to 9 3/16 per cent on
the offered side, from a close of 9 1/4 per cent the previous night. This
was largely put down to a softening of rates at the short end of the market
because of the easier conditions.
In spite of the huge shortage caused by its heavy support of sterling on the
foreign exchanges last week, the Bank of England is offering to roll-over
the facilities that it promised to the biggest banks last Thursday, easing
conditions. The one-month rate was slightly softer at 9 7/16 per cent from a
previous close of 9 1/2 per cent.
The December short sterling contract moved within a narrow 12-tick range,
but ended at roughly the opening level, at 91.79. Strictly speaking, this
assumes that three-month money will be at 8.21 per cent by the year-end.
In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 14m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per
cent and Pounds 1.44bn in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Spanish paper falls on introduction of
capital controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER tension within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System forced Ireland and Portugal to follow Spain's example and impose
restrictions on the movement of capital yesterday.
The reintroduction of capital controls infuriated many bond investors and
traders, and left some wondering which other troubled markets would follow
suit.
The Spanish government bonds suffered a sharp sell-off yesterday as foreign
investors scrambled to get out of the market.
The capital controls are intended to hit speculators who have played havoc
over recent days with the weaker European currencies by betting on a forced
devaluation.
According to 1988 legislation on the liberalisation of capital controls,
Spain, Portugal and Greece have until the end of 1992 to lift all controls.
Both Greece and Portugal may ask for the deadline to be extended until 1995
under special economic circumstances.
However, yesterday, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the EC
considered the new exchange controls introduced by three member countries to
be legal under the EC Treaty.
FRENCH government bonds dropped on currency worries but picked up again
later in the session. Dealers said most of the activity took place in the
futures markets since the spreads quoted on cash bonds were too wide to
attract business.
One trader at a French commercial bank said the French houses had an
informal arrangement to quote especially unattractive prices for French
bonds and currency to certain US houses in order to deter speculation in the
currency.
Bid-offer spreads of three-quarters of a point on bonds - against 0.1 of a
point normally - were cited by one house.
The franc appeared relatively resilient yesterday as both the Bank of France
and the Bundesbank intervened in order to support the French currency.
The Matif futures contract fell from 108.00 to 107.70 while the 10-year
bond, which opened with a yield of 8.69 per cent, ended at 8.60 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds ended lower, pulled down by disappointment over the
fading prospects of a cut in German interest rates and poor inflation
figures.
Traders said the French franc's ability to weather speculation pressure and
stay above the ERM floor dashed hopes of an easing by the Bundesbank.
Market participants had hoped that the German central bank would be forced
to cut interest rates in order to buoy up the franc and reduce tensions
within the ERM.
The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a range of 90.70 to 91.05 and
ended at around 90.87, slightly lower than the opening level.
Bond prices dipped briefly following the release of western German state
inflation data yesterday. Consumer prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 3.3 per
cent year-on-year and climbed 0.3 per cent from August. In North
Rhine-Westphalia, prices climbed 0.3 per cent on the month and rose 3.4 per
cent from September 1991.
SPANISH government bonds tumbled as foreigners rushed to sell their holdings
following Wednesday's introduction of capital controls.
While the curbs were aimed at preventing speculation in the currency,
traders complained it had become prohibitively expensive for bond market
participants to fund their positions as a result.
The yield on the 10-year bond climbed from 13.01 per cent to 13.09 per cent
yesterday.
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices ended the day lower or barely changed as hopes of
lower German interest rates - and hence of a cut in UK interest rates -
faded.
Volume in the Liffe futures contract was relatively low at about 22,000
contracts. The contract opened at 98.20 and fell to 98.01.
However, cash bonds showed little movement, with the 9 per cent gilt due
2008 gaining  1/32 to trade at 98 5/8 in the late afternoon.
US Treasury prices rose sharply across the maturity range yesterday
following a bigger-than-expected increase in weekly jobless claims.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up at 97 15/16 ,
yielding 7.426 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up 5/32 at 100
3/16 to carry a yield of 3.885 per cent.
Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose by 15,000 in the second
week of September. Although the figures were affected by the impact of
Hurricane Andrew, the week was shorter than usual because of the Labor Day
holiday, and with car and defence companies laying off significant numbers
of staff, the data confirmed the labour market remains in a poor condition.
The bearish jobs figures helped offset the negative implications of a
weakening dollar.
By early afternoon yesterday the US currency was more than a pfennig lower
at DM1.4850.
THE yen's recent strengthening against the US dollar helped to lift Japanese
government bond prices above their closing levels on Tuesday, which was the
last trading day before the public holiday.
The US currency opened at a historic Tokyo low of Y119.90 to the dollar, and
hit an all-time intraday low of Y119.83.
A strong yen helps to push up Japanese government bond prices because it
means that it is easier for the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates
The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.79 per cent in Tokyo
yesterday, against Tuesday's close of 4.865 per cent, and ended the day at
4.795 per cent.
The number of market-makers in the UK government bond market has fallen to
19 following Hong Kong Bank's move this week to merge its James Capel Gilts
and Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged businesses.
The operation will continue under the name of Greenwell, which was already
among the biggest market-makers, with a market share estimated at around 15
per cent.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Citicorp launches Dollars 1.33bn,
five-year floating rate note issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP yesterday joined the ranks of borrowers offering floating rate
notes in the international bond market, launching a Dollars 1.33bn issue
backed by credit card debt.
However, in contrast to the Dollars 6bn 'collared' floating rate notes
issued in recent weeks, yesterday's deal carries no upper limit on the
interest rate paid to investors.
The issue, lead-manged by Goldman Sachs, was the first floating rate note
deal by Citicorp under its global bond programme. The notes were issued by
Standard Credit Card Master Trust 1, a special-purpose vehicle used to fund
the bank's extensive credit card operation.
The five-year paper pays 30 basis points more than three-month dollar London
interbank offered rate (Libor) and was re-offered to investors at a fixed
price of 99.865.
At this level the discounted margin is 33 basis points over Libor.
Participants said the majority of the deal was sold to US institutional
investors. But the lead manager said around Dollars 300m bonds were bought
by European institutions.
Elsewhere, the market struggled to absorb the latest batch of collared FRN
issues. Dealers said that future issues may have to offer improved terms.
Floating rate note issues by top-rated borrowers such as Austria and
Rabobank this week have capped the interest rate payable to investors at 8
1/4 per cent.
Until this month, caps of 9 per cent or more were common for borrowers of
similar credit quality.
However, with European bond markets in turmoil and US interest rates close
to cyclical trough, borrowers hungry for funding have few alternatives but
to tap the dollar floating rate sector.
Yesterday, Bank Austria, the triple-A rated financial institution, launched
a Dollars 150m fixed-rate issue lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation.
The lead manager said the four-year bonds, priced to yield 40 basis points
more than US Treasury bonds, appealed to continental European investors,
including many private individuals, unwilling to buy floating rate
instruments. But the small size of the deal underlined that appetite for
fixed rate dollar paper remains limited. In addition, the decision by Spain
to raise the yield on its Dollars 1.5bn fixed rate issue on Tuesday, in
response to turbulent market conditions, has made underwriting firms wary of
bringing substantial fixed-rate issues.
Earlier fixed rate deals from the European Investment Bank and AB Spintab
were postponed.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Ecu bonds face an uncertain
future - Richard Waters on the faltering performance of the Ecu market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ambition postponed? Mr John Major, the UK's prime minister, yesterday
delivered this blunt verdict on the future of the Ecu as Europe's single
currency. If he is right, then the Ecu bond market could finally be
consigned to oblivion after its faltering performance of recent weeks.
The condition of the Ecu market this week has been as bad as at any time
since Danish voters first punctured the politicians' optimism about European
monetary union at the beginning of June.
The French referendum - the event which only a fortnight ago was expected to
determine the future of the market - has come and gone, and things are no
better.
Marketmakers continue to sit on large stocks of the bonds with no investors
in sight. If anything, more institutions have taken to liquidating their Ecu
bond holdings since the ERM crisis intensified a week ago.
As a result, liquidity has disappeared. Apart from benchmark issues such as
those from the French and UK governments, trading has ground to a halt,
pushing up the yield on the less-liquid bonds. The yield on Denmark's
10-year Ecu bonds, for instance, was yesterday quoted at 35 basis points
above the French Ecu OAT, compared with a difference of 5 to 10 basis spread
in more normal times.
The yield spread between German government bonds and the Ecu OAT speaks
volumes about how far investors' sentiment has changed.
Immediately ahead of the Danish referendum, the yield spread had narrowed to
as little as 61 basis points. The Ecu bond at that time was yielding
considerably less than its constituent currencies.
The reason: investors hoped that when the EC reached its deadline for
currency union, set by the Maastricht treaty at 1999 at the latest, some of
the higher-yielding currencies would not have met the convergence criteria.
As a result, when the Ecu became Europe's new single currency it would
comprise only the 'core', low-yielding currencies, making it more valuable
than the wider basket of all EC currencies.
That process would effectively have reversed the sort of adjustment made to
the Ecu basket in 1989, the most recent of the Ecu's five-yearly
adjustments. At that time, the Spanish peseta was brought in with a 5 per
cent weighting and the Portuguese escudo with 1 per cent - adding 40 basis
points to the yield on Ecu bonds overnight.
Since the Danish referendum, Ecu bonds yields have soared back above their
theoretical yield, reaching a spread of 50 basis points this week. The
spread over German government bonds has levelled out this week at around 180
basis points.
The Ecu's hopes are now pinned on two possible outcomes to the current
crisis, both of them seemingly remote. One is that the Maastricht treaty
will survive the current upheaval, and that European currencies will restart
the march to union.
The other is that, if Maastricht dies, a new - and perhaps even more
determined - rush to monetary union will develop with the D-Mark and French
franc at its core.
If the EC were to use the Ecu as its single currency for this more limited
monetary union, then holders of Ecu bonds would make a large and unexpected
gain.
Such hopes still look far-fetched. Most analysts agree that such a limited
currency union would adopt its own single currency, leaving the Ecu as
simply a reference basket for a wider group of EC currencies.
In that case, the Ecu would never return to the position centre-stage that
it enjoyed until June this year.
The result is in the hands of Europe's politicians - though Ecu investors
seem already to have made up their minds.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cox backs new satellite channel

<TEXT>
COX Enterprises, the Atlanta-based media group, is to underwrite the Pounds
35m (Dollars 59.85m) funding requirements of UK Gold, a new satellite
channel featuring programmes from the BBC and Thames Television.
It is the first investment in the UK market for privately-owned Cox, one of
the largest US communications groups with annual revenues of Dollars 2.3bn.
Together with other investors, Cox, the sixth-largest cable television
operator in the US, will also take a 65 per cent stake in the venture.
Thames will have a 15 per cent stake and BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm
of the BBC, 20 per cent.
The new advertising-financed channel, which will be aimed entirely at the UK
market, is likely to be launched in mid-November.
It will broadcast for around 18 hours a day from the Astra satellite system
to both satellite dishes and cable networks.
The entertainment-only channel will draw heavily on the programme libraries
of both the BBC and Thames.
Mr Derek Lewis, former chief executive of the Granada group who is leading
the UK Gold launch, said yesterday that he was delighted that Cox had
underwritten the financing and would be a key partner in UK Gold.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hungary is seen as top choice
for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY is the most popular east European location for the expansion of
medium-sized companies, a study by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the accountancy
and consultancy firm, has shown.
One-third of a sample of nearly 400 companies from 20 developed companies
said Hungary was their first choice in the region. The next most popular
countries were Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia.
The vast majority - 71 per cent - said the main reason for interest in the
east was market opportunity.
But the survey showed many businesses were hindered in their attempts to
invest in the east. One-third said investment was too risky, while a
significant minority were troubled by the unsuitability of the political and
social environment.
Deloitte Touche said the study showed prospects for increased trade were
encouraging, given the need for good information and funding mechanisms.

NZDollars 251m

BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand investment holding company, reported
an 18.6 per cent increase in net profit to NZDollars 251.1m (USDollars
135.3m) for the year to June 30, compared with NZDollars 211.7m last year.
Mr Paul Collins, chief executive, forecast the company would show a similar
improvement in the current year and would be helped by improving fortunes
from its its main investment, UK hotel group Mount Charlotte.
Directors said the latest advance was largely due to a substantial rise in
operating earnings in New Zealand and lower interest and overhead costs.
Interest charges fell 44 per cent to NZDollars 171m (NZDollars 308m) due to
lower debt levels and interest rates.
But the directors pointed out that good results from Air New Zealand and
Carter Holt Harvey were offset by losses from Ariadne Australia and Magnum.
The figures included write-offs of NZDollars 72m for Magnum, NZDollars 44m
for Ariadne Australia, and NZDollars 20m for New Zealand properties that are
to be sold.
Operating profit before tax and minorities rose 17 per cent to NZDollars
354.8m (NZDollars 303.7m).
New Zealand-controlled companies produced a combined profit of NZDollars 73m
(nil last year), and directors expect another strong contribution this year.
Mount Charlotte made a loss of NZDollars 6m, against a profit of NZDollars
78m last year. The UK contribution was NZDollars 321.1m (NZDollars 452.5m)
which included a profit of NZDollars 160m on the sale of UK motor group
Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn.
A NZDollars 33.4m loss was incurred in Australia after the decision to write
off the NZDollars 44m investment in Ariadne. Investments in W D and H O
Wills and the 93 per cent shareholding in Australian Consolidated
Investments did not produce revenue.
Directors are proposing a final dividend of 5 cents a share, making an
unchanged 9 cents for the year.

BRAMALEA, the property group controlled by Toronto's Edper-Bronfman group,
has negotiated an agreement that may smooth the way to restructuring the
company's CDollars 5bn (USDollars 4.06bn) debt.
Lawyers representing holders of CDollars 525m of secured debentures said
they will recommend an exchange into Bramalea stock and new five-year
secured debentures.
The debenture holders, if they finally approve, would receive slightly more
than 50 per cent of Bramalea's equity.

<TEXT>
WANG Laboratories, the US computer group, is to restate its financial
results for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 to reflect additional
restructuring charges resulting from its bankruptcy filing.
The charges could be 'substantial and result in a sizeable loss for the
prior fiscal year,' Wang said.
In August, Wang filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
US bankruptcy code.
Yesterday, in a letter to customers, Mr Richard Miller, chairman and chief
executive, said that since the bankruptcy filing cash-flows had been
satisfactory.
The company's cash balances were steadily building and exceeding the
company's forecast, he added.
'We are continuing to talk with lenders about financing, but our strong cash
balances have enabled us so far to finance our needs internally,' Mr Miller
said.
Most of Wang's suppliers are extending credit to the company, he added.
By the end of this month Wang will have reduced its workforce to about
11,000 from 13,000 , Mr Miller said.
Most of the reductions to date have been in the US. Some job cuts have been
delayed to comply with local employment regulations, Wang said.
However, the company plans further reductions of about 3,000 worldwide.
'As our business stabilises after the shock of the Chapter 11 filing, we
will complete our business plan which will become the basis for our plan of
reorganisation,' Mr Miller said.
'It is still too early to know how long that process will take', he added.

recovery to L6.2bn

<TEXT>
SAIPEM, the listed engineering and pipe-laying subsidiary of Italy's
state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, has staged a turnround in the
first half. Net earnings were L6.2bn (Dollars 4.9m) after minority
interests, against losses of L85bn in the same period last year.
The improvement marked a gradual recovery from the crisis in the world's
off-shore and plant building industry which started in the mid-1980s, said
Mr Giovanni dell'Orto, chairman.
He predicted Saipem would remain in profit at the end of the year, but
indicated it was too soon for dividend payments to be resumed. 'In the first
phase, profits should be used to cover past losses', he said.
Saimpem's sales have risen almost 22 per cent to L856bn in the six months to
July. New orders, particularly for off-shore rigs, have also surged, with
the total reaching L1,176bn by end-June, against L938bn at the same time
last year.
By end-September, Saipem's order backlog reached a record L3,050bn, boosted
by the recent contract to develop the South Pars field in Iran, worth almost
L1,000bn to the company.
Group debt, which remained stable at around L207bn at mid-year compared with
last December, had fallen to around L165bn by the end of last month.
Italcable, the listed international telecommunications company which is part
of Italy's STET state-owned holding company, raised profits before tax and
extraordinary items by 5.3 per cent to L143.6bn in the first half of this
year, from L136.3bn in the same period in 1991.
The increase comes in spite of continuing cuts in tariffs for international
calls - Italy's are among Europe's highest. While call traffic jumped by
around 25 per cent, group sales rose by just 6.2 per cent to L362bn in the
first half from L341bn. Merloni, the Italian white goods group which
manufactures under the Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes names, raised interim
pre-tax profits by almost 37 per cent to L7bn from L5.1bn in the first half.

growth

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Agricole, one of France's largest banks, expects net profits growth
of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent this year, despite the competitive
state of the French financial markets.
The announcement lightened the mood of the French banking industry, which
has been clouded by concern about the impact of the economic slowdown on its
exposure to small businesses and the property sector.
Credit Lyonnais, another leading French bank, recently disclosed a sharp
fall in profits for the first half of 1992 following a steep increase in
client risk provisions.
Credit Agricole, which has expanded rapidly from its roots as a co-operative
of banks for French farmers to become Europe's biggest single bank,
according to The Banker magazine, made net profits of FFr4.9bn on net
banking income of FFr57.5bn in 1991.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman, said the bank would be forced to raise
provisions this year, probably by FFr1bn or FFr2bn on last year's total of
FFr14bn.
The bank does not disclose figures for its performance in the first half of
the year. However, it announced yesterday that gross operating profits had
risen by 19 per cent on the preceding interim period.
Credit Agricole anticipates continued growth in gross operating profits at a
similar rate of between 19 per cent and 20 per cent for the full financial
year. Similarly, net banking income is expected to show growth of 8 per
cent, with the increase in costs restricted to 5 per cent below last year's
level.
Societe Generale, another leading French bank, yesterday announced a
rationalisation plan to cut staffing levels in its domestic retail banking
network by 2.5 per cent over the next three years. This will involve
shedding 1,600 of the bank's 23,000 staff.

investment

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROLEOS de Venezuela, Venezuela's national oil company, has sharply
reduced its capital investment programme, according to company executives.
The company is to make direct investments of Dollars 20bn during 1993-98, a
cut of around Dollars 6bn compared with previous forecasts made only last
year.
Weak international oil prices and high taxes on operating profits have
forced the company to make the cut.
PDVSA, which had gross revenues of Dollars 22.3bn last year, is
concentrating most of its capital outlays on core activities - exploration,
crude oil production and refining. Other projects will be stretched out or
shelved.
The company also hopes to attract further outside investment for oil,
petrochemicals and coal projects.
The 1993-98 investment programme includes Dollars 13bn on maintaining crude
oil production capacity, and a further Dollars 1.4bn to take it beyond its
present 2.83m barrels per day, and Dollars 2.6bn on upgrading domestic
refineries.
Since most of Venezuela's oil wells have been producing for many years,
heavy investment is required to reverse an annual average decline of 22 per
cent in output from old oil fields.
PDVSA, which has the highest level of debt in its 16-year history -
estimated at more than Dollars 3bn - will still need to borrow on
international capital markets in 1993-94 to help finance its investments,
company executives said. Officials also warned that unless the company's tax
burden were reduced over the next several years, it will not be able to make
the investments required - especially in maintaining oil production capacity
 -to keep the business afloat. The company pays taxes equivalent to 82 per
cent or more of operating profits.

board

<TEXT>
MR TORSTEIN Hagen, the Norwegian investor, yesterday won his long battle to
win a seat on the supervisory board of Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group,
after an Amsterdam court rejected objections to the appointment that were
lodged by the company's works council.
The court ruling caps a long and determined effort by Mr Hagen, who owns
about 25 per cent of Nedlloyd's shares, to get a board seat and help oversee
the company's return to sustained profitability.
In 1988, and again in 1991, Mr Hagen attempted to gain influence at Nedlloyd
but was rebuffed each time by the management board.
The board argued that it was counter to Dutch corporate practice to nominate
significant shareholders to the supervisory board, a body that is required
by law to look after the interests of all 'stakeholders' and not just
shareholders.
The management board reversed its position in early 1992 and nominated Mr
Hagen to the supervisory board.
However, the move was opposed by the works council, which charged that
management was hoping to buy off Mr Hagen and neutralise his criticism of
company policy.
Yesterday's court ruling breaks the deadlock and clears the way for Mr Hagen
to join the board.
'We cannot do anything else but loyally accept this decision,' the works
council said.
Mr Hagen's clashes with Nedlloyd in the past were central to the continuing
debate in the Netherlands about the subordinate role of shareholders in
Dutch corporate governance.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Spring Ram jumps to Pounds 18.4m - Results
lifted by strong growth in kitchens where sales rose 19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its kitchens division helped Spring Ram
Corporation increase first-half pre-tax profit by 13 per cent, from Pounds
16.3m to Pounds 18.4m, against the trend in the building and home
improvements market.
The share price gained 10p to close at 143p, continuing the recovery from
104p earlier this month. Doubts about the group's momentum had punctured the
May peak of 181p.
Turnover rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 101.5m (Pounds 86.9m). Earnings per
share advanced to 3.5p (3p), assisted by a lower tax charge. The interim
dividend goes up 20 per cent to 0.103p (0.086p).
Mr Stuart Greenwood, financial director, said sales rose by 19 per cent in
the kitchens division. The driving force for the profit growth was the
500,000 sq ft Scunthorpe factory. After breaking into profit for the first
time last year, the performance was improving rapidly through greater
utilisation of capacity.
The bathroom division pushed up sales by 13 per cent and increased market
share. But margins were eroded in a contracting market.
Special products, a smaller part of the group, showed a 40 per cent sales
increase. Exports were up by 48 per cent and now accounted for 9 per cent of
group turnover compared with 7 per cent a year ago.
Spring Ram is approaching the mid point of a Pounds 102m capital spending
programme, with outlay at a peak of Pounds 40m this year compared with
Pounds 15m last year and Pounds 30m next year.
The recession was enabling the group to build and equip more cheaply and
about Pounds 10m might be saved, although this was partly being taken up by
other projects.
Government grants of Pounds 8m were being taken through the profit and loss
account over four to five years.
This year the credit was Pounds 2m (Pounds 400,000) to offset some of the
start-up costs at the Regency doors factory, near Barnsley, and a new tile
factory near Bradford.
Mr Greenwood said the amount of cash held by the group was expected to fall
from Pounds 45m at the end of last year to Pounds 25m this December, with
the half-way figure about Pounds 7m. Interest received in the first half
amounted to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1m).
COMMENT
y, Spring Ram showed 150 analysts, fund managers and journalists around its
two new factories to inspire confidence in its growth prospects. The
practice of building low-cost lines on green field sites has borne fruit so
far - witness Scunthorpe. It will aim to repeat the trick with doors and
tiles, pushing against imports and weak points in the UK competition. The
group looks on course to increase full-year pre-tax profits by 14 per cent
to Pounds 43m. The prospective multiple of more than 17 gives it a deserved
premium to the market, but no longer offers the buying opportunity that
followed the recent faltering in the share price. As the company gets
bigger, the scrutiny of its accounts gets tougher - on depreciation, grants,
the high level of stock and the low stock turn. Price volatility may persist
as Spring Ram may now be prone to alternate doubt and hype.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon brings in Astra's former
chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY McCann, one of the company doctors brought in to run Astra Holdings,
the munitions and fireworks maker before it went into receivership earlier
this year, has been appointed chief executive of Harland Simon, the control
systems company which had its shares suspended earlier this month pending
clarification of its financial position.
Mr McCann was also named as deputy chairman of Harland's executive
committee, which will be chaired by Sir Ian Morrow, the industrialist and
accountant whose industrial experience includes the successful restructuring
of Rolls-Royce.
Mr David Mahoney retains his post as chairman.
The new appointments were announced along with the resignation of Mr John
Redshaw, managing director, from the board of the troubled group. A company
statement added that Mr Redshaw had 'waived all claims' against it.
Harland requested the suspension of trading in its shares at 20p earlier
this month after Barclays, the group's main commercial banker, indicated
that its banking facilities were being cut by up to one third. Yesterday the
company emphasised that it continues to receive the support of its principal
bankers.
The appointment of Sir Ian and Mr McCann completes a management
reorganisation which began in February when Mr Roy Ashman, former chairman
and the driving force behind the company, was replaced by Mr Mahony, a
former chairman and an industrial adviser to Hambro's, the company's
financial adviser.
The immediate priority of the new management team will be to complete a
review of the financial condition and prospects of the group, which has
already begun an asset sale.
Harland's problems began in February after the once high-flying company
issued an unexpected profits warning and released details of exposure to
companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. In the wake of the
warning the group's share price collapsed and it subsequently reported a
Pounds 6.3m pre-tax loss for the year to March 31.
Mr McCann also has extensive industrial experience with Black &amp; Decker,
Allegheny International and Littlewoods. Most recently, institutional
investors in Astra asked him to take over as chief executive to resolve its
financial difficulties.
Although he, with Mr Roy Barber as chairman, managed a significant
improvement in Astra's performance, from losses of Pounds 65m to near
break-even, the burden of debt prevented a capital reconstruction and the
company eventually went into receivership.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BENNETT &amp; Fountain, the electrical group, swung into losses in the year to
end-June as the recession took its toll on the building and construction
sectors.
Pre-tax losses - after redundancy costs of Pounds 607,000 and a reduced
interest charge of Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 2.46m) - were Pounds 3.55m, against
profits of Pounds 2.31m last year.
Turnover, which included Pounds 13.6m from discontinued operations, fell to
Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 74.1m). Losses per share were 3.2p (earnings 2.2p).
The company said that because of the substantial deficit on the profit and
loss reserve there would be no final dividend on either the ordinary or
preference shares.
A number of branches were disposed of in November, and an extraordinary item
of Pounds 3.84m represents the results of these operations.

finance director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICARDO INTERNATIONAL, the engineering design group, yesterday reported a 56
per cent decline in full year pre-tax profits, and announced that Mr Matthew
Thorne, finance director, had resigned 'to pursue his other interests.'
Mr Thorne's departure, said to be 'amicable', follows the resignation in
June of Mr Roger Smedley as chairman and chief executive, after pressure
from non-executive directors. He was replaced by Mr Christopher Ross as
chief executive and Sir Philip Foreman as chairman.
The company, which also yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Cecil
Foreman as a non-executive director, said the appointment of a new finance
director would be announced in the near future.
Pre-tax profits, struck after an Pounds 800,000 charge to cover
restructuring costs - including Mr Smedley's compensation package, fell to
Pounds 2.04m in the year to June 30.
This compared with profits of Pounds 4.65m last time and came on turnover
down from Pounds 63.5m to Pounds 57.6m.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 2.47m, with three of the
group's four operating divisions suffering losses. The only division to post
'a wholly satisfactory performance' was consulting engineers in the
automotive sector, even though its turnover slipped marginally to Pounds
18.4m (Pounds 18.6m).
Turnover in the aerospace division fell to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 27.4m)
although within the division the gas turbine group performed strongly.
Technical communications turnover slipped to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 6.2m), but
the hitech division managed to increase turnover to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds
11.2m).
Sir Philip described the results as 'disappointing,' but emphasised that the
group's balance sheet remained strong with shareholders' funds of Pounds 22m
and net borrowings of only Pounds 2.62m after capital expenditure of Pounds
2.6m.
The group's overall investment in research and development was Pounds 1m,
mainly focused in the automotive business.
After a reduced tax charge of Pounds 885,000 (Pounds 1.53m) earnings per
share came out at 3.6p (9.9p).
An unchanged final dividend of 3.8p is recommended, maintaining the total
for the year at 5.7p. Although the dividend is not fully covered by
earnings, Sir Philip said it 'reflects the underlying strength of the
group.'
On prospects, Sir Philip said the new financial year would be very
challenging. Nonetheless, the actions taken to redirect the activities of
the company would result in a stronger, healthier enterprise.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Interest savings boost More O'Ferrall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DROP in interest charges helped More O'Ferrall, the billboard and bus
shelter advertising contractor, increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent,
from Pounds 812,000 to Pounds 936,000, for the six months to June 30.
Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said the overall advertising market
continued to be 'short-term and erratic'. Revenues were up in the third
quarter, but there was 'a long way to go before we get anywhere near
recovery,' he said. Much would depend on the outcome of the economic
situation in the UK over the next six weeks.
Nevertheless, the interim dividend is again 3.2p, and uncovered for the
second consecutive year with unchanged earnings per share of 2.1p.
Mr Gore-Andrews said the pay-out had been held as there was 'no reason for
thinking that things are going to be any worse than last year'.
Turnover was down by 1 per cent to Pounds 28.6m. The Pounds 13m 1-for-4
rights issue in October last year was responsible for a drop in interest
payments from Pounds 1.65m to Pounds 857,000. However, gearing currently
stood a little above the 26 per cent of June 30 and was expected to remain
so.
Mr Gore-Andrews said business in the first quarter had been 'extremely poor
in relation to a very good quarter in 1991'. Poster advertising declined by
10 per cent, compared with an advance of 15 per cent in 1991.
The improved second quarter had not been enough to avert an overall decline
in operating profits of 27 per cent to Pounds 1.79m during the first half.
Sharpest drop was in the UK, where profits fell by 81 per cent to Pounds
241,000 on turnover 5 per cent down at Pounds 16.5m. The deepening recession
in France resulted in a 60 per cent decline in profits there to Pounds
263,000. Belgium improved significantly, following the reorganisation of the
Visibility business acquired in 1990; profits increased from Pounds 570,000
to Pounds 1.32m.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho sells Firsteel via buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, has sold Firsteel Group, a
narrow steel strip processor and distributor, to its management.
Mr Frank Neale, a partner of Phildrew Ventures, which helped fund the
management buy-out, said the price was close to the Pounds 21m net asset
value of the company.
Over the last year Lonrho has been making a series of disposals to reduce
its debt. At the half year to March 31 net debt fell from Pounds 1.1bn to
Pounds 903m.
Firsteel last year had sales of more than Pounds 80m. It has financing of
Pounds 24.5m, comprising Pounds 11.5m of debt facilities from Midland Bank,
Pounds 10.5m raised by Phildrew Ventures and Pounds 2.5m of mezzanine
finance organised by Midland Montagu Ventures.
The transaction represents the first buy-out for Phildrew's Pounds 108m
third fund which owns the majority stake in the West Midlands-based
business.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Rutland Trust falls by 9% to Pounds 3.54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUTLAND TRUST, the financial services and property surveying group, suffered
a decline of almost 9 per cent in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.87m to
Pounds 3.54m, in the first six months of 1992.
Mr Christopher Dowling, director of corporate finance, said that the result
was 'satisfactory under the (recessionary) circumstances'.
Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said that all three divisions had
remained profitable 'although at a lower rate' and the group was 'in a
healthy financial position'. The interim dividend is held at 0.27p.
The head office/corporate finance division lifted pre-tax profits from
Pounds 266,000 to Pounds 639,000. Rutland has central cash resources of a
little more than Pounds 8m net giving it interest of some Pounds 500,000.
However, some corporate finance deals have been delayed by recent
uncertainties. Progress at Capital Industries, in which it has a 37.9 per
cent interest, was 'encouraging'.
Trading conditions in the second-hand car market were 'at an all-time low',
said Mr Dowling, though he felt that the bottom of the cycle had been
reached and was encouraged for next year.
Profits in the asset financing side declined by 25 per cent, from Pounds
1.2m to Pounds 892,000.
In professional services profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds
2.41m). Ellis &amp; Buckle, the loss-adjusting business, received fewer claims
because of the mild winter, but managed to gain market share. However,
building surveying at Hunter &amp; Partners traded only at about break-even.
Group turnover was down at Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 52.2m), partly, said Mr
Dowling, because this time Capital Industries was an associate.
After tax of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.35m) and minorities of Pounds 233,000
(Pounds 388,000) earnings slipped to 0.84p (0.88p) per share.

The net asset value per share of Murray Ventures, the Edinburgh-based
investment group, stood at 286.2p at the July 31 year end, against 305.8p a
year earlier.
Directors said it had been a record year for unlisted disposals with Pounds
15.7m realised for a net gain on cost of Pounds 7.5m.
Net revenue increased to Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 2.98m) and earnings per share
came out at 12.2p (12.04p). A same-again final dividend of 6.9p is proposed
to maintain the total at 10.3p.

SWP Group, the Worcestershire-based building components supplier, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 30,000 for the year to June 30, against Pounds
826,000. The usual single final dividend is being passed.
However, as a result of cost cutting and efforts to expand in niche areas,
Mr Robert Stickings, chairman of the USM-quoted company, said that an
improvement was expected in the present year. Figures from the first two
months supported his view.
Turnover fell 25 per cent to Pounds 7.74m (Pounds 10.3m). Earnings per share
were 0.1p, compared with 2.2p last time when there was a final dividend of
0.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caverdale, the motor and engineering trade consumables group, yesterday
announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 272,000 for the six months to end-June.
This compares with profits of Pounds 247,000 for the comparable period last
year and with losses of Pounds 305,000 at the December year end.
The pre-tax figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 112,000
(Pounds 332,000 gain) relating to the costs of an abortive acquisition.
Turnover fell 13 per cent to Pounds 4.77m and losses per share were 0.31p
(earnings 1.87p).

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Substantial rise in losses at Era
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Era Group, the retailer and distributor, incurred a seasonal loss of Pounds
1.66m in the half year to June 30, compared with Pounds 951,000.
Mr Tony Fay, chairman, described the result as in line with expectations and
satisfactory in the economic conditions.
He pointed out that the year's results were dependent on November and
December trading - last year the group made Pounds 2.17m pre-tax profit. He
said a return of consumer confidence was still awaited, but the group had
moved ahead significantly over the past 18 months with new stores, designs
and products.
The group trades in models and toys, photographic, video and related
electronics, and console and computer based games. Turnover this time came
to Pounds 29.3m (Pounds 28.7m) on which gross margins were slightly lower
partly because of competitive pressures.
Losses per share were 2.07p (1.28p). The cumulative preference dividend,
absorbing Pounds 96,000, has been passed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced operating profit, coupled with higher interest charges, meant Atlas
Converting Equipment showed a drop of 26 per cent in pre-tax profits for the
first half of 1992.
From turnover of Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 21.5m), operating profit came to
Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.07m). Interest costs were Pounds 267,000 (Pounds
13,000). Earnings per share were 18.4p (24.6p) and the interim dividend is
again 7p.
Mr Christopher Rogers, chairman, said turnover was lower than anticipated as
a result of a technically difficult mix of machines.
Output for the second half would be higher than for the first, he said, and
added that orders for 1993 and prospects also showed signs of improvement.
'With 90 per cent of our output exported, the recent effective devaluation
of the pound will give us a strong competitive edge and this further
increases our confidence.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar to appoint two more
non-executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the property, engineering and construction group, has
decided to appoint two more non-executive directors in response to criticism
from institutional shareholders.
The group yesterday confirmed that the board, which met on Wednesday, had
decided to beef up its non-executive directors. While the group has been
looking to increase the number of non-executives for some time it is now
treating the matter with some urgency in light of shareholder unease with
the group's performance.
Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman, is understood to have drawn up a list of
suitable candidates and hopes to announce the new appointments by the end of
the year.
The group's three non-executive directors are Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA
Group, the aircraft lessor which is trying to raise finance after its
flotation was aborted, Mr David Howell, the Conservative MP and Mr Alan
Clements a retired senior ICI director who has a string of non-executive
directorships.
Some of Trafalgar's biggest shareholders have told the group that they
expect the new independent non-executives to decide whether the present
management is able to halt the slide in the group's share price.
In June 1991 the group raised Pounds 310m with a rights issue priced at 190p
a share to fund the acquisition of Davy Corporation. Since then the shares
have collapsed to a low of 45p.
Yesterday they closed 7 1/2 p up at 57 1/2 p.
After Trafalgar's board meeting this week directors were adamant that there
would be no changes at the top.
However, four of the group's 10 biggest shareholders said they believed new
non-executives would be in a better position to decide whether or not there
should be any managerial changes.
One institutional shareholder said: 'Shareholders are not in a position to
know who is to blame for what has happened. I hope new non-executive
directors will be able to make a judgment about who is to blame and whether
there should be any managerial changes.'
The message from Trafalgar's directors is that the group is determined to
improve its communications with the City and avoid the previous criticisms
of its accounting when it announces its full-year results in December.
Trafalgar House's accounts have been criticised by shareholders for their
liberal use of write-downs, revaluations and reclassification of properties.
A Trafalgar executive said: 'We will provide more detail and explanation in
our accounts than ever before.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Norman Hay turns in Pounds 393,000 deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite directors' 'best efforts to contain losses', Norman Hay, the
engineering group, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 393,000 for the six
months to end-June.
The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 85,000 last time and with a
loss of Pounds 2.16m at the December year end. Turnover fell to Pounds 4.2m
(Pounds 5.56m).
The company said the loss had resulted from difficulties encountered in
combining its Heathrow operations with the Coventry businesses during 'the
most prolonged and severe recession in living memory'.
Directors added that they were unable to view the economic outlook for the
country with any degree of optimism and expected the loss reported to
increase for the full year.
Losses per share came out at 1.8p (earnings 0.4p). The directors consider it
imprudent to pay an interim dividend - 0.5p was paid last year - but said
they would review the circumstances at the year end.

Tight control of overheads and increased sales through booksellers and book
clubs enabled Headline Book Publishing to increase interim pre-tax profits
by 60 per cent from Pounds 378,000 to Pounds 604,000.
Sales in July and August were 34 per cent ahead of last year and the company
said that the second half would be helped by two acquisitions in April and
July. It added that the plan to increase its new book programme from 300 to
400 titles in the year was on schedule.
Turnover for the first half of 1992 increased 20 per cent to Pounds 5.3m
(Pounds 4.42m) and earnings per share came out at 3.6p (3.2p). An interim
dividend of 1.5p is declared. Last year there was a payment of 0.5p for the
period from flotation in April to the end of June.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the effects of the continuing resession in its markets, Yule
Catto, the industrial chemicals and building products group, showed a 4 per
cent improvement in the six months to June 30.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 10.2m, against Pounds 9.87m last time, and were
struck on turnover down by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 126m. The result was helped
by a lower interest charge of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 1.76m).
Directors said the speciality chemicals operations had performed strongly,
with sales and profits increasing by 4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.
However, 'unsurprisingly', the building product companies had experienced
tough trading conditions, they added.
An interim dividend of 2.5p (2.3p) is declared, covered three times by
earnings per share of 7.5p (7.2p).
Since the start of the current year two small acquisitions have been made,
both of which have been fully integrated within existing operations, the
company said.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Berkertex businesses sold to Wm Baird
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM BAIRD, the textiles and engineering company, has acquired most of
the rest of Berkertex Holdings that the receiver had not previously sold.
The combined turnover of the acquired businesses was Pounds 29.1m in the
year to January 1992.
The price was not revealed, but Baird said that it 'reflected the forced
nature of the sale'. Conversely, Touche Ross, the receiver, said that the
amount reflected 'the attractiveness of the businesses'.
Last week, the receivers at the last minute and in a fairy godmotherly way,
agreed to supply dresses ordered from the collapsed company for the Queen
Charlotte's Ball in London.
Mr Andrew Mills-Baker, Baird's finance director, said that the acquisition
was a good fit with his company's current operations and filled gaps in the
women's wear market that it did not already cover.
The same also applied to the bridal wear segment - Berkertex Bridal, which
operates at the upper end, will be run by Baird's Bridal Fashions, which
leans towards the lower. Baird's Windsmoor Group, which makes smart everyday
women's wear, will operate Berkertex Dress, which makes formal women's wear,
and Genesis, which makes smart casual wear.
Mr Mills-Baker said that the acquisition was a good opportunity for his
group. Baird had been able to pick and choose what it wanted - it only
bought two of the Berkertex shops (Bond Street, London and Nottingham),
leaving the remaining 14 with the receiver. It had picked up most of the
shops-within-shops in the UK and 26 in Spain, where Windsmoor also has
concessions.
Furthermore, Baird had bought the goodwill and the trademarks of famous
brand names, as well as the stock at a discount. With those advantages and
the opportunities for running the acquired businesses without overheads
rising proportionally, Mr Mills-Baker said he was pleased to have outbid the
other interested companies, both UK and non-UK.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 1.3m at Hopkinsons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Hopkinsons Group, the industrial valve and hydraulic
equipment maker, showed a marked decline, from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.34m,
in the six months to end-July. The shares closed 7p lower at 32p.
The pre-tax figure was struck after an interest charge of Pounds 608,000,
against income of Pounds 1.29m, and an exceptional provision of Pounds
600,000 for redundancy costs in the gas division.
Mr Ralph Goodall, chairman, said last year's interest income had been
eliminated on the purchase of Carbo in October last year. Borrowing had
increased, he added, but gearing, at 41 per cent, remained within acceptable
limits.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 18.7m) reflecting a full six months'
contribution from Carbo. Group operating profits improved by 48 per cent to
Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m).
Mr Goodall said there was currently no sign of an upturn in the group's main
markets and the timing and extent of any recovery remained uncertain, with
no expectation of significant improvement within the next 12 months.
The interim dividend is reduced to 0.9p (1.2p), payable from earnings of
1.4p (3.18p) per share.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Philip Green quits as Amber Day's Pounds
7.53m disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTROVERSIAL career of Mr Philip Green as chairman and chief executive
of Amber Day ended yesterday when the discount retailer announced
unexpectedly poor results.
Mr Green, 40, said he had resigned from the board and would cease all
executive functions within the group, which reported annual pre-tax profits
of Pounds 7.53m. It was well below the forecast of at least Pounds 10.1m
made as recently as mid-June, when downgrading analysts' expectations of
Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m.
Amber Day's shares collapsed from a peak of 129p last November following a
series of bear raids and newspaper stories about Mr Green's business
associates and commercial deals. The shares yesterday closed 1p higher at
35p.
Mr Green said all the claims had been investigated by the company's advisers
and found to be groundless. However, the board announced in June that Mr
Green intended to split his role with an independent chairman, after the
resignation of the group's finance director and only non-executive director,
both within a year of joining the group.
Amber Day's advisers, including bankers Samuel Montagu and stockbrokers
Smith New Court, insisted on the quality of the group's underlying business,
the Glasgow-based discount chain What Everyone Wants, which it bought in
1990 for Pounds 46.7m.
The line that Amber Day's problems were merely to do with corporate
governance could not stand the strain of the surprise drop in sales and
profits, which proved the last straw for the group's advisers and main
shareholders.
One adviser said the board, including Mr Green, recognised that he would
have to go in order to salvage any of the group's hugely diminished
credibility. Mr Green still owns 10 per cent of the group, which has seen
its market value drop from Pounds 158m to Pounds 43m at last night's close.
Mr Green said the company had suffered from a lot of undeserved publicity,
which was causing management of the business such distraction that he
believed it was right for him to stand down.
Mr David Thompson, who joined as finance director in July, has temporarily
assumed the roles of chairman and chief executive. The board said it
intended to appoint a new chairman, chief executive and at least one
non-executive director as soon as possible.
Total group turnover fell from Pounds 103.1m to Pounds 96.5m in the year to
August 1. The group blamed the profits shortfall on over-optimistic sales
forecasts which required markdowns to clear stock. Sale of the mens' wear
division caused an extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.99m.
Earnings per share fell from 6.81p to 3.87p. The final dividend of 2p gives
a total for the year of 3.1p, compared with 2.7p.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Newarthill loss grows to Pounds 9.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Newarthill, the family-controlled holding company for the civil engineer Sir
Robert McAlpine whose listing was cancelled in 1989, reported an increase in
pre-tax losses from Pounds 5.35m to Pounds 9.21m for the six months to April
30.
However, Sir John Greenborough, chairman, said that the second half loss was
expected to be substantially less than the first.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 245m to Pounds 135m producing an operating loss
of Pounds 3.66m, compared with Pounds 4.44m. The pre-tax deficit was struck
after a provision of Pounds 3.76m for the loss in the partnership
development on the Haymarket Leicester project, redundancy costs of Pounds
1.39m and Australian restructuring costs of Pounds 409,000.
After a tax credit of Pounds 845,000 (Pounds 1.28m charge), and taking in
profits on sales of securities and investment properties of Pounds 4.96m
(Pounds 1.21m), the attributable loss came out at Pounds 3.42m (Pounds
5.37m). Losses per share were 63.9p (50.1p).
Sir John said that construction activities made a profit before redundancy
costs.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals add to losses at DY Davies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN 88 per cent increase in exceptional items further depressed losses at DY
Davies in the year to April 30.
Pre-tax losses of this USM-quoted architect surged from Pounds 543,000 to
Pounds 1.67m.
The Pounds 950,000 exceptional charges were for costs associated with
surplus property, bad debts, redundancies, and disposal of fixed assets.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said he was optimistic that the majority of the
company's high level of excess office space resulting from staff reductions
during the year would be removed and costs borne in the current financial
year.
Mr Davies, who said the company's performance was affected by the severe
recession hitting the construction industry, also announced that board
members have agreed to accept salary reductions amounting to an average of
25 per cent in the current year.
Turnover fell 30 per cent to Pounds 7.29m. An increase in operating losses
to Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 349,000) was partly offset by a reduction in
interest charges to Pounds 287,000 (386,000).
Mr Davies said the company had secured a rescheduling of Pounds 1.3m of its
bank borrowings, or 50 per cent of total debt, to long-term finance
repayable in three to 10 years.
Losses per share jumped to 21.8p (5.5p).

FT  25 SEP 92 / Barings cuts jobs in effort to stem losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARINGS, the privately controlled UK merchant banking group, yesterday shed
108 employees at its securities trading subsidiary, Baring Securities, in an
attempt to stem heavy losses.
It also reorganised the senior management of Baring Securities, which made
losses of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m in the six months to June 30,
according to Mr Andrew Tuckey, Barings' deputy chairman. An executive in
Barings' merchant banking operations, Mr Peter Norris, is becoming chief
operating officer of Baring Securities.
The losses were responsible for a fall in Barings' group pre-tax profits
from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 11.8m in the six months to June 30. Mr Tuckey
said he was particularly pleased with the way in which the group was working
with Dillon Read, the Wall Street investment bank in which Barings acquired
a 40 per cent interest late last year.
Baring Securities, set up in 1984, was for many years one of the UK's most
profitable international securities trading firms, winning The Queen's Award
for Export. Its founder, Mr Christopher Heath, became one of the UK's
highest paid executives.
Mr Tuckey said Baring Securities, with 1,260 employees, had become too big
for Mr Heath to have sole responsibility for day-to-day management. So Mr
Heath is giving up his title of managing director to become chairman of
Baring Securities, concentrating on developing new business and seeing
clients.
The losses fell in Baring Securities Japanese and continental European
operations. However, extensive operations in other parts of south-east Asia
and Latin America are trading profitably.
More than half the redundancies are in the London headquarters. There were
also 15 departures from the Tokyo office and 13 from the Frankfurt office,
which is being closed.
Barings is reorganising its European operations to concentrate on southern
European markets, where it believes its research is superior to rivals'.
The reorganisation has made some of its office space redundant. In the
second half of the year, Barings will therefore take a charge of Pounds 10m
to cover the cost of lay-offs and the surplus property.
Profits of Barings' corporate finance, banking and capital markets
operations were almost unchanged in the first half. However there was a fall
in profits at its fund management subsidiary.

FT  25 SEP 92 / French bank's fate hinges on chairman: Analysts may be
losing patience with Jean-Yves Haberer's mounting provisions at Credit
Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the grandest of the grandiose bank buildings on the Boulevard des
Italiens in Paris is number 19 which was built in the 1870s as the
headquarters of Credit Lyonnais, a leading bank in the city of Lyons, then
making its first move into the French capital.
The Credit Lyonnais board was not at all sure its excursion into Paris would
work. Just in case, it built the new headquarters in the design of a
department store, so the building could be converted if the bank beat a
retreat back to Lyons. For the past few years the joke running around the
other banks on the Boulevard des Italiens has been that number 19 may yet be
turned into a department store.
Whenever a group of international bankers gathers together the fate of
Credit Lyonnais, one of the biggest of France's state-controlled banks, and
of its controversial chairman, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, is almost always on the
agenda. Since he became chairman four years ago, Mr Haberer has pursued a
strategy of international expansion and aggressive lending which, his fellow
bankers say, may make or break Credit Lyonnais.
Earlier this week Credit Lyonnais fanned the flames of the debate by
announcing a collapse in net profits from FFr1.61bn in the first six months
of 1991, to just FFr119m (Pounds 13.7m) in the first half of this year. The
reason for the fall was a hefty increase in provisions on bad debts and sour
investments from FFr3.37bn to FFr6.25bn over the same period.
Banking analysts, who had been bracing themselves for a slight fall in
interim profits to between FFr1.3bn and FFr1.6bn, were taken completely by
surprise. So it seemed was Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled French
electronics group which is one of Credit Lyonnais' largest minority
shareholders with a 15.5 per cent stake. Thomson-CSF issued a profits
warning immediately after Credit Lyonnais' results. It chairman, Mr Alain
Gomez, was quick to identify the cause of his company's problems - Credit
Lyonnais.
The bank has grown accustomed to criticism under the chairmanship of Mr
Haberer. But until now banking analysts have been prepared to give it the
benefit of the doubt. The critical question is whether the shock of the
interim results, coupled with Mr Haberer's warning that there will be
another steep set of provisions in the second half, has erased the benefit.
The first signs of strain emerged last summer when Credit Lyonnais unveiled
a fall in net profits from FFr3.71bn in 1990 to FFr3.16bn in 1991. It also
announced an increase in client risk provisions from FFr4.2bn to FFr9.5bn -
the legacy of Mr Haberer's loans to clients including Mr Robert Maxwell, the
disgraced British media magnate, and Olympia &amp; York, the collapsed Canadian
property concern.
The 1991 figures also accentuated the positive aspects of Mr Haberer's
strategy. The restructuring of the French retail banking network was bearing
fruit, as was the group's expansion into retail banking across Europe and
into investment banking in the US.
Moreover, although Credit Lyonnais, appeared more precarious than its fellow
French banks, the level of its provisions as a proportion of total loans (at
around 1.6 per cent) was far lower than those of its UK and US competitors.
Analysts were still reasonably sanguine.
Times have changed. This week's interim profits were well below
expectations. 'We all knew they were going to be bad, but not that bad,'
said Mr Keith Brown, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. The
situation was scarcely improved by Mr Haberer's insouciant reaction to the
results: 'It's one half year, no more and no less.'
Analysts are even more concerned about the level of Credit Lyonnais'
first-half provisions and by the warning of more to come. Their concern has
been aggravated by Credit Lyonnais' refusal to specify exactly what the
provisions consist of, and whether it has finished writing down critical
portfolios such as its Dollars 350m (Pounds 205m) exposure to Olympia &amp; York
and its Dollars 215m of loans to Mr Maxwell.
All Credit Lyonnais will say about the interim provisions is that they come
from three sources: losses on loans to small businesses in France and on
French property investments; failed film investments (including MGM, the
stricken Hollywood studio) made by its Dutch subsidiary; and from bad debts
to international enterprises, including Olympia &amp; York.
'How can we be expected to come to a sensible assessment when Credit
Lyonnais won't tell us what provisions it has already made and how much is
left?' said Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at Shearson Lehmann in
London.
Most analysts are now much more sceptical about Credit Lyonnais' prospects
for the full financial year. 'It's impossible to say how much it'll make but
it certainly won't be anywhere near our original forecast of FFr3.6bn,' said
Morgan Stanley's Mr Brown.
In the meantime Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has put
Credit Lyonnais' long-term debt rating under review for possible downgrade
for the second time in a year.
As for the long term, analysts are concerned that Mr Haberer's corporate
style may turn out to have been too risky for Credit Lyonnais. 'This is a
bank that has pursued a high-risk strategy and, if all goes well, in five
years' time we could all be saying 'Wow]',' said Ms Garrard of Shearson
Lehmann. 'A year ago I still thought that might happen. Now I'm not so
sure.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / BA buys 49.9% of TAT for Pounds 17.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is acquiring a 49.9 per cent stake in the French regional
airline Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT) for Pounds 17.25m with an
option to buy the rest by April 1, 1997.
The investment is part of BA's strategy to create a global airline by buying
big stakes in other airlines. BA has already agreed to buy 44 per cent of
USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 439m) and bought a large minority stake this
year in Delta, a German regional airline which has since been renamed
Deutsche BA.
Other international carriers including American Airlines, United Airlines
and Swissair were understood to have considered acquiring a stake in TAT.
The French regional carrier is based in Tours, and operates a network of
French and European destinations including a service between Paris and
London's Gatwick airport.
It operates 54 aircraft, carried 3m passengers last year and employs 1,540
people.
BA said yesterday it intended to help TAT develop its route network and
strengthen its competitive position as a regional airline in the new
European single aviation market.
The BA acquisition is expected to intensify competition between the regional
carrier and Air France, which was forced last year by the European
Commission to sell its 35 per cent stake in TAT when it took over UTA, the
French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the French domestic airline.
BA said the acquisition, which includes only the airline activities of the
TAT group, would be funded from its cash resources. After making a small
pre-tax profit last year, BA said TAT was expected to incur losses this year
as it expanded its international routes.
But the UK carrier said it did not expect material dilution in earnings nor
material change in the debt-to-capital ratios as a result of the investment.
However, the deal, expected to be completed in January, has to be cleared by
the EC competition directorate and the French regulatory authorities.
Although BA's Pounds 17.25m investment was relatively small, City analysts
said TAT had commitments for about 10-15 new aircrafts to be delivered
between now and the end of next year which could prove more costly.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Dow switches to D-Mark invoicing after ERM turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOW, the US chemical giant, yesterday announced its European chemical
operations would begin invoicing in D-Marks immediately, abandoning the use
of local currencies.
The action appears to be the first time an international company has
required payment in a single European currency from its customers, and comes
in response to recent turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism.
Dow said margins of its chemical businesses, with an annual turnover of
Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.6bn), had been hit by the currency fluctuations this
month. A third of the group's sales had been affected by devaluations.
The group's main costs, energy and hydrocarbons, were dollar-denominated,
while two-thirds of its fixed costs were in D-Marks or Dutch guilders.
Mr Fernand Kaufmann, sales and commercial vice-president at Dow Europe,
said: 'Most of our costs are stable. But the devaluations have knocked
between 2 and 3 per cent off our European margins. For the first time in 10
years, European operations made a loss in the second quarter. Quite simply,
margins are so depressed we cannot afford to absorb the devaluations.'
The company, which is attempting to impose price increases for its products
during the fourth quarter this year, said the aim of the D-Mark move was not
to make extra money.
'We also need to act out of fairness to our customers in markets with strong
currencies and avoid price differentials brought about by currency
fluctuations,' said Mr Kaufmann. 'The benefits of devaluations wear off
quickly,' he added.
He admitted the company was taking a risk that competitors would not follow
its example, and would use lower prices to gain market share. The move was
effective from yesterday.
Mr Clive Johnson, a partner in the treasury group at Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy firm, said he believed Dow was the first company to bill in a
single European currency.
A few companies operate partial billings in ECUs, and the aviation industry
 -including fuel and aircraft leasing - tends to operate with dollars, he
said.
He said in the long-term Dow's move might offer stability, but in the
short-term it would add to its currency exposure.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Vickers cuts its interim dividend: UK engineering group
blames continuing losses at Rolls-Royce Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICKERS, the UK engineering group, blamed continuing losses at its
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary when it yesterday cut its interim dividend
from 3.7p to 0.5p. The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.1m in the
six months to June 30, compared with a Pounds 4.3m loss last time, although
turnover increased from Pounds 330.2m to Pounds 349.3m.
Vickers, which cut last year's final dividend, said the latest reduction
reflected the losses at Rolls-Royce Motors, and consequent restructuring
costs. The 950 job cuts at Crewe announced yesterday will be taken as a
Pounds 12m exceptional charge in the second half, but the first half also
included an exceptional restructuring and redundancy charge of Pounds 1.7m,
half incurred at Crewe.
Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said: 'Prospects for the year are uncertain and
it is therefore prudent to conserve cash and ensure our ability to support
our defence, aerospace, marine engineering and medical businesses, and
Cosworth, all of which are trading satisfactorily.'
Sir Richard said the board intended to adopt a policy of continued dividend
growth, albeit from a lower level, reflecting the sustainable long-term
earnings growth when trading improved.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said the performance of the aerospace
business, comprising Ross Catherall and Vickers Precision Components, had
been encouraging. Cosworth, which makes high-performance engines, was hit by
cuts at its principal customer, Ford, but its racing operations were
successful.
The marine engineering division encountered sluggish demand and strong
competition, but had won valuable orders.
The group's medical equipment business, which experienced a record year in
1991, suffered from lower demand in the US and uncertainty in Europe. Sir
Colin said he expected an improvement in the second half.
Vickers is continuing the development and manufacturing phase of the new
Challenger 2 battle tank programme, for which it last year won a Pounds 520m
order from the British government.
Losses per share were 1.8p, compared with 2.6p last time. Gearing was 33 per
cent at June 30, but is likely to rise to between 45 per cent and 50 per
cent by the year-end, because of the cash drain from Rolls-Royce Motors.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Vickers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard on the heels of British Aerospace, Vickers has demonstrated how easily
defence profits can glide silently into the black hole of diversification.
And as with BAe, Vickers must struggle to persuade the market that its
problems are under control. Despite the robust way in which Vickers has cut
costs at Rolls-Royce Motors, sales have fallen faster than overheads,
generating a string of trading losses on top of rationalisation charges.
Vickers' gearing is rising rapidly and will reach 50 per cent by the year
end. It is merger or closure for BAe's regional jets. Distressingly, Rolls
cars may go the same way.
The problems at Rolls go well beyond the downturn in the luxury car market,
though that is bad enough. Rolls needs heavy investment if it is to match
the technology being developed by Mercedes and the Japanese. Vickers simply
cannot inject cash on the scale required. Providing capital to update
existing models can only be a holding exercise. Besides, there is an image
problem for a car designed to appeal to a disappearing sense of British
status.
It is understandable that much management time is being spent getting the
Rolls fire under control. But, disappointingly given the failure to reach an
accommodation with BMW, fire-fighting begins to look like the only strategy
on offer. There are some profitable operations in Vickers. Without Rolls the
company could make profits of Pounds 40m a year. Even the tank business may
generate export orders, though the market will be tough. Yet a clutch of
businesses, however profitable, do not add up to a company with strategic
purpose. Sir Colin Chandler, the new chief executive, has yet to show he can
provide some.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: The relegation zone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's fall of nearly three pfennigs yesterday was a taste of what life
in the slow lane can be like. We do not yet know whether the Bundesbank and
the Bank of France have finally triumphed in their battle with the currency
speculators. It may be that the latter will have another go, but the Bank of
France will doubtless ensure that the cost of being short of francs is
prohibitive over the weekend. And the central banks certainly seemed to be
on a winning streak yesterday. That not only lessens the chance of a cut in
German interest rates; if the attack on the franc is repelled, France and
Germany may want quickly to cement their victory by establishing a hard
currency zone within Europe.
Encouraged by Mr Major's apparent distaste for a speedy return to the ERM,
the UK equity market jumped to the conclusion that sterling's position
outside such an arrangement left more room for rate cuts. The trend in the
currency market suggests otherwise, at least in the medium term. Sterling
will be more vulnerable to speculative swings. Monetary policy will have to
be rigorous if foreigners are to be convinced to buy gilts. The UK joined
the ERM in 1990 partly with the immediate aim of cutting short term interest
rates. It is easy to forget that that was preceded by a period in which the
government was running a surplus and had no need to fund itself in the bond
market.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Delors hints at two-speed union: France and Germany could
lead other EC states to quicker integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany could proceed to economic and monetary union with a few
European Community partners if other countries held up the Maastricht
treaty, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, suggested
last night.
Mr Delors, in a thinly veiled reference to growing UK opposition to to
Maastricht, said: 'If some countries are looking for alibis for delaying the
treaty, it may well be that others take the lead . . . This cannot be ruled
out.'
Mr Delors was careful not name the countries which could proceed to speedier
integration. But his remarks were the most concrete indications to date that
France and Germany may be considering forging closer links based on an
'inner core' of EC states.
Speculation about a 'two-speed' split in the EC - under which a
Franco-German 'core', supplemented by the Benelux countries, would press
ahead with political and monetary union - has been fuelled by this month's
financial turbulence.
By throwing its weight behind support for the French franc, the Bundesbank
has underlined the strength of German political commitment to monetary ties
with France. This contrasts with Germany's less enthusiastic support for
maintaining parities with the lira and sterling, the two currencies which
have withdrawn from the exchange rate mechanism.
Pointing to the success of this week's Franco-German co-operation in
defending the franc, Mr Delors said: 'The actions of every day bring us new
lessons on how to proceed'. Officials in Bonn and Paris meanwhile denied a
German newspaper report that the two countries had agreed to press ahead
with 'high-speed' union. Mr Dieter Vogel, the Bonn government spokesman,
said: 'These claims are invented and have no basis in fact.' An official at
the Elysee palace dismissed the story as 'a flight of fancy'.
However, this month's split between 'hard' and 'soft' European currencies
has intensified the belief that a 'two-speed' Europe is inevitable.
Mr Delors was reticent on specific proposals to restore order to the ERM. 'I
have to be cautious,' he said. 'To have a stable market we need to fulfil
certain requirements. But it's not really the moment to put forward
proposals. It will be necessary to think either about the ERM or about
accelerating the process of economic and monetary union,' he added.
In an unscripted and impassioned attack on Maastricht's opponents, which
came perilously close to identifying UK Euro-sceptics, Mr Delors asked:
'What do the partisans (of rejecting the treaty) propose instead? The
short-term satisfaction of their public opinion and personal vanity. This is
leading to decline and ridicule.'
EC finance ministers will discuss possible reforms of the ERM at their
regular meeting on Monday. UK officials said the 'shortcomings' of the ERM,
outlined by Mr John Major, the prime minister, would be discussed, in
preparation for the special EC summit in Birmingham on October 16.

IRELAND and Portugal yesterday introduced new foreign exchange controls to
protect their fragile currencies, although signs emerged that some of the
recent pressures in the European exchange rate mechanism were petering out.
While the punt and the escudo both gained ground during the day against the
D-Mark, the battle to prop up the French franc appeared to be shifting in
favour of the combined forces of the Bank of France and the German
Bundesbank.
This was signalled by the franc gaining about 1 centime on the day against
the D-Mark, to close comfortably above its ERM floor, partly in response to
recent heavy action by the two central banks in buying francs for D-Marks.
But the peseta was a notable weak performer, closing last night in London
near its ERM floor after a large fall on the Madrid stock market sparked by
Wednesday's introduction of exchange controls. That move, even though it
promised some respite for the beleaguered Spanish currency, was viewed as
negative for the Spanish economy by many investors.
The Irish Central Bank yesterday tightened its foreign exchange controls to
reduce pressure on the punt, which has weakened along with several other
currencies as investors switched funds into the D-Mark.
This move led to Irish money market rates moving up by 7.25 percentage
points against the base rate, while Portugal also introduced currency
controls in an effort to stop selling of the escudo.
In the past 10 days, the pressures in the ERM have forced the suspension
from the mechanism of the pound and the lira, while the peseta has been
devalued by 5 per cent against the other eight currencies in the grid.
After slipping recently against the D-Mark the franc closed last night in
London at FFr3.4010, above its floor of FFr3.4305. But the peseta finished
at Pta70 to the D-Mark, perilously near its floor of Pta72.62.
In Madrid, the stockmarket fell to its lowest level in more than five years
yesterday and bond yields rose to historic highs as investors sold domestic
equities and debt following Wednesday's introduction of exchange controls by
the Bank of Spain.
'There is a clear sentiment, lead by foreigners, to get out of Spain. A lot
of confidence has been killed,' said Mr Alvaro Villacieros, chief of trading
at Iberagentes, the Madrid securities arm of Credit Lyonnais.
The Spanish authorities say the exchange control measures are aimed solely
at currency speculators and that they are purely temporary and will be
lifted as soon as the current exchange rate turmoil subsides.
In Washington, the recent moves in Europe to impose currency controls were
sharply criticised by Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
He urged their removal as soon as possible.
'Controls are a palliative of temporary effect only. Any step back to real
controls is a regressive step,' Mr Camdessus said.

little punctuation would occasionally help.
On the front page of your international edition (September 23) I wondered
whether 'Maastricht lives on promises Kohl' was intended as 'Maastricht
lives on, promises Kohl' or 'Maastricht lives on promises: Kohl'. However, a
few more minutes' thought persuaded me that in this case it probably didn't
matter. . .

FT  25 SEP 92 / Here a squiggle, there a wobble: Yesterday's performance by
the prime minister suggested not so much a U-turn as a U-squirm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's run of ill-fortune continues. He has lost a strategy,
forfeited a vision, and now failed to protect a best friend in his cabinet.
I will come to the minor matter of Mr David Mellor in a moment. Take the big
stuff first. The prime minister has spoken. The government's intentions
remain the same: they are as clear as mud. The cabinet's strategy for Europe
and the economy looks like a toss-up between two propositions. Either we are
in the midst of the mother of all U-turns, or what we heard yesterday will
go down as the first squiggle in what is likely to be a prolonged period of
wobble.
My vote is for the squiggle-wobble theory. Mr Major, whose current mood is
described by close colleagues as 'up and down', is, to his credit, sticking
to the most important of all the positions he has espoused since arriving at
Number 10 Downing Street. He still asserts that Britain must be a
participant in the affairs of its continental neighbours. Opening the
emergency debate yesterday he rejected the view, held by one or two of the
more lunatic anti-European MPs, that it was a mistake to enter the European
Community in the first place. He also derided the proposition, common among
vintage Euro-enthusiasts, that sooner or later a centralised Europe is
inevitable. 'Just as the interests of France or Germany will always come
first for them, so the interests of Britain will always come first for us,'
he said.
'The third school of thought about Europe is quite different,' he went on.
'It's that it is in the interests of Britain . . . for us to be part of the
development of our continent.' This kind of statement, of which there are
other examples, might, in happier times, serve to reassert his leadership.
So would the promise, firm on first hearing but unfortunately wobbly on
close examination, that once an unpredictable set of circumstances has come
to pass, the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty will once again be put
before the house. 'I do not believe it would be proper for a British prime
minister to agree a treaty and then disown it,' said Mr Major.
The difficulty with this stout affirmation lies in those unpredictable
circumstances. Take, first, the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major led
Britain in two years ago, then suddenly led us out last week. Yesterday he
made it clear that he will not advocate re-entry until the other
participating countries have done such things, he knows not what, as enable
the mechanism to work 'to the benefit of all its members'. These things
needed 'careful examination, careful consideration' before a decision to
return to membership could be made. That is a squiggle if ever there was
one. In July he set a single obstacle to ratification of the Maastricht
treaty. There must first be a solution to the Danish veto. Now he has added
a further obstacle, the incorporation into the treaty of a protocol on
subsidiarity. A clear wobble.
Thus the effect of a speech that contained passages worthy of the best in Mr
Major was diluted by the surrender of such territory as the Conservative
anti-Europeans are deemed to have captured for the duration. It did not
sound like a U-turn, more like a U-squirm. The prime minister's performance
was not enhanced by the opening remarks, which amounted to a list of
excuses, made all the more piquant by references to 'my formidable
predecessor'. It is hardly surprising that the Conservatives did not rise to
their feet to cheer. Only a scattering of order papers was waved. The
hostility of some of the Tory backbenchers was evident from both their
questions and the insulting tone in which they were put; one questioner had
to be reminded by Mr Major that he had fought the recent election on the
Conservative manifesto.
Those who fear a U-turn on the strategy for the economy will find similar
obfuscation in yesterday's debate. The prime minister told the Commons that
his administration would still fight for low inflation, albeit outside the
European exchange rate mechanism. He stood by Mr Norman Lamont, declaring:
'I take full responsibility for the actions and policies of my chancellor.'
The trouble here is that no one has any reason to believe what Mr Lamont
says any more.
My own view, from some knowledge of both of them, is that Mr Major and Mr
Lamont sincerely intend to maintain the reduction of inflation as the
lodestar by which economic policy is guided. They will not, however, be
believed by the markets until their actions demonstrate the truth of their
words. So far their one action, an interest rate cut, has been in the
direction of fostering growth, not bearing down on inflation.
Now for Mr Mellor. Shortly after the prime minister sat down yesterday the
news came through that the heritage secretary, known as the 'minister for
fun', had resigned. In the battle with the tabloids, the prime minister
lost. He had made more than one statement of steadfast support for his close
friend, who had been caught in an act of adultery, for which he should not
have had to resign, and hounded over stories about his acceptance of
hospitality, which would not have been pursued if there had been no adultery
to oil the lubricious word processors of the popular papers.
The question now is whether this is a sufficient blood-sacrifice for a
public that has wanted to see at least one member of the government topple
in the light of all the disturbing news of the past 10 days. Is Mr Mellor's
head to lie on the scaffold that might have dispatched Mr Lamont? We can
only ask the question. The proposition that Mr Lamont will not be next rests
more on his own purposeful build-up of a power base within the party than on
Mr Major's stated determination to protect the colleague who helped him
become leader of the party.
That is not the end of the tale of prime ministerial woe. The new leader of
the Labour party has emerged from his Trappist period and shown that when he
has a man in his open sights in a clear field he has no hesitation in mowing
him down. This Mr John Smith did mercilessly yesterday, with an easy command
of the house that Mr Major can only dream of. They listen even when Mr Smith
speaks in a low voice for dramatic effect; Mr Major has to shout above the
hubbub. The Labour leader, who has positioned himself solidly on Mr Major's
pre-devaluation European strategy, contented himself with displaying his
forensic skills and his talent for knockabout comedy. It lacked substance,
but was strong on entertainment value.
Mr Major and Mr Lamont may content themselves with the observation that in
their last contest with Mr Smith, in April, it was they who won. They (or at
least Mr Major) can look forward to four more years of office before taking
him on again. A simple U-turn would ensure that they coast to victory next
time. All Mr Lamont has to do is betray his own deep instincts and stoke up
a Lamont boom to stand in history alongside the Barber and Lawson booms. He
will not mean to, but the temptation must be strong. The likely result:
wobble.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: New orthodoxy on devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARVEY COLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A new orthodoxy seems to be developing. This suggests that, because of
the slack in the world economy, competitive pressures will stop us having to
pay the normal inflationary consequences of devaluation.
Only time will show whether this is true. However, if it is, then presumably
we will also fail to reap the export benefits that would otherwise be
associated with a lower value of the pound.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Cost of expansionary fiscal policy in Japan of key
significance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MASAKI OMURA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to comment on the recent editorials (August 19 and
September 1) regarding the Japanese fiscal authority's inaction over the
current economic problem. Because these attributed the delay of measures
solely to the authority's misjudgment of the economy, I think the most
important factor in the argument was missing. This is the cost of
expansionary fiscal policy, which the authority always calculates much
higher than others do because of its belief that the budget deficit cannot
be reduced at an economically desirable pace. The higher the cost, the more
the economic situation needs to be recognised as serious to adopt a drastic
expansionary policy.
l wonder how many economists and journalists, not to mention politicians,
who strongly advocated Japanese fiscal expansion on this occasion will show
the same enthusiasm about reduction of the budget deficit if the fiscal
authority has difficulty with it at a later stage. If the fiscal authority
thought it would have as much support for cutting the budget deficit as for
expanding it, its judgment would come closer to one based on purely economic
factors.
Although the articles cited the general government budget surplus of Japan
as evidence of room for flexibility, the central government budget shows one
of the worst situations among G5 countries, with debt-related service
exceeding 20 per cent of the total expense. The difference between the
deficit of the central government budget and the general government surplus
is mainly attributable to the surplus of the social pension fund. However,
this is the source of future payments to pensioners and is mainly used
through the Fiscal Investment Loan Programme, which also plays an important
role in economic policy. Owing to the rapid ageing of Japanese society,
future payments from the pension fund are expected to increase dramatically.
Under such circumstances, if the government used up this surplus in
expenditure not loans, as your articles suggest, it would soon face severe
difficulties.
Certainly, the authority should make optimum effort to achieve accurate
economic assessment. But the others, or at least the economists and the
journalists, also need to pay more attention to the political reality of the
budget cut process. Until we reach this situation we may have to live with
the ironical balance between neglect of the economic reality and of the
political one. Naturally the result will have to come with some delay, owing
to the present distance from reality. However, this may be the second best
solution at the moment.

Sad to see that Uli Schmidt, one of South Africa's few world class rugby
players, has pulled out of his team's forthcoming two-month tour of France
and England.
Pressure of work - he's a surgeon - is partly to blame. But so is the ANC's
increasing interference in the game. 'As a player, if you are denied the
symbols of your country, the flag, and the anthem, you are denied your
identity,' says Schmidt.
But isn't that what white South Africans have been doing to their black

Naturally, if you happen to head a polytechnic apotheosising itself into a
university, the critical issue is which title to award yourself.
After all, while 'director' might have befitted a poly, it's far too plain a
style for the newly grand. 'We had to have a vice-chancellor to show we were
doing the whole thing seriously,' says a 'deputy vice-chancellor' at the
University of Greenwich (alias Thames Polytechnic).
In the event, most of Britain's former polys have likewise adorned
themselves with V-Cs although a few have plumped for Euro-appeal with
rectors. But neither such style is good enough for Chris Price, the former
Labour MP who runs what is now Leeds Metropolitan University.
'Americans only understand presidents,' he contends. So he is about to
become one.

If there is one obvious lesson to be drawn from the Blue Arrow fiasco, it's
not to leave your Filofax lying around, and especially not on the boardroom
table.
The career of Mitchell Fromstein, the US boss of Blue Arrow's most important
Manpower business, ended temporarily after his missing Filofax fell into the
hands of Blue Arrow chairman Tony Berry. It triggered Fromstein's dismissal.
According to yesterday's DTI report into Blue Arrow, Berry was 'extremely
shocked' and 'numb' after he had read the plans that Fromstein had in mind.
Leaving aside the question of the propriety of reading someone else's
Filofax, Observer is much more puzzled by what someone as un-yuppie-like as
64-year-old Fromstein was doing with a bulging Filofax in the first place.

The strange reappearance of the name Ross Perot in connection with the
presidential election race has set American calculators clicking.
When earlier this year he stepped out of the limelight there was speculation
that he was unwilling to fund the scale of the task. If he's now back - in
some form - has he found the necessary?
The necessary, in this case, is pretty huge.
Back in July, Horizon Media calculated that a third-party candidate would
need to spend Dollars 4.49 a vote, or Dollars 153m, to stand a chance of
winning 34 per cent of the 100m Americans expected to vote in November, the
minimum percentage required to win a three-way race.
That's a big pork barrel by anyone's standards.

Who put Arkansas on the map - George Bush or the state's governor, Democrat
presidential candidate Bill Clinton?
Oddly enough, Bush aroused the biggest publicity boost for the state this
year by mislocating it: 'somewhere between Oklahoma and Texas,' he said,
which applies only to one minuscule corner north-west of Texarkana.
But while Clinton has carried on the good work, the man who is most keen for
the international limelight to fall on the state is Jim Guy Tucker.
True, Clinton is technically governor, and every now and then breaks from
the campaign trail to go back home to Little Rock and 'attend to state
business'. In reality, however, Arkansas is run by Tucker and and he looks
to be enjoying it.
A lawyer and two-time state attorney general, with a term in Congress under
his belt from 1976-78, he is three years older than Clinton, looks a little
like him, but is trimmer. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1990,
appointed acting governor last year, and if the Democrat wins the White
House, is in line to take over the state in his own right.
One option would be to serve out Clinton's unexpired term until 1994. But
he'd prefer, provided his checks confirm that state law allows it, to call a
special election within 60 days. 'If I can't win at this point, God let me
know now.'
He slyly points out that the US president's ignorance of the state's
whereabouts certainly isn't shared by the 109 international companies with
investment there.
Moreover, if the recent British corporate experience is anything to go by,
the last place jobs are going to be cut is Arkansas. Within the past week,
both BICC and BAe have been wielding the axe - but not, significantly, in
the land of the razorbacks where both have interests.
Could these decisions, not to mention Hanson's five separate operations in
the state, reflect some British political preference?

FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Subsidiarity not a recent concept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STANLEY CROSSICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Britain's chancellor, Norman Lamont, referring to subsidiarity on the
BBC's Today programme on September 21, said '. . . that very British idea
that no one was interested in at first'.
The clarity of his assertion suggests that the chancellor may believe in its
accuracy.
May I respectfully remind him that subsidiarity has been on the periphery of
discussions on European integration for nearly 20 years. The Tindemann
report of 1976 addressed the subject (which was raised by the Commission).
In 1984 the European parliament's draft treaty on European union explicitly
included the principle of subsidiarity in its preamble and several articles.
Article 130(r)(4) of the 1986 Single European Act expressly applied the
principle without the term subsidiarity as such.
Subsidiarity was raised as early as 1988 by Jacques Delors and has been
debated ever since. It was not the UK which introduced the provision into
the Maastricht treaty.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Misleading retail sales behind inaccurate Treasury
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL LIVESEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Wynne Godley rightly draws attention to the inaccuracy of the
Treasury forecasts (Letters, September 21). Could not a significant factor
be the misleading retail sales figures during the period in question? Some
retailers believe that the non-food retail sales figures have been as much
as 6 per cent greater than actual sales during the March 1990 to November
1991 period shown in the graph.
Since the summer of 1989, when retail sales started to show a decline,
retailers have regularly drawn ministers' attention to the inaccuracy of the
published retail sales. In addition, major multiples, including House of
Fraser, have been sending to the Treasury their own sales figures via Price
Waterhouse which have shown a significant difference from Central
Statistical Office figures. This information seems to have been ignored.
The British Retail Consortium is now providing more comprehensive statistics
to the CSO, whose own sample has been doubled in size. I trust that these
activities will go some way to improving future forecasts. Paul Livesey,

Several thousand more Danes said No than said Yes and the treaty has to be

FT  25 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Time to assess Mr Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN SOME 400 leading US businessmen, some of them big Republican
contributors in the past, declare their support for the president's November
opponent, Governor Bill Clinton, it is time to take the US opinion polls
seriously. The election was always Mr Bush's to lose, and the evidence
continues to suggest that he will duly lose it. If he does, America's
partners will lose a long-familiar friend, whose prime interest - fatally,
perhaps, for his re-election hopes - was foreign policy, and will have to
come to terms with a successor who is, internationally, a virtual unknown.
This is hardly a novelty. The US system usually finds its leaders from
domestic politics, rather than from the experienced cabinet hands who
normally succeed to the leaderships of European political parties.
Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Carter and Reagan were each
accused in their time of dangerous navety in foreign affairs; they did not
do notably worse than the experienced presidents, Nixon and Bush. The fact
that Mr Clinton will find it easier than Mr Bush has done to shed the
expensive trappings of the cold war may even prove an advantage, especially
in restraining the US budget deficit.
However, the main problem of the present day is recession rather than
ideology, so Mr Clinton's economic policies will be of far more interest to
his partners than his foreign policy. Some of his speeches during the
campaign have shown disturbing protectionist undertones, and his opponents
have painted him as a covert liberal, whose promises of fiscal restraint are
not to be believed. Only an extreme optimist would believe that the deficit
reduction sums set out in his campaign platform add up.
Fortunately, there is a good deal of evidence that Mr Clinton is concealing
conservative rather than liberal tendencies. His record in Arkansas is of a
tight and sometimes tough administrator, prepared to confront extravagance
and to do some of the things, such as imposing performance-related pay on
public servants, which are still only agenda items for Britain's
Conservative government. He has brought new enterprise, and some prosperity,
to a previously depressed southern state.
His campaign proposals for a tough reform of the welfare system and for a
cap on health spending are not those of a soft-hearted liberal. The rumour
that he would try to recruit Mr Paul Volcker as Treasury secretary is still
more suggestive. His demand for a line-item veto, giving him the power to
block purely vote-buying spending proposals, steals a long-standing item
from the Bush agenda. The difference is that Mr Clinton, working with a
Congress of his own party, and with many new members free of long-standing
political debts, might get it enacted.
This political change, coupled with Mr Clinton's freedom from personal
political debts, is the strongest reason for believing that a Clinton
administration would develop a new, activist style. He believes that
government action, mainly through large investment in education and the
infrastructure, can secure better growth. Those who believe that recession
is the biggest world threat might welcome a Clinton victory. Those who
believe, with the IMF, that US and German fiscal deficits are the biggest
bar to recovery, will still have some reservations.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Hounded down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Mellor was hounded from office by the British tabloid press. He was
right to refuse to resign for as long as he did, and he should not have been
forced to go in the end. The private life of a politician should not
determine his or her suitability as a minister; Mr Mellor's admitted
adultery was an unfortunate incident which in other countries might not have
been thought worthy of mention. A peculiarly British prurience led to it
being magnified out of all proportion.
It might be argued that it was not his affair with an actress that brought
his downfall. By accepting an expenses-paid holiday in Spain as the guest of
the daughter of a senior figure within the PLO Mr Mellor showed a lack of
judgment. True, although the prime minister has supported him in his denial
that the visit breached the ministerial code of conduct. The same lack of
judgment might be discerned in his business/holiday visit to Abu Dhabi,
which would have looked better had Mr Mellor bought his own ticket.
These are not incidents of which the former secretary for the national
heritage can be especially proud, but they would never have been carried on
so many front pages had it not been for the interest aroused by the original
adultery story. To say now that it was the foreign visits alone that brought
Mr Mellor down is humbug.
There is a certain irony in all this. The task of deciding whether to
introduce laws to protect the privacy of individuals will now fall to other
ministers. Few of the likely candidates are as clearly opposed to a privacy
bill as was Mr Mellor. Even if he favoured one, he would, given his
circumstances, have found it difficult to propose such a law. His departure,
and the manner of it, will not weaken the determination of those who want to
curb the press.
It is a curious fact about the British way of politics that a relatively
unimportant minister can be forced to resign from office for his personal
peccadilloes, while a chancellor may safely see his entire strategy collapse
in ruins and lose his credibility with the markets. We may question his
judgment on the management of the economy, but hound him out? Never.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Threadneedle street credibility: Currency turmoil has raised
the question of whether the Bank of England should be more independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the case for an independent central bank in Britain an idea whose time
has finally come? Or is it just one more overblown nostrum of the kind that
has contributed to the exceptionally erratic path of British monetary policy
over the past two decades? Whatever the answer, the arguments for an
independent central bank will run and run in the aftermath of the debacle
over the exchange rate mechanism.
The issue of central banking independence has already been aired in the
course of the debate on the Maastricht treaty, which contains a blueprint
for an independent European central bank. The emphasis on independence
undoubtedly stems from the success of the Bundesbank in achieving price
stability in Germany within a context of high economic growth. Given the
pivotal position of the Germans in the negotiations over monetary union it
was inevitable that the Bundesbank should become the model for any European
central bank. But the idea also derives wider support from the work of
thinkers such as Friedrich Hayek and from the adherents of public choice
theory.
Current academic theories on central banking hold that, since there is no
trade-off in the medium and long term between growth and employment, on the
one hand, and inflation on the other, the only sensible goal for a central
bank is the exclusive pursuit of price stability. But as there remains a
short-run trade-off, politicians who work within the constraints of an
electoral timetable will always be tempted to engineer pre-electoral booms
regardless of the longer-run inflationary consequences. That, in essence, is
the argument for protecting central bankers from political interference. It
particularly appeals to the growing band of people who favour explicit
constitutional limitations on government.
The idea has obvious relevance for countries such as Britain where inflation
has proved highly resistant to orthodox treatment. A huge body of academic
evidence suggests that more independence, however defined, is accompanied by
lower inflation. But work by Alberto Alesina and Lawrence Summers* does not
confirm that freedom from political interference delivers lower
unemployment, a more stable economy or higher growth - this, despite
frequent assertions that the anti-inflationary credibility which supposedly
derives from independence encourages more rapid adjustment in labour
markets.
Nor does the existence of a correlation between independence and low
inflation mean that independence is a sine qua non. France has recently
achieved a lower rate of inflation than Germany despite the Bank of France
being more subservient to government than most. What was the key to this
impressive disinflationary performance: the exercise of political will, or
the institutional arrangements that the French borrowed from the Bundesbank
via the ERM?
Japan's ability to control inflation over the past decade has compared more
than favourably with that of Germany or the US, where the Federal Reserve
enjoys a high degree of independence. Yet the Bank of Japan ranks low in the
independence stakes because it is so closely tied to the apron strings of
the Ministry of Finance (MoF). That said, it is the officials, not the
politicians, who count at the MoF. And in a system where the governorship
alternates between appointments by the Bank of Japan and the MoF, the bank
tends to become more independent when one of its own men holds office -
witness the single-mindedness with which Mr Yasushi Mieno has pursued
anti-inflationary policies in the face of opposition from the MoF.
The low view of politicians implicit in the arguments for independent
central banking assumes a degree of competence, as well as cynicism, on the
part of ministers that is not always in evidence. The Barber boom in Britain
in the early 1970s was followed by sterling crises and a succession of panic
increases in minimum lending rate that severely damaged the prospects of
Tory leader Mr Edward Heath at the polls in 1974. Nor is it easy to
reconcile the economic policies of the Conservative government before the
1992 election with anything that remotely resembles ruthless political
expediency.
Clearly the issue is more complicated than it appears at first sight.
Statutory independence must strengthen the central banker's arm in resisting
political pressure. But there are degrees of independence, as well as
conflicting goals: even the German central bank, under the Bundesbank Law of
1957, is obliged to 'support the general economic policy of the federal
government', and was seen to do so at the time of German unification - much
to the chagrin of the Bundesbank Council. And when it comes to any
consideration of independence for the Bank of England, it is important to
acknowledge that the best known examples of independent central banks such
as those of Germany, the US and Switzerland, are products of a federal
system. They are thus representative organisations, enjoying a legitimacy
they could not enjoy in a unitary state.
In a country such as Germany, where the folk memory of the devastating
inflations of 1923 and 1948 is strong, such a structure has obvious appeal.
The British inflationary experience has been exceptionally mild by
comparison. This is reflected in official statements. The governor of the
Bank of England, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, remarked in the early stages of
moves towards economic and monetary union (Emu): 'I have to say that I
believe the term 'independent' is misleading and obscures the key issues. No
one could sensibly suggest that in liberal democracies any central monetary
institution should be unaccountable.'
Yet the Maastricht treaty's subsequent blueprint for a European Central
Banking System comes even closer than the Bundesbank to a version of central
banking independence where the politicians are, so to speak, required to
throw away the key. That highlights one of the problems the government would
face in the course of any ratification process for Maastricht. It also
suggests that a British move towards independence for the Bank of England,
if it takes place outside the context of Emu, would have to incorporate an
extended discussion of accountability and democracy.
The best available model for an independent central bank in a unitary state
is that of New Zealand. There the government has signed a contract with the
governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Donald Brash, whereby the bank commits
itself to a 0-2 per cent inflation target as measured by a specially
adjusted version of the retail price index, which makes allowance for
external pressures such as adverse shifts in the terms of trade. In other
words, the goal is specific, performance can be measured and the existence
of a contract provides for a transparent political override: the politicians
can reset objectives in response to circumstances. Yet the government cannot
override a contract without giving notice and an override has to be renewed
after six months. The procedure is thus transparent.
There is also some link between achievement and reward, if not to the extent
originally intended. According to Professor Charles Goodhart of the London
School of Economics, who helped advise on the adoption of the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand Act, it was originally proposed that the salaries of the
governor and his top officials should be related to the inflation outturn.
This idea was shelved because it was thought politically inflammatory to
increase the governor's salary for taking deflationary measures that might
throw people out of work. But a sanction remains: if the governor fails to
deliver, reappointment is unlikely.
It is conceivable that something more akin to the New Zealand version of
independence could be acceptable in Britain. But the existence of an
override might be thought to dilute the anti-inflationary commitment. And as
David Marsh has pointed out in his new book on the Bundesbank, referred to
here on Wednesday, the German central bank only acquired credibility over a
long period in which forceful bankers engaged in constant trench warfare
with the likes of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Schmidt as well as Helmut Kohl.
With the benchmark German bond standing at nearly 7 1/2 per - 4 percentage
points more than German inflation and marginally higher than comparable US
Treasury securities - the Bundesbank is clearly having to fight the
credibility battle again and again. Would British politicians and central
bankers be capable of such dogged persistence in pursuit of low inflation?
It is tempting to argue that any government that so cheerfully abandoned
control over its monetary policy to the Germans could hardly object to
giving away control of the Bank of England to British central bankers. What
has the Treasury got against the Bank of England that does not apply with
greater force to the Bundesbank? But then the government only passed the
buck to the foreign central bankers with an opt-out clause on Emu and, as we
saw last week, the ERM always contained an opt-out clause anyway. Would such
a government offer the Bank of England a version of independence worthy of
the name?
As for the people who run the Bank of England, their undoubted resolve could
no doubt be reinforced by different institutional arrangements. But whether
they would ever be a match for the inheritors of the great Prussian civil
service ethos who run the Bundesbank is an open question. In a clubby
British culture that no longer attaches overwhelming priority to the
protection of the currency, the risk might be similar to that in Ireland,
where central bankers are sometimes alleged to be too close to the
politicians, notwithstanding their central bank's high degree of formal
independence.
To return to the academic statistics, there could be another explanation for
the low correlation between independence and low inflation. To wit, those
electorates that give their central banks independence may be precisely the
ones that value price stability most. In which case, thinks Prof Goodhart,
the act of granting independence to a central bank to pursue policies that
the public does not want could lead to severe political problems.
It is striking how often the case for an independent UK central bank is put
most vocally by politicians who have left office (Lord Tebbit, Lord Lawson)
or are unlikely to hold it in the foreseeable future (Mr Paddy Ashdown, Mr
Alan Beith). That correlation is perhaps even more impressive than those
provided by the academics. Over to you, Messrs Major and Lamont.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Public sector pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS TREASURY ministers struggle to contain UK public expenditure, hard
decisions loom. Government funding for the building programmes of housing
associations is threatened. The inner cities may lose money for urban
regeneration to ease the introduction of the council tax. Important
transport projects such as London's Crossrail will be postponed. Cutting
these programmes - all of which generate employment  - will do nothing to
help end the recession.
Yet the cuts might be less painful if the government seized control over
public sector pay. Running at more than Pounds 70bn this year, the public
sector pay bill accounts for almost a third of general government
expenditure. It has been rising at around 10 per cent annually in the last
two years - almost double the rate of inflation at a time when there has
been no economic growth. As today's New Earnings Survey shows, average pay
in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector for the first
time since 1986.
Public sector pay increases tend to lag behind awards in the private sector
in times of boom and overtake them in recession. But the New Earnings Survey
figures suggest that it is time for the catching-up to stop. If the
government is serious about reining in public expenditure, its pay bill must
be at the top of the list. Mr Howard Davies, the new director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, has called for the public sector pay bill
to be frozen. That seems eminently sensible.
Sadly, a bad start has already been made to the pay round with this month's
settlement for the police. With the system of police remuneration under
review, the government might reasonably have shelved this year's
inflationary 6.5 per cent increase due under the Edmund Davies formula.
Unfortunately it did not. The same mistake should not be made with firemen's
pay, likely to rise by more than 6 per cent next year unless their pay
formula is set aside.
Freezing the pay bill would be simple for the civil service and armed
forces, where the government is the employer. However, a firm line is also
needed on the pay of almost 1m people working in the health service and 2.3m
in local government. The government should make it clear that funding for
these services for the coming year will be on the basis of nil increase in
the overall pay bill. If local authorities concede increases in the pay bill
and pass the cost on to local taxpayers, the government must ensure that the
blame is firmly pinned on their profligacy.
A freeze on the total pay bill does not rule out pay rises for some. Where
efficiency gains are made - for example through contracting-out of services
 -the savings will be available to increase pay within the organisation.
However, the emphasis should be on improving incentives for experience and
good performance rather than across-the-board increases. Performance-related
pay still plays an insignificant role in most of the public sector and has
not yet penetrated some such as teaching. Fast progress should now be made
on extending its coverage throughout the public services.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Set fair for progress: Middle East peace talks have
adjourned on an optimistic note but with no breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one person who encapsulates the state of the Middle East peace
negotiations, which adjourned yesterday after a month of talks in
Washington, it is Ms Bushra Kanafani, Syria's spokeswoman.
Ms Kanafani is canny, cautious and clipped as befits the secretive, ruthless
regime she represents. But the severity of old sometimes gives way to a
lighter tone, even to good-natured bantering with Israeli journalists. 'You
know we have a saying that before it rains it must become cloudy,' she said
this week. 'But it is not cloudy yet, so I cannot expect rain tomorrow.'
So it was that the first round of peace talks held since Mr Yitzhak Rabin
came to power in Israel in July, pledging to accelerate the peace process,
ended yesterday without any significant breakthrough.
But just as Mrs Kanafani's manner contains tantalising hints of a change of
attitude, so there are grounds for believing that the talks may yet produce
positive results. All sides have agreed to return to the table in late
October. As Mrs Kanafani said: 'Don't take it that we are pessimistic. Don't
take it that the discussions so far have not been very useful.'
This, in itself, is something of an achievement. Almost a year and six
rounds of negotiations have now passed since the talks were launched at last
October's Madrid peace conference. In that time negotiations have become the
established way of doing business for the Arabs and Israel in a way that was
previously unthinkable. Five strands of multilateral negotiations are
proceeding on arms control, economic co-operation, water resources,
environmental issues and refugees, involving dozens of Middle Eastern and
other nations.
'The peace talks might fail,' says Mr Robert Satloff, deputy director of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Jewish-funded think tank. 'But
things can never go back to the way they were before. Arabs and Israelis
meet regularly to discuss problems now.'
While the four tracks of bilateral negotiations between Israel and,
respectively, the Palestinians, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, have failed to
resolve their wide differences, they have been characterised by cordial and
determined efforts to keep the process going.
Israel and the Palestinians have still not fully agreed the terms for
negotiating an initial five-year period of Palestinian self-government in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Such an agreement would precede talks
on a permanent territorial settlement. The Palestinians remain afraid that
this two-stage approach will prejudice their goal of an independent state.
There are positive signs, however. Mr Rabin - in contrast with his
predecessor Mr Yitzhak Shamir - has turned a blind eye to close
consultations between the Palestinian delegation from the occupied
territories and the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Equally significant, in the past week the two delegations formed small,
informal working groups to try to find ways forward which were not
tape-recorded as all the main negotiating sessions have been.
In the Syrian-Israeli talks the issue revolves around the Golan Heights,
occupied by Israel since 1967. Mr Rabin, despite opposition at home, has
signalled a willingness to give back at least some of the heights if Syria
commits itself to a full-fledged peace treaty. Syria puts the issue the
other way around: It will not commit itself to full peace until it is
assured of getting back all the Golan.
The intention to issue this week an initial joint document of principles
that would be the basis for negotiations fell down on the Golan question.
Talks between Israel and Jordan and Israel and Lebanon are less difficult
than those with the Palestinians and Syria. But here lies another
complication: how to co-ordinate all four sets of negotiations so that they
move roughly in step.
Privately, all sides agree that in the end, they are unlikely to be able to
make real progress without the active intervention of the US, which has
stayed mainly on the sidelines.
'At a certain point only the Americans can come up with a solution on the
Golan that will be less than the Syrians demand right now and more than any
Israeli government could afford to propose by itself,' said a senior Israeli
delegate.
Until recently there was an assumption that the talks would not resume until
after the US presidential election in November. Now all sides have agreed to
come back before then.
No great shift in US Middle East policy is anticipated should Mr Bill
Clinton defeat President Bush. But it will be hard to make significant
advances in the peace process until a new administration is established and
able to give the talks its full attention.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: Subversive stitching - Craft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two contemporary craft exhibitions in London set out to explode widely held
misconceptions. The cosy world of the embroidered tray cloth is rocked by
any number of examples of subversive stitching in the Craft Council's
avant-garde embroidery show, Out of the Frame.
Alice Kettle's 'Indian Summer - Man', for instance, soars more than three
metres high and features a life-size nude, richly textured with densely
machine-stitched metal, silk cotton and rayon threads. His puffy face,
partially padded, gradually emerges out of the gloom of the picture plane.
Stumpwork was never quite like this.
Rozanne Hawksley, now in her 60s, offers a mock reliquary arm in 'Libera me,
Domine, de morte aerterna' - a sombre confection of black taffeta, jet,
pearls and a gloved hand clasping a rosary and hand-mirror. The arm is
shrouded in black silk and enshrined in a glass-topped black box. In
contrast, Maddi Nicholson dazzles with fluorescent pinks and yellows.
Materials frequently are unexpected. Janet Ledsham's 'Canopy' incorporates
maple and aspen leaves, Michael Brennand-Wood has a nice line in Ladybird
books, pencils and paperback spines.
The show, which is of British work only, is witness to the various
revolutions which transformed the textile arts in the 1960s. Since then, it
has appeared that there is nothing that fabric, and the stitching techniques
traditionally associated with it, cannot be persuaded to do.
Surfaces are moulded, animated, distressed and encrusted using a wide
variety and media and techniques appropriated from the art school. It comes
as no surprise to discover that a number of makers here began their training
as painters, sculptors or ceramicists. We find textile vessels, and a
menagerie of fantastical animals that have precious little in common with
soft toys. Kate O'Toole's heart-shaped 'Valentine' cushion is nothing other
than a frilly 'construction', complete with absurd naked Action Man and a
mass of rubber creepy crawlies. Pure Jeff Koons kitsch on a domestic scale.
The relationship between fine art and embroidery often proves too close for
comfort. Painting by needle is rife. No doubt the organisers should be
commended for having no modernist axe to grind and showing an honest,
representative survey of contemporary embroidery. As a consequence, we find
Monet-style poppies, Nolde daisies, even shades of Glynn Boyd Harte.
Moreover, Eiran Short's technically brilliant evocation of a Helen Allingham
cottage garden succeeds in confirming all the old prejudices about
handicraft. The icing on this particular tea cake is a frame created out of
brown-beige 1970s curtain material, aluminium and silver braid, and lavished
with rows of pale pink sequins.
Far more impressive is Polly Binns' minimalist triptych of geometrically
ordered cuts into white cotton - despite a certain debt to Lucio Fontana.
Only rarely do painterly treatments succeed. Audrey Walker's long, random
stitches are used to great atmospheric effect in 'These Golden Days', its
texture akin to that of pastel.
Textures and subtle surface patterns are the delights of this show. Hannah
Frew Patterson shows great sensitivity in exploiting the intrinsic qualities
and beauty of specific materials. Her abstract 'Strome Slab' manipulates
hand-made silk felt and hand-dyed silk fabrics, some treated with gelatine,
others gathered, shredded and layered. Hazel Bruce chooses to burn, layer
and cut Habotai silks and cottons, and then to paint, print and stitch.
Setting this contemporary work in context is a selection of often
spectacular historic textiles on loan from the Embroiderers' Guild, plus a
group of Glasgow School and later 20th century pieces (all confusingly
jumbled together as only the Crafts Council Gallery knows how). They offer
valuable lessons in pattern-making that a number of contemporary makers
would do well to study. They also serve to remind us how traditional
techniques such as quilting, embroidery, white work and patchwork - and
utilitarian domestic artefacts - continue to be creatively, and often
joyously, reinterpreted.
Bound to Please] at the Royal Festival Hall (until October 4) offers a
glimpse at the ever-expanding boundaries of book board and slip case. There
is not a piece of red morocco in sight. Among those represented is Cathy
Robert, something of the Damien Hirst of bookbinding after her
aquarium-cum-cover for The Practical Encyclopaedia of Freshwater Tropical
Aquarium Fish. Here, the letters forming the august name of Appolinaire
cascade down the front of her binding of selected poems - and down the
patinated bronze of its sculptural stand. Are such bulky excrescences really
desired by bibliophiles?
Far more covetable are the books that appear not only user-friendly but
alluringly tactile. Romily Saumarez Smith employs soft pink goatskin,
overlaid with white calf for Plato's Symposium. Jen Lindsay chooses limp,
mottled vellum for Gerard Manley Hopkins. For a cover of a book of 7th
century Arabic poetry, John Pearson suggests great age and fortunate
survival by dyeing linen in tea, and throwing in a handful of small nails
during the drying process to produce smoky marks. The linen is dyed, dried,
waxed, flattened and folded, and finally fastened by calfskin ties.
It is tempting to suppose that even that curmudgeonly Old Devil Philip
Larkin may have approved of Jenni Grey's ingenious perspex, wood and brass
container for 'Required Writing'. From certain angles it appears to be
empty.
Out of the Frame continues at the Crafts Council Gallery, 44a Pentonville
Road, Islington N1, until November 1, and tours to Wakefield, Coventry and
Aberystwyth in 1993.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: Joey Calderazzo/Barbara Thompson - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A funny thing about jazz, especially when it is performed in bars, is that
the group may have met only hours before they take to the stand. Having
rehearsed together for an hour or so in the afternoon they go out with some
standards and follow the leader using eye and ear contact more than charts
to find the way. Some leaders helpfully telegraph their direction while
others simply do what they always do and leave their sidemen to come along
if they want to.
Pianist Joey Calderazzo takes a third option and apparently enjoys the
company of strangers. A contender, along with the likes of Julian Joseph or
Marcus Roberts, for the hearts of youthful modern jazz fans, Calderazzo is a
likeable and unpretentious young man. Heard at the Jazz Cafe earlier this
week without his regular band but with Britishers Winston Clifford (drums)
and Gary Crosby (bass), the American showed why Blue Note, and his
occasional sidemen, like him.
A nimble player, with an unforced tone, he has a teeming right hand and a
way with minor chords on the left. Well modulated in delivery, his technique
is to work up to a swinging number from an almost standing start - egged on
here by Clifford's tough Art Blakey-like drumming. The exchange of energy in
a trio is usually exciting because the three way dynamics demand it. At the
Jazz Cafe Calderazzo seemed keen to make the three sides equal and as a
result rationed his solo work to great effect. Thus, original ballads which
started innocuously soon developed into full steam ahead workouts as
Calderazzo bounced across the keyboard.
A new trio recording with drummer Peter Erskine and bassist John Pattitucci,
his third date for Blue Note, is due in February and promises to be an
interesting proposition.
Having a less happy time in clubland (The Vortex) without her regular band
was saxophonist Barbara Thompson. Boldly tackling originals such as 'Secret
Soul' and 'Jaunty' from the recent album Breathless, as well as standards
like 'The Man I Love', Thompson's playing was sweet and unfussy. Some
uncertainty happening around her and an extremely noisy house conspired to
detract from the clean and vocal phrasing which fought for a fair hearing,
however. Better to catch her at Ronnie Scott's other club in Birmingham up
to and including the September 26 where she will be surrounded by her usual
Paraphernalia.

In the run-up to next week's Labour party conference, C4 offers a Dispatches
Special (8.30) in which Vincent Hanna tries to find out why the party did so
much worse than expected in the general election. Ten days before the ballot
they were said to have a seven-point lead in the opinion polls, but the
election count proved they were eight points down. No doubt some voters
really did switch, but there is a growing belief that people have taken to
lying to pollsters.
BBC1 offers another engrossing episode of Between The Lines in which the
Investigation Bureau of London's Metropolitan Police finds itself up to the
armpits in freemasons' skullduggery and the investigator, Det Supt Tony
Clark, finds himself in trouble with his mistress as well as his wife
(9.30).
The newly imported hospital comedy on C4, Nurses (10.00) carries further an
irritating habit already noticeable in other American sitcoms: the Buggins'
Turn routine in which the main characters collect laughs on a strict rota
basis. That is promptly followed by Terry And Julian with Julian Clary
imposing his camp taste on his oh-so-straight flatmate (10.30).

The BBC has added once again to a unique record of success at the Prix
Italia, oldest and most respected of all the world's broadcasting festivals,
by winning this year's prize for television documentaries with War, Lives
and Videotape. The programme, made by Nick Danziger, was one of the 'Video

given rudimentary training, and encouraged to produce personal documents.
Danziger's tells of his efforts to provide a home in Kabul for orphans
growing up in the mental hospital.
The prize of L15m (about Pounds 7,500) was won against competition from 32
other entries submitted by 22 countries. The special, or second prize, was
won by a Belgian programme called Les Amants D'Assises which tells the
extraordinarily dramatic story of a court case concerning a crime of
passion.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: Toovey's 'Ubu Roi' - Music Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cartoon cuts of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi, much celebrated 19th-century
precursor of the Theatre of the Absurd, seem to offer a constant temptation
to opera composers. Only last year Penderecki's Ubu Rex appeared at the
Munich Festival, and now Andrew Toovey's version has been staged in Cardiff
by Music Theatre Wales, which commissioned it. The touring production by
Keith Turnbull is shared with the Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada.
Toovey, born in 1962, has already amassed a substantial catalogue of works;
an article by Michael Finnisy in the most recent issue of the magazine Tempo
offered a useful introduction to his music. Ubu is his second theatre piece,
but much more substantial and ambitious than its predecessor, based upon
Artaud. Everything the composer has written about it suggests a summation of
his development so far, and hints at the possibility of a fix on his musical
style and future prospects. But in both these respects and in fact from
every other perspective too, the evening is a huge disappointment, musically
thin, dramatically unfocussed and doggedly unfunny. The libretto was
prepared by Toovey and Michael Finnissy, making a translation of Jarry's
original that is at pains to preserve and to enhance where necessary its
scabrous and scatological elements.
The intention seems to have been to write an Offenbach comic opera for the
1990s; perhaps the tale of the terrible Ubus is meant to have an awful
resonance for our own times. The grotesque Pa Ubu, the Essex Man of his day,
is goaded by his equally noxious wife into killing the King and seizing
power for himself; he then runs riot in his kingdom, reducing it to ruins by
destroying its entire social fabric.
Toovey's version is far too leaden, and the humour impossibly coarse-grained
to carry any kind of satirical force. An opera that considers that a line
like 'Then I'll get the fuck out of here' becomes side-splittingly funny
just because it is sung to an ornate vocal line is in dire straits. The
score is most convincing when deliberately intended as pastiche - there are
some winning Ibert-like numbers, cornily melodic. The accidental pastiches,
of the violence of Birtwistle's Punch and Judy or of Maxwell Davies's
hyper-expressionism, ring less true, perhaps because they are never placed
within a convincing frame.
Ubu does not lack the courage of its convictions, but its full frontal
assault on the audience's finer sensibilities is never accurately targeted.
Toovey is a much more discriminating composer than he allows himself to be
here, and a few beautifully imagined passages towards the end of the opera
give that game away.
The production is reasonably effective, the performance conducted by Michael
Rafferty enthusiastic. Both Richard Morris's Pa and Gale Oxley's tenor Ma
are larger-than-life horrors; there is a neat Prince Buggerlips from
Anne-Margaret Cameron, while Twylla Augustson, representiong both the
Nobility and the Army, deals with some stratospheric coloratura with great
aplomb.
St David's Hall, Cardiff; further performance tonight, and then touring to
Milford Haven (October 1), Aberystwyth (October 3), London (Queen Elizabeth
Hall, October 5), Swansea (October 7), Builth Wells (October 10)

This is late-ish Ibsen, which means that it is horribly difficult to play
now for full value. Annie Castledine's production is fluent, unfussy,
dramatically well-pointed; Joan Tindale has translated the text into easy
modern English - though that leaves the principals' unbrookable effusions
about Freedom and the Joy of Life sounding eccentrically quaint. For
Ibsenites and for theatre-lovers who want to improve their education, this
Rosmersholm is seriously collectable, but some way off spot-on.
A quick re-cap: Rosmer is a scholarly Pastor (now ex-), the descendant of a
distinguished family in his Norwegian town. Widowed when his unstable wife
flung herself into the mill-race, he has been not merely consoled by her
young nurse-companion Rebekka (as the Young Vic programme insists upon
spelling her), but transformed from moralising conservative to radical
freethinker. He lends his name to a muckraking liberal journal, and his old
Establishment friends - represented by Headmaster Kroll - are scandalised.
Kroll unearths some worrying facts about Rebekka; she and Rosmer examine
their relationship and their ideals in a bleak new light; tragic denouement.
As so often with late and late-ish Ibsen, we can recognise that matters of
elevated moral import are at stake - and on a good night, be moved by them;
but the theatrical scaffolding designed to raise them high seems
period-bound and dusty. To our sceptical ears, everybody sounds naively
windy, or plain hypocritical. When we are meant to shudder or feel lofty
thrills, we snigger. Sufficiently charismatic playing by the six-strong cast
can override the hazards; here, however, six very intelligent performers are
all more or less miscast.
Corin Redgrave's Rosmer, persuasive in his own terms, is a crumpled
teddy-bear, ready with wry, self-deprecating little smiles whilst the text
insists upon his sober gravitas. No trace of the former right-thinking
orator is detectable, nor therefore any reason why the town's reactionary
Right should be so keen to keep him. As Rebekka - a fervently idealistic
girl, brought up in the stark North by a liberal stepfather (or perhaps
incestuous father) with 'advanced' books - Francesca Annis is irremediably
chic, moving sensuously and self-appreciatively, and wielding an urbane,
knowing chuckle.
Instead of a passionate backwoods Utopian, we see a lady whom Kroll's nasty
diagnosis (ambitious, calculating seductress) fits all too well. When she
succumbs to it near the end, it seems a matter of facing the unedifying
facts, when we ought to feel an engineered subversion of blazing ideals.
Similarly, Allan Corduner's Kroll - a pompous, edgy bantam-cock, towered
over by Redgrave's gentle Pastor - is so brittly fixed from the start as to
devalue his pragmatic wisdom later to cheap point-scoring. Old Ibsen gives
his conservative monsters a fairer leash than that.
Bernard Lloyd makes Rosmer's unregenerate old tutor little more than a
ruined poseur and dandy. Miriam Karlin is curiously enlisted as the
Rosmersholm housekeeper: we expect more of her than the role could ever
afford, and she treated her final lines (stagey reportage on the double
suicide) with numb disdain. The piquant casting of a black actor, Leo
Wringer - complete with Afro-Caribbean accent - as the crusading small-town
journalist, gives an extra fillip of unreality to the scene.
At the Young Vic, SE1, until October 31

FT  25 SEP 92 / People: Capital Radio picks Thames's Mansfield
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Radio, which runs Britain's two biggest independent radio stations,
wants to put a stop to being regarded as the poor relation when it comes to
national advertising. It has hired its new commercial director, 38-year-old
David Mansfield (left), from the television marketing world.
Mansfield, currently deputy director of sales and marketing at Thames TV,
joins Capital on January 1 and will be respon-sible for boosting the
revenues of a group whose two London radio stations have an estimated 6m
people a month.
Having started his career selling Terry's chocolates, Mansfield will be one
of three executive directors reporting to Richard Eyre who took over as
chief executive at the start of the year following Nigel Walmsley's move to
run Carlton Communications TV business.
The radio industry's share of total advertising revenue of about 2.5 per
cent is 'far below its potential', says Eyre. He blames the poor showing on
the fact that commercial TV came to Britain long before commercial radio and
as a result has hogged an unusually large share of the national advertising
budget.
Eyre, who comes from the advertising world, believes that television's share
of national, as opposed to local, advertising - currently around a third of
the total - has peaked and the share of commercial radio is poised to grow.
'Mansfield shares my vision,' says Eyre, who argues that with increasing
competition at local level, radio stations like Capital must increase their
share of the national advertising market.
Mansfield's arrival will overlap with next year's retirement of Philip
Pinnegar, the deputy managing director who has been with Capital since its
launch in 1973. However, the company says that the management of the sales
department under sales director David Lees would not be affected by the new
appointment.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Management: German workers go back to school to get ahead -
Leslie Colitt reports that highly-trained employees are the key to the
country's success / Training on Trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
German manufacturers never cease to complain that their labour costs are the
world's highest, especially when non-wage benefits are included.
But press them a bit harder and they will admit that their highly-trained
German workers are a key to the country's manufacturing success.
The cost of employing skilled workers is causing German industry to shift
lower-value production abroad.
Klaus Krone, chairman of Krone in Berlin, a medium-size producer of
telecommunications components, says German manufacturers are switching to
higher technology products.
This has been the experience of his own company, even though labour
represents less than 5 per cent of total costs.
Germany is famous for its training system. This provides for three-year
apprenticeships during which most trainees from the age of 16 work on three
days a week and attend vocational school for the other two.
Management at Krone, which has 4,100 employees in 17 countries, says this
training gives the company's German labour force a significant advantage in
both theoretical and practical knowledge over its workers in Britain and
Australia which favour on-the-job training.
Thomas Mickeleit, a spokesman for Krone, says: 'A worker in the UK has a
more narrow training than here and lacks the theoretical background which
would make him more flexible.' Krone workers in Berlin said they found it
difficult to imagine how foreign workers could cope without having been
apprenticed or having attended a vocational school.
Jurgen Rinner, a 38-year-old, did his three-and-a-half-year apprenticeship
at Krone when the company was desperate for skilled workers in isolated west
Berlin. At that time he earned only DM145 (Pounds 57) a month compared with
the DM800 which a 16 year-old apprentice starts off with today. He attended
vocational school once a week, doing practical work and studying technical
drawing, maths and materials science.
Today, young German apprentices go to vocational school twice a week - to
the dismay of many small companies which rely heavily on them - and the
range of subjects is far greater and more specialised. One language is
required, usually English, and a social science.
'You can't know enough today,' says Rinner. In fact, a growing number of the
100 young people who are apprenticed at Krone each year have Abitur
school-leaving certificates, qualifying them for university studies but
instead choose to learn a trade through fear of unemployment.
Rinner is one of a handful of maintenance and control workers in an
automated hall producing quick connection components for copper and optical
fibre networks. He doubts that on-the-job-training could give a worker the
skills he gained during his apprenticeship and vocational school.
'The foundation would be missing' he says.
A colleague, Karsten Vogel, is one of Krone's nearly 200 east German
employees, hired since the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. They proved to be
as well-qualified as their west German counterparts, according to the
company.
Vogel, a 28-year-old electronics worker did his apprenticeship at an east
Berlin television plant equipped with modern Japanese equipment.
At the same time, he studied to gain the coveted Abitur. 'You learned more
than you need but you never know where you will end up,' he says.
Vogel attended a number of training courses offered by Krone and was soon
able to cope with its different control system for the automated equipment.
At first, western workmates kept their distance but finally accepted him
when he proved his competence.
Vogel would like to become a technician but says the two years of evening
classes he would need to attend are not possible while he continues to work
in a three-shifts-a-day pattern.
A vital link between the management and workers on the German shopfloor is
the meister, the foreman. Jurgen Schumacher, aged 54, and a meister at Krone
for seven of his 11 years with the company, says: 'The only problems we have
are with older employees as their capacity to absorb new information is
limited.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Management: Standing firm under fire - The Cadbury Committee
is under pressure over its plans to reform corporate governance. Christopher
Lorenz assesses the arguments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recalcitrant top executives in Britain should not count their chickens.
Contrary to what they may have heard a week ago, before its latest meeting,
the Cadbury Committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance is
now unlikely to backslide on the substance of two of its most important
proposals.
But nor should advocates of better governance relax. They still need to
reinforce the committee's resolve - and to warn boardroom dinosaurs that the
alternative to Cadbury's mild proposals will be the imposition of tough
regulation.
That, in a nutshell, is the delicately-balanced situation facing opponents
and supporters of the committee's proposals as, over the next two months,
its members try to decide which proposals should be amended  - rather than
merely reworded - in the light of the many responses to the draft code which
was issued in May. Some bodies have complained that various proposals are
excessive, others - notably institutional shareholders - that they are far
too puny.
At this stage, only one thing seems sure from talking privately to members
of the committee, including radicals: that, despite all the flak it has
suffered from both sides, it still wants to try to foster a consensus in
support of its proposals - or, at least, in compliance with them. The
committee is therefore unlikely to toughen up many of its proposals before
the finalised code is published in December. This is in spite of the fact
that most are extremely mild compared with the governance regulations which
either already exist in the US, or are being proposed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Instead, moves are afoot to spark the creation of some sort of continuous
Cadbury review mechanism over the next two years, which could lead to
changes during that period in response to corporate behaviour. Originally,
the committee proposed merely a review period after that time.
Two of the Cadbury proposals have created a particular stir. The first,
supported strongly by the Stock Exchange, is the one which gives the draft
most bite (the only one, some critics would argue): that a new listing
requirement should oblige companies to declare the extent to which they
comply with the code. Where they do not comply, they would have to explain
why. Since this compliance statement would be in each company's annual
report, it would give shareholders the right to raise the whole subject in
detail at annual general meetings.
That is precisely why some top managers oppose the idea. It is why certain
members of the Confederation of British Industry persuaded their
organisation to object to the proposal on the grounds of 'bureaucracy',
despite the fact that the CBI's representative on the committee had already
supported it.
With typical tact, the committee's chairman, Sir Adrian Cadbury, has instead
attributed the CBI's opposition to a misplaced fear that the code's clauses
would themselves be enforceable. To most people, the difference may seem a
fine one.
But it is actually rather more than that, since it enables the committee to
state honestly, in the best (or worst) tradition of British self-regulation,
that compliance with the code's contents is voluntary.
To remove any risk of further misunderstanding about the compliance
requirement, the wording surrounding it is likely to be changed in the final
Cadbury code - but not the requirement itself.
The second most controversial proposal is that non-executive directors
should 'monitor' the activities of directors. The noisiest objector here has
been the Institute of Directors, which has complained that this would split
the board into two interest groups. It has also been argued that this would,
in effect, create a two-tier board - a notion which is always held to be
anathema to most British top managers, on the grounds that it would open the
door to the European Commission's hated employee-directors.
The Cadbury Committee is perfectly aware that, in reality, a growing number
of large company boards in the UK has a majority of non-executive directors,
who also form either the majority or the entirety of the board's
remuneration and audit committees. So they are already, in a sense, on the
way to being two-tier. In its response to Cadbury, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland wisely advocated much greater debate about
the virtues of two-tierdom.
Yet, in the interests of consensus, the committee is likely to skirt this
issue. It will tone down the wording of its 'monitoring' proposal, and make
a declaration of continued faith in the ability of board members to play a
proper supervisory role within a unitary structure.
For the same reason of consensus-building, and also because its remit was
supposedly too narrowly financial, the committee is unlikely to take much
account of the widespread complaint that it is being far too soft on two of
the hottest issues of all: the bases on which top pay packages are both
decided and disclosed (or not, as is most often the case). Unlike in the US,
where the SEC proposed rigorous and detailed new disclosure rules three
months ago, the issue will be left to fester for many another day.
And fester it certainly will. In many companies, directors are losing their
bonuses, and the average rise in their pay packages has at last moderated -
though often not as sharply as for other managers.
A few companies are still producing headline-grabbing rises in top pay
packages which, as at recession-bucking WH Smith this week, are harder to
judge - and condemn - than they at first appear.
But in far too many other companies, the value of top packages is still
climbing out of all proportion to the company's performance - or not falling
sharply enough with it. The British Institute of Management has rightly
complained about this sort of thing: leaving aside the resentment it causes
among less favoured managers and other employees, the most obvious
short-term outcome will be increasing annoyance among shareholders.
As with some of the other issues which the Cadbury Committee has chosen to
duck for tactical reasons, the probable medium-term result will be a growing
political impetus in favour of US-style regulation. The only way out will be
for the committee or its successor body, plus the many financial
institutions which say they support Cadbury, to use the next two years to
shame boards into doing what is in their companies' best interest: behaving
more sensibly.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Technology: Hammer and icicle - Andrew Baxter explains how
Finland's rock bashers are sharpening up their skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard rock is a favourite subject among the employees of Scandinavia's
construction and mining equipment companies, but they are unlikely to be
discussing the latest heavy-metal band to hit the nightspots of the Nordic
region.
For Europe's most northerly engineering companies hard rock is the ground
under their feet. Producing equipment to drill, hammer or crush it is a
challenge which, once overcome, can provide a passport to success in world
markets.
Nowhere is that more important than in Finland, where the frozen terrain has
bred a number of equipment producers which have benefited in export markets
from the expertise necessary for their equipment to survive the battering it
takes at home.
For Finnish companies such as Rammer, which makes hydraulic hammers, Lokomo,
which produces crushing equipment, and the rock-drill and underground loader
producer Tamrock, exporting is now more important than ever.
The local market - down by 70 per cent or more over the past two years,
depending on the sector - makes the UK equipment sector look like a beacon
of prosperity. But even in good times Finland has been too small a market to
support engineering companies' product development spending, and forced
companies to look overseas.
Not everywhere outside Scandinavia has such hard rock, however, and the
Finnish suppliers have had to spend heavily to manufacture a range of
products suitable for all environments or to convince prospective purchasers
of new uses for their hard rock equipment.
The Finnish engineering sector has been through considerable upheaval over
the past decade, but manufacturing is emerging as a key weapon in equipment
producers' attempts to build on their hard rock foundations and remain
competitive internationally despite being tucked away in a corner of Europe.
In Lahti, the provincial Finnish town best known as a ski-jumping centre,
production of small hydraulic hammers has undergone a quiet revolution since
1990 when Rammer's new automated factory was opened. The factory is one of
around 40 flexible manufacturing systems in Finland, with three
manufacturing and assembly cells grouped around an automated warehouse
system into which raw materials are fed. The critical hammer parts are
produced by computer-controlled machining centres and robots and matched
with subcontracted parts, with final assembly mainly by hand.
According to Olli Vartiainen, a production expert at the Rammer
manufacturing company Bretec, production times have been reduced from four
weeks to one week, and Rammer's new 20-series hammers have been 'designed
for manufacture' from the start. But other important advantages of the new
system have been increased flexibility and technical quality. The factory
was planned to handle six hammer variations, but is now producing more than
40, he says.
The new system is timely for two reasons. Following a reorganisation this
year, Bretec (short for breaking technology) has become a manufacturing unit
within Rammer Detec, a holding company ultimately owned by Outokumpu, the
big Finnish mining and engineering group.
The Rammer sales company has become a Bretec customer, a system which keeps
everybody on their toes. But the new factory has also allowed the group to
exploit what Pekka Heikkonen, Detec president, sees as an important change
over the past two to three years in the relationship between hammer
manufacturers and producers of the excavator to which hammers are normally
attached. 'Excavator manufacturers never used to be interested in the
attachment business, but now they are,' he says. 'If they sell an excavator
with attachments as a package, they can get more added value per unit.'
But each excavator company has different design priorities, and none wants
to become involved in manufacturing hammers, so companies such as Bretec,
which is making hammers for Caterpillar, have an opportunity so long as they
can respond to several different customers at the same time.
In the past two months Tamrock, based in Finland's third city of Tampere,
has also opened a new factory producing rock-drills. For Tamrock, Finland
represents only 2 per cent of sales, and the company has expanded from its
base in hard rock drilling into all grades of rock and earth-drilling where
different methods apply. That requires investment in the latest flexible
manufacturing technology to maintain the company's competitiveness, says
Markku Varjoranta, marketing communications manager.
But perhaps the biggest transformation in manufacturing methods and culture
has occurred at Lokomo, also based in Tampere, which was founded in 1915. On
a site which over the years has produced a huge range of mechanical
equipment, production has been concentrated on Lokomo's crushers and
manufacturing cells installed over the past decade.
Overall, says Kauko Hinkkanen, workshop manager, manufacturing lead times
have been reduced from six-12 months to just eight weeks. 'That's very
important for us, because with so many variations and options, forecasting
is very difficult,' says Pekka Pohjoismaki, area manager.
As at Rammer, Lokomo machines the critical parts of its crushers itself, but
has taken the unusual decision to retain its own foundry. Keeping Lokomo
Steels, the biggest steel foundry in Scandinavia, is not just a question of
ensuring access to large, high-quality castings. Since 1982, the foundry has
built its future around 'vacuum steel' which has low levels of impurities.
The extra-tough vacuum steel allows Lokomo to use lighter castings for its
rock crushers, but also gives the foundry a strong position making castings
for water-turbines, diving bells and other equipment where steel strength is
crucial. 'Vacuum steel is the reason why we are still alive,' says Tapio
Saari, Lokomo Steels project manager.

International Business Machines, acknowledging that some of its big
customers are 'downsizing' from mainframe computers to open systems
networks, is to make its mainframe- class transaction processing software
available for use on high-performance IBM computer workstations.
The announcement marks a significant shift for the world's largest mainframe
computer maker and reflects the new level of freedom that has been accorded
to IBM business units to compete among themselves to provide customers with
the best possible computing solutions.
Transaction processing involves the use of computer systems to collect,
process and update quickly and accurately online information such as
customer purchase records or bank account statements.
This area is traditionally the stronghold of IBM mainframe computers.
However, many IBM mainframe users are now looking to add open systems
computing networks, including Unix systems, as a cost-effective alternative
to expanding mainframe systems, IBM acknowledged.
Previously, according to competitors, IBM has only reluctantly offered its
computer workstations to commercial customers, instead proposing mainframe
or minicomputer-based systems for 'mission critical' business applications.
With computer workstations, originally aimed at scientific and technical
applications, now being used increasingly by commercial customers such as
airlines, banks and insurance companies, IBM has shifted its stance.
'IBM intends to be a leader in the fast-growing open systems transaction
processing market,' said Bill Filip, IBM vice president and president of the
advanced workstations division, announcing two additions to the IBM RS/6000
line of workstation that offer performance improvement of more than 20 per
cent.

<TEXT>
Battered by the vagaries of the weather and the Common Agricultural Policy,
Europe's farmers are demanding ever-increasing efficiency and productivity
from their tractors.
That means larger, heavier implements at both ends, and hence heavier engine
blocks and transmission cases to carry the load. But, with the conventional
block design of a tractor, this leads to a disproportionate increase in the
overall weight, raising energy consumption and soil compaction.
Deere, the big US tractor group, is now tackling the problem with its new
6000 and 7000 Series tractors, which incorporate an independent steel frame
that forms the tractor's structural backbone. The full-frame design is
intended to give better weight distribution, improving the performance and
making it easier to fit front-mounted implements. John Deere: UK, 0949

DIY enthusiasts know all about fixing shelves to a wall with plugs and
screws, but the building industry normally uses products such as expanding
anchors - you drill a hole, drop the anchor in and 'torque' it up.
Plasterer Charles Bickford, who is also managing director of Essex-based PA
Fixings, has come up with an alternative - the Excalibur Universal
Screwbolt.
The device can be used in timber, aerated blocks, brick, masonry, concrete
and even steel plate, does not expand and requires no plugs. The screwbolt
cuts its own way into a pre-drilled hole with a unique wide-spaced thread,
leaving a thick band of material between the thread. With a conventional
fine thread, material such as brick crumbles. PA Fixings: UK, 0702 206962.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The Property Market: Double whammy for Hatfield - Vanessa
Houlder reports on a town feeling the full force of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAe's announcement this week that it is to close its historic plant at
Hatfield in south-east England with the loss of some 2,300 jobs is the
second recession-induced blow to have hit the town within the past
fortnight.
The Hatfield Galleria, which went into receivership with debts of Pounds
175m, is the other casualty and it could hardly be more conspicuous: some
40m motorists a year drive past the hangar-like steel and glass structure
that straddles the A1 dual carriageway.
From the day it opened in September last year, the centre has drawn
attention to itself with fanfares of marketing hyperbole. 'An opulent,
relaxed, spacious and dazzling shopping centre modelled on the most
prestigious malls in the US,' it boasted.
There are no shortage of factors that finally forced the centre's downfall.
The overriding problems, according to Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton, the
receiver, were two-fold: cost overruns and the harsh economic climate which
cut rental income; this latter factor was particularly severe since rents
were linked to turnover.
Equally, the collapse of the project can be blamed on fundamental flaws in
its conception and its controversial planning history.
The story of the Galleria began in the early-1980s when the local Welwyn
Hatfield Council agreed in principle to build a shopping centre on land on
top of the tunnel over the new A1 dual carriageway at Hatfield.
The council tried to allay the fears of local developers and retailers by
emphasising that the new centre would be a 'speciality leisure centre',
which would be obliged to exclude fashion, convenience, food and variety
shops.
Critics argued that such a scheme would not be viable. 'We felt the scheme
would never work,' said Mr Roger Carey, development director of Slough
Estates, which built a rival shopping centre in nearby Welwyn Garden City.
But the Hatfield scheme was given planning consent in 1986 by Mr Kenneth
Baker, then secretary of state for the environment, who overruled the
decision of a public inquiry. By then, retail fashions had changed and the
developers decided to upgrade the centre from a 'covered street' to a
shopping mall.
At the same time, the developers concluded that the centre needed more
flexibility in its choice of tenants. After some behind-the-scene dealings
by the council - later described by a High Court judge as an 'abuse of
power' - restrictions on the choice of tenants was relaxed. Slough Estates
is set to sue the council for damages on the grounds that it would not have
gone ahead with its project in Welwyn had it known that the Galleria would
ultimately seek similar retailers to its own project.
But even if the Galleria took business away from neighbouring town centres
it was not a success in its own right. Property consultants attribute the
Galleria's problems to the lack of an 'anchor' tenant and its relatively
small size, which limited its appeal to shoppers outside its vicinity.
The Galleria tried to make a virtue out of its lack of well-known high
street names and its emphasis on boutiques, restaurants, cinema and a health
club.
This concept of 'fun shopping' lost its appeal in the depths of recession.
In any case, it is still unclear whether the Galleria's catchment area is
affluent enough to support such a 'theme' centre.
The Carroll Foundation, a private diversified industrial group which
developed the Galleria and is considering a rescue, rejects this criticism.
It points out that when the centre opened 85 per cent of its 380,000 square
feet was let. Furthermore, some shops and restaurants report brisk trade.
Instead, Carroll attributes the Galleria's financial problems to 'a
combination of a Pounds 60m cost overrun in the initial Pounds 90m
construction budget, an 18-month delay in the original 21-month building
timetable and the failure to complete the complex to its original
specifications.'
Carroll has issued writs totalling more than Pounds 50m against several
parties, including Aukett Group, the architect. Aukett says that teething
problems are only to be expected for a development of this size. 'We will
defend ourselves vigorously,' says Mr Gerry Deighton, Aukett's chairman. 'We
are not aware we have done anything other than we should have.'
Whatever the reasons for the cost overuns, the centre's finances have become
unsustainable. Its debts cannot be serviced by its income. A year ago, the
developers predicted income of about Pounds 10m for 1992.
But the receiver is upbeat about the project's prospects once it is able to
support a smaller debt burden. 'The Galleria now faces a rosier and more
secure future,' Grant Thornton said last week, announcing the receivership.
Even last week, its comments seemed optimistic. The announcement of more
than 2,000 jobs losses at BAe's Hatfield plant will put that optimism to the
test.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The Property Market: A dismal August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In August, commercial property posted its worst performance so far this
year, according to the Investment Property Databank, an independent research
group, writes Vanessa Houlder.
Total returns slipped back to -0.2 per cent, the lowest single monthly
return in 1992. A 0.05 percentage point rise in equivalent yield caused
capital values to fall by a full percentage point, the single largest fall
this year.
August's poor results have dragged down the year-on-year results, with the
total return for the year to August falling back to 1.8 per cent. Rental
values continue to fall, dropping by half a percentage point to -7.5 per
cent for the year ending August.
The gap between retail and industrial returns continues to widen, as yields
in the industrial sector were driven upwards. The average equivalent yield
was pushed to its highest level yet at 11.2 per cent.
Retails were the only sector to show a positive return, with a total return
of 0.1 per cent. Office property was the worst hit sector. Rental and
capital values fell by about 1.5 percentage points and total returns fell
almost half a point below July's return at -0.8 per cent. The industrial
sector has shown signs of volatility, with a total return in August of -0.2
per cent.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Ashdown blames Tories for
'vacuum of leadership'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHDRAWAL from the exchange rate mechanism had put the UK on the periphery
of Europe and in danger of becoming part of a 'second tier' in the European
Community, said Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader.
He complained that Mr John Major had given no indication in his speech to
MPs about the future direction of UK economic policy.
There was also a 'vacuum of leadership' in the UK over ratification of the
Maastricht treaty which would only strengthen the hands of Euro-sceptics.
Mr Ashdown argued that sterling's difficulties last week could have been
avoided if measures had been taken earlier to tackle weaknesses in Britain's
economy.
It was 'nonsense' to suggest that a peculiar bout of speculation meant that
'in a single day, the central planks of the government's economic policy and
of its foreign policy were obliterated'.
Mr Major had wanted Britain at the heart of Europe, 'but last week he put
this country at the periphery of Europe', the Liberal Democrat leader said.
It had been a tactical mistake for the government to blame Germany for the
crisis, 'for which we will pay a very heavy price in the future'. Britain
was now in danger of being condemned to 'a second tier' within the EC.
Responding to Tory jibes that Liberal Democrat policy had been to put
sterling in the narrow bands of the ERM in order to boost the currency's
credibility, Mr Ashdown insisted that such a move would have increased the
financial markets' confidence in the UK's commitment to Europe.
Confidence in the pound could now be boosted by a move to an independent
central bank, investment in infrastructure and by Britain spurning its
'opt-out' from a single currency in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Ashdown said.
The lesson of last week was that moves towards a single currency would help
European countries co-operate in exchange rate management.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: ERM exit was sole option,
says PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday launched an unapologetic defence of the government's
decision to abandon the European exchange rate mechanism, insisting before a
rowdy Commons' chamber: 'There was no choice.'
His frequently interrupted speech, targeted as much at his own backbench
Euro-sceptics as at the Labour opposition, warned that there was no
possibility of a return of the pound to the system 'in the near future' or
into an un-reformed ERM.
But, in a passage that was not well received by Tory opponents of the
Maastricht treaty, Mr Major also insisted he would press on with
ratification of the accord once Denmark had said how it would proceed to a
second referendum.
Nailing his colours firmly to the European mast, he reiterated the case for
the treaty and claimed the narrow French and Danish referendum results
ensured that 'the British agenda is now on the table'.
With the government clearly on the defensive over the future course of
economic policy, Mr Major's speech attempted to concentrate on European
issues.
Against a constant hubbub of abuse and sarcasm from the opposition benches,
he began beligerently, claiming Labour had lost the election because the
electorate had chosen Tory principles of 'low inflation, low taxes, free
trade and freedom from state control'.
The prime minister then went on to remind his listeners that the trade
unions, Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, had
supported the UK joining the ERM at a DM2.95 rate.
To the jeers of his opponents, he then went on to describe the 'exceptional
circumstances' which led to the decision to take the pound out of the
system.
He blamed a speculative attack provoked by the French referendum, Germany's
highest interest rates for a decade and, in a tacit reference to the
Bundesbank, 'injudicious comments that should never have been made'.
Accepting his central role in the decision, he added: 'I take full
responsibility for the actions and policies of my chancellor.'
But his explanation for the events did not escape some withering
observations from the opposition benches. Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish
Nationalist leader, interrupted to ask how, after years of defending the
ERM, he had only just discovered the 'fault lines' in the system.
Mr Major replied that no one had anticipated the size and scale of the
speculative attack against the pound.
Turning to government economic policy, he made clear there was no room for
complacency: 'Nobody should believe that a floating exchange rate is a free
meal, always allowing interest rates to fall to a very low level.'
The government would now use the existing narrow money target, the behaviour
of broad money and asset prices and the exchange rate as means of keeping
pressure on inflation.
He also stressed the need to bear down on public expenditure as a 'tough but
necessary' control on prices.
On European policy, he tried to steer a course between 'fundamentalists'
opposed to any return to the ERM and those who backed an immediate
resumption of sterling's membership.
Instead, the prime minister argued that reforms to the system would be a
precondition for re-entry. 'I do not see that we could readily return to the
mechanism without dealing with the problems that have been thrown up,' he
said.
But he made clear that he remained committed to the Maastricht treaty,
stressing that many of the things for which it had been attacked actually
stemmed from the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act.
In a lengthy package, attacked by one Labour backbencher for failing to
address the motion's theme of economic policy, he restated the government's
achievements in negotiating concessions in the Maastricht treaty.
Pointing up the provisions on subsidiarity - the devolution of powers - he
hinted that a clear definition of those provisions could supply the grounds
for Denmark to reconsider the treaty in a new referendum.
Concluding that only his government offered industry freedom from state
control and the low taxation and low inflation that allowed British
enterprise to flourish, he commended the motion to the House.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Policy under fire from
former chancellors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR FORMER chancellors of the exchequer united in the Lords yesterday to
criticise the government's alleged lack of leadership in handling the recent
sterling crisis.
Two - Lord Howe and Lord Jenkins - called for the swift return of the pound
to the European exchange rate mechanism.
There were repeated cautions against the dangers of allowing speculative
capital to flow unrestricted on foreign exchange markets and repeated calls
for Mr Norman Lamont to resign as chancellor.
In surprisingly friendly early proceedings, there were also stern warnings
that the euphoria which greeted the return of floating exchange rates in
certain quarters would prove seriously misplaced.
In the hardest-hitting speech of the day, Lord Healey, the former Labour
chancellor, said it would be 'far better' if Mr Lamont left office since his
credibility had been 'destroyed'.
He also castigated leading Conservative figures for their 'unfair' attacks
on Germany. It was depressing that the government had chosen last week to
incite 'the worst form of xenophobia'.
Arguing that a single currency would not be possible without 'a degree of
convergence guaranteed by a single political authority' he warned that
Britain would be 'unable' to return to the ERM if the government did not
make significant changes in its economic policies.
In perhaps the staunchest defence of the ERM from a former chancellor, Lord
Howe - the Tory who played a crucial role in Britain's joining the mechanism
 -called for sterling to re-enter it 'as soon as prudently possible.'
Last week's events - though a serious setback - did not even 'seriously
diminish the case for a European Monetary System,' he said. A floating pound
meant Britain would be 'more not less exposed'.
Lord Callaghan, the former Labour premier who resigned as chancellor over
devaluation in 1969, added his voice to calls for sterling's prompt
restoration to the ERM, saying devaluation was not 'an easy way out'.
Condemning the recent speculation by 'barrow boys' whom he described as
'front men' for respected banks, he advocated an excess profits tax of
'about 100 per cent' for such currency deals.
Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the former Labour chancellor and Social Democratic
party leading light, warned that the turmoil on foreign exchange markets
might bring forward the date upon which the 'core' ERM participants moved to
a single currency.
If it did, Britain should not endeavour to 'obstruct' the move.
Lord Cockfield, a former European commissioner, argued that the importance
of Maastricht had been overstated because all the key policies enshrined in
the treaty were already part of EC law or policy.
Failure to ratify the treaty would not stop the single currency from going
ahead, he said. Its purpose was to 'dot i's and cross t's'
Hitting out at speculation by 'frenetic young men' in the foreign exchange
markets, he warned that the pound would become 'par excellence the
speculators' counter' if a single currency materialised from which sterling
was excluded.
For Labour, Lord Cledwyn, blamed Britain's predicament on the 'lack of
coherent political leadership' and the government's apparent blindness to
'gathering clouds'.
The blame for 'one of the most costly misjudgments of the century' rested
'on the cabinet table at Number 10 Downing Street,' he said. The prime
minister and the chancellor had 'dithered in a crisis' with leadership
'conspicuous for its absence.'
Opening the debate for the government, Lord Wakeham said he did not think
sterling could readily return to the ERM without dealing with the problems
that had been 'thrown up.' In the mean time, monetary policy would be guided
by 'a range of indicators'.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Smith scoffs at Major's
'devalued' government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A scathing attack on the policy failures which had resulted in the forced
devaluation of sterling, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, warned that
Britain faced relegation to the second division of the European Community.
In his parliamentary debut as leader of the opposition - which won
enthusiastic acclaim from his party - he branded Mr John Major as the
'devalued prime minister of a devalued government'.
Mr Smith was equally scathing about the credibility of Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, in the wake of the minister's earlier repeated assurances that
there was no question of devaluation.
The Labour leader recalled that in addition to ruling out any change in the
parity of sterling, Mr Lamont had also mocked every possible alternative to
Britain's continued membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System.
Mr Smith swept aside protestations from Mr Major that he had failed to
appreciate the force of the speculative pressures which triggered
devaluation.
'In the course of a few weeks, the one policy with which Mr Major was
uniquely, personally associated, the contribution to policies of which he
appears to have been most proud, has been blown apart,' Mr Smith said.
'With it has gone forever any claim by the prime minister or the party he
leads to economic competence.'
The Labour leader likened the prime minister's explanation to that of the
seaman in charge of the bridge who complained: 'Along came a wave and
overturned the vessel'.
The prime minister had to endure sustained ridicule from Labour MPs as Mr
Smith quoted a newspaper report - from the month before a 13 per cent
devaluation - that it was his (the prime minister's) aim that sterling
should replace the D-Mark as the anchor of the exchange rate mechanism.
'The more generous thought it was a case of audacity straining the bounds of
credulity, others thought the prime minister had taken leave of his senses,'
Mr Smith scoffed.
He forecast that the prime minister's failure to deliver the economic
recovery which he had promised would follow from a Conservative victory in
April's general election would be intensified by a round of public
expenditure cuts.
Mr Smith claimed that the British people had reached the conclusion that
they were governed by 'a prime minister and a government fatally flawed by
incredulity and incompetence'.
Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney and a leading
critic of sterling's inclusion in the exchange rate mechanism, said the bad
performance of the British economy had inevitably led foreign opinion to the
conclusion that sterling's parity had been out of line.
Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, who played a leading role in
securing the referendum which endorsed Britain's membership of the European
Community in 1975, renewed his call for a referendum on the Maastricht
treaty.
He said the debate had been 'totally unrealistic' because party leaders had
not taken account of the anxieties of those who feared unemployment or
having their homes repossessed.
Mr Benn said he would launch a national petition and introduce a
parliamentary bill in his attempt to ensure that the citizens of the UK were
given the right to vote for or against the treaty. The bill would include a
provision that the referendum result should be binding on parliament.
Llanelli MP Mr Denzil Davies said the 'fault lines' which the prime minister
had recently discovered in the exchange rate mechanism should have been
apparent to him when, as chancellor, he persuaded Mrs Margaret Thatcher to
agree to sterling's entry in 1990.
Mr Davies, a former Labour Treasury minister, insisted that the ERM had
changed a system of fixed and adjustable exchange rates to a quasi-monetary
union in January 1987.
Shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown ridiculed the chancellor's 'no
devaluations' statement made outside the Treasury in August in front of the
television cameras.
He said: 'Forty-five seconds on the Treasury steps cost the Bank of England
millions - think of the cost to the country if he had spoken for three
minutes or even longer'.
Mr Brown predicted that Mr Lamont's loss of credibility would soon bring
about his departure from the Treasury.
To Labour laughter he told Mr Lamont 'there is no point in setting monetary
targets other than in negotiations with publishers about his memoirs'.
Both the prime minister and the chancellor had a credibility problem which
would have to be paid for by an interest rate premium or in some other way.
Challenged by Tory backbenchers to spell out Labour's policy, Mr Brown said
there was now a clear difference between the two main parties.
Labour's policy was to have 'managed exchange rates,' while the chancellor
was unable to say whether he supported managed or floating rates.

wounds

<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT convincingly won the division at the end of the debate on its
economic strategy last night in the Commons, although the split in the Tory
party over Europe was apparent from the opening speech.
Only a handful of backbenchers defied the government whips by abstaining as
the motion expressing support for the government's policy passed by 322 to
296, a majority of 26.
A stream of Euro-sceptic critics on the government benches, such as Sir
Teddy Taylor and Mr William Cash, queued up to speak in the debate, but
abstained in the division rather than voting against the government.
From the start of the debate, Mr John Major faced pressure from both wings
of the party. Euro-sceptic MPs warned against a return to a system of
managed exchange rates. But Sir Edward Heath, the former Tory prime
minister, urged that the UK should not again be left on the sidelines if
Germany, France and the three Benelux countries moved quickly to a single
currency.
The trickiest intervention in the prime minister's speech among several from
Euro-sceptics came from Mr Nicholas Budgen, for long an opponent of fixed
exchange rates.
He pointed out that MPs had spent a long time discussing both the details
and the basis of the exchange rate mechanism, and asked Mr Major what new
details had caught him out unexpectedly, and what would have to happen
before he took sterling back into such a mechanism.
But there was also a call - swiftly rebuffed - from Mr Michael Spicer, a
former minister and a leading Euro-sceptic, for Mr Major to give his MPs a
free vote on the bill to ratify the Maastricht bill when it returns to the
Commons.
Sir Edward emphasised that there were many points of Mr Major's speech with
which he agreed, including his rejection of a referendum, but warned that
the review of what had occurred should go wider than the events of the past
week.
The government benches were crowded for the opening of the debate, but the
strength of feeling in the party was perhaps reflected in the fact that
Euro-sceptics as senior as Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary,
remained in their places waiting to speak long after many of their
colleagues had left the debate.
Mr Baker said he had opposed Britain's entry into the ERM while Lady
Thatcher was prime minister, and hoped Mr Major would not be 'too vigorous'
in pursuing his search for a replacement for a system the advantages of
which had been exaggerated.
He turned his fire on Treasury officials, suggesting that Sir Terry Burns,
permanent secretary to the Treasury, should also be in the pillory alongside
the prime minister and the chancellor.
Commenting that the mandarins in the Treasury were held in high esteem, 'not
least by themselves', he said that their advice had been 'not marginally
wrong, but comprehensively wrong'.
Mr John Biffen, a former cabinet minister on the Euro-sceptic side of the
argument, predicted that as the unified Germany looked to exert economic
influence on Eastern Europe, the economic conditions envisaged in the
Maastricht treaty would become increasingly irrelevant.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Long battle is likely over disqualification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S applic-ation to have Mr Berry disqualified as a company
director under the 1986 Company Directors Disqualification Act looks certain
to lead to a protracted legal battle.
In a written statement Mr Berry 'utterly rejected' the findings of the
report by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. He said their
contention that he had acted in a way which made him unfit to be a director
was 'unjustified, unfair and untrue'.
Mr Berry is chairman of Business Technology Group, an office equipment
company; non-executive vice-chairman of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club; and
a non-executive director of Profitbuilder, a business expansion scheme. He
is also vice-chairman-elect of Tottenham Hotspur plc.
There is no appeal against the findings of DTI inspectors. Mr Berry could
seek a judicial review of the report, but that would be expensive and is an
option he has already rejected. Instead, he intends to use the DTI's
application to have him disqualified to put his case against the findings.
The case may never reach open court. Most disqualification cases are
conducted by submission of written evidence with occasional hearings in the
judge's chambers.
The process can be long. For example, the application to disqualify Sir
Edward Du Cann and six other former directors of Homes Assured, the
collapsed financial services company, was made in August last year but has
still not been resolved.
Under the 1986 Act a director can be disqualified for general misconduct,
persistent breaches of company legislation, fraud, wrongful trading or for
unfitness generally.
If the DTI's application is successful Mr Berry could face disqualification
for up to 15 years, though such a severe penalty is unlikely.
In cases dealt with by the courts since the act was passed, 88 per cent of
disqualification orders have been for five years or less. There is a minimum
disqualification period of two years.
Penalties of between 10 years and 15 years are imposed only in particularly
serious cases, for example where a director has been disqualified for a
second time. The DTI says 2,162 directors have been disqualified following a
company insolvency or a DTI inquiry since 1980 and more than 1,300 since the
1986 Act was passed.
The rate of disqualifications has risen sharply during the recession as more
companies go to the wall. At the end of June there were court proceedings in
progress against 12 directors, stemming from 14 DTI investigations.
Once a disqualification order has been made the person concerned is
prevented from acting as a director of any company.
In Mr Berry's case this would mean he would be prevented from taking any
part in the management of the three companies in which he holds
directorships.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Reform of standard on cashflow is demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW accounting standard on cashflow needs urgent reform if it is not to
lose credibility according to a critical analysis published this week.
The analysis of the work of the Accounting Standards Board and of accounting
practice concludes that use of Financial Reporting Standard One, which
became mandatory for year-ends after March 23, is causing widespread
inconsistencies.
It says that without rapid reform the standard will lose credibility.
The findings are contained in the latest edition of UK GAAP - or generally
accepted accounting practice - which examines the state of financial
reporting in British companies each year.
GAAP says a number of practical difficulties have already emerged with the
standard - the first to be introduced by the board after it began work two
years ago.
It also says there is confusion over the definition of 'cash and cash
equivalents' as laid down in the standard and over the definition of
'operating activities'.
GAAP also points to inconsistencies between companies in classifying cash
outflows relating to provisions set up in previous years. It also highlights
practical difficulties in the treatment of cashflows from joint ventures and
from research and development.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Conduct 'clearly not acceptable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry's report into Blue Arrow, published
yesterday, finds that the conduct of Mr Tony Berry 'was clearly not
acceptable conduct for someone in a position of authority in a public
company'.
The broad conclusion of the 'extraordinary corporate story' described in the
report is that Mr Berry was not sufficiently accountable to the board and
had an ambivalent attitude to non-executive directors. He also had
insufficient regard for his statutory obligations as a director and for
regulatory matters concerned with the company.
Much of the report is devoted to the circumstances of the transaction that
brought Blue Arrow into the public arena - a Pounds 25m loan by Blue Arrow
in 1988 to a company controlled by Mr Peter de Savary.
The loan was undertaken in the hope that it would provide enough profits to
defray the costs of the involvement of Blue Arrow Challenge, a subsidiary of
the company, in the America's Cup yacht race. But the terms of the loan,
which related to a property deal at Canvey Island in Essex, aroused
controversy because it appeared highly speculative. Moreover, the
transaction was entered into without the board's approval and without
disclosure to shareholders or the Stock Exchange.
The most serious criticisms levelled at Mr Berry concern breaches of
fiduciary duty to Blue Arrow, including: 'Deliberately making two misleading
statements to the board concerning the Canvey transaction.' The inspectors
conclude that Mr Berry's assertion that the investment was secured by a
guarantee from Mr de Savary was deliberately misleading. They say he misled
board members by failing to tell them that Mr de Savary required exchange of
contracts within a few days.
Concluding the Canvey transaction 'despite the absence of board approval and
without authority'.
'Deliberately omitting to inform the board about the revision to the Blue
Arrow Challenge shareholders' agreement.' The inspectors conclude that Mr
Berry failed to tell the board that he had committed Blue Arrow to a further
Pounds 15m expenditure on the America's cup because it could affect the
response to the Canvey transaction.
'Not bringing to the board transactions in which he had an actual or
possible conflict of interest and duty.'
That criticism applied to a joint venture agreement to build a leisure
complex in Portugal, which involved a business associate of Mr Berry called
Mr Hobday who would have gained financially if the project had proceeded. Mr
Berry was relying on repayment of Pounds 500,000 from a personal joint
venture with Mr Hobday to allow him to increase his personal shareholding in
Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, where he was a director, says the report.'
The culmination of this corporate transaction could have assisted, in some
way at least, Mr Hobday's ability and/or willingness to pay the Pounds
500,000 due to Mr Berry,' the report concludes.
Possible conflict of interest was also said to have applied to a series of
transactions with Tottenham Hotspur, the report says. It concludes that Mr
Berry failed in his fiduciary duty by failing to bring these transactions to
the board's attention. It also finds that he attempted to use Blue Arrow as
a repository for disposing of shares in Spurs when financial difficulties
hindered him paying for them personally. Again, he did not take the matter
to the Blue Arrow board.
The inspectors were also concerned about certain dealings between Mr Berry
and Mr Michael Ashcroft, a long-standing friend and an entrepreneur. They
say they failed to get a satisfactory explanation from both Mr Berry and Mr
Ashcroft concerning the timing, amount and the prompt payment of an invoice
from Mr Ashcroft.
The inspectors conclude that, to an extent, Mr Berry was a victim of
circumstances. They note that he was under increasing personal and business
pressure involving events outside his control. The report concludes,
however, that although these factors partly explained Mr Berry's actions, it
did not excuse them.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Berry pledges fight to clear his name: Inspectors' report
into Blue Arrow is published; Judge will be asked to bar former chairman as
a company director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday said that it is to apply to
the High Court to have Mr Tony Berry, the former chairman of the Blue Arrow
employment services group, disqualified as a company director.
Investigators appointed to probe Mr Berry's stewardship of Blue Arrow
submitted their report to the DTI in June last year. The report was
published yesterday, and says he failed in his fiduciary duty to Blue Arrow
and paid insufficient regard to his statutory obligations as a director.
The investigation was launched after disclosure of a loan approved by Mr
Berry to a company controlled by Mr Peter de Savary, the entrepreneur,
involving a property project on Canvey Island, Essex.
The circumstances of the loan were not disclosed to Blue Arrow's board or to
its shareholders or the Stock Exchange, and only came to light after a
question was asked about the deal at an annual general meeting. The
investigation covered Mr Berry's stewardship of Blue Arrow with particular
reference to the Canvey Island deal.
Mr Berry yesterday rejected the conclusions of the DTI report and pledged,
if given the opportunity, to clear his name 'for ever' in the courts.
He said yesterday: 'I've had 3 1/2 years of hell, and now I have the
opportunity to talk, I shall . . . It's been a strain. The only relief is
that the DTI report has come out although I didn't expect to have to go on
with further aggravation and further expense.'
Mr Berry said the report, particularly the criticisms that on a number of
occasions he 'deliberately misled' the board of Blue Arrow, was unsupported
by evidence.
He said: 'I find the whole thing quite extraordinary. There is no finding of
fraud, improper action, or financial gain, so why should I have a motive for
misleading the board . . . I reject their findings . . . they are going to
have a hell of a job to make this stick.'
He said the DTI had been forced to make a scapegoat of him under pressure of
'innuendos leaked to the press' and 'people thinking there must be some
great scandal'.
He said that if there were errors in the way he had conducted his affairs,
they were 'small in the context of a whole massive organisation'.
The report exonerates Blue Arrow's non-executive directors including Lord
Tebbit, the former cabinet minister. 'He at all times acted both responsibly
and honourably,' it says.
The report also finds that the controversial property deal, which concerned
a company headed by Mr Peter de Savary, was 'a genuine commercial
transaction' that was offered in good faith to Blue Arrow.
Mr Berry said he earned Pounds 400,000 a year as chief executive of Blue
Arrow and had received a pay-off of Pounds 1m. He said legal fees involved
had cost him Pounds 600,000 so far, and he had put his house in Florida on
the market.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Minister falls foul of the backbench referees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the judgment of Mr David Mellor's behaviour under the rules for
backbenchers rather than under those for ministers that finally seemed to
count against him in the eyes of his colleagues.
As MPs gathered in Westminster yesterday morning, members of the influential
1922 committee of Tory backbenchers commented that the party was concerned
about the propriety of Mr Mellor's acceptance of hospitality from wealthy
friends without, apparently, making any admission in the register of MPs'
interests.
The rules leave MPs great freedom of action, provided that they declare
financial interests including gifts and overseas visits.
As backbenchers do not have the patronage ministers possess - although they
can be influential in pursuing particular causes - the aim of the guidelines
for MPs is to ensure that any links are known so that they can be taken into
account when MPs make representations.
The importance of declaring such interests - rather than not having any -
can be seen in the fact that MPs generally see no problem with admitting to
trips taken abroad. More than 160 of the 650 MPs declared overseas visits in
the latest register of interests, published earlier this year, excluding
journeys undertaken on behalf of groups such as the inter-parliamentary
union.
Visits declared included those by MPs who went to southern Italy at the
invitation of the Tobacco Advisory Council, while numerous others went to
Israel as guests of either the Conservative or the Labour Friends of Israel,
or of the Israeli government.
The last MP to fall foul of the regulations was Mr John Browne, then Tory MP
for Winchester, who was suspended for four weeks early in 1990 after the
Commons found him guilty of failing to declare a payment of more than Pounds
50,000 from the Saudi central bank and a 'client' relationship with a group
of Lebanese middlemen.
The form on which interests are declared asks MPs whether they have made any
overseas visits related in any way to their membership of the Commons where
the cost was not borne by themselves or from UK public funds.
This does not mean MPs have to announce every time they stay in a friend's
villa in Spain or flat in Paris. What raised eyebrows in Mr Mellor's case
was the news that not only were he and his family alleged to have been
provided with summer holiday accommodation in 1990 by Mrs Mona Bauwens, the
daughter of a leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, but
that she was also said to have paid for their flights.
While the rules for ministers are strict, they are left more to the judgment
of the individuals. They are advised that they should not accept 'gifts,
hospitality or services from anyone which would, or might appear to, place
him or her under an obligation'.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Pressure for new financial services regulator rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTLE was joined yesterday in the attempt to persuade financial services
companies to join a new regulatory authority for retail financial business.
The formation committee of the proposed Personal Investment Authority issued
a consultative document setting out the plans for its structure and
functions. It aims to have the regulator in operation in July.
Sir Brian Hayes, chairman of the committee, said consumers would benefit
from consistent standards across the sector, simplified and improved
handling of complaints and a strengthened investors' compensation scheme.
The industry would benefit from cheaper regulation through economies of
scale and through a common rule book for similar businesses.
The problem for Sir Brian is persuading companies to be regulated by the new
body - they cannot be compelled to do so. Members of Lautro, the regulator
for unit trusts and life assurance companies, and Fimbra, the regulator for
financial intermediaries, will have to vote those two bodies out of
existence.
But the main problem may lie in persuading banks and building societies to
join. They fear being outnumbered by the life insurers on the new body and
being forced to pay compensation money for faults of others such as
independent intermediaries.
The formation committee has tried to meet their objections by creating a
30-seat board and an elaborate voting structure in which 75 per cent
majorities of product providers and independent practitioners would be
needed to approve any change.
Consumer advocates feel the participation of the banks is vital.
'The aims of the PIA's formation committee are to be applauded,' said Ms
Jane Vass, head of money at the Consumers' Association.
'But the PIA will only work if the majority of businesses who deal with
private investors are covered, including banks and building societies.
Without them, the scheme will founder.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Life assurance reforms urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, director-general of fair trading, yesterday gave the
life assurance industry a 'daunting shopping list' of reforms it should
carry out if it wanted to head off tighter regulation.
He said at the Chartered Insurance Institute meeting in Preston, Lancashire:
'There should be a shift in competition away from who gives the best
commission to who gives the best value to the customer.'
His remarks come amid speculation that the Office of Fair Trading will call
for much tighter regulation on disclosure of charges when it advises the
government on the competition implications of the Securities and Investments
Board's review of retail financial regulation. A decision is expected in the
next two months.
Sir Bryan's speech brought instant condemnation from the Association of
British Insurers, which said he had 'betrayed a lack of understanding about
how the insurance industry operates'.
Sir Bryan suggested that, to stimulate competition, 'league tables' should
be published showing the charges levied by different companies for
equivalent policies.
He also attacked the heavy penalties suffered by investors who surrender
endowment policies early.
'No other investments result in such heavy automatic losses,' he said.

THE GOVERNMENT should confirm its commitment to prosperity by cutting

The move would do more to improve confidence and boost recovery than any
other reform of comparable cost, the institute explained. It would also most

A SURVEY of almost 150 estate agents conducted last month before the recent
cuts in interest rates shows how deeply depressed house prices and sales had
become.
More than 60 per cent of agents questioned by the Royal Institution of

months to the end of August.
Other agents said prices had remained static over the summer.

immediate effect for new borrowers.
Nationwide cut its basic mortgage rate by 0.75 points to 9.95 per cent, but
also made smaller reductions for larger mortgages with reductions of between
0.6 points and 0.45 points. National Westminster became the second bank to
cut its mortgage interest rate, moving it from 10.69 per cent to 9.99 per
cent immediately for new borrowers and from November 1 for existing
customers.
Lloyds Bank yesterday cut most of its personal customer lending rates for
overdrafts.

PUBLIC-SECTOR pay has outstripped pay in the private sector for the first
time since 1986, according to the government's New Earnings Survey, Lisa
Wood writes.
It shows that average gross weekly earnings of all full-time employees were
Pounds 305 in April and that earnings in the previous year rose more for
women than for men and more for non-manual workers than for manual workers.
But the survey showed that employees in the public sector had been less
affected by the recession. Public-sector earnings averaged Pounds 307.80
compared with Pounds 303.30 in the private sector, representing increases of
8.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively on the previous April.
The survey says that over a two-year period which included part of the
recession cumulative pay increases were 21 per cent in the public sector and
14 per cent in the private sector.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Mellor pays price of living dangerously: Talent will be
missed in cabinet Risk-taker with weakness for high life Self-confidence
made enemies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSERVATIVE colleague dubbed him one of the sharpest politicians of his
generation. The only problem was that the secretary of state for national
heritage knew it.
Few at Westminster were surprised by the nature of Mr David Mellor's
departure. Just as he has always played the game of politics dangerously, he
never looked the type who would slot easily into a conventional private
life.
The 43-year-old MP for Putney is a man for fashionable restaurants and
nightclubs rather than slippers and fireside. A politician who, when charged
with policy towards the Middle East, preferred bawling out an Israeli
officer in front of television cameras to the genteel diplomacy of the
Foreign Office.
His weakness for much wealthier friends and willingness to accept their
hospitality provided the lever with which the tabloid newspapers eventually
forced him from office.
Though he is undoubtedly pro-Arab, there is no evidence he was influenced by
the hospitality provided by prominent members of the Arab community. But in
government, the implication is enough.
He will be missed from Mr John Major's cabinet. Not because he is the most
popular politician at Westminster: a self-confidence that merges easily into
arrogance has won him plenty of enemies.
But in a government not noted for its political and human sparkle the
self-styled minister for fun looked as if he was enjoying getting things
done. 'Others agonise about the minutiae. David makes up his mind and gets
on with it,' is how one cabinet friend puts it.
In the end his arrogance was his worst enemy. An illicit relationship
between a cabinet minister and an actress was always bound to provide the
tabloids with a field day.
But the sheer tenacity with which some of the newspapers stuck with the
story over two months - even after Mr Major had given his full backing to a
colleague who had become a close friend - attested to the fact that Mr
Mellor made too many enemies among the government's friends.
It was no accident that newspapers which had fiercely supported Mr Major at
the general election were ready to extend their attacks on Mr Mellor's
personal life to detailed accounts of his links with generous friends.
What Mr Mellor lacks in humility he has frequently made up for in sheer
guts. It is no coincidence that similarly brave colleagues such as Mr
Michael Heseltine have a good word for him.
He started in politics early. The son of a schoolmaster from Wareham in
Dorset, he was chairman of South Dorset Young Conservatives at the age of
15. A degree at Cambridge and a brief spell at the Bar were interludes in
what was a determined ascent on the political escalator.
Within two years of entering parliament in 1979 he was a junior minister.
Although his friend Mr Major has never shared Mr Mellor's penchant for the
high life, the two share a political outlook shaped by childhoods outside
the Tory establishment. They both like soccer, forging their close political
as well as personal relationship during Saturday afternoons watching Chelsea
FC.
A Dorset grammar school boy, Mr Mellor is a meritocrat. Like the prime
minister he is dry on economics, wet on social policy. Like Mr Major he has
no time for the traditions of the old Tory establishment.
Ironically, as the minister charged with the press and broadcasting, his
instincts are far more liberal than those of many in the Tory party. As a
junior home office minister he frequently defended the BBC against the
intemperate attacks of the Tory right.
Piloting the broadcasting bill through parliament he persuaded the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher that there was a role for quality as well as money in
independent television.
When he took the responsibility for broadcasting to the new Department of
National Heritage, the BBC management breathed a huge sigh of relief. He
would be tough on efficiency, on securing value for money. But he was
committed to the principle of public service broadcasting.
During the summer he responded to the political uproar over press intrusion
into the private lives of members of the Royal family by asking Sir David
Calcutt QC to carry out another investigation into the effectiveness of
self-regulation. But colleagues said that while the royal stories had tipped
the prime minister decisively towards advocacy of a new privacy law, Mr
Mellor was unconvinced that legislation was the best way to regulate a
business in which he has many friends as well as enemies. The events of the
past few days may well have changed his mind.
Mr Mellor is widely regarded as a clever man and talented politician. Many
will say his reckless confidence in his future was at the heart of his
downfall.
Others will lament the Victorian principle of thou shalt not get caught,
which still infuses British political life.
David Mellor was yesterday finally consumed by headlines.
It began on July 19 on the front page of The People with the headline,
'David Mellor And The Actress'.
The Sun then claimed that 'Mellor Made Love In Chelsea Strip'. Mr Mellor
said it had been made up. But the minister for fun was rapidly being laughed
out of his job.
It was the headlines over the libel action against The People by another
friend, Mrs Mona Bauwens, that really undermined Mr Mellor.
Some of the best came yesterday after Mr Mellor went on television to argue
that it was the prime minister, and not tabloid editors, who decided who
should be a member of the cabinet.
'Mellor's Last Stand' said the Sun. And so it was for the man who three
years ago warned the press it was drinking in the 'last-chance saloon'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID MELLOR'S letter of resignation to Mr John Major reads:
'Dear Prime Minister,
'As you know, I decided this morning that I should resign. I am deeply
touched by your reluctance to let me do so, but I feel sure this is the
right thing to do.
'I was very grateful that you and colleagues concluded in July that my folly
in becoming embroiled in revelations of an affair did not warrant my leaving
the government.
'I am also very glad that following advice in the normal way, you have been
able to make it clear that in relation to subsequent allegations, I have
acted within the guidance on the conduct of ministers.
'However, I have concluded that it is too much to expect of my colleagues in
government and in parliament to have to put up with a constant barrage of
stories about me in certain tabloid newspapers.
'Rather than have this turn into a trial of strength between the government
and some sections of the press about my future, I have decided to resolve it
myself by resigning. I also have to bear in mind the interests of my wife
and family who have been such a wonderful support to me during this
particularly trying period for all of us.
'I leave with great regret. I have been privileged to hold office for 11
years in a series of jobs of enormous interest and I believe of some
importance, especially in relation to drugs, broadcasting, the NHS and
foreign affairs.
'It has been a special privilege to serve under you in the cabinet as chief
secretary and as the first secretary of state for National Heritage. It is
an opportunity given to few to lead in the creation of a new department of
state, especially one which has so much to contribute to your own vision of
improving the quality of life in this country. I would have loved to have
been able to do more to turn that vision into reality.
'I shall of course continue to serve as Member for Putney. I love my
constituency and will do all I can to advance the interests of my
constituents from the backbenches. I shall also do everything in my power to
support and sustain the government in the months and years ahead.
'The country is fortunate to have you as our prime minister. I am privileged
to count you as a dear friend. I do not want to be seen as a liability to
you. It is my one great regret about this whole sorry business that at this
crucial time in the government's fortunes, when I should so much have liked
to be seen as a tower of strength, I am perceived by some as a point of
weakness. I hope I deal with that matter today by taking this step.'
Mr Major's reply reads:
'I was very sorry when you told me this morning of your decision to resign
from the government. As you know, you have always had my warm personal
support, and I accepted your decision with deep regret. I admire the courage
with which you have handled difficult circumstances in recent weeks.
'You have been a valued member of my cabinet, both as secretary of state for
National Heritage and before that as chief secretary. Your knowledge,
experience and insight has been invaluable in getting the new Department of
National Heritage off to a swift and successful start.
'I know from the messages of support I have received from those in the arts
world and elsewhere how much your leadership, interest and enthusiasm will
be missed. It is a matter of great regret that you will not be overseeing
the next stage in the development of the department, but you have laid a
sound foundation for the future. Before that, you handled the difficult job
of chief secretary to the Treasury with great skill and determination and
made an important contribution in a wide range of other ministerial jobs.
'I will continue to value your friendship and your continued support in the
House of Commons. My very best wishes to you and to Judith, who has provided
such marvellous support through all this.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Mrs Maxwell alleged to control Liechtenstein trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Elisabeth Maxwell is the power behind secretive Liechtenstein trusts
linked to the business empire of her late husband, an MP alleged yesterday.
Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, suggested to the Commons social
security committee that Mrs Maxwell had a side letter that gave her
authority to 'pull the strings' of the trusts.
He said Mrs Maxwell called an extraordinary general meeting by telephone
from Grand Canaria two days after Robert Maxwell died last November, and
instructed the board to appoint her two sons Kevin and Ian as directors of
Maxwell Newspapers Inc, which owns the New York Daily News.
The committee was questioning accountants from Price Waterhouse who are
administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation.
Mr Shaw was asking about the level of co-operation from lawyers controlling
the Liechtenstein-based trusts and the Maxwell Foundation, which controls a
series of US-based companies linked to the Maxwell business empire that
continue to trade.
Mr Mark Homan of PW said that there had been 'encouraging' contact between
his firm's lawyers and those controlling the Maxwell trusts.
But in response to the allegations about Mrs Maxwell, he said: 'We don't
know who is behind those trusts. It is not the sort of thing that
Liechtenstein lawyers normally answer.'
There are believed to be about 12 trusts, several of which may own shares in
MCC and Mirror Group Newspapers and were used as part of an alleged share
support operation to sustain the market price of the two companies.
Mr Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said he had not seen the
documents to which Mr Shaw referred.
Also at the hearing, Mr Homan said he was 'considering the possibility' of
legal action against Coopers &amp; Lybrand, auditor to most of the Maxwell
companies until the collapse of the empire.
He disclosed that total professional fees incurred so far during the
administration totalled Pounds 15m, including Pounds 7m from the
accountants. He said so far sales of assets had realised Pounds 59m, but
that he anticipated substantial future sales.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Honda plans big increase in Swindon workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA is preparing to recruit the next 600 workers needed to reach the
initial 50,000-a-year output of the new car it is about to start building in
its Pounds 370m plant at Swindon, Wiltshire.
The Japanese carmaker, which already employs 900 people on the 360-acre
site, yesterday released the first official pictures of the car.
The vehicle, previously code-named Synchro, will use the Accord name that
Honda uses throughout the world for its upper-medium saloon range.
Honda wants to complete recruitment of the 600 staff before the middle of
next year, Mr Shojiro Miyake, managing director of Honda of the UK
Manufacturing (HUM), said yesterday.
That would allow for sufficient training for Honda to reach its single-shift
target of 50,000 cars within 18 months of the start of production. The first
cars destined for sale are due off the Swindon lines early next month.
It was ironic that Mr Miyake was outlining the recruitment on the day that
both Ford and Rolls-Royce announced job cuts against a background of
slumping car demand in Britain and several overseas markets.
The Swindon plant is scheduled to be employing 2,000 by 1995, when the
Japanese group plans to be building 100,000 cars a year on a two-shift
system.
The Swindon-built Accord, which Honda says will be sold only in the European
market, has been developed jointly with Britain's Rover Group.
Rover will start production of its own version of the car - expected to be
called the Rover 600 - early next year. Mr Miyake said yesterday that the
Accord will be launched first in continental Europe, making its debut at the
Berlin Motor Show on October 9.
It will be launched progressively in other European countries throughout
next year and early 1994. Its UK debut is to be in May, with Honda UK, the
British sales subsidiary, forecasting 3,500 sales next year rising to 12,000
by 1995.
Honda hopes the Swindon-built Accord, and the replacement for the Honda
Concerto that the Wiltshire plant will also be building by 1995, will help
lift Honda's total Europe sales to between 250,000 and 300,000 a year by the
late 1990s. Concertos are now produced by Rover alongside the similar Rover
200 models at Longbridge.
To help achieve this increased production target, Honda is also expanding
its European dealer network to around 2,000, up from a present total of
1,915.
Mr Miyake, who declined to comment on whether Honda would expand Swindon's
capacity beyond the 100,000 level in the late 1990s, said Honda was also
taking steps to establish a presence in eastern Europe.
Although it is not considering production there, it has already set up what
it describes as 'representative' offices in Hungary, Poland, Moscow and
Czechoslovakia.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Ford factories face deep cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD announced yesterday that a total of 1,487 hourly paid jobs are to be
cut throughout its UK plants. Car assembly plants at Dagenham, Essex, and
Halewood, Merseyside, will be hit hardest by the cuts, but the workforces
will also be reduced at engine plants at Dagenham, east London, and Bridgend
in south Wales.
The workforce at the Dagenham car plant, which produces the Fiesta small
car, will be reduced by about 650, while 700 jobs will be cut at Halewood,
which builds Escort and Orion small family cars.
A further 90 jobs will be cut at the Dagenham engine plant and 47 at
Bridgend. It is understood that Ford's salaried-staff unions were being told
last night of a further cut of about 60 salaried jobs to be implemented by
the end of the year.
The new round of redundancies is in addition to the reduction of 2,100 jobs
announced by Ford of Britain in February. Of this earlier redundancy package
about 827 jobs remain to be shed before the end of the year.
In parallel with the job reductions Ford is cutting its daily car output by
200 at Dagenham - from 1,200 at present - and by 250 at Halewood from about
1,100.
These cuts are in addition to the short-time working announced earlier this
week, which means the plants will effectively work a three-day week
throughout October.
Compulsory redundancies appear inevitable at Ford for the first time,
although the company offered an alternative tough package to the trade
unions including a six-month delay in pay increases to make the redundancies
voluntary.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Rolls-Royce sheds 950 more car jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars is cutting a further 950 jobs, or nearly a third of
the workforce, at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire.
The heavily loss-making luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering
group, said sales of its Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars had fallen by 65 per
cent in the past 18 months.
The company said the drop in sales, under the impact of the 'unprecedented
length and depth of economic recession', had taken place in all its main
markets.
The latest round of redundancies should be completed during December, and
will have cut the workforce of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars UK to 2,100 from 4,850
at the end of 1990. The company said compulsory redundancies appeared
inevitable.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said yesterday that the latest
cuts would cost about Pounds 12m in exceptional charges during the second
half of the year.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would make a 'substantial trading loss' this year,
Sir Colin said. The trading loss in the first half of the year was Pounds
10m to Pounds 15m against just below break-even in the first half of last
year. In the whole of last year it made a trading loss of about Pounds 30m
as well as suffering exceptional losses of about Pounds 32m for the
re-structuring and last year's job cuts.
The remaining Rolls-Royce Motor Cars workforce worldwide of about 2,400 has
been cut from 5,300 18 months ago, said Sir Colin.
The latest jobs reduction was 'required for the future of the business' and
was 'designed to reduce operating costs during a time of continuing
uncertainty and difficult trading in all major markets'.
Sir Colin claimed that the break-even level of the beleaguered Rolls-Royce
and Bentley car business will have been cut to about 1,400 cars a year by
the end of the year from 2,800 in 1990.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars sales have plunged from a peak of 3,300 in 1990 to
1,723 last year, and Sir Colin forecast sales for the whole of this year at
just 1,250 and 1,350. Retail sales worldwide dropped in the first six months
of this year to 681 from 890 in the first half of last year. The company's
market in Japan in particular has collapsed this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and Russia have agreed to take the first steps towards repairing their
bilateral relations, badly damaged by President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt
cancellation of his planned visit to Tokyo this month.
Mr Michio Watanabe, Japanese foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his
Russian counterpart, agreed in New York that their deputies should resume
discussions as swiftly as possible over the future of four Russian-held
islands off the northern tip of Japan, so as to pave the way for Mr Yeltsin
to reschedule the trip.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister, said Mr Yeltsin might
visit Tokyo at the end of this year or early next.
The two foreign ministers agreed to sanction the talks on the islands, known
in Japan as the northern territories, during discussions at the UN. The
islands, known in Russia as the Kuriles, were taken by Soviet troops at the
end of the second world war.
Japan insists it will not offer Russia bilateral economic aid until the
dispute on the islands' sovereignty is settled.
Russians blamed Japanese intransigence over the islands for Mr Yeltsin's
decision to cancel his visit.
Japanese officials argue that this was an excuse to disguise the domestic
political pressures which they believe forced him to remain in Moscow.
Mr Watanabe assured Mr Kozyrev that a conference on western aid to Russia,
due to be held in Tokyo in late October, would not be jeopardised by the
dispute.
Mr Watanabe insisted Japan did not feel isolated in its approach to aid to
Russia.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Climax in Kanemaru political saga near
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE public tug-of-war between Mr Shin Kanemaru, so-called kingmaker of
Japanese politics, and prosecutors investigating his receipt of Y500m
(Pounds 2.36m) from a trucking company linked to organised crime appeared to
be nearing its climax yesterday, writes Charles Leadbeater.
His lawyers, who have been negotiating with the Tokyo prosecutor's office in
the past few days, are reported to have delivered a written statement in
which he admitted receiving the money from Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the
president of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Mr Kanemaru's lawyers have wanted to avoid
him appearing in court to face formal charges that the donations violated
political funding laws.
If the prosecutors are satisfied the statement acknowledges his guilt, it is
expected Mr Kanemaru will be summarily indicted and fined Y200,000 without
having to appear in court.
That would lessen the public humiliation of the case, which could yet mark
the nadir of his political influence and spark what could be a destabilising
power struggle within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The case forced
Mr Kanemaru's resignation as LDP president on August 27, but he still wields
enormous power in the party through his influence at the head of its largest
faction.
The prosecutors allege that Mr Kanemaru asked Mr Watanabe to give him the
money just before the election of February 1990. It was then distributed
among 60 candidates of the LDP's Takeshita faction, say the prosecutors.
Mr Kanemaru admitted his office received the Y500m, but said it was simply
'goodwill money' and not in breach of the Political Funds Control Law, which
stipulates that a company can donate no more than Y100m to one party.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Inchcape and Peugeot link to lift Japan sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMOBILES Peugeot, the French car maker, has joined forces with Inchcape,
the British trading company, in an effort to boost car sales in Japan.
The two companies said yesterday they would invest more than Y2bn (Pounds
9.8m) in Peugeot Japon, which imports Peugeot cars into Japan. The two will
hold equal shares in the company.
Inchcape is the world's largest independent car distributor, although this
will be the company's first direct involvement in car importing and
distribution in Japan.
The deal follows a plunge in sales of Peugeot cars in Japan. They are
expected this year to be under 2,800 units, against a peak of 5,414 in 1990.
Unless sales pick up sharply, Peugeot will have difficulty supporting the
180 Peugeot showrooms in the country.
Signs of friction have emerged recently between Peugeot and Suzuki Motors,
which sells Peugeot cars in its dealerships. Peugeot and Rover last month
ended an agreement under which Rover distributed Peugeot cars through its
dealers in Japan.
Peugeot is hoping to capitalise on Inchcape's experience in car
distribution, as well as its extensive marketing experience in Japan in
other product areas.
The two companies will hold equal shares in Peugeot Japon, but it remained
unclear whether stakes in the company would be retained by minority Japanese
shareholders, including Suzuki, Seibu Motors and Nissho Iwai. Discussions
with the companies are continuing.
Mr Derek Whittaker, Inchcape group motors director, said the aim was to
improve performance of the existing network of dealerships, and no expansion
was envisaged.
He had begun discussions with Suzuki on how to rationalise the network to
increase sales and profitability.
The move to bolster Peugeot sales comes when sales of Volkswagen-Audi cars,
which together have 22.5 per cent of the import market, have been severely
disrupted.
Yanase Motors, Japan's biggest dealer in imported cars, has decided to stop
selling Volkswagen-Audi cars from next year.
Mr Philip Mead, Peugeot Asia Pacific director, said: 'We are there to attack
the market and take market share from German manufacturers'.

FIVE Latin American banana producers have asked Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt
director-general, to intervene in their row with the EC over import curbs on
bananas from the region.
Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela want the EC to
scrap its plan to raise import barriers to 'dollar' bananas as part of its
single market programme.
They claim the plan would cost them up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 292m) in
export earnings and flout Gatt rules against discrimination between trading
partners. They say it runs counter to proposed farm trade reforms in the
Uruguay Round that would scrap all import quotas in favour of tariffs.
The EC proposals, yet to be endorsed by ministers, would replace national
curbs with a Community-wide quota on banana imports. Latin American bananas
would also face a 20 per cent tariff, with costlier bananas from Lome
Convention members entering duty-free.
The Latin Americans are using a procedure urging the director-general to
resolve a poor country's grievance against a rich one. He has two months to
try to solve the row.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 300m (Pounds 175.4m) joint venture agreement between Lucchini, the
Italian steel-maker, and the Huta Warszawa steel mill is set to go ahead,
after an overwhelming vote this week by the plant's employees to approve the
scheme.
The deal with Poland's most important quality-steels producer is the first
big foreign investment in eastern Europe's steel industry.
The local authority where the mill is located has voted to end its
opposition to a land settlement accompanying the venture. This fulfils the
last condition Lucchini had set for signing the agreement.
The deal foresees a Dollars 200m modernisation plan for the mill, to be
followed by a further Dollars 100m investment in its rolling mill. The aim
is for the plant to produce 600,000 tonnes of quality steels a year.
The vote this week by 99 per cent of the 4,700-strong workforce signified
acceptance of a phased wage-rise scheme offered by Lucchini which would
almost double the present Zloty 2.2m (Pounds 88) average monthly wage by the
end of next year.
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate which
concentrates on private-sector investments, is providing Dollars 37.2m in
loans and Dollars 5m equity in the project.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is providing a further
Dollars 37.2m loan; another Dollars 79.2m is to be provided by SACE, the
Italian trade insurance corporation.
Poland has not supplied any weapons or military spare parts to Russia this
year, Mr Jan Straus, the Polish government's top arms-trade official, said
yesterday.
The arms sales ban followed Russia's failure to pay for Dollars 244m worth
of deliveries last year. Poland sold another Dollars 140m worth of military
equipment to other countries in 1991, Mr Straus said.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UN set to approve Iraqi asset seizure

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council appears certain to approve, perhaps as
early as next week, a western proposal to seize a large sum in frozen Iraqi
oil assets abroad to fund humanitarian relief and compensate victims of the
invasion of Kuwait.
Diplomats said last night that no one had a reliable estimate of the amount
involved - mostly assets in the US - but sums between Dollars 200m and
Dollars 1bn or more were mentioned.
The US is leading the effort and some sources said it appeared to be yet
another 'get tough with Iraq' exercise motivated by the current presidential
election campaign.
Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, said Britain supported the move and hoped
the Security Council would approve it within a few days.
The money raised would go into an escrow account under tight UN control.
The US move follows the failure of persistent efforts by UN negotiators to
complete agreement with Baghdad for the sale under strict UN control of up
to Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil to help meet the world body's heavy
expenses under the Gulf ceasefire resolution.
Following a closed-door meeting yesterday the Security Council again decided
that Iraq had done nothing to justify lifting or modifying sanctions. The
world body reviews the situation every 90 days.
Iraqi assets proposed for seizure would pay for food and medicines for needy
Kurds and, among other things, compensate foreign workers expelled by
Baghdad after the imposition of UN sanctions.
All of the funds would come from oil sales completed or in progress when
international sanctions were applied against Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait.
Sir David Hannay said after the meeting that this was not a case of
expropriation.
The assets would be restored to Iraq once it complied with the relevant UN
resolutions.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Asia-Pacific group embraces the inevitable: Apec's loose
form gets a permanence that reflects region's growing integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER UNGPHAKORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group is beginning to think big.
Washington sent only a low-powered delegation to the group's fourth annual
meeting in Bangkok this month. Although ministers from Apec's 14 other
members were not entirely happy, they made sympathetic noises about the Bush
administration's electoral preoccupations; Mr James Baker had left the State
Department and was running Mr George Bush's presidential election campaign,
while Ms Carla Hills, US trade representative, was said to be tied up with
her daughter's wedding.
But the ministers carried on regardless, agreeing on the creation of an Apec
secretariat in Singapore with a maximum budget of Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.2m)
in its first year and pressing ahead with exploratory plans for regional
trade liberalisation.
A small group is to prepare a blueprint for trade and investment
co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region to the year 2000. It will report to
Apec ministers at next year's meeting in the US and economic co-operation
could eventually spill over into political and security issues.
With the decision to site its secretariat in Singapore, the loose gathering
that spans the Pacific and includes some of the world's largest and
fastest-growing economies is about to become a permanent institution. The
choice of Singapore also establishes Apec's heart in the Association of
South East Asian Nations (Asean), whose six members (Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), were at first afraid of
being swamped by Apec's large members.
Apec covers the US, Canada, Japan, Korea, the 'three Chinas' (China, Hong
Kong, Taiwan), the Asean states, Australia and New Zealand. It encompasses
two existing free trade agreements (US-Canada and Australia-New Zealand) and
two more that have just been agreed (the North American Free Trade Agreement
and the Asean Free Trade Area).
Enthusiasm for Apec has waxed and waned. No trade barriers have fallen and
no action has been taken on proposals to harmonise standards or exchange
university students. The Australian objection to US wheat export subsidies
is only the latest area of trade friction.
But a sense of inevitability has started to creep into its proceedings as
Apec has passed through successive stages of development and as some of its
exploratory projects have begun to take shape.
Although they have strong trade and investment ties with other parts of the
world, in particular Europe, an Apec study* completed last month shows that
the group's economies are integrating faster than the global trend.
Members are able to hold regular consultations on economic and trade issues
because they share common concerns - such as a desire to see the
multilateral Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
completed rapidly and the Gatt system strengthened.
Apec has shown no signs of becoming a belligerent trade bloc, partly because
the region is no longer so apprehensive about the single market turning the
EC into a closed trade bloc.
Rather than envisaging it as a trade bloc, some Apec members are beginning
to talk of regional liberalisation as a tool for encouraging a step-by-step
further lowering of trade barriers globally, a view that appears to fit Mr
Bush's 'strategic network'.
Reaffirming their commitment to the Gatt system, Apec ministers called for
the Uruguay Round to be completed within this year and for the draft
agreement compiled by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, to be 'the
key document' for reaching a conclusion.
Singapore, the site of the secretariat, is now poised to become the nerve
centre for computer networks that will offer Apec members easy access to
regional trade and investment data. Some are talking about standardising and
digitalising customs and other business documents that could be transmitted
through these networks, greatly increasing the convenience of trade in the
region.
Australia, under whose initiative Apec was created in November 1989, has
retained the role of pace-maker. Last week the Australian foreign minister,
Mr Gareth Evans, successfully urged Apec ministers to press ahead with the
exploration of regional trade liberalisation.
There are, however, still members who would prefer to go slow. Within Asean,
Malaysia is now willing to participate fully in Apec, but still prefers its
own version of regional co-operation, the East Asia Economic Caucus, that
would exclude the North Americans and possibly Australia and New Zealand.
Kuala Lumpur envisages these groups forming 'concentric circles', preferably
with Asean at the core.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian international trade and industry minister, also
questioned last week whether Mr Evans was being realistic in suggesting some
kind of common market across an ocean as vast as the Pacific.
With Mexico likely to be the next to join Apec, largely through its
membership of Nafta, some South East Asians are concerned that the balance
could be tilted to the east Pacific. Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian foreign
minister, made a point of arguing that Papua New Guinea might be a more
suitable candidate for Apec membership.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Canadians warned on Nafta
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA may have greater difficulty attracting both foreign and domestic
investment following the creation of a North American free trade agreement
(Nafta) area, the Conference Board of Canada concluded in a study published
yesterday.
The study, based on a survey of 240 companies with operations in Canada,
says the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact has already altered the investment
relationship between the two countries. Patterns are likely to change
further as the recently concluded North American trade agreement is phased
in, the study adds.
Canadian companies are giving a higher priority to business opportunities in
the US, while US subsidiaries in Canada are having to fight harder to
justify their survival in a more integrated North American market.
'With the increased focus on the US market, a decision by Canadian firms to
manufacture in the US and now Mexico is a distinct possibility,' the
Conference Board, an economic forecasting and lobby group, says.
The board notes that high production costs, which are one of the most
commonly cited drawbacks to doing business in Canada, are likely in future
to be as important in domestic companies' investment decisions as they are
for foreign investors.
Many of the foreign-owned plants in Canada were set up to cater exclusively
for the domestic market at a time when local manufacturers were protected by
trade barriers.
But free trade has increasingly led companies to view the US and Canada as a
single market.
However, the board says that US subsidiaries in Canada, which make up the
bulk of foreign investment, will survive only 'by carving out and justifying
their existence as an integral component of the company'.

THE African National Congress (ANC) and the South African government last
night agreed that their leaders should hold a peace summit within days to
pave the way for the resumption of talks on a post-apartheid constitution.
After 10 days of negotiations, the two sides agreed late yesterday that the
summit should be held at the weekend. Mr FW de Klerk, the president, and Mr
Nelson Mandela, ANC president, would be the main participants.
Agreement was reached after the two sides resolved the issue of the release
of political prisoners, including three ANC members involved in terrorist
attacks. It was understood that the three would be released shortly.
The summit is likely to focus on measures such as action to contain violence
emanating from single-sex township hostels, the banning of weapons in
public, and the issue of an amnesty for government security officers, as
well as the question of ANC mass protest actions leading to violence.

<TEXT>
ALL PARTIES to the Middle East peace talks agreed yesterday to return for a
further month-long round of negotiations in Washington, starting on October
21, despite earlier concerns that discussions would have to be adjourned
until some time after the US presidential election on November 3.
The agreement was seen by all sides as confirmation of their commitment to
keep pressing for progress in the talks, despite failure to reach any
significant breakthrough in the latest round of Israel's bilateral
negotiations with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
During the latest talks, the first since the election of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's
new Israeli government in June, hopes were raised that Israel and Syria were
close to reaching an initial agreement on their dispute over the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
But these hopes evaporated after both sides had refused to shift from their
essential positions. Syria still insisted that it win back the entire Golan,
while Israel stuck with its demand for assurances of peace before making
territorial concessions.
Israel and the Palestinians agreed to set up working committees to work
towards setting up an interim period of Palestinian self-government in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But they have yet to agree fully the terms for negotiating an interim
settlement.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Civil war overhang threatens Angola poll: Julian Ozanne
reports on the country's chances of a peaceful transition to democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S year-long transition to peace and democracy is being marred in the
final days of campaigning before the country's first multi-party elections
next Tuesday as underlying violence, built up during 16 years of civil war,
boils over.
Several incidents in the past week have revealed the potential for violence
in a transition programme whose remarkable success so far has astounded most
observers.
Minutes before President Jose Eduardo dos Santos arrived to campaign in
Huambo on Tuesday, government soldiers, egged on by a flag-waving mob,
opened fire on two supporters of Unita, the former rebel movement which is
challenging the ruling MPLA. The incident happened the day after Unita
troops had seized 11 anti-riot policemen, burnt three cars and took control
of the airport in Cuito after alleging that the MPLA was trying to
assassinate Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader.
At least a dozen people have been killed in other clashes between the two
sides in the past seven days across the country.
'It is true that sometimes Unita has over-reacted,' Mr Salupeto Pena, a
senior Unita official, said yesterday. 'But there are many more incidents of
successful co-operation between Unita and the MPLA and the process is
holding together well despite the tensions.'
'Nobody thought we would get this far without major bloodshed,' said a
western diplomat. 'It's an amazing achievement.'
The peaceful unfolding of the electoral process has been helped considerably
by the belief by each side that it is going to win the elections. Much of
the credit for the success of the transition also goes to the United
Nations, which is observing the process, and to the MPLA, which has
consistently refrained from responding to Unita provocation. In Huambo
President dos Santos has specifically ruled out taking violent action to
return Cuito airport to government control and called on his supporters to
remain calm.
President dos Santos's western-style campaign stresses stability and the
goal of unifying Angola's fractured tribal society. A former Marxist who
broke with communism in 1990, he has successfully exploited the fears of
many Angolans, especially in the towns, that Mr Savimbi is a power-hungry
human rights violator and a racist whose victory next week would throw
Angola into a period of witch-hunting and instability.
With the help of several million dollars of government funds and a slick
Brazilian public relations company, Mr dos Santos has cultivated the image
of a soft-spoken, well educated family man gently leading his country to a
new but certain future.
In contrast, Mr Savimbi looks aggressive, arrogant and threatening. He has
failed to make the leap from authoritarian guerrilla leader to peacetime
politician capable of rising to the challenge of national reconciliation.
His inflammatory rhetoric and veiled threats against white and mixed race
Angolans, 'enemies and foreigners' have alienated many educated Angolans.
Mr Savimbi has, however, struck a chord in his attacks on the abysmal record
of the corruption-ridden MPLA in the economy, education and health of a
country which could be one of Africa's richest.
Whether the campaigns of the two men will make much impact inroads on a
society expected to vote along tribal lines is dubious. The real worry is
whether the violent tensions will explode once the results are announced and
one of the parties is defeated.
Church leaders and the United Nations yesterday appealed for calm ahead of
Angola's first multi-party election next week, Reuter reports from Luanda.
'We have to avoid further tragedies in this country. There have been too
many tragedies,' UN special envoy Margaret Anstee told reporters.
The leader of Angola's Catholic church, Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento,
urged President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to do
everything possible to ensure their followers maintained the peace.

<TEXT>
THE South Korean government yesterday proposed a 26 per cent increase in
spending on economic development, which includes support for small and
medium businesses.
At the same time, the Bank of Korea predicted that economic growth this year
would be the slowest since 1981.
The government's 1993 budget sharply curbs defence spending growth in order
to fund expanded infrastructure projects that will relieve the country's
congested transportation networks.
The 9.8 per cent rise in defence spending, which accounts for a quarter of
the national budget, is the lowest rise since 1985. Defence spending is
normally an important component of the South Korean budget because of the
military confrontation with North Korea. The 1993 budget is set to increase
by 14.6 per cent to Won38,050bn (Pounds 28bn).
Significantly higher spending is planned for small and medium-sized
businesses, education, science and technology, and infrastructure projects.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Court pitches Collor's fate into Congress
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor's fight for survival moved into the political
arena yesterday, the Brazilian Supreme Court having closed all possibility
of delaying the Congressional vote next week on whether he is to face an
impeachment process.
His last hope of winning more time to defend himself was dashed on Wednesday
night when six of the nine court judges rejected his appeal. The court also
ruled that the vote will be secret, a further blow to Mr Collor.
He was described by aides as 'shaken'. He might be out of office - suspended
from duty during the process - as early as next Tuesday.
The president is increasingly isolated and his only remaining chance is to
prevent the opposition mustering the two-thirds (336 members) of the House
of Representatives needed to initiate an impeachment process. Mr Etewaldo
Dias, his spokesman, admitted: 'We have lost the legal battle. We now have
to win in the political arena.'
The Supreme Court ruling was welcomed by the opposition and described by Mr
Ibsen Pinheiro, chairman of the House, as 'a victory for Brazil's
institutions'. Large street celebrations were held in several Brazilian
cities.
The financial markets reacted positively to the news, which could mean a
rapid end to the four-month crisis. The main Sao Paulo stock exchange index
closed 11.9 per cent up yesterday after very heavy trading.
Pro-impeachment demonstrations suggest public opinion is heavily against Mr
Collor but he claims to have enough Congressional support to survive. The
opposition argues that it has 360 votes - more than enough to win.
Mr Collor's chances have been weakened by the court decision. He has
suffered a further blow with the suspension by a federal judge of all
spending by the Banco do Brasil Foundation, a state-owned funding agency.
This has been one of the president's main sources of funds for securing
Congressional support. Over the last two months, the foundation has granted
99 spending requests from politicians.
Legal suits are also in hand to suspend the president of the national
savings bank, one of Mr Collor's main political allies, for alleged use of
social security money for political ends.
Mr Roberto Jefferson, a key member of Mr Collor's so-called 'shock
battalion', said the government's strategy would now be obstruction. The
pro-Collor forces could move their Congress members out of Braslia in an
attempt to make meetings inquorate.
Mr Jefferson met Mr Collor yesterday to demand a cabinet reshuffle. Accusing
Mr Celio Borja, justice minister, and Mr Francisco Gros, central bank
governor, of 'stabbing Collor in the back', he said, 'either we govern with
loyal people or we won't win the vote.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Third world vexed over future of aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries have come away from the annual meetings in Washington
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank deeply anxious over
their prospects for future aid flows from the richer nations.
Thrust offstage by the currency market turmoil that has dominated the
meetings, finance ministers of the developing world have watched in
bewilderment and some bitterness as their wealthier colleagues squabbled
over who was most to blame for the crisis.
Third world ministers who have painfully dragged their own budgets out of
persistent deficit have been particularly galled by the failure of
industrial nations to face up to their own budget deficit problems.
Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday echoed the gloom felt by
many of the developing countries which are his institution's customers:
'They need help. It's important that they not be expected to bear the burden
of adjustment in the rich countries as well as in their own.'
Sounding despondent and at times angry, he criticised the industrial
countries for repeated failure to live up to their promises - on the
reduction of protectionism in the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; on the 'Earth increment' in aid
promised to the developing world to help in environmental protection; on the
next injection of funds into the International Development Association
(IDA), the World Bank arm which provides loans at concessional interest
rates to the poorest countries.
World Bank officials are now pessimistic about the prospects for the 10th
replenishment of IDA funds, which should start to take effect next June.
Donor countries have committed themselves to match in real terms the level
of IDA 9, which would require 13bn special drawing rights (Pounds 10.9bn),
the basket of reserve currencies used by the IMF and the World Bank, spread
over three years.
But a meeting of high-level officials from IDA donor countries last week
failed to agree on the replenishment. World Bank officials say openly that.
when it comes to specifying each donor's share of the pot, they will back
away from their promise.
'Today there is a serious doubt that we can reach the objective of SDR13bn,'
said Mr Ernest Stern, World Bank joint managing director. 'If we do not
achieve our objective, it is going to be very painful, with consequences for
those on the ground.'
Mr Preston said the most worrying aspect for his institution of the currency
crisis was its effect on aid flows from industrial countries to the
developing world. Once-generous donors such as Sweden, which last week
announced a budget retrenchment package in response to fierce market
pressure on its currency, have had to cut their aid budgets.
The package is expected to bring a cut of perhaps 10 per cent in Sweden's
SKr14bn (Pounds 1.47bn) aid budget, and the country has given up, at least
for now, its target of increasing aid to 1 per cent of gross domestic
product from 0.9 per cent in 1990.
Less generous countries, such as the UK and the US, whose official
development assistance amounts to barely 0.25 per cent of their GDP, are
expected to cut still further.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy grew sluggishly in the second quarter, revised figures from
the Commerce Department confirmed yesterday.
Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.5 per cent, rather
than the 1.4 per cent earlier reported. This was the fifth successive
quarter of slow growth, following a contraction of output in the winter of
1990-91.
The sluggish overall growth reflected a slight fall in personal consumption
spending and a deterioration in net exports, offset by a higher investment
expenditure and a rebuilding of corporate inventories.
The price of gross domestic purchases - a broad measure of inflation - rose
at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent compared with 3.1 per cent in the first
quarter, confirming that inflationary pressures remain moderate.
Separate figures for state unemployment insurance claims, published
yesterday, showed a 15,000 increase to 414,000 in the week to September 12,
another sign that labour markets remain weak.

THE US should allocate at least Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn to help industry
adapt for commercial use advances made in the Dollars 22bn federal
laboratory system, according to a report by the private sector Council on
Competitiveness.
'The superb array of expensive facilities, equipment and instruments' of the
government laboratories, as well as their scientists and researchers, could
be 'intensively utilised by and for the private sector,' said Mr Erich
Bloch, former director of the National Science Foundation. He presented the
report yesterday to the House committee on science, space and technology.
The laboratory system is a microcosm of the broader US competitiveness
problem, he said. It is still geared to the Cold War, rather than the
current era of intense international economic competition.
'The federal government should launch national technology infra-structural
projects that strengthen US industrial competitiveness and foster
co-operation among industry, universities and the federal labs,' he said.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Senate overrides family bill veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democrats in the US Senate, with some Republican help, yesterday
overrode President George Bush's veto of the family leave bill, the latest
in a growing line of election-year confrontations between the legislature
and the executive.
The 68:31 vote, just over the required two-thirds majority, may not be
sustained in the House of Representatives, which had passed the bill by 27
votes, less than necessary to negate the veto. During his term, Mr Bush has
used the veto 31 times without rebuff.
The bill itself would require companies with more than 50 employees to give
up to 12 weeks' leave for home care in the event of childbirth or other
family need. Mr Bush, who vetoed the bill late on Tuesday to minimise
publicity, has countered with a proposal to give companies tax credits to
meet such eventualities.
The Republican emphasis on family values, though less of a feature of the
election campaign now, was an open invitation to the Democrats to find an
issue which could be turned to electoral advantage. Mr Bush had vetoed an
earlier family leave bill in 1990.
Sensing a shift in the prevailing mood, Mr Bush has now been obliged to
support the concept of mandated family leave, but has argued that the bill
would place unnecessary financial and regulatory burdens on companies.
This is not the only popular issue by which the Democrats are trying to put
the president on the defensive in the six weeks before the election. The
Senate has already passed, by a margin large enough to override a veto, a
bill designed to stop price gouging in the cable television industry. Mr
Bush has already indicated he will try to kill it.
Clauses to allow abortions for poor women have also been written by
Democrats into at least two other bills, again inviting a veto, as exercised
in the past by a president now more than ever intent to shore up his
conservative base.
In the defence bill, individual senators and congress members are moving
might and main to keep military installations in their districts from the
budgetary axe. Mr Bush may attack this as quintessential pork-barrel
politics, but has himself engaged in the same by showering federal largesse
on the defence industry and farmers.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Croatia tightens grip on south-west Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIA yesterday moved to consolidate its grip over south-western
Bosnia-Hercegovina by signing a military alliance with the Bosnian
government.
The alliance coincides with fresh moves by President Franjo Tudjman to end
the United Nations mandate in Croatia so that Croatia can regain control
over its territory.
At present UN peace-keeping forces in Croatia are located in three sectors
seized by Serb forces last year. The Croatian press has recently stepped up
a campaign against the UN, accusing it of consolidating Serb gains in the
republic, and preventing Croat refugees from returning to these sectors.
But UN officials said yesterday the ethnic tensions in the sectors prevent
the refugees from returning. They added that if the UN forces withdrew,
Croatia could be plunged into another war.
Military experts in Belgrade yesterday said Croatia was now heavily armed,
despite the UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia.
However Mr Goran Hadzic, leader of the militant Serbs in sector east, the
UN-protected region in eastern Croatia, yesterday said his forces would
never live in an independent Croatia. He also vowed to fight until it was
united with Serbia.
The military alliance with Bosnia, drawn up last June by Mr Tudjman, was
signed by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic in an attempt to defend its
territory against Serb forces which have already seized large parts of
eastern Bosnia, and have maintained a five-month siege on Sarajevo.
But instead of supporting the Bosnian/Moslem forces, as agreed in June,
Croatian units seized parts of western Bosnia and regions around Sarajevo,
and even prevented supplies reaching Bosnian troops.
As a result, Bosnian forces are now sandwiched between Serb and Croat army
units intent on dividing the republic between Croatia and Serbia.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Ethnicity stalks Romania poll: Virginia Marsh and Anthony
Robinson on elections this weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENTIAL and parliamentary elections in Romania this weekend will decide
the fate of domestic reforms and vitally affect prospects for stability
throughout the volatile Balkan region.
The prospects do not look good. The latest public opinion poll by Irsop, an
independent research company, indicates that the most likely outcome is a
parliament where intolerant nationalists will hold the balance between
conservative former communists and a shaky coalition of reformist democrats.
No clear winner is expected to emerge from the first round of the
presidential elections, where Mr Ion Iliescu, the current president, leads a
field of six candidates. (The run-off takes place in two weeks.) His
strongest challenger is Mr Emil Constantinescu, the rector of Bucharest
University. He represents the 'Democratic Convention' (DC), a loose,
18-party coalition of anti-communist reformers.
But the DC, which won power in Bucharest and many other big cities in local
elections last February, has fought a lacklustre campaign. It has been
unable to attract many rural voters, who make up 47 per cent of the
population, or gain sufficient support from industrial workers suffering
from rising unemployment, and lower real incomes.
Mr Iliescu, a former high-ranking communist official who mysteriously rose
to power after the execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator,
and his wife on Christmas Day 1989, is supported by the Democratic National
Salvation Front (DNSF). This is the rump party which emerged from a split in
the National Salvation Front (NSF), which won Romania's first post-communist
elections by a landslide in May 1990.
The NSF, led by Mr Petre Roman, the deposed former prime minister of the
first post-Ceausescu government, is now the standard bearer of International
Monetary Fund-supported market reforms. The rump DNSF retained the loyalty
of older-generation communists, including leaders of the secret police and
intelligence services appointed by Mr Iliescu after the formal dissolution
of Ceausescu's infamous Securitate network. He has also appointed loyal
followers to key positions in the judiciary, the state television and the
army. He appeals to ordinary workers and peasants traditionally suspicious
of Romania's westward-looking intelligentsia.
In recent months however, ultra-nationalist parties have chipped away at Mr
Iliescu's electoral base by stirring up deep-rooted xenophobic traditions.
Ethnic intolerance is especially strong in Transylvania, ruled by Hungary
until 1918 and home to most of Romania's 1.7m ethnic Hungarians. But gypsies
and Romania's exiguous Jewish and other minorities have also re-emerged as
traditional targets.
The estimated 2m gypsies are in a specially invidious position. Many
Romanians blame the gypsies for giving the country a bad name abroad and
making it difficult for Romanians to get foreign visas. This intolerance is
likely to worsen following Germany's decision to repatriate 43,000
Romanians, of whom 60 per cent are gypsies, only days before the election.
Recent weeks have seen a surge in support for Mr Gheorghe Funar, the rabidly
anti-Hungarian mayor of Cluj, the former capital of Hungarian-ruled
Transylvania, who has risen to third place in the polls with 14 per cent,
against 38 per cent for Mr Iliescu and 31 per cent for Mr Constantinescu.
If the polls are right, Romania's fragile democracy and market reforms could
be undermined by an opportunistic alliance between Mr Iliescu's DNSF and Mr
Funar's nationalists. This could reinforce a mirror-image rise of
nationalist fervour in Hungary, where the government is already under attack
for not properly defending the rights of 5m ethnic Hungarians in Croatia,
Serbia and soon-to-be-independent Slovakia, as well as Transylvania.
Such an outcome would alienate potential foreign investors and derail the
economic reform process just as it is starting to bring results. Under the
caretaker government headed by Mr Theodor Stolojan, Romania has set up much
of the legal and institutional framework needed for privatisation and a
market economy. It has earned praise from the IMF for sticking to tough
budgetary and other parameters. A new IMF interim lending arrangement has
been agreed, pending finalisation after the elections.
Recent months have seen a sharp growth in exports and a rapid expansion of
the private sector. This has not been enough to counteract a 50 per cent
drop in industrial production since 1989 or stem a fall in real incomes of
more than 20 per cent and rising unemployment, which is uppermost in the
minds of many voters as they go to the polls.

PEACE mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen today fly to Banja Luka, seat
of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia, to investigate reports of
growing tension and intimidation of Moslems and Croats.
The two said they were 'deeply concerned' about reports 'indicating a
build-up of tension, bomb incidents, and intimidation with the potential
threat of violence and the development of an ethnic cleansing campaign'.
They urged both the Bosnian Serbs and the rump Yugoslavia to take immediate
steps to reduce tensions in the area.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the two mediators, said Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed to join Mr Vance and Lord Owen in Banja
Luka. Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, had pledged his
'complete co-operation' with the investigation.
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the International
Committee of the Red Cross, both of which have staff in Banja Luka, said
yesterday that tension in the town had been rising for some weeks.
Mr Fernando del Mundo of the UNHCR said a bomb had exploded at the Banja
Luka hotel last Monday and there had been another bomb incident on Tuesday.
He had no information on casualties. Many non-Serbs had already left Banja
Luka for Croatia, often under duress.
Mr Claude Voillat, spokesman for the ICRC, said the town was 'very tense'.
The ICRC has a 10-strong delegation in Banja Luka which is trying to
negotiate the evacuation of Serb-run camps in the area, including Manjaca
and Trnopolje with about 4,000-5,000 prisoners.
Aircraft flying out of Banja Luka, the main airbase, have recently been used
to bomb the eastern city of Visegrad, the northern town of Brcko, on the
Croatian border, and the eastern Bosnian town of Tomislavgrad.
When the Yugoslav federal army withdrew from Bosnia in May it left 24
aircraft.
Bosnia's Serbs also have 24 helicopters which are used for re-supplying Serb
forces. The helicopters can carry anti-tank missiles.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Germany charges spy with treason
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Germany yesterday charged communist spymaster Mr Markus Wolf with spying and
treason for running at least 12 agents against Bonn during the cold war,
including one who brought down Chancellor Willy Brandt, Reuter reports.
The prosecutor's office said Mr Wolf, who headed East Germany's spy network
from 1953 to 1986, had up to 600 agents in West Germany.
Germany's constitutional court has yet to rule whether Bonn can try East
Germans for espionage, since they acted within the laws of a sovereign state
and did much the same work as West German spies.

Fears of radioactive leaks from nuclear submarines scuttled by the Soviet
military appear to be unfounded, writes Bronwen Maddox.
A Norwegian-Russian team has been sampling water between Finland and Russia
where it is believed the Soviet navy dumped radioactive parts from up to 12
nuclear submarines and three ice-breakers in the 1960s. Norwegian and
Finnish fishermen have feared leaking radioactive waste could contaminate
fish.
The European Community yesterday signed a new convention to fight pollution
in the Baltic, one of the world's dirtiest seas, together with the countries
which discharge waste to it.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Canal unites great rivers of Europe: The North Sea and Black
Sea are linked amid trade hopes and environmental fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY an age-old European dream is to become a reality: a canal is to open
which will link the Rhine and Main rivers in the north of Europe to the
Danube in the south - thus connecting the North Sea and the Black Sea.
This was a dream of Charlemagne 1,200 years ago, and of subsequent Holy
Roman Emperors. With an appropriate sense of occasion, the opening will be
celebrated in grand style - but not without a note of discord.
For as some 2,000 guests assemble this morning in the Nuremberg
Meistersingers Hall for a musical celebration, the Bavarian Green Party is
hoping to field a demonstration of several hundred opponents on the square
outside.
And as the guests float down the canal later in the day in a flotilla of
boats to celebrate the formal opening in the presence of German President
Richard von Weizsacker and Mr Gunter Krause, the federal transport minister,
the aggrieved Greens will be following a similar route in their mini-buses,
with the view of staging a second demonstration later in the day.
Fans of the project, among the most prominent of whom is Bavarian President
Max Streibl, who will be hosting today's proceedings, say that the 171km
stretch of canal from Bamberg to Kelheim will do more than provide an
impetus to Bavaria's economy.
They talk in grand terms about a waterway, twice as long as the Panama canal
and longer than Suez, which will bring east and west closer together in
troubled times for Europe.
It has taken more than 30 years to build, at a cost of over DM6bn (Pounds
2.3bn). Building work was halted during Mr Helmut Schmidt's time as
chancellor, on the basis that the project was woefully uneconomic, and
revived again only after Mr Helmut Kohl came to power in 1982.
'A monument to godlessness,' is how one Bavarian pastor described the
project this week. Another critic, Mr Christian Magerl, Green party
spokesman on the environment in the Bavarian parliament, says that the canal
is a 'pure prestige object'.
He objects to the canal first on environmental grounds: it runs through what
used to be unspoilt countryside and it will alter the water-table, to the
detriment of Bavaria's flora and fauna.
Second, he believes that the canal is economic nonsense. 'It will compete
with the train system and not the Autobahns, which is stupid,' he says. 'And
the canal operators' expectations of 10m tonnes of cargo every year are
hopelessly ambitious.'
Mr Magerl believes that cargo will amount to no more than 3m tonnes a year -
a level at which the project will not even cover its running costs, he says.
While a wondrous thing, the new waterway is by no means as smooth and simple
as, say, the Rhine. For one thing, there are 59 locks on the Main and in the
canal, slowing traffic considerably. Also, the Danube flows faster than the
Rhine. A voyage from Linz to Rotterdam will probably take 10 or 11 days
compared with a guaranteed 42 hours by rail.
There are stretches of the Danube - in Germany below Regensburg, in Austria
above Vienna in the Wachau and along the Slovakian-Hungarian border - where
the water is occasionally too shallow for navigation. This rules out the
establishment of regular liner services and the use of the waterway for
just-in-time deliveries.
Clearances beneath some bridges on the Danube are so low that containers can
only be piled two-high. Rhine operators feel they need to pile containers
four-high to be profitable, and they are plying a much shorter, more densely
populated stretch of water than the Danube. Similarly, long strings of
barges can be put together on the Rhine, but not on the twisting Main or
through the new canal locks.
If these obstacles ensure that the amount of traffic going all the way from
Rotterdam to Romania will be limited, the canal seems certain to provide a
boost to Austro-German trade. The Austrians estimate that nearly half of the
traffic on the canal will be related to their country - either raw materials
coming from Rotterdam to the big steel and chemical plants at Linz or
industrial components and semi-finished products moving up to German
factories from Austria for final assembly.
Austrian officials expect the build-up of traffic on the waterway to be
gradual and to depend on a number of factors, such as reliability and how
the railways react to this new competition.
Hungary also hopes that the canal will boost trade with Germany, already the
country's largest trading partner. The Transport Ministry estimates that
traffic in Hungarian goods on the Danube, currently about 1.5-2m tonnes,
will rise by up to threefold.
As a condition, Hungary is pressing ahead with port renovation and an
entirely new facility at Gyor in the west of the country.
Hungary also sees the canal as insurance that the country will still be able
to import oil from Rotterdam even if the pipeline through the former Soviet
Union as well as that through Yugoslavia is cut off.
Meanwhile at Constanta, the ancient Black Sea port where the poet Ovid spent
his last days in miserable exile, the cranes stand idle.
Hopes are high in Romania that the opening of the canal will revive the
port, which handled only 28m tonnes of cargo last year, less than half 1989
levels, and strengthen the country's ties with the west.
Although Nicolae Ceausescu, the country's former dictator, spent more than
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the hope of making Constanta the world's third
largest port, and personally oversaw the building of a 65km canal to link it
to the Danube, the port still needs investment of some Dollars 200m to be
completed.
Worse, trade has fallen victim to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
with the United Nations embargo on trade with Serbia likely to cost Romania
Dollars 3bn this year alone.
The only shipping now passing through Constanta on to the Danube each week
is two or three convoys of barges carrying raw materials to Romanian ports
such as Galati, the steel town.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Russian reforms facing biggest test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WORLD Bank report on Russian economic reform, under discussion by the
bank's board, stresses the need for tight monetary policy - to which the
Russian government has again committed itself.
The report pays tribute to the government's ambitious programme of
macro-economic stabilisation and to the remarkable patience of the
population in tolerating the harsh consequences of reform, but says the
commitment to reform will now be severely tested as the scope for relatively
painless adjustments has been exhausted.
The report notes:
Inflation for 1992 is expected to be 2,200 per cent.
Oil production has declined by 1m barrels a day each day for the past two
years and may fall even more rapidly. Investment of Dollars 25bn may be
required over the next decade to arrest the decline. The government has
inherited a vast, loss-making industrial structure. The financial structure
is wholly inadequate for the tasks of reform, with much lending neither
competitive nor market-based. The central bank has neither the staff nor the
authority to force the (commercial) banks to comply with its mandates.
There are great difficulties in implementing policy, exacerbated by a lack
of trust within the civil service between reform-minded officials and those
who have seen their power and prestige diminish as a result of the reforms.
The report estimates the government's external financing requirements for
1992 at about Dollars 22bn (Pounds 12.8bn), and says that two-thirds of this
must come from export credit agencies and from international financial
institutions.
However, it warns that failure to set clear priorities in the allocation of
scarce financing may ultimately jeopardise the success of the reform
programme.
The drop in production - estimated by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime
minister, to have fallen by 27 per cent in the year to last month  - has not
so far resulted in substantial growth in unemployment, the report says.
'Economic decline has rather been reflected in declining labour productivity
rather than growing unemployment. . . the next phase of economic reforms, if
they are to be effective, will have to address the problem of labour force
restructuring.'
The report also says that it will be extremely difficult to bring inflation
down to the 10 per cent a month target agreed with the IMF, and says the
programme would still be successful if it took longer - up to two years - to
reduce inflation to single-digit levels on a monthly basis. The rouble
slipped to an all-time low on the Moscow interbank currency exchange
yesterday, trading at 248 to the dollar compared to 241 on Tuesday, Reuter
adds.
Meanwhile the Russian cabinet yesterday agreed to big wage increases for 15m
public sector workers, notably poorly paid doctors and teachers.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Capital flow study takes EC by
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US call for a study of global capital flows and their impact on the
world monetary system caught European policy-makers by surprise yesterday,
although it is likely to be taken up in the months ahead.
It emerged yesterday that the proposal - made in a speech on Wednesday to
the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund by Mr Nicholas Brady,
US treasury secretary - had not been discussed with European finance
ministers during the past weekend's monetary meetings in Washington.
It is understood that Mr Lamberto Dini, chairman of the Group of 10 deputies
which Mr Brady has asked to carry out the study, only learned about the US
plan after returning to Italy from Washington yesterday.
However, European nations are certain to examine the idea of the study,
which Mr Brady has sought in his present capacity as chairman of the G10.
That does not mean that it will be easy to come to joint conclusions. It is
also uncertain whether it could be completed in less than a year.
The events of the past two weeks - when short-term capital movements have
challenged the parity of the French franc and overwhelmed central bank
defences in Italy, the UK and Spain - have led some European policy makers
to consider ways to regulate somehow the flows on a more lasting basis than
the temporary re-imposition of capital exchange controls, as in Spain on
Wednesday and in Ireland and Portugal yesterday.
'There has to be a rethinking,' said one senior European monetary official.
'These flows cannot be allowed to undermine our economies.'
The G10 - embracing the G7 (US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Canada and
Italy) plus Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden - now has 11 members since
Switzerland's entry.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: US and Japan shy from investing in
UK - Falling profits put pressure on institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors in Japan and the US have been expressing caution
about UK investments amid the currency turmoil.
Although some in the US see advantages from the floating of sterling,
Japanese fund managers in particular said they had become more wary of
investment in UK financial markets.
Mr Eiji Arima, manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Life Insurance, said
the company is 'negative about investment in the UK' until it returns to the
European exchange rate mechanism.
'We think it will take a long time for the UK economy to recover. We will be
watching the currency situation closely and hope that it will be settled
quickly,' he said.
The souring of Japanese investor sentiment comes after a surge of interest
in UK securities last year, when net purchases totalled Dollars 14.5bn, up
from Dollars 1.95bn in 1990.
Net purchases of UK securities, mostly bonds, accounted for 19.9 per cent of
all Japanese purchases, behind only the US, which accounted for 21.3 per
cent.
Mr Arima said sudden currency fluctuations intimidate Japanese institutional
investors, some of whom have suffered large currency losses in recent years.
Meanwhile, the slowing of the Japanese economy and sharply falling profits
have put extra pressure on institutions to take no risks this year.
Mr Shinpei Kawate, investment strategist at Yasuda Trust and Banking, said
investors are interested in longer-term bonds, but there is 'a real fear
that the monetary order will change dramatically' in coming weeks.
'We have to exercise great discretion in case sterling or the German mark
fall suddenly. It's not only the UK, but all of Europe. We are waiting to
see how far interest rates can be cut,' Mr Kawate said.
'Germany will probably cut rates some time in the near future, and other
European countries will follow. We will watch for the timing, as it will
make long-term bonds attractive.'
Many US fund managers are pessimistic about the impact of ERM withdrawal and
lower interest rates on UK prospects. Mr William Holzer, who runs the
Scudder Global Fund in New York, has not changed his opinion in light of
sterling's withdrawal from the ERM or the cut in interest rates.
'My view is that the domestic part of the economy, those companies that sell
their products within the UK . . . their prospects remain bleak over the
long term because of insufficient reinvestment in the physical UK economy.'
As for the future, 'with everything in a state of flux', Mr Holzer remains
extremely cautious about investing in the domestic UK economy.
He does not believe the devaluation of sterling will be a great help: 'If
devaluing was the route to economic prosperity, Brazil would be very
successful and Argentina not far behind.'
A sharply different view of the UK came from Mr John Hickling, international
portfolio manager at Boston-based Fidelity, the largest fund group in the
US. He was bearish about the UK until very recently, primarily because he
never believed the ERM would work.
'Since early 1990 my opinion has been that it would be extremely difficult
to maintain a system with economies at such divergent points in the economic
cycle.'
Consequently, he was 'extremely pessimistic about the UK from an earnings
standpoint because of the arbitrary, deflationary system' that was the ERM.
Now that sterling has been taken out of the ERM, however, and UK interest
rates lowered, Mr Hickling's opinion on prospects for investing in the UK
has changed. He says: 'The UK now, fundamentally speaking, has done what
needed to be done. Lower interest rates, freedom from the yoke of German
monetary policy and a weaker currency are all positive for corporate profits
and earnings in the UK.'
Since last week Mr Hickling has been considering rearranging his portfolio,
moving from the purely defensive positions he has been holding in utility
stocks into interest rate sensitive and early cyclical sectors, such as
financials (especially insurance companies and brokers), health and
house-hold companies and housebuilders.
Sterling's weakness, however, poses a problem for dollar investors like Mr
Hickling, but because Fidelity's management policy has always been not to
hedge against currency movements, there is nothing he can do about it.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Japan weighs the good and the bad of
rising yen - Banks stand to gain, but much else will suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVEL agents in Tokyo's Ginza shopping area were doing a brisk trade
yesterday afternoon as Japanese tourists eagerly counted the falling cost of
an autumn holiday in the US.
Tourism apart, however, the yen's rapid rise against the US dollar - which
fell to a post-war low yesterday of Y120.25 - could cast an additional
shadow over a Japanese economy which is flagging under the burden of
stagnant consumption, deep cuts in corporate investment, falling profits and
a banking system riddled with bad debts.
The yen has risen as investors have retreated from Europe's turbulent
currency markets, confused about the prospects for monetary co-ordination
and worried about the prospects for growth in Germany. The Japanese are
repatriating funds to seek a safe haven.
However, the yen's strength is not simply a side effect of the currency
turmoil in Europe and nor is it likely to fade quickly.
The yen has strengthened 10 per cent against the D-Mark since the start of
September and by 5 per cent against the US dollar, according to Mr Paul
Summerville, senior economist at Jardine Fleming Securities.
The consensus among Tokyo analysts is that the dollar could weaken to Y115
and possibly fall as low as Y105. The outlook for the US economy is still
uncertain in the run up to the presidential election in November. However,
many industrialists and financiers in Tokyo believe the Japanese economy
crossed a watershed with the announcement last month of a Y10,700bn (Pounds
52bn) emergency government spending package. At the least, that has given
the economy a breathing space which could last a couple of months.
The prospect of a stronger yen will fuel speculation that the Bank of Japan
may further cut its official discount rate which was lowered by half a point
to 3.25 per cent in July. The Bank has insisted it will only cut rates
further if it judges that the domestic economy needs to be stimulated, not
as part of a concerted international effort to encourage growth.
The Bank's problem is that the domestic economy will be clouded by a
sustained rise in the yen. The authorities will have to weigh the costs and
benefits it will bring to different sectors of the economy.
Exporters could be hit severely. Many medium-sized manufacturers claim they
need an exchange rate of Y120 to Y125 to break even. Large Japanese
manufacturers invested heavily in plants overseas in the late 1980s and so
are better placed to deal with a yen appreciation than they were in 1985
when they were much more dependent on exports.
The domestic economy is in such a weak state, however, that exports have
been one of the few sources of growth. The authorities will not want it
killed off.
The case for an interest rate cut to restrain the yen will be strengthened
by three other factors. The appreciation amounts to a tightening of monetary
policy at a time when money supply growth is minimal. A strong yen will
create more downward pressure on inflation, thereby raising real interest
rates and hindering the banks efforts to deal with their bad debts. The
government will soon have to decide how to finance its rising spending; if
it borrows heavily interest rates could be pushed up.
However, the authorities may not want to take too much of the steam out of
the yen.
A resurgent yen would help to curb Japan's politically sensitive ballooning
current account surplus which grew by 94 per cent to Dollars 56.2bn in the
first six months of the year as import demand fell away and manufacturers
turned to exports.
The biggest beneficiaries from the yen's appreciation could be the banks,
which are at the heart of the economy's weakness. The fall in stock and
property prices has eroded the equity base, as they have been hit by a
rising tide of bad debts on loans made to customers who got caught by the
puncturing of the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s. Investment,
especially by small and medium-sized companies, and consumer spending is
unlikely to revive until banks are in better shape to lend, pumping more
liquidity into the economy.
Indeed, Japanese financial institutions may have brought funds home as a
precaution while they assess their bad debts in preparation to disclose a
revised figure next month.
The yen's strength could help the banks in two ways. First, the prospect of
cuts in interest rates could underpin the recent stock market rally which
yesterday took the Nikkei average up 327.23 to 18,609.95. With the Nikkei
above 18,000, banks should have enough capital to meet their Bank for
International Settlements requirements for capital adequacy ratios and so
could contemplate renewed lending.
Second, a large portion of Japanese banks lending is in the US, denominated
in dollars. A rise in the yen against the dollar is an automatic
strengthening of bank balance sheets for the purposes of their US
operations. That means they will be under less pressure to raise new equity
as the base for their Japanese operations.
According to Mr Summerville: 'With the Nikkei at 18,000 and the dollar at
Y120, all but one of the banks should be home.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Paris holds the fort on the franc -
William Dawkins wonders how long economic rectitude will be tolerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEAR and doubt have been part of currency speculators' motives for hammering
the French franc in recent days.
They appear to doubt that the unpopular French government can maintain the
virtuous economic policies of the past decade and fear that the franc's link
with the D-Mark will snap as a result - despite assurances from the
Bundesbank, the Banque de France and most economic analysts that the
franc/D-Mark parity is justified by France's past economic performance.
There are, however, questions over French economic policy, even if the risks
of deviation are slight by the standards of some of less economically stable
neighbours.
The national divisions exposed by the Maastricht campaign and the very
narrowness of France's 'petit oui' for European union do not just imply
popular dislike for the treaty. They also indicate discontent with the human
costs of the government's policies of competitive disinflation, which are
exactly in line with the treaty's criteria for monetary union.
So France's close call over Maastricht invites the question of how much
longer its electorate will tolerate rigorous monetary and economic policies
and how the government might respond to this pressure.
France has for eight years suffered among the highest rates of unemployment
 -a record 2.9m or 10.3 per cent in July - in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the main blight on an otherwise
resilient economy.
This is partly a consequence of successive governments' rigid adherence to
competitive disinflation and maintaining the franc/D-Mark parity, policies
which leave almost no room for stimulating the domestic economy in hard
times.
Despite the government's entreaties to industry to show more optimism,
output rose by a mere 1.25 per cent in real terms in 1991, according to the
OECD, and should rise just 2 per cent this year. Even that will be hard to
achieve, given that the latest survey from Insee, the state statistics
institute, reports that growth practically ground to a halt in the second
quarter of this year.
The big reward of French government's monetary and budgetary rigour has been
one of Europe's lowest inflation rates. France's annual inflation, currently
at 2.7 per cent, dipped below Germany's in June 1991 for the first time
since the early 1970s and looks set to hold that advantage.
Just how tough has been the control in the money supply is underlined in the
latest figures for bank credits, up 4.7 per cent in France in the first six
months of the year, as against 11 per cent in Germany over the same period,
according to Credit Lyonnais.
All this has fed through to significant gains in industrial competitiveness,
with hourly wage costs 16 per cent below those in Germany. The reward has
been a sharp improvement in the trade balance, with a surplus of FFr19.35bn
(Pounds 2.2bn) in the first eight months of this year, against a deficit of
FFr29.6bn for the same period in 1991.
Some of this has been due to a one-off surge in export demand from German
unification, as underlined by the fact that France's trade account swung
sharply into a FFr3bn deficit last month from a FFr6bn surplus in June. Even
so, the French government is convinced that there is a real improvement in
industrial competitiveness which will bring lasting gains on export markets.
So far, successive governments have held the line, helped by a more or less
solid consensus on economic policy. But last weekend, the political
establishment received a slap in the face from the provincial electorate,
which complains that the elite - whether in Paris or Brussels - is out of
touch with its concerns.
The shadow of legislative elections next March and a possible snap
presidential election can only increase the temptation for political parties
to deviate from the stern economic line of the past.
The evidence against this happening, at least on the interest rate front,
has been encouraging in the past few days. A U-turn by Mr Michel Sapin, the
finance minister, is the prime example. He hinted last week that a Yes to
Maastricht might open the way to lower French interest rates. But he did not
hesitate to raise them on Wednesday when needed to defend the franc, even if
it meant appearing to go back on his word only three days after the vote.
'As far as French interest rates are concerned, the sky is the limit. France
is not like the UK. It will not let itself be beaten by the speculators,'
argues Mr Bernard Godement, senior French economist at Nomura Research
Institute.
On budgetary policy, the outlook is less clear. Here, France is still a good
pupil, but the record has slipped fractionally. The government has pledged
to keep the budget deficit this year well below the 3 per cent of gross
domestic product ceiling set out as a criterion for monetary union in the
treaty. The OECD believes the deficit will come out at around 2.3 per cent
of GDP this year. But it is on a rising trend, due mainly to the fall in tax
revenues caused by the economic slowdown, but also to the government's need
to spend on pressing social problems, such as job training for the
unemployed and farmers' support.
Until two years ago, the Socialist government had trimmed the deficit by
FFr10bn or so a year, following the trend of the previous Gaullist
administration. Since then, the deficit has crept up again, from 1.4 per
cent of GDP in 1990 to 1.9 per cent last year, when it hit FFr131.7bn, well
over the government's initial target. It could reach FFr150bn-FFr180bn this
year, according to official and market estimates.
The final figure will be known when the government tables its 1993 budget on
September 30, a week late because of the turmoil in the currency markets.
That could well give the markets the information they need to come to a more
stable valuation of the franc.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: London thrives as biggest
foreign-exchange centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON has continued to build up its position as the world's biggest
foreign-exchange trading centre but its business is shifting to non-dollar
currency trading and the forward markets, the Bank of England said
yesterday.
Reporting on a survey of foreign exchange activity in April this year, the
Bank said total average daily turnover in spot and forward transactions
increased to Dollars 303bn (Pounds 177.1bn), some 62 per cent higher than at
the time of the previous survey in April 1989.
London accounts for about 30 per cent of global foreign-exchange turnover of
about Dollars 1,000bn a day. The US markets are the second most important,
handling Dollars 192bn in currency transactions daily for a rise of 49 per
cent over the three years, while the Japanese market ranks third with
Dollars 128bn turnover, up 10.8 per cent.
The survey found that the bulk of activity in London continues to be in
trading sterling against the US dollar and in the D-Mark against the dollar.
But while the dollar/D-Mark trade showed little change in market share since
1989, moving up slightly to 23 per cent from 22 per cent, sterling-dollar
trading fell sharply to 19 per cent of total turnover from 27 per cent.
Trading involving the D-Mark and currencies other than sterling grew over
the three-year period.
In another shift, the share of total turnover accounted for by spot business
fell by 14 per cent to 50 per cent of the total, reflecting a big jump in
the market share of forward trading to about 50 per cent.
Forward trading volumes grew by 125 per cent from Dollars 65bn in 1989 to
Dollars 146bn in 1992, while spot trading advanced 24 per cent to Dollars
147bn from Dollars 119bn. The main factor behind the expansion of forward
trading was the growth of the swap market.
The Bank surveyed 352 banks and investment houses and 13 brokers for its
survey. It found activity had become more heavily concentrated among big
players, with the 10 most active organisations holding a combined market
share in London of 44 per cent compared with 35 per cent for the top 10 in
1989.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Pointing a finger is pure
speculation - James Blitz and Emma Tucker on who brought Europe's currencies
down
</HEADLINE>

AFTER the unprecedented turmoil on the foreign exchanges in recent weeks,
politicians and popular newspapers are baying for blood.
In Britain, Italy and Spain, politicians and central bankers are pointing
accusing fingers at the speculators in the banks for forcing their
currencies into humiliating devaluations.
As the French franc battled against devaluation this week, Mr Michel Sapin,
the French finance minister, warned that during the French revolution
speculators were beheaded.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor has described the 'huge speculative
flows' that drove the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism as a
'whirlwind'.
Foreign exchange analysts maintain that this is too simple a view of the
market. 'The foreign exchange market involves everybody from people going on
holiday to government pension funds,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, research head at
Swiss Banking Corp in London.
'The number of people who can be involved is enormous and the idea that it
was just speculators at the banks causing all the problems last week is
utter rubbish.'
There is little doubt that some interbank dealers have made big profits from
the recent devaluations. It has been in the dealers' interests to sell
sterling, the lira and the peseta when the currencies were at their floor
levels in the exchange rate mechanism, forcing a devaluation. The dealers
could then buy the currency back for less money at the devalued rate, and
make a profit on the difference.
But bank dealers say that such speculation formed only a small part of the
recent trading in European currencies, and that strict guidelines limit the
amount by which they can speculate. Mr Peter Wood, Barclays finance
director, said: 'Barclays has strict prudential position limits, agreed with
the Bank of England, that control our ability to take risks in the markets.'
Foreign exchange analysts believe there are three other types of investors
who, through the banks which operate on their behalf in the foreign exchange
markets, in effect forced sterling, the lira and the peseta to devalue in
recent days.
Corporate treasurers, who took fright and sold the currencies as devaluation
loomed. UK importers, for example, would have wanted to protect themselves
from the greater costs of a sterling devaluation by buying D-Marks.
This was potentially a big movement of funds. It is said by critics of the
way in which the foreign exchange markets operate that only 5 per cent of
transactions carried out daily reflect underlying movements in trade between
countries, while the rest is pure speculation. But one London-based analyst
disagreed, saying that the 5 per cent did not take into account the boom in
currency hedging by big corporations since the mid-1980s.
The huge fluctuations in the dollar/D-Mark rate in the 1980s encouraged
companies then to buy forward contracts and swaps to protect their trading
positions. 'This dealing puts the figure for corporate-based trade in the
market at 20 per cent,' he says.
Pension and investment fund managers in the US, Europe and Japan, an even
bigger group of players, who have developed big currency exposures in the
last five years. These institutions can have a much bigger potential impact
on the foreign exchange market than the interbank dealers. A currency
dealing room at a leading foreign exchange bank will have tens of millions
of pounds with which to buy currencies in the market on a daily basis. But a
big pension fund is able to move funds into different currencies to the tune
of billions of pounds if it so wished.
These investment funds invested heavily in currencies with the globalisation
of the securities market in the mid-1980s. They bought currencies to hedge
themselves against the risk that their underlying assets would lose their
value with currency movements. Although they take a long-term view of the
markets, the big funds, especially in the US, were widely reported to be
selling sterling in huge quantities last Wednesday.
A broad range of investors around the world who bought currencies such as
sterling and the lira in the mid-1980s for speculative reasons. The
currencies had high interest rates attached and were believed to be an
increasingly safe bet as the European Monetary Union project developed and
inflation rates converged.
Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Bank in London, estimates
that Pounds 40bn to Pounds 50bn worth of short-term capital flowed into the
UK between 1985 and 1992 from investors attracted by high UK interest rates.
Britain's entry into the ERM, which tied sterling to the D-Mark and heralded
the prospect of lower inflation, encouraged the investors further.
This investment in the pound was massively reversed this summer. A fund
manager at a large US bank has pointed out that Middle East and Far East
clients were becoming increasingly worried about sterling ever since
devaluation started to be mentioned by backbench politicians in the UK as
early as June.
'If only 20 per cent of those who had bought sterling pulled their money out
of the UK last week that would have accounted for the selling of Pounds
10bn,' said Mr Brown.
The big winners in the sterling crisis according to Mr Brown, were not the
interbank dealers, but these short-term investors in sterling.
'By buying the pound in the 1980s, they got a high return on the investment.
When the Bank of England bought sterling last Wednesday, it in effect
allowed these investors to get out of the currency without incurring any
losses.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SIEGE mentality grips the Breydel, the ultra-modern building in the centre
of Brussels and home of the much reviled, much misunderstood European
Commission.
As the dream of a centralised European union of 12 states built around the
Maastricht Treaty has faded, the Commission's 12,000 staff fear they have
become the whipping-boys of the European Community. At best, they admit, the
glorious 1980s when the Commission reached the peak of its power will not be
repeated for a long time to come.
This week, many of the Commission's fears were confirmed when German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl launched a fierce attack on the Brussels bureaucracy.
Citing European public opinion, he said Brussels was 'too powerful,
constantly expanding, and exterminating national identities'.
Mr Graham Meadows, an expert on regional policy who has worked for 17 years
at the Commission, says the scale of criticism is becoming unbearable. 'It
is getting to the point where you are putting the Community in jeopardy; all
this criticism is sapping the institution's confidence.'
Mr David Williamson, secretary general of the Commission, the top job in the
Brussels bureaucracy, is less apocalyptic. But he agrees that ever since
Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European political and
monetary union last June, it has suited friend and foes alike to single out
the Commission as a power-hungry, centralising technocracy.
The result, he says, is that the Commission is exercising restraint. All
legislative directives are on hold to check whether they are really
necessary. The Commission's workload has dropped sharply.
Elsewhere Mr Pascal Lamy, the powerful chief of staff to Commission
president Jacques Delors, has asked all EC member states to send in examples
of Commission meddling.
Yet Mr Williamson, who used to advise Mrs Margaret Thatcher on Europe when
she was British prime minister, correctly points out that it is not the
Commission but the member states themselves who usually put forward the most
controversial proposals - and who introduced 94 per cent of all legislation
in 1990. And, he stresses, it is the member states themselves who bear the
ultimate responsibility for passing the legislation through the European
Council.
So why is the Commission suddenly in the firing line? It has long suited EC
ministers to blame Brussels when they have had to compromise or lose in
Council debates; this tendency increases in hard economic times.
Mr Meadows argues that weaker European leaders have become expert at 'laying
off' blame for their own domestic problems. 'That's why the British have
blamed the Germans for the devaluation of the pound,' he says.
The big loser in the current blame game is Mr Delors, the architect of the
1992 single European market and the driving force - along with Mr Kohl and
President Francois Mitterrand of France - behind the Maastricht Treaty. No
one should count Mr Delors out; he is too much of an intellectual force and
bureaucratic in-fighter to be written off.
But as one senior EC official said recently, Mr Delors was only as strong in
the 1980s as the member states allowed him to be.
Now that the public in key nation states such as France, Germany and Britain
are having second thoughts about Maastricht and the pace of European
integration, Mr Delors, and the Commission, are much weaker than the popular
rhetoric might suggest.

FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sweden acts to shore up shaky
financial system
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government will introduce legislation this autumn designed to
protect the country's financial system and secure credit supplies, it
announced yesterday.
With Sweden's banks facing estimated credit losses totalling SKr90bn (Pounds
9.5bn) over the next five years, contingency action by the state is seen as
vital to safeguard their activities.
The legislation will involve a state guarantee to underpin commercial banks
and their subsidiaries and also other credit institutions, including the
building societies which have a government affiliation.
The Finance Ministry said the aim was to reassure households, enterprises
and other holders of claims that their finances will be safe, by creating a
framework for the functioning of the banks and their subsidiaries. The cost
of this rescue plan has not been revealed.
'The aim is to secure credit facilities and make it possible to finance
housing', said Mr Bo Lundgren, tax minister. 'It will also strengthen
overseas confidence in the whole of the financial system.' The government's
commitment would remain as long as necessary and when it was phased out it
would be done in such a way as not jeopardise the interests of creditors, he
said. Housing interest rates fell yesterday as a result.
The proposals reflect government anxiety at the continuing deterioration in
the position of Sweden's financial sector. Three days ago Standard and
Poor's, the US credit agency, placed 13 of Sweden's leading financial
institutions under review for possible downgrade.
The state has already been forced to intervene this year to save Nordbanken
with SKr20bn worth of grants and guarantees and Forsta Sparbanken with
SKr7.3bn and more recently the Gota Bank, a rescue plan for which is still
being worked out.
The government is worried that other banks and financial institutions will
also need financial support in the coming months if they are to avoid
collapse. Mr Lundgren said that he did not rule out direct state ownership
of a bank if this was necessary.

With support of the main opposition Conservative and Progress Parties, Mrs

FT  25 SEP 92 / Carsberg tells life houses to make 'daunting' reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, the director-general of fair trading, yesterday gave the
life assurance industry a 'daunting shopping list' of reforms it should
carry out if it wanted to head off tighter regulation.
He said at Chartered Insurance Institute meeting in Preston, Lancs: 'There
should be a shift in competition away from who gives the best commission to
who gives the best value to the customer.'
His remarks come amid speculation that the Office of Fair Trading will call
for much tighter regulation on disclosure of charges when it advises the
government on the competition implications of the Securities and Investments
Board's review of retail financial regulation. A decision is expected in the
next two months.
Sir Bryan's speech brought instant condemnation from the Association of
British Insurers, which said he had 'betrayed a lack of understanding about
how the insurance industry operates'.
Sir Bryan suggested that, to stimulate competition, 'league tables' should
be published showing the charges levied by different companies for
equivalent policies.
He also attacked the heavy penalties suffered by investors who surrender
endowment policies early. 'No other investments result in such heavy
automatic losses,' he said, calling for life offices to publish figures on
how many of their policies persisted to maturity. Sir Bryan also criticised
'front-end loading' of charges and commissions so that they are all paid at
the beginning of a policy.
'This gives inappropriate incentives,' he said. 'If commission depended more
on the maintenance of policies over their extended lifetime, salespeople
might give more attention to whether the policy fitted the needs of the
customer.'
The ABI said the proposals would damage independent advisers at the expense
of tied agents and direct sales forces. The Consumers' Association welcomed
Sir Bryan's speech, however, saying that the industry tended to blame
consumers for its own deliberate obfuscation.

At the same time, the Bank of Korea predicted that economic growth this year

The government's 1993 budget cuts defence spending growth to fund expanded
infrastructure projects that will relieve congested transport networks. The
9.8 per cent rise in defence spending, which accounts for a quarter of the
national budget, is the lowest rise since 1985.

GERMANY is headed towards a fundamental change in its economic policy that
will bring lower interest rates, International Monetary Fund managing
director Michel Camdessus said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
At the end of the IMF's joint annual meeting with the World Bank he said
that German interest rates were 'extremely high'.
To bring them down underlying policies must be changed, he said in an
apparent reference to the need for a tighter fiscal stance to relieve
pressure on monetary policy. 'We are headed in that direction,' he said.
Mr Camdessus rejected suggestions that capital controls were the answer to
the currency crisis. Spain and Portugal have taken such action this week to
shelter their currencies from speculative attack.
The IMF chief said that such moves were understandable but added that the
controls should be dismantled 'very rapidly' as the countries are obliged to
do under the European treaty setting up a single market.
He saw the risk that the use of such capital controls might spread but said
that should be resisted.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Lamont outlines post-crisis
agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC monetary policy will be guided by a range of traditional indicators
pending sterling's return to the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons last night.
The chancellor said that the existing annual target of between 0 and 4 per
cent for narrow money growth would be retained.
Other reference points would include broad money, asset prices and the
exchange rate itself.
The government would also 'continue' with its policy of fully funding the
public-sector borrowing requirement.
Mr Lamont promised 'shortly' to set out the precise policy guidelines that
the government would be pursuing in the wake of the disintegration of its
original strategy.
In a fighting speech designed to re-establish his authority before a packed
Commons, Mr Lamont sought to stress that this week's cut in interest rates
did not signify that the government was going soft in the fight against
inflation.
On the eve of today's meeting of the recently established public expenditure
committee at which options for hitting the government's Pounds 244.5bn
1993-94 spending target will be discussed, the chancellor also emphasised
that the struggle to impose tight public spending controls would be
maintained.
The main difference between the two leading political parties lay in
Labour's 'addiction to public spending,' he said, in a passage which was
particularly well received on the government backbenches.
Flanked by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, his
Treasury lieutenant, Mr Lamont laid out three conditions which had to be met
before sterling could resume its ERM membership.
These comprised: the easing of 'current tensions' in the markets; a 'proper'
review of 'the whole way the ERM works, including intervention rules,
co-operation procedures and obligations placed on those countries at the top
and bottom of their permitted bands; and convergence of the British and
German economies so that they were 'more in step'.
It was essential that Germany was able to reduce interest rates to levels
'more compatible with sustained, non-inflationary growth', he said.
In a lengthy attempt to justify his decisions of the past two weeks, the
chancellor concluded that he had 'not heard of anything that might have been
done or handled differently and produced a different outcome'.
To widespread opposition derision, he laid much blame for the speculative
turmoil which derailed sterling at the door of Britain's European partners,
saying that remarks made by Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
had 'triggered the final irresistible assault' on the pound.
The French referendum, he said, had 'given speculators a fixed date against
which they could speculate'.
The 'unique' event of German reunification had been 'the root cause of the
current turbulence.'
Concluding with a vitriolic attack on Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, he said his opposite number's idea of long-term strategy was
'thinking up the week's sound-bite a week in advance'.

yesterday after the company cut its dividend and announced Dollars 320m of

Continental, the 11th-largest US insurer in terms of property/casualty

It expected to take a third-quarter pre-tax charge of Dollars 120m from this
withdrawal and would also take a Dollars 200m charge from hurricane losses
and the cost of restoring its catastrophe reinsurance protection.
It aimed to lock in more than Dollars 100m of realised capital gains during
the quarter and would be cutting its quarterly dividend from 65 cents to 25
cents.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exchequer Levy cut lifts Anglia to Pounds
4.83m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIA Television yesterday announced a 58 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 4.83m, for the six months to the end of
June.
The growth came from the one-off reduction in Exchequer Levy for the last
year of the old ITV franchise system. Anglia's levy payment in the period
fell from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 732,000.
From January Anglia will begin paying to the Treasury Pounds 17.8m a year -
the bid that regained it the East of England licence - plus 7 per cent of
its advertising revenue.
Operating profit declined from Pounds 5.45m to Pounds 4.27m in the half
year. Expenditure on Anglia's own productions rose from Pounds 7.86m to
Pounds 12m
Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, singled out for praise its programmes such as
the Survival series, Fay Weldon's Growing Rich and the documentary adaption
of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time.
He said that after allowing for the increase in costs in both programme
production and acquired programmes, the operating profit was similar to last
year but below that of 1990.
He was confident of further programme commissions under the new competitive
ITV networking arrangements.
Anglia's advertising revenue was Pounds 53.4m (Pounds 52.2m), with its share
of ITV advertising increasing to 6.88 per cent thereby continuing a steady
upward trend.
Turnover totalled Pounds 67.2m, compared with Pounds 63.8m.
Earnings per share rose from 4.35p to 7.04p, and the interim dividend is
held at 2.86p.

the year.

15m.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TV-am at Pounds 9m despite reorganisation
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TV-AM, the breakfast television company that was outbid in last year's
tenders for new franchises, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
9.05m for the six months to June 30.
The outcome compared with Pounds 6.72m last time and was achieved despite
the depth of recession in the television advertising market. Turnover dipped
from Pounds 39.6m to Pounds 37.7m.
The profits rise reflected a reduction in Exchequer Levy and cuts in costs
as the company slowly runs down towards December 31 when it ceases to be an
ITV broadcaster.
However, reorganisation costs and the inevitable redundancies led to an
exceptional charge of Pounds 2.57m and the company warned that there would
be additional costs of a similar nature when it reached the end of the
franchise.
Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman, said: 'All our energies over the final months of
the franchise are committed to maximising revenue, minimising costs while
maintaining our commitment to the audience.'
The interim dividend is an unchanged 4p, payable from earnings of 8.2p
(6.5p) per share.
It is not yet completely clear what TV-am will do in future following the
loss of its franchise. It examined the possibility of bidding for the new
Channel 5 but decided not to go ahead. It did, however, win the franchise
for a new national commercial pop music radio station in a venture with
Richard Branson's Virgin group.
A number of other possible media investments are being assessed by TV-am, a
company that is likely to have a Pounds 50m pot of gold when it says goodbye
to the breakfast audience for the last time.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals behind decline at Telemetrix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER EXCEPTIONAL charges of Pounds 2.93m, Telemetrix, the electronics and
information systems group, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.47m
to Pounds 673,000 for the six months to June 30.
However, operating margins climbed from 6.9 to 8.3 per cent as turnover rose
to Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 41.7m) and operating profits advanced to Pounds
3.88m (Pounds 3m). Comparative figures have been restated to consolidate the
Zimbabwean operations.
The group is also listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange and 49 per cent
of its equity is owned by Altron and its chairman, Mr Bill Venter.
Some Pounds 2.3m of the exceptional item related to provisions against the
closure of the defence-related activities in the Trend subsidiary,
instigated by the new board as part of its restructure of the group. These
were secure communications and encryption businesses, which, given the
pressure on defence budgets worldwide since the Gulf war and the collapse of
the Soviet Union, had seen a sharp contraction of activity. The benefits of
the closure became effective on July 1.
The retained telecommunications services and test operations 'had underlying
profitability', said Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive.
GTI, the 65 per cent-owned data communications subsidiary in the US, doubled
operating profits to Pounds 3.2m on turnover up Pounds 7m at Pounds 27.7m,
helped by Valor, its networking subsidiary, which lifted its sales 68 per
cent to Pounds 15.6m.
With growth specially in the Far East, Zetex, the semi-conductor subsidiary,
also doubled profits - to Pounds 800,000 - on turnover ahead at Pounds 7m
(Pounds 5.9m). In Zimbabwe, where Telemetrix makes telecom and lighting
products, profits rose to ZDollars 4m (ZDollars 3.3m) on turnover of
ZDollars 13.1m (ZDollars 9.3m), but on translation after devaluation there,
there was a sterling fall to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 700,000) on turnover at
Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.8m).
Group debt was reduced to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4.8m), giving gearing of 23
per cent (28 per cent).
After tax kept high at Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 787,000) by the US and Zimbabwe
operations and minority interests at GTI of Pounds 995,000 (Pounds 556,000),
losses per share emerged at 1.6p (earnings 1.3p).

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Whatman edges ahead to Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHATMAN, the specialist paper and filtration equipment maker, reported a 3
per cent advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.5m, for
the half year to June 30.
Sales were unchanged at Pounds 25.9m but trading profit fell to Pounds 4.46m
(Pounds 4.63m) because of the impact of the weak dollar. More than 60 per
cent of sales are generated in North America.
Mr Hugh Perrott, finance director, said: 'There are signs of a steady US
recovery. We have made progress by increasing the number of sales staff in
the US and increasing investment in new products.'
Sales of gas generators and microfiltration devices benefited from the
increased investment.
Reorganisation costs of Pounds 727,000 related to the discontinuation of
manufacturing filter systems in the UK. After a Pounds 640,000 profit on the
sale of UK land that left an exceptional charge of Pounds 87,000.
Net interest income of Pounds 33,000 compared with a charge of Pounds
266,000. Borrowings were about Pounds 1m.
Earnings per share increased to 13.56p (12.83p). The interim dividend is
3.1p (2.9p).

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft warns of interim deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based lighting, home improvements and industrial
and medical textiles group, yesterday announced complete withdrawal from the
double-glazed windows and conservatories market and warned that pre-tax
losses for the half-year to end-September would be about Pounds 1m.
There will be no interim dividend (3.3p).
The share price, fell from 37p to 23p on the news but later recovered to
27p.
Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said yesterday: 'We are eliminating Pounds 2m of
losses and this has to be right.'
Two of the group's windows and conservatories businesses have been sold and
negotiations are under way to sell the other two. Mr Goold said this was
better for shareholders than closure because the buyers would assume
responsibility for future liabilities.
Whitecroft made Pounds 4.49m in the year to March 31, with operating profits
halved. It cut its final dividend to 0.7p, making a total of 4p, compared
with 10p in 1990-91.
'We said earlier this year that if consumers did not start buying
energetically again, we would take radical action. We are, however, quite
confident longer term.
'Our strategy is to concentrate on core businesses with growth potential. We
have been incurring costs up front, but benefits will flow later,' Mr Goold
added.
Goodwill of Pounds 23.8m associated with the sales will pass through the
profit and loss account. This had been previously eliminated against
reserves and will be shown as an extraordinary item, with no effect on
shareholders funds of about Pounds 40m.
Group borrowings on September 30 are expected to be about Pounds 38m -
gearing of about 95 per cent. Mr Goold said borrowings would fall back to
March's level of Pounds 36m next year as investment in its performance doors
business generated cash flow benefits.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dunloe House losses at IPounds 432,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealings in the shares of Dunloe House Group, the Dublin-based property
company, resumed yesterday following its inability to reach agreement on the
broadening of its equity base. The company is 77 per cent owned by Clayform
Properties.
The board had been attempting to achieve this by acquisition or the
injection of assets, but despite protracted discussions none of the
proposals was thought to reflect the value of the existing business. The
shares were suspended in January.
The company also announced increased pre-tax losses for the six months to
June 30 of IPounds 432,000 (Pounds 442,000), against IPounds 165,000. The
result included an exceptional charge of IPounds 257,000 being the provision
against a loss on the sale of two properties.
Turnover was IPounds 76,000 (IPounds 79,000). Losses per share were 2.43p
(0.93p).

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hampden warns of worsening trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hampden Group, the Belfast-based company which operates Texas Homecare
stores in Ireland through a franchise agreement, lifted profits to Pounds
202,000 pre-tax in the 24 weeks to June 13.
The increase from last time's Pounds 175,000 was achieved on turnover ahead
20 per cent to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 11.8m).
The Texas stores increased both turnover and profits, helped by a relocation
of the Bangor store in February and the reopening of the Galwally store in
April. Directors warned, however, that trading conditions in Northern
Ireland had 'noticeably worsened' since June.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.2p, payable from earnings of 0.91p
(0.77p) per share.
The shares are traded on the USM.
