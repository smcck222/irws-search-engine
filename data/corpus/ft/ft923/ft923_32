TURNER Broadcasting System (TBS), the US cable television group that owns
CNN, is forming a joint venture in Russia to seek what it claims will be the
first independent television station in Moscow.
A memorandum of understanding has been signed by TBS and the Moscow
Independent Broadcasting Company, (MIBC), a private Russian company.
Mr Sidney Pike, president of CNN International's special projects division,
is in Moscow to represent Turner interests in the 50-50 project, which will
be broadcast free over the air. Revenues will come from advertising.
Mr Pike said yesterday the plan depended on obtaining local government
approval for a broadcasting licence to use Channel 6, an existing VHF
frequency. Russian authorities have indicated they plan to award the licence
within the next four months, Mr Pike added.
Under an interim licence MIBC and Turner have been broadcasting two hours of
CNN International, translated into Russian, every day on Channel 6 since
May. Mr Pike said the joint venture channel would include CNN news, classic
films, sport, entertainment and children's programmes, broadcast mostly in
Russian.
Channel 6 is the last VHF frequency available in Moscow. A formal contest
will be held to decide who should be given the licence. Siemens, the German
engineering group, and Russian partners are jointly developing plans to
equip nuclear reactors in the former Soviet bloc with western monitoring
technology for added safety, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The aim is to improve the safety of 1,000-megawatt VVER pressurised water
reactors, the most modern reactors produced in the former Soviet Union. The
technology would be based on existing Russian systems and advances under way
in Russia and be enriched with Siemens knowhow.

THE Australian economy is likely to grow about 4 per cent in the year to
June 1993, after growing about 2 per cent in 1991-92, Mr Paul Keating, the
prime minister, said yesterday.
Forecasts suggest Australia's real GDP grew about 0.6 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1991/92, after growth of 1.4 per cent in the first three
quarters. The government seems to have abandoned hope that growth would
reach 4.75 per cent in the current year. The weakness of the recovery is
reflected in the unemployment level, up from 10.5 per cent in February to
11.1 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE SIX members of the Association of South East Nations yesterday sought to
ease tensions over the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea by
urging the countries involved to exercise restraint.
In a special declaration at the end of a two-day meeting in Manila, the
foreign ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - emphasised the need to resolve
arguments over sovereignty and jurisdiction 'by peaceful means, without
resort to force'.
They suggested the establishment of 'a code of international conduct over
the South China Sea' to be based on the principles of their regional Treaty
of Amity and Co-operation, and resolved to explore the possibility of
collaborating on maritime navigation, pollution control and anti-piracy
operations in the area.
The dispute over the Spratlys came to a head earlier this year when China
reaffirmed its claim to the entire archipelago and granted an oil
exploration licence to a US company in a zone also claimed by Vietnam.
Asked whether Asean regarded China as a bully, Mr Raul Manglapus, foreign
minister of the Philippines, replied: 'We have said China has its own
historical claims which we might reject in the light of 20th century
realities, but we have never said it's a bully.'
A decision to set aside the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys did not
mean that the countries concerned could not peacefully continue or even
reinforce their presence on the islands, he said.
For the first time since it was founded 25 years ago in the shadow of the
spread of communism in Indochina, Asean explicitly put the emphasis on
security concerns.
In another sign of the changing international climate, Vietnam and Laos were
yesterday granted observer status at future Asean meetings.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Sind crackdown holds key to Sharif's reforms: Investors are
growing nervous about Pakistan's immediate political future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is coming under
growing pressure over its handling of violence in the southern province of
Sind and as a result of a damaging split within the ruling coalition.
Though it has acquiesced to army requests for wider powers in the crackdown
on lawlessness in Sind, that seems unlikely to end political uncertainty.
The People's Democratic Alliance (PDA), the main opposition party led by Ms
Benazir Bhutto, has stepped up pressure by threatening to resign seats on
national and provincial assemblies in an attempt to force elections.
Some businessmen fear investment could be slowed because of nervousness at
the outcome of events in Sind, which is seen as crucial to the government's
future. This could put at risk the radical economic reform programme
introduced by Mr Sharif. The government insists, however, that reforms and
investment are on track.
Yesterday troops stepped up raids in Sind during a visit to the province by
Mr Sharif, in a search for suspects and illegal arms. They are operating
under broader powers of search and arrest, granted last Sunday, in a drive
against highway robberies and kidnappings for ransom. The powers allow the
military to carry out independent operations without assistance from
policemen.
This follow weeks of reported deterioration in civil-military relations
through the army's demand for wider powers. 'They (the army) are concerned
that wide-ranging corruption in the provincial police and administration is
making it difficult for them to arrest criminals,' a senior official said.
Last month, a key government ally in Sind, the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement),
a regional Moslem party and part of the ruling coalition, broke ranks from
the ruling party after torture cells allegedly run by the MQM were found in
an army crackdown.
Twelve MQM members resigned in protest from the 217-seat National Assembly,
and 23 from the 109-seat provincial assembly. Though Mr Sharif's ruling
coalition, the IDA (Islamic Democratic Alliance) still commands a majority
in the National Assembly, the provincial Sind government of chief minister
Muzaffar Hussain Shah has become vulnerable.
Mr Shah turned down an opposition demand to seek a fresh vote of confidence
and challenged the PDA to initiate a vote of no confidence if it wants to
force him out. The opposition has set a deadline of July 30 for Mr Shah to
prove his majority.
At the national level, too, there have been signs of a worsening in
relations between government and opposition. The PDA has said its members
would resign from assemblies after consulting smaller parties outside the
government, in protest against the ruling party.
The resignations are being considered as one option to force President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan to dissolve the assemblies and hold elections.
Mr Sharif responded by saying he would call by-elections to fill the vacant
seats.
Both sides are aware that any action potentially leading to a dissolution of
parliament carries the risk of inviting martial law, in a country which has
been run by military dictators for more than half its 45-year history.
Some government officials are concerned that the government is getting an
image of instability. 'Even if in reality we are firmly in place, we are
seen as weak and under pressure. That's not a good sign,' said one official.
But precipitate action to bring down the government seems unlikely: the
military wants to stay out of politics and senior army officers have
repeatedly given assurances that they have no intention to introduce martial
law.
Government officials also discount the possibility of presidential action to
dissolve parliament, on the grounds that Mr Khan and Mr Sharif share common
views on politics.
However the uncertainty appears to be taking its toll. 'Investors are
becoming nervous over the future course of politics and want to wait and see
the outcome of the latest round over Sind,' said one businessman. He added:
'We need some sense of stability to know that economic liberalisation
introduced during the past two years is going to remain intact.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Building freeze nearer in West Bank and Gaza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government is today set to entrench temporary measures taken to
stem new building in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, moving
closer to Arab demands for a complete settlement freeze and US conditions
for the release of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees to Israel.
Yesterday, the housing ministry confirmed that in addition to a temporary
freeze imposed last week on unsigned contracts for government-backed
housing, it had also this week ordered a halt to projects in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip where contracts had been signed, but construction work was
not yet in progress.
Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, and Mr Binyamin Ben Eliezer,
housing minister, will meet today to formulate the extent of a new building
freeze and review the possibility of halting some programmes where
construction is underway.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has avoided spelling out how far he is
prepared to go in freezing settlement activity. Although committed to
extensive curbs, he has tended to exclude settlements in the Golan Heights,
the Jordan Valley and the Jerusalem area which he classifies as 'security
settlements', against 'political' or ideological settlements.
However far it turns out he is prepared to go, there are strong pressures
other than the weight of US and Arab opinion pushing Mr Rabin towards deep
cuts.
The over-inflated housing programmes commissioned to cope with mass
immigration from the former Soviet Union by the previous government of Mr
Yitzhak Shamir demand radical measures to stem costs and over-supply. In
these circumstances, settlements in the occupied territories, where
relatively few Israelis and few immigrants want to live, are an obvious
target for the axe.
Finance ministry estimates put the cost of redeeming guarantees to
contractors to buy back unsold apartments at up to Shk4bn (Pounds 842m) 6 -
or about 5 per cent of the 1992 budget. With the US pressing Israel to
contain its fiscal deficits as a further condition for the loan guarantees,
it is the kind of expenditure that Mr Rabin has to control.
The attention on last week's initial building freeze focused on the occupied
territories. What was less noticed was that it applied to all new contracts
inside Israel as well. Only about one-fifth of some 60,000
government-commissioned units said to be under construction and about half
of the 5,000 contracts awaiting signature are in the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr Shochat and Mr Ben Eliezer will have to halt or curtail any building
projects inside Israel 'proper' as well as in the occupied territories. But,
given the political climate over the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza,
it is inevitable that these will bear the brunt of the cuts.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Bad blood flows after Japanese media coup d'etat: Fujisankei
ousts chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJISANKEI, one of Japan's biggest media groups, yesterday ousted its
chairman, provoking the unusual spectacle of a Japanese boardroom row being
conducted in public as well as a mutiny in the deeply conservative empire.
The departure of Mr Hiroaki Shikanai, 47, was described variously yesterday
by Mr Shigeaki Hazama, president of Sankei Shimbun, the 2m circulation daily
which is a main part of the group, as a 'duel', an act of 'self-catharsis'
and 'house-cleaning for Sankei'. Mr Shikanai, a banker before he became
chairman just two years ago, was given the job after marrying into the
founding family.
Mr Shikanai, who was first ousted from Sankei Shimbun and then resigned his
remaining group posts, at a press conference condemned the decision by the
newspaper's directors as 'illegal because it was unilaterally taken without
any specific reason'. While saying he was willing to meet the group board to
'avoid further confusion and turmoil', he added that he was contemplating
legal action.
Mr Shikanai owns key minority shareholdings in various parts of the
interlocking, privately-owned organisation, which also controls the Fuji
television network, a Tokyo radio station, and Pony Canyon, a music and
video cassette supplier which owned a quarter of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Music before he sold the division to Thorn EMI.
The fact that these holdings did not protect him signals the carefully
concerted nature of the putsch by fellow directors. Their troubles may not
now be over, though - Mr Shikanai is suspected to have been stake-building
in recent months by buying shares from family members. For example, his 6.8
per cent officially registered holding in Nippon Broadcasting, the radio
station, is regarded by some to be on the low side. Yesterday he said only
he would 'explore ways to develop and promote the group'.
His ousting came a month after Japan's gaudy popular press began chronicling
claims of his high-handedness - allegedly demoting those who displeased him
and demanding that his photograph in an in-house publication be made larger.
Yesterday such papers were describing him as a 'dictator' who 'rode the
company like a souped-up trail bike'. However racy, his management style had
no apparent ill effect on the group's trading performance. Fujisankei does
not publish profit figures, but sales have been on a steadily rising trend
and were up 8.7 per cent in 1991.
At the heart of the affair, although not made explicit by Fujisankei
directors yesterday, appear instead to be payments totalling Y1.7bn (Pounds
7.1m) which group companies made as a posthumous retirement allowance to Mr
Nobutaka Shikanai, his father-in-law, who died in October 1990. (Mr Shikanai
senior had adopted the younger man on his marriage and the death of his own
eldest son, and allowed him to take the family name before succeeding him as
chairman.) In response to observations that he would himself benefit from
such payments as an inheritance, Mr Shikanai insisted that the decision had
not been his personally, had been discussed within the group, and was in
accordance with its rules. He was outraged that he had been 'fired as if
involved in corruption'.
While not referring directly to the payments, Mr Hazama said it was
'inexcusable for anyone to use a corporation as if it is his own personal
property'. He added: 'A newspaperman is presumed to behave with special
responsibility vis-a-vis society. In this connection, Shikanai lacks the
qualifications to represent a newspaper.' Media professionals ascribed the
upheaval to Mr Shikanai's status as an outsider - his previous career was
with Industrial Bank of Japan. Professor Akihiko Haruhara of the journalism
school at Tokyo's Jochi University said: 'The problem for the group is that
a man who has nothing to do with journalism was placed in the top position.'
But back on the outside, Mr Shikanai, unless he is persuaded to part with
his stake of 12.6 per cent or more in Sankei Shimbun, may still be in a
position to cause headaches for the board.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Change in UK rebate outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday put forward options which could slightly
reduce Britain's future rebates on its EC budget contributions, but stressed
it was for the Council of Ministers to decide.
Since 1985, Britain has received back each year two-thirds of the net
difference between what it pays in and what it gets in return.
The Commission is not proposing any change in this 66 per cent rebate but
suggests a possible modification to how the gap is defined. This rebate is
paid in recognition of the fact that Britain, with slightly less than
average EC income per head, makes the second largest gross revenue
contribution while getting relatively little EC money back in the form of
price support for its small agricultural sector.
The current system could be maintained, the EC executive says, in which case
the level of the UK rebate, expected to total Ecu2.27bn (Pounds 1.6bn) this
year, 'would remain roughly the same in constant Ecu figures', despite the
planned growth in the EC budget over the next five years.
The Commission proposes two possible modifications. Any changes would have
to be decided by unanimity, thus giving the UK a veto.
One is to take out of the calculation of Britain's net budgetary gap
whatever the UK pays into the cohesion fund proposed for poorer countries.
This would reduce the rebate, though not by very much, EC officials said.
The second possible change would be to reduce the share of the UK rebate
shouldered by Germany, which makes by far the biggest net contribution
(Ecu9bn this year) to the budget. Bonn is already excused one third of its
share of the UK rebate, and is pushing for a further reduction.
Such a change would not necessarily reduce the UK rebate, provided other
countries were willing to take up Germany's reduced contribution to it. But
their readiness to do this is far from clear.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Treuhand announces record sales in June
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand agency, yesterday announced
that a record 562 former east German state companies were privatised in
June, but admitted the agency's debts had mounted to more than DM200bn
(Pounds 68.9bn).
The German Finance Ministry recently estimated that by the time the federal
government and states assumed the Treuhand's debts, at the end of 1994, they
will have risen to DM250bn. This estimate now appears on the low side as the
Treuhand increasingly turns to costly restructuring of unsaleable companies
which it nonetheless believes are viable.
Mrs Breuel said that in addition to the debts, there were substantial
charges arising from extensive ecological damage by east German companies.
By the end of June, 8,175 companies had been privatised, while 4,340
companies under the Treuhand umbrella remained unsold. Proceeds from the
privatisation amounted to DM30.7bn and the buyers had pledged to invest
DM144bn and guarantee 1.2m jobs.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said after conferring with Mrs
Breuel yesterday, that one of the main issues was the serious effect the
collapse of orders from the Soviet Union was having on struggling east
German companies.
He blamed 'internal Russian conditions' for the lack of concrete orders
despite the German government's recent approval of DM5bn in Hermes export
credit guarantees this year for east German companies exporting to the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Mr Waigel said Germany had done everything possible to facilitate east
German deliveries to the CIS. The Russians, however, were neither signing
contracts nor giving state guarantees for payment.
Mr Heinrich Hornef, the board member of the Treuhand responsible for
finance, said the Russians were seeking to obtain 'special arrangements'
from the Germans, which diverged from international practice.
'They are also trying to set an unrealistic exchange rate for the rouble,'
he said.
The haggling over conditions is taking place even though Russian and
Ukrainian industrial companies are desperately in need of east German spare
parts, plant and equipment. Seventeen ships ordered by former Soviet
shipping lines and worth DM850m are still at east German shipyards awaiting
payment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday restarted the process of nudging EC member
states towards a single air traffic control system and relieving congestion
in the skies.
Commissioners adopted legislation aimed at harmonising and integrating air
traffic control equipment in Europe's 54 control centres. The centres
currently use 31 different and incompatible technical systems and 70
different computer languages.
Under the Commission's plans, new surveillance, navigation and communication
systems would have to conform to a single set of standards developed by
Eurocontrol, the 14-nation air traffic control organisation based in
Brussels.
The Commission has already tried once to persuade member states to harmonise
the complex European system. Three directives were produced in 1988, with
broadly the same aim, but they were rejected by EC ministers keen to protect
sovereignty over their own airspace. Now, according to Mr Karel Van Miert,
the EC transport commissioner, the time is ripe for a new effort.
'Little by little, the member states have begun to change their minds,' he
said yesterday. 'They now recognise that the Community has an important role
to play.'
In March, transport ministers from the European Civil Aviation Conference
(ECAC) outlined a plan to improve the air traffic control system, and last
week European airlines called on the European authorities to act quickly to
relieve congestion. But Mr Van Miert made clear yesterday that progress
would be gradual and that this directive was only the first step.
Delays and cancellations have now become a notorious feature of air travel
in Europe, particularly in the summer.

BRITAIN yesterday attacked a European Commission decision to approve a
Pta120bn (Pounds 655.7m) capital increase and restructuring plan for Spain's
state-owned airline Iberia, write Andrew Hill in Brussels and Daniel Green
in London.
Brussels gave its approval after Madrid promised the funds would be used to
renew Iberia's fleet rather than to buy stakes in other Community airlines.
It will also alter the loss-making airline's statutes in line with the
Commission's air transport liberalisation plans.
The Commission insisted this should be the last such subsidy.
Lord Caithness, UK aviation minister, called the EC decision 'most
regrettable'.
He said Mr Karel Van Miert, transport commissioner, had accepted last week
that state aid could be allowed if it might equally have come from a
commercial organisation.
'Yet within days the Commission has approved a vast injection of state aid
to Iberia which surely no private sector company would have undertaken,'
said the minister.

NESTLE, the Swiss foods group, has won European Commission approval for its
FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) bid for Perrier, the French mineral water group,
but will have to give up several brands to a new 'third force'.
It has agreed to sell the Vichy, Saint Yorre, Thonon and Pierval brands, as
well as an unspecified number of other unnamed sources to a single buyer to
create a viable competitor. The brands - which have to be sold before a set
deadline - represent some 20 per cent of French mineral water capacity.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, yesterday hailed the
Commission's decision as 'a considerable victory for the consumer' and a
landmark in Brussels' rapidly evolving merger control policy.
The decision establishes for the first time that the EC merger control
authority can take into account the impact of duopolies and oligopolies  -
where more than two groups dominate a market - in its investigations.
But sceptical competition lawyers pointed out that the decision still leaves
more than two-thirds of French mineral water production in the hands of a
duopoly - Nestle and BSN, the French foods group which will buy the Volvic
brand from the enlarged group.
'This is yet another 'deal' (between the Commission and companies),' said Ms
Diana Good, a partner with the law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines in Brussels.
'There's no doubt that the time is ripe for one of these merger regulation
cases to be challenged before the European Court. The question is who is
going to do it?'

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Amato government's emergency economic package to cope with Italy's
deteriorating finances yesterday passed its first parliamentary hurdle.
The chamber of deputies agreed by 294 to 228 that the decree containing the
economic measures could be accorded urgent status.
The entire parliamentary passage for the mini-budget, raising an extra
L30,000bn (Pounds 13.9bn), is now expected to be completed by next
Wednesday, according to a timetable agreed by the 16 political parties.
The government, headed by the Socialist prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato,
has a 16-seat majority with the backing of the Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. In addition, the small Republican
party yesterday decided to support it.
The political parties have been remarkably muted since the budget was
announced on July 17, even though traditional privileges of patronage in a
slimmed-down state sector are under threat.
In part, this reflects internal divisions within all the main parties. But
Mr Amato also appears to be having some success in persuading them there is
no viable alternative but to approve the package if Italy wishes to regain
international credibility and improve its public finances. He has been
backed by Mr Carlo Azelio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, who
addressed parliament on Monday.
The most visible opposition has come from the trade unions, whose leaders
met Mr Amato and the government economic team yesterday. As a sop the
government may cut the increase in social security contributions for
salaried workers from 0.8 per cent to 0.6 per cent and modify proposals on
ending controlled rents for the lower paid. But last Saturday the three main
union confederations could only muster a crowd of 8,000 in Rome to protest
against these.
Confindustria, the employers confederation, whose representatives also met
the government yesterday, is prepared to back the measures provided Mr Amato
does not give ground to the unions which they are then asked to make up.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Milan bourse at new low amid growing pessimism

<TEXT>
ITALY'S hard-pressed equity markets suffered a further blow yesterday with
the Milan bourse sinking to a new low for the year, while money market
interest rates continued to surge.
The Comit index of shares fell by 0.47 per cent to 409.76, its lowest level
since October 1985. Rates for banks' securities repurchase agreements
(repos) with the Bank of Italy climbed to 17.56 per cent from 16.02 on
Friday.
Analysts blamed the movements on pessimism about Italy's economic and
political prospects, which has overwhelmed any fundamental factors about the
health of the corporate sector. 'Uncertainty is what drives the market
crazy, and we're at the height of uncertainty at the moment,' said one.
Sentiment remains overshadowed by concern about the lira, possible further
interest rate rises and political instability before parliamentary votes
later this week on the mini-budget and privatisation. Italy's credibility
has also been hit by the poor handling of treatment for creditors of Efim,
the state holding company which is to be wound up.
Shares in companies linked with Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Sicilian property
magnate arrested last week in the Milan political corruption scandal, were
among the hardest hit. Premafin, Mr Ligresti's main holding group, tumbled
3.4 per cent to L7,100.
Dealers were pessimistic about equities and the economy. 'Foreigners are
already out of the market; it's Italian funds which are selling now on
account of high redemption pressure from investors,' said one.

FT  23 JUL 92 / East European consumers take national shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIANS may not have much to cheer about, but at least they have twice as
many freezers as Poles. On the other hand, Poles, on average, have twice as
many video-recorders as Czechs and Slovaks.
European Russians stand twice as much chance of having a domestic telephone
than Hungarians. But none of the newly independent east European countries
can boast more home satellite dishes than Hungary.
These findings appear in 'The East European Consumer'*, a report published
yesterday by Mintel, the UK's leading market research analyst.
Mintel questioned about 1,000 people in each of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, and European Russia, from a wide range of occupations and
locations.
The survey suggested that Czech, Slovak and Hungarian households were the
most likely to be equipped with the more basic consumer durables, such as a
washing machine and television, while European Russian and Bulgarian homes
came bottom of that particular ladder.
When it comes to one of the greatest status symbols of all - a personal
motor car - the picture in east Europe is as varied as with other luxury
items. Car ownership is at its highest in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, with
207 and 204 cars per thousand inhabitants respectively; in Russia the figure
is closer to 84. By contrast, car ownership is about 600 per thousand people
in the US and just over 400 in the UK.
The survey also revealed widely different attitudes on leisure activities.
Czechoslovaks were found to be keenest on sport, with one in four of the
sample having a sporting recreation, against just one in ten Bulgarians, who
topped the list for those spending time in cafes and bars. Listening to
Western radio was found to be most popular in Czechoslovakia and European
Russia.
Mintel also tried to gauge more intangible aspects of life for the region's
consumers, by asking questions designed to ascertain feelings of optimism
versus pessimism, and of being risk-inclined or cautious. It found that
while 'there is considerable variance in the responses', the overall view
from the region was one of 'cautious optimism'. Optimism about future
economic prospects was found to be at its highest in Hungary and Poland, and
reached lowest ebb in European Russia.
Czechs and Slovaks evinced the least inclination to take risks - perhaps,
hazards the study, because 'they certainly have the best equipped households
in the survey' - while the Polish sample indicated the highest number
backing risk-inclined statements such as: 'There's not enough excitement in
my life' and 'I would gladly live in another country.'
Mr Peter Ayton, Mintel's senior European analyst, said that while crucial
statistics, such as those relating to personal disposable income, were
either inaccurate or unavailable, the study offered a 'guide to the relative
prosperity of the region.'
Within the region - with a population of some 328m, against the EC's 327m -
the study pinpoints a wide range of economic data, from gross domestic
product per capita to washing machines and other consumer durables per
household.
*The East European Consumer 1992; published by Mintel International Group,
18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE. Price Pounds 1,295, or separate reports on
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and European Russia at Pounds 395
each.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Interest rate rise on the cards in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain may increase its key interest rate, the intervention rate,
at today's tender of certificates of deposit in an attempt to add monetary
muscle to a tough package of fiscal restrictions announced by the government
on Tuesday night.
The central bank intervened yesterday to reduce liquidity in the interbank
market by selling short-term instruments at 12.75 per cent, up from around
12.5 per cent last week. This led to speculation that it was signalling an
imminent rise in its official intervention rate, which stands at 12.4 per
cent.
Analysts do not believe the peseta's controlled slide against the D-Mark in
the past few weeks justifies an interest rate increase. But they say the
government may be looking for an adjustment in monetary policy to boost the
effectiveness of a series of tax increases and budget cuts designed to trim
Dollars 3.26bn off its runaway public deficit this year.
As part of this fiscal package, Madrid has decided not to introduce a new
low tax regime this year, meaning that Spaniards will be paying up to 3 per
cent more tax for 1992 than they had expected. The country's top marginal
rate remains at 56 per cent, one of the highest in the European Community.
The government announced in addition that it was bringing forward an
increase in value added tax from 13 per cent to 15 per cent from January
1993 to August 1. It is also raising, from the beginning of next month, the
amount of tax the revenue service retains on salaries each month.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, also announced cuts in central
government capital and current transfers affecting most ministries but
particularly Defence and Public Works, worth some Dollars 1.4bn for the rest
of this year.
A freeze on hiring in the public sector, fines for abuse of rules
guaranteeing medicines to pensioners, and a measure to force employers to
pay for part of employee sick leave would cut a further Dollars 500m, he
said.
The fiscal measures have been introduced to stem a 40 per cent overspend, by
the end of June, in the planned central government budget deficit. Mr
Solchaga conceded that a worsening economic outlook in Spain meant the
economy would grow at around 2 per cent or less this year, compared with the
3 per cent projected in March.
The VAT increase could mean inflation of 6.8 per cent for the year, wide of
its 5.5 per cent target and a potentially powerful argument for increasing
interest rates.

FT  22 JUL 92 / BA's global dream ready for take-off: UK airline's stake in
USAir will give it unrivalled access to the biggest air travel market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord King's 11-year dream of creating the world's first global airline took
a step closer to reality yesterday with BA's acquisition of a stake of up to
44 per cent in the sixth biggest US carrier, USAir.
The deal follows years of frustration for BA as it tried in vain to
establish a bridgehead in North America. A tie-up with United Airlines of
the US collapsed in 1989. Another with KLM, the Dutch flag carrier which has
a stake in US carrier Northwest, was abandoned early this year.
Now BA has done it, and with the largest ever transatlantic stake among big
airlines. The deal, it believes, gives it a unique position to take
advantage of deregulating markets in Europe and across the Atlantic. And
compared with other European airlines, it will now have unrivalled access to
the US east coast.
On many measures, the price is high. In a complex deal, BA is injecting
Dollars 750m (Pounds 395m) into USAir in return for convertible preference
shares that, if converted in five years, could give it up to 44 per cent of
the equity capital of the airline. USAir has other holders of convertible
shares and if they converted too, BA's stake would be diluted to 32 per
cent. BA has the right to maintain its 44 per cent by paying up to another
Dollars 600m.
A possible total outlay of Dollars 1.35bn over several years compares with
the Dollars 600m of ordinary shares and Dollars 600m of preferred shares
USAir has outstanding. Furthermore, BA cannot buy 44 per cent of shareholder
voting rights.
US regulations limit foreign control of domestic airlines to 25 per cent. As
foreigners currently hold about 4 per cent, BA's voting power will initially
be about 21 per cent.
In return, BA will earn a return of 7 per cent on the convertibles. BA says
this will cover the costs of the investment which will come from its own
resources.
It will also appoint four of USAir's board of 16 directors as well as
another two non-executive directors who will sit on the boards of both
companies.
Perhaps more importantly, the tie-up gives BA access to the US air travel
market, which accounts for some 40 per cent of global air traffic. This will
help BA stave off challenges from smaller low-cost operators such as Virgin
which fly to only a handful of US cities. A combined BA and USAir will be
able to sell through tickets to 204 US cities, compared with BA's current
19.
BA also plans to exploit economies of scale in areas such as marketing,
maintenance and purchasing. This will help it challenge the position of the
world's biggest airlines, United and American, which last year took over
some of the transatlantic routes of the now defunct Pan Am and TWA. The
size, and the financial and marketing strength of United and American have
given each 15 per cent of the north Atlantic market, a figure which is
rising steadily.
The combined USAir and BA will carry more passengers than any other airline,
but it will still be smaller than American and United on the more usual
measure of airline size - revenue passenger kilometres - which take into
account the distance travelled by each passenger.
For USAir, the deal is even more important. The carrier has been suffering
from severe problems integrating Piedmont Aviation which it bought for
Dollars 1.56bn in 1987. With domestic recession and then the Gulf war,
USAir's problems escalated. Domestic traffic growth ground to a halt, and
cash-strapped carriers initiated costly fare wars.
At the operating level, USAir made Dollars 21.5m profit in 1989, but turned
this into a Dollars 501.1m loss in 1990, and a Dollars 173.5m deficit in
1991. With the hefty interest charges added in, the net loss for the same
three years was Dollars 63.2m, Dollars 454.4m, and Dollars 305.3m
respectively. Long-term debt remained in excess of Dollars 2bn, and in
late-1990, USAir suspended dividends on its ordinary shares.
USAir said yesterday that the money would initially go towards paying down
bank debt, reducing its total debt to equity ratio, on a pro-forma basis,
from around 58 per cent to 38 per cent.
So why should BA be prepared to pay Dollars 750m for a 32 per cent stake in
such a loss-maker?
'We looked at the projected profitability and calculated a fair value,' said
Mr Derek Stevens, BA's chief financial officer. He points to USAir's drastic
cost cutting: the company has shed more than 7,000 jobs in the past two
years, and cut salaries and services. 'The opportunity is for traffic,' said
Lord King. 'I don't think it's a gamble. It's an opportunity to reach out
and take the airline global.'
USAir ranks sixth among US carriers in terms of revenue passenger kilometres
flown; it ferried more than 55m passengers last year and employs 45,281
people. It operates 439 jet aircraft, almost twice the size of BA's fleet. A
large part of its route network is still to the heavily travelled East
Coast. This was augmented last winter, when USAir agreed to operate the
former Trump Shuttle which flies between Washington DC-New York-Boston.
So the airlines respective routes fit fairly neatly together. USAir is
largely a US domestic carrier while BA is strongest on international routes.
Both have large Boeing fleets, so shared maintenance and purchasing should
be easy to implement.
The immediate obstacles could come from the phalanx of regulatory and legal
hurdles the deal must overcome before it is finalised. In the US, the
airlines may have to convince the departments of Transportation and Justice,
over anti-trust rules. In Brussels, the European Commission will cast its
eye over the proposed transaction.
On an operational level, the combined managements face the issue of New
York. British Airways has invested heavily in its base at the city's biggest
airport, JFK. USAir, however, is committed to the second airport at La
Guardia.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and in sole operational command of
the airline since last week's annual meeting, would not forecast potential
cost savings. But UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the company's broker, said the
'combined annual cost savings and extra revenue of Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m
a year is not an unreasonable target'. Sir Colin conceded that gains were
unlikely to outweigh the costs of reorganisation for two years. But then BA
has a further three years before it is likely to have to convert its
investment into ordinary shares and consolidate USAir's profits or losses
into its own.
By that time BA will hope the synergy benefits and an economic recovery will
have brought USAir back into profit. If this comes true then BA's
shareholders will have avoided diluting their earnings and Lord King will
receive their thanks. If it does not, he will be safe from their wrath in
the semi-retirement of BA's honorary presidency.

FT  22 JUL 92 / BA creates global giant with Dollars 750m USAir deal

BRITISH AIRWAYS is buying a stake in USAir, the sixth biggest US airline, in
a move that creates the world's biggest airline alliance.
BA is paying Dollars 750m (Pounds 393m) initially for a stake of up to 44
per cent in USAir, to be held in the form of convertible shares. US
regulations limit foreign ownership of voting shares so the British airline
will only have 21 per cent of voting rights.
The combined operation will link the world's biggest international air
network with the sixth biggest US domestic network and will carry more
passengers than any other airline.
BA's biggest deal since it was privatised in 1987 closes a long and
frustrating period for the company, providing a long-sought foothold in the
huge north American market.
'We have been stalking a number of airlines for some time,' Lord King,
non-executive chairman, said yesterday. 'The catchment area for BA is this
little island. For USAir it is a very large part of the US.'
It also throws a lifeline to USAir, which has incurred after-tax losses of
Dollars 760m during the past two years and has debts of more than Dollars
2bn. But Mr Seth Schofield, president of USAir, denied that BA's capital
injection was a rescue deal. 'We still had strong liquidity and we would
have been a survivor,' he said.
Investors in London and New York welcomed the deal. British Airways shares
rose 10p to 268p in London and USAir shares closed up Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 14 1/8 .
Either BA or USAir can pull out if the deal is not completed by Christmas
Eve this year. To ease the way through US anti-trust laws, BA will take over
running USAir's few existing transatlantic routes.
In the US, the deal will need clearance from the Department of Justice and
the Department of Transportation. Mr Schofield made clear that the carriers
will argue the deal improves competition, creating a stronger rival to the
three big US carriers - Delta, American and United.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United, the second biggest US carrier, said the
deal presented 'a singular opportunity to achieve competitive breakthrough
in air services between the US and Great Britain'.
He forecast an expansion of US air carrier access to the UK.
Mr Robert Crandall, head of American Airlines, echoed United's stance and
offered conditional support for the deal. 'We have long advocated greater
liberalisation of both investment and competitive opportunities for all
international carriers,' he said. 'This proposal . . . seems consistent with
the advocacy - assuming that the US government assures the availability of
appropriate new competitive opportunities for US carriers.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S government-run postal monopoly should be exposed to competition
from private sector express freight carriers, the Industry Commission said
yesterday.
The commission, which advises the federal Labor government, has been the
driving force behind much of the liberalisation of the Australian economy
which has taken place since 1983.
Its attack on the Australia Post monopoly will be welcomed by freight
carriers such as TNT, which has extensive experience of express delivery in
the UK and elsewhere.
However, the report is likely to provoke widespread opposition from trade
unions and consumer groups.
Mr Neil O'Keefe, who is chairman of the Labor party's parliamentary
communications committee, said that it should be dismissed 'out of hand'.
The commission said that the Australia Post monopoly on letters weighing
less than 500g should be replaced by a maximum price set by the federal
government.
This would allow the country's private sector competitors to enter the
market, while maintaining a reasonably priced service for customers in
remote areas of rural Australia.
It said loss-making services should be directly funded by the government.
'The monopoly is stifling the development of innovative, low-cost ways for
business and individuals to communicate,' the commission said.
The draft report is intended to provide a basis for public hearings on the
postal monopoly in September.
The commission is expected to present its final recommendations to the
government in October.

The criticism, made during a meeting on the nuclear issue, coincides with a

to industrial facilities in the South. Seoul officials are hoping to use the
visit of Mr Kim, North Korea's senior economic official, to persuade
Pyongyang to accept spot inspections of suspected nuclear research

THE non-government members of Hong Kong's executive council, or cabinet,
have offered their resignations to Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor,
writes Simon Holberton.
Mr Patten said yesterday that Baroness Dunn, the senior non-official member
of the cabinet, had written to him on July 13 saying that she and other
non-official members would be happy to put their offices at his disposal.
There are currently 10 unofficial and four official members of the executive
council. The 'unofficials' include Baroness Dunn, a leading conservative, Mr
William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, and Mr Andrew Wong, a university
professor and the only directly-elected member of the cabinet.
Mr Patten said he had taken no decision on the offer, other than to welcome
the 'generosity of spirit' in which it was made. But he is widely expected
to reshape his cabinet around the time that he opens the autumn session of
colony's legislature on October 7.
Since his arrival Mr Patten has stressed that his government will be
'executive-led' and that he expects to take the initiative in winning
support for his policies among local legislators.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Sanctions force Belgrade to tighten its belt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'PEOPLE complain about the prices of green peppers. But after paying for
fertilisers and fuel, I have no choice - we earn a pittance,' says Mrs
Dusanka Mladenovic, a peasant selling vegetables at Kalenic Pijaca, one of
Belgrade's green markets.
The effects of United Nations sanctions, including an oil embargo, imposed
on Yugoslavia for its backing of Serb fighters in Bosnia, are hitting the
inhabitants of the Serbian capital.
Mrs Mladenovic says she has barely enough petrol to travel from her nearby
village to Belgrade. Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro,
introduced a monthly ration in June of 20 litres for private car owners.
Even that is likely to be cut next month to 15 litres, according to Serbian
newspapers.
Queues of cars snake around the handful of petrol stations still open in
Belgrade. Crowds of people wait for hours to pack into buses after city
authorities halved the number running each day and closed many routes.
Mr Ivan Obradovic, a Belgrade university professor, had difficulty even
getting hold of his ration coupons.
Five municipal offices told him they had run out. Mr Obradovic dismissed as
'useless' an offer of diesel coupons. One clerk recommended he buy them on
the black market.
The flourishing black market sells hard currency and petrol coupons but the
price of DM1 for a 10 litre coupon is steep for people whose average monthly
wage has plummeted to DM65.
'It is catastrophic,' says Mr Obradovic. 'The government has shown it is
incapable of effectively rationing patrol. If this is any sign of how - if
necessary - they will ration flour and cooking oil, then we will starve.'
Tired of war and uncertainty, people appear to blame Yugoslav and foreign
politicians for their economic woes. An attendant at one Belgrade filling
station told foreign journalists in search of petrol to ask 'Bush and
Genscher'. The former German foreign minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher has
been much maligned by the Serbian media for his support of Croatian
independence.
Other people pointed the finger at Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and
Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman.
'If you listen to television the politicians are always right. But while
they argue, people are dying in Bosnia. Milosevic and Tudjman should be
blamed, not ordinary people.' says Mrs Mladenovic, sitting on a wooden crate
at the market.
Zeljko, a warehouse manager from Zemun, a city across the River Sava from
Belgrade, says: 'We are are all guilty for the situation - but it is mostly
Serbia's ruling politicians. Meanwhile, I live from one day to the next
trying to make ends meet.
'I cannot feed my family on a monthly wage of DM100, so I have to sell goods
on the black market.'

Michael of Hohenzollern, the former king of Romania, has said he will
consider initiatives aimed at bringing him back to the country as sovereign,
writes Virginia Marsh from Bucharest.
The ex-king's statement appears to rule out the possibility he will run for
president in elections due September 27 and comes as a blow to the National
Liberal party (NLP), one of the country's main political parties, which last
week-end nominated 'Citizen Michael Hohenzollern' as its presidential
candidate.

Angry anti-mafia protesters yesterday broke through police cordons outside
Palermo cathedral at the funeral of five bodyguards blown up with leading
anti-mafia judge Mr Paolo Borsellino on Sunday, Reuter reports from Palermo.
Anger against the political class which failed to protect Mr Borsellino
after the Mafia murdered his colleague, judge Giovanni Falcone last May, has
been rising since Sunday's bombing, particularly among police bodyguards in
Palermo.
The mayor of Palermo, Mr Aldo Rizzo, resigned hours before the ceremony and
seven of the Sicilian capital's 16 deputy prosecutors have also stepped down
in protest at the authorities' latest failure in the battle against the
Mafia.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Yeltsin aide rejects liberal dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR adviser to the Russian president has called for Russia to 'abandon
the liberal approach' in both foreign and domestic policies, and to cease
attempting to integrate itself into the western economies.
Mr Sergei Stankevich, a state counsellor and a former deputy mayor of
Moscow, yesterday called a press conference with the sole apparent aim of
putting on the record his opposition to the 'liberal dream' of a market
economy and democratic institutions - calling instead for the creation of a
'strong central power. . . to carry out reform'.
Mr Stankevich is a prominent and still-young politician who has made his
name as a radical democrat over the past five years. However, he has been
moving steadily towards a more outspokenly authoritarian position under the
impact of the worsening economic crisis and the fractious relations between
Russia and the other former Soviet states, which expose Russians in these
states to increasing tension.
Figures published earlier this week by the Russian Statistical Committee
showed sharp falls in every branch of production in the first half of the
year - including 13 per cent in oil, 12 per cent in coal, 4 per cent to 13
per cent in chemicals and petrochemicals, 14 per cent in cement and building
materials, and by more than 20 per cent in paper. The rouble, no longer
supported by interventions of the central bank, has sunk to 150 to the
dollar.
Mr Stankevich, who insisted he was an individual voice, also admitted his
ideas were close to those of General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian
vice-president. Gen Rutskoi's party, Free Russia, has formed the 'Civic
Union' coalition with the Democratic party and the Union of Industrialists
to create a powerful and increasingly vocal bloc espousing the kind of ideas
publicised yesterday by Mr Stankevich.
The state counsellor stressed the 'Russianness' of his ideas, saying that
the country was now rejecting the notions of the westernisers who took power
after the collapse of communism, in favour of a balance between east and
west. In economic reform, he said, the government's ideas on market reform
had been discredited, and should be replaced by 'active industrialism' -
that is, 'capitalism with a very active oversight by the state'.
Mr Stankevich drew a parallel here with the statesman Mr Pyotr Stolypin,
whose reforms from 1905 until his assassination in 1911 laid the base for
private farming under authoritarian Tsarist rule.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Efim creditors meet to decide on action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of banks that are owed money by Efim, the Italian state holding
company, met in London yesterday in the first sign of concerted action by
banks around the world to recover Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.05bn) of foreign
debts owed by the group.
It also emerged that a group of Japanese banks, led by Sanwa and Mitsubishi,
are among the largest creditors of the group, which is to be wound up. About
15 international banks are owed more than Dollars 30m each and there are
more than 150 bank creditors.
The announcement that the Italian government is to dismantle Efim has
dismayed bankers, who were not warned of the move and who are concerned
about whether they will be repaid in full. Any failure would have dire
consequences for Italy's standing in international financial markets.
Yesterday morning a group of banks owed Ecu300m (Pounds 215m) by the group
met to decide what action they should take. The syndicate is led by Bankers
Trust International and Mitsubishi Bank.
The lead banks in a number of banking syndicates have already established
informal contact in an attempt to co-ordinate their actions.
Mitsubishi Bank, in charge of the Ecu300m syndicate and itself thought to be
owed some Dollars 53m, was named yesterday as a likely leader in any
discussions with the Italian authorities.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Citicorp ahead despite property loss
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the largest banking group in the US, yesterday provided evidence
of a solid recovery in overall earnings in spite of trebled North American
commercial property losses.
The bank's second-quarter net profit was Dollars 171m (Pounds 89.5m),
compared with Dollars 11m in the same period of 1991. Earnings per share
were 32 cents against a loss of 12 cents. A second-quarter loss of Dollars
355m was reported for the North American commercial property division, more
than three times the Dollars 108m loss of a year ago.
Mr John Reed, chairman, said the results showed the bank to be on track in
meeting the objectives of its reorganisation and capital building programme.
He cited the improved operating margin of Dollars 1.8bn, an increase of 24
per cent year-on-year. The bank's core consumer division achieved a 34 per
cent rise in net earnings to Dollars 234m, on revenues 4 per cent up at
Dollars 2.6bn.
The global corporate business achieved Dollars 294m of net income in the
quarter, against a Dollars 10m loss. Revenues of Dollars 1.4bn were 12 per
cent improved year-on-year. The cross-border refinancing portfolio produced
Dollars 105m of net income, against Dollars 3m a year ago.
For the first six months of 1992 Citicorp's net income was Dollars 354m (69
cents per share), against Dollars 104m (5 cents per share) in the first half
of last year.
Citicorp wrote off Dollars 356m of North American commercial property loans
during the second quarter, against Dollars 90m a year ago. Total
second-quarter loan write-offs were down to Dollars 908m from Dollars 1.68bn
a year ago, due to the absence of last year's heavy cross-border loan
write-offs and the benefit of corporate division loan write-offs of Dollars
126m - less than one third last year's level.
Bad debt provisions were unchanged year-on-year at Dollars 1bn while
non-performing corporate side loans totalled Dollars 8.1bn against Dollars
7.9bn a year ago.
Non-performing North American commercial property loans represented 24 per
cent of the Dollars 11.95bn loan book, but when foreclosed property is added
this rises to Dollars 6.3bn, or 52.6 per cent.
Mr Tom Hanley, an analyst at First Boston, said the figures showed
property-related bad debt provisions would remain high this year, but 'it
looks like the worst is past in terms of credit quality problems'.
On Wall Street, Citicorp's shares rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 1/4 .

FT  22 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Little strength behind modest rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER news on UK mortgage rates and a steadier performance by sterling
helped London share prices to rally yesterday from the severe shakeout of
the previous session. But there was little enthusiasm behind the recovery
and the FT-SE Index was never able to recapture its opening gain of nearly
23 points.
The scene for a market recovery was set overnight by the UK government's
move to reduce upward pressures on mortgage charges by cutting the interest
rate on its latest National Savings bond, which has been draining deposits
away from the building societies. A rebound in stock index futures also
encouraged the UK market to join in the rally in European bourses, prompted
by central bank support for the US dollar on the previous day.
The early gain, however, faded as it became clear that genuine investment
support was restrained by continuing uncertainty over the background both
for economic progress and interest rates. In the light of the National
Savings bond rate change, one of Britain's largest building societies
withdrew its warning that higher mortgage rates were planned, but some City
analysts said that higher home lending rates remained a danger.
After returning almost to overnight levels, the market began to move forward
again, but traced an erratic course, largely under the influence of the
stock index futures. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,415.6
with a net gain of 11.9.
At the close, London was ignoring an early gain of 16 points on the Dow
Average as Wall Street responded to the address to the Senate of Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Traders and strategists alike laid stress on the poor trading volume in the
stock market. 'The market was dead,' said the leading trader at a Japanese
house. Seaq volume totalled 421.2m shares, compared with 456.3m in the
previous dramatic trading session.
But Stock Exchange statistics disclose that on Monday, when the Footsie at
one time showed its biggest fall since the Moscow coup in August 1991,
retail, or customer, business was worth only Pounds 950m. For three weeks,
daily retail volume has rarely moved above the Pounds 1bn mark regarded as
profitable for the London securities industry.
'In spite of the sound argument that equities are outstandingly cheap, the
institutions simply won't buy them at present,' said a senior dealer at a UK
investment bank. 'They are buying UK government bonds.'
The impending sale of 330m Wellcome shares, for which the offer closes on
Friday, is also blamed for keeping the institutions out of the stock market.
Traders will be glad to see this deal out of the way, but were unimpressed
by reports that the Wellcome shares might be sold at a 5 per cent discount
to the current market price.
The best news of the day, according to the market, came when British Airways
confirmed that it is gaining valuable access to the US airline business by
taking an equity stake in USAir Group.

FT  22 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome worries increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER selling of Wellcome prompted suggestions from some dealers that the
planned share issue might have to be scaled down to take account of market
weakness. Pressure from two small securities houses and from the options
market was said to be behind a fall of 12 to 833p in the shares yesterday.
Wellcome is now an even tighter market than usual, with few traders prepared
to buy stock ahead of next week's share flotation.
Wellcome Trust, the governing charity, is hoping to sell 330m shares through
investment bank Robert Fleming, although some dealers were suggesting
yesterday that the flotation might have to be scaled back to 200m. Fleming
has said it has received indicative bids for more than 250m shares and is
understood to be convinced that UK institutions will be happy to buy
Wellcome stock at around 800p when the tender process ends on Friday.
However, if the price continues to fall, institutions could find themselves
in the bizarre situation of paying for the floated shares at a premium to
the price in the market.
Reuters above worst
A sharp fall for Reuters shares following the group's interim results
surprised many in the market. The stock tumbled 70 from the day's high, but
picked up later to close a net 25 off at 1126p on further consideration of
the company's trading report.
Marketmakers focused initially on a newswire headline which appeared to
indicate that revenues, rather than the percentage growth, would be under
pressure. However, further appraisal showed that the first-half profit of
Pounds 187.4m was towards the upper end of forecasts and cash holdings were
strong at Pounds 600m.
Mr John Clarke of Daiwa, the Japanese securities house, commented: 'The
earnings are of the very highest quality. With cash continuing to increase
there is no reason for Reuters to lose its premium rating.'
BA advances
News that British Airways is to pay Dollars 750m for a 21 per cent voting
stake in USAir, America's fourth largest carrier, was well received in the
stock market. Share volume in BA soared to 10m in strong two-way business as
the stock advanced 10 to 268p.
Earlier, the shares had moved forward in light trade with the market, but
the announcement drove the stock to a day's peak of 275p, before
profit-takers arrived.
Mr Chris Tarry at Kleinwort Benson Securities said: 'This deal goes much of
the way to combat competition from BA's main US rivals, United Airlines and
American Airlines.' Another analyst, however, commented: 'British Airways
appears to have paid a high price in a buyers' market.'
Enterprise weak
The focus of attention among oil exploration and production stocks shifted
away from Lasmo and moved to Enterprise Oil as its shares retreated 13 more
to 319p, their lowest since April 1988.
The price was unsettled early by the sale of a block of 400,000 shares at
319p, a 7p discount to the prevailing market price. The move accompanied
growing unease about lack of news on the expected sale of Enterprise's stake
in the Hudson field in the North Sea.
Sector specialists have been waiting for many weeks for news of the Hudson
sale, which is expected to raise around Pounds 25m. C. Itoh, the Japanese
holding company, has been rumoured to be the buyer of the stake.
HSBC put on 7 to 346p, responding to much better than expected figures from
Marine Midland, the bank's US subsidiary.
Monday's rally in Lasmo came to an abrupt halt, with the shares slipping 4
1/2 to 126 1/2 p on good turnover of 3.2m in the wake of some determined
selling by one of the leading London brokers.
There was a suggestion that one of the UK banks, a big corporate lender to
the oil sector, had revised downwards its oil price forecasts and was
reducing its revolving credit facilities to some oil groups.
BP settled 3 up at 203p after confirmation of the biggest ever traded
options deal in the UK market, involving the equivalent of 20m BP shares.
Strong hints in the market that British Steel's broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
had taken the stock off its buy list led to a retreat in the share price
which made it the day's worst performing component of the FT-SE 100 Index.
The shares gave up 2 1/2 to 56 1/2 p in brisk trade of 11m amid suggestions
that the broker had cast doubts about the level of this year's dividend.
Simon Engineering fell 16 to 190p after broker Smith New Court downgraded
its current-year dividend expectation.
The market responded well to first-half results from SmithKline Beecham, the
'A' shares appreciating 13 1/2 to 457p and the units 12 to 412p. Profits of
Pounds 254m were at the top of a Pounds 248m to Pounds 254m market forecast
range. SmithKline announced a dividend of 2.075p which was in line with
expectations and several houses were recommending the stock.
Glaxo saw healthy trade following good buying in New York on Monday night.
The stock moved ahead 28 to 716p, principally boosted by the company's
defensive qualities. Lehman has been telling clients that sales in the UK of
the oral version of the company's anti-migraine drug Imigran could have
reached Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) this year.
Newsagent John Menzies maintained a firm tone after Monday's better than
expected results led to an upgrading by County NatWest. The securities house
said it is looking for profits of Pounds 28m next year, compared with a
previous estimate of Pounds 25.5m. The shares gained 2 to 385p.
Northern Foods rallied 10 to 594p, after losing ground on Monday ahead of
this week's annual meeting.
Property shares bounced following the recent spate of depressing statistics
showing an all-time low for the sector against the FT-Actuaries All-share
Index.
Broker recommendations helped British Land to improve 3 to 184p and Slough
Estates 5 to 122p. Growing belief that Greycoat would maintain its dividend
left the stock 5 firmer at 33p.
Mirror Group Newspapers gained a further 5 to 63 1/2 p on heavy turnover of
16m shares as talk that a stakebuilder is at work refused to die away.

FT  22 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE deal in the traded options sector boosted turnover, enlivening an
otherwise featureless day in the derivatives markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
Following light dealing at the opening, traded options were featured by a
big trade in British Petroleum when broker Strauss Turnbull, said to have
been acting for Lehman Brothers, 'crossed' 20,000 of the July 160 calls.
There was speculation in the market that the deal had been carried out for
tax purposes.
British Aerospace was the second most active stock option with 1,909
contracts dealt, BZW being a strong buyer of the November 260 calls, the
day's busiest series. Total turnover in traded options reached 46,759
contracts, with 5,002 lots transacted in the FT-SE 100 option.
In stock index futures, the FT-SE contract for September delivery
experienced a volatile session. With economic worries continuing,
independent traders led the contract down and it fell to a day's low of
2,411.
Bargain hunters prompted a turnround and, by noon, September had reached its
peak of 2,440 before drifting back. It finished at 2,424, up 8 from the
previous close but 7 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash
of about 18. Turnover, at 8,120 contracts, was reasonable.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Program selling takes Dow
back from highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH US stock markets - buoyed by an overnight recovery in foreign
equities - opened firmer yesterday, a round of program selling saw share
prices retreat from their early gains and end virtually unchanged, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.41 at 3,308.41, but
well below the day's peak when the index was 20 points ahead. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished just 0.01 firmer at 413.76, while the American SE
composite gained a mere 0.30 at 384.82. The Nasdaq composite managed to end
4.35 higher at 568.63. Turnover on the New York SE was a modest 174m shares.
After two days of big losses, a rebound in Tokyo and leading European
markets yesterday paved the way for a positive opening in New York, although
the underlying factors behind Monday's sharp worldwide declines - the
weakness of the global economy and high German interest rates - remained a
drag on sentiment.
The market received little comfort from the testimony before Congress of Mr
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman. He gave little away, although his
upbeat comments about the outlook for inflation may have provided investors
with some comfort.
That left second quarter corporate results as the main influence on stock
prices yesterday. Drugs shares were in the forefront, with Warner-Lambert up
Dollars 1 at Dollars 65 1/8 on news of record quarterly net income of
Dollars 178m, up 15 per cent from a year ago, and Pfizer Dollars  1/8 firmer
at Dollars 75 3/4 in active trading on a 14 per cent increase in second
quarter profits to Dollars 204m.
USAir climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 in heavy trading after British
Airways agreed to buy a 44 per cent stake in the US carrier for Dollars
750m. The news of the deal lifted BA's ADRs Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 5/8 .
Leading banks were also a feature, with Citicorp gaining Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 20 1/4 after revealing net income of Dollars 171m for the second
quarter, against just Dollars 11m a year ago. The comparison, however, was
distorted by after-tax restructuring charges and after-tax net gains on the
sale of non-strategic assets.
Chemical Bank went the other way, falling Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 in spite
of second quarter net income jumping to Dollars 240m. Investors may have
been disturbed by large loan/loss provisions in the quarter.
United Technologies moved ahead Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 on
announcing second quarter net income of Dollars 166m, up from the Dollars
44m earned a year ago in the wake of a one-off charge against earnings.
Motor issues continued to take a beating on concern about the outlook for
car sales. Ford fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 and General Motors Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 39 3/4 . Canada
A BARRAGE of sell orders at the opening set the tone for heavy losses on the
Toronto stock exchange, but the overall market was mixed. Northern Telecom
opened late due to an imbalance of sell orders on reporting surprisingly
poor second quarter earnings.
Nortel ended CDollars 4 1/4 down at CDollars 41 1/8 . Its parent, BCE Inc,
further depressed later by a sharp loss at its Montreal Trustco unit,
tumbled CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 45 1/8 .
The TSE 300 index closed 27.3 down at 3,425.2, although falls and rises were
almost evenly matched at 265 to 264 after volume of 25.0m shares.

THE DOLLAR extended its rally against the D-Mark at the start of European
trading yesterday but showed new signs of weakness by the close, writes
James Blitz.
The US currency continued to derive strength from Monday's concerted
intervention by the Federal Reserve and European central banks to keep the
dollar above its all-time low. In the morning it rose nearly two pfennigs to
peak at DM1.5020 as corporate demand for dollars intensified. By lunchtime
the rally had petered out and it retreated to close in London at DM1.4885.
In New York the dollar finished a shade lower at DM1.4865.
The dollar is underpinned by the market's belief that if the currency tests
its record low again, the central banks will intervene. Mr Angus Armstrong,
an economist at Morgan Grenfell in London, commented: 'The reputations of
nearly a dozen central banks are at stake here, so I think they will be keen
to underpin the dollar for now.'
Yesterday's dollar downturn was partly due to the market's disappointment
with the testimony on the US economy given by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve. He said US GDP would be in the area of 2.25 to 2.75 per
cent in 1992, compared to a previous forecast of 1.75 to 2.50 per cent.
However, Mr Christian Dunis, a currency analyst at Chemical Bank in London,
said Mr Greenspan's upward revision of US growth estimates for 1992 was
unconvincing. 'In recent times we have seen the Fed consistently
over-optimistic about the economy,' said Mr Dunis. 'What the market did not
want to hear was wishful thinking about the scope for a US economic
recovery.'
The dollar's later weakness could also be put down to the continued strength
of the D-Mark, with many operators remaining convinced that the Bundesbank
will put up its Lombard rate when it next meets in August.
A clear sign that the German currency has not been seriously weakened by the
central bank intervention was the D-Mark's gain against the French franc
yesterday. France has a trade surplus, while Germany has a trade deficit.
The French also have an inflation rate 1 percentage point below Germany's.
But the D-Mark still rose yesterday, ending at FFr3.3780, against a previous
close of FFr3.3750.
The D-Mark was also firm against sterling, which has failed to track the
dollar's rise in the last two days. The pound managed to finish unchanged at
DM2.8425, but it was down in morning trading to DM2.8367. The Italian lira
was weak in spite of the Bank of Italy's huge intervention on its behalf the
previous day. It dropped to a low of L761.20 against the D-Mark, but
improved later to L759.40.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the sterling money market were slightly softer yesterday, as
dealers continued to digest the effects of Monday's concerted intervention
by central banks to keep the dollar above its all-time low.
Although the US currency's rise helped to keep sterling above its own lows,
the pound had a weak bias throughout the day. It closed unchanged on the day
but left the markets in a bearish mood.
In the morning, short-term rates were boosted by a medium-sized shortage of
Pounds 750m from the Bank of England, most of which was removed by dealers
in early operations. Traders said there was now no expectation at all of a
base rate cut, considering the Bank's decision to deal in Bands 3 and 4 last
Friday at the old rates which had preceded their cut of two weeks ago.
The speed at which the shortage was brought down reduced the offered rate
for one-week money: it closed  1/8 off at 10 per cent. The one-month rate
was at 10 1/4 per cent, down from 10 5/16 per cent.
Dealers said the Treasury's decision to reduce the gross interest paid on
the First Option National Savings Bond also helped to soften rates because
it had taken the pressure off building societies to raise their mortgage
interest rates. Helped by this, three-month money ended down at 10 5/16 per
cent offered from a previous close of 10 3/8 per cent.
All of this was offset by sterling's poor performance. The 10 5/16 rate was
offered right out to one-year, and the virtually flat yield curve showed how
bearish the market has become.
The decision on National Savings had a bullish effect on short sterling
futures in the morning, with the September contract opening at 89.75, up 5
basis points from its previous close. However, the front-month contract
dropped to a day's low of 89.63 before closing only one basis point up at
89.76 on balance.
The Bank of England's operations were light, with the Bank dealing at the
established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent
for the repurchase agreement (repo).
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 550m in a repo for resale on
August 10. In the afternoon, the forecast was revised to Pounds 900m and the
Bank bought Pounds 350m in Band 1.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: European traders' panic subsides
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets recovered yesterday from the panic that
shook them at the start of the week. However, volatility persisted in some
quarters.
Longer-dated UK gilts bounced back by a quarter of a point as sterling
stabilised on the foreign exchange markets. Although the currency remains
firmly at the bottom of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, some observers were
already predicting with relief the end of devaluation fears.
The long gilt future on Liffe edged up from 98.15 to close at around 98.22,
near its high of the day. Gains among shorter-dated gilts were meagre,
reflecting continued pressure in the money markets pending the latest money
supply data from Germany.
THE Italian government bond market experienced another highly volatile day,
although bond prices managed to end the day firmer. The market opened
firmly, continuing the trend from Monday afternoon, as traders continued to
buy to cover short positions taken on the market. But prices soon slipped.
'Once the shorts had been covered, there was really nothing to support the
market,' one trader said. The BTP futures contract on Liffe, which had
opened at 93.00, fell sharply to 92.15.
Later in the day though, a stronger lira helped the market recover its
equanimity, pushing the futures contract back up by almost a full point, to
93.06, by the close.
With the sell-off by foreign investors since the Danish rejection of
Maastricht now largely thought to be over, traders expect considerable
wariness before international investors return to the Italian market.
GERMAN bond prices settled into a tight trading range as the market looked
forward to a batch of economic data for a clue as to the Bundesbank's next
move on interest rates.
Most expect M3 growth for June, due this week, to come in at about 3
percentage points above the ceiling on the Bundesbank's target range, set at
5.5 per cent. The latest consumer prices figures, the first of which are due
at the end of the week, are also expected to show some improvement - though,
again, they will remain outside the Bundesbank's target. After a June rise
of 4.3 per cent, consumer prices are expected to show a rise of between 3.4
and 3.7 per cent.
Ahead of these numbers, the market remained quiet, with the bund futures
contract edging up from 87.13 to 87.17.
US Treasury prices were little changed at the long end and slightly easier
at the short end after the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, gave
little away in his testimony to Congress.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 103
31/32 , yielding 7.652 per cent, and the two-year note was down 1/32 at 101
5/16 , yielding 4.269 per cent.
The short end eased slightly because some investors thought Mr Greenspan's
comments in his Humphrey-Hawkins report indicated that the Fed would not
ease monetary policy again in the current business cycle.

30%

<TEXT>
CHEMICAL BANKING, the third biggest US bank that was formed recently by the
merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, yesterday unveiled
a 30 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 240m.
For the first six months of 1992 the net income was Dollars 500m, up by 37
per cent year-on-year.
These are the first quarterly results from Chemical since the merger was
formally completed last month, and the comparative 1991 figures cited
represent a pooling of the two precursor banks. Combined total assets are
now Dollars 142bn.
Earnings per share in the second quarter were unchanged year-on-year at 83
cents, while the net income per share for the first six months was Dollars
1.83, against Dollars 1.67 in the first half of 1991.
The earnings per share numbers are affected, however, by the fact that the
bank sold 57.5m new shares last January, in an issue that raised Dollars
1.5bn.
Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said the bank's earnings momentum continued
in the second quarter with strong results in most businesses. He said
pre-tax earnings were 72 per cent improved year-on-year and the results were
achieved against the backdrop of high bad-debt provisions and loan
write-offs.
Net interest income in the second quarter was 14 per cent improved at
Dollars 1.1bn, while non-interest revenues were Dollars 744m, up from
Dollars 713m a year ago.
Bad debt provisions were Dollars 345m in the second quarter, compared with
Dollars 303m a year ago and Dollars 375m in the first quarter of 1992. Mr
McGillicuddy said the provision level would decline during the remainder of
the year.
Non-performing assets totalled Dollars 6.56bn at the end of June, about the
same level as a year ago and more than Dollars 300m higher than the level at
the end of March 1992.
Commercial loan write-offs during the quarter amounted to Dollars 345m, up
from Dollars 273m a year ago. If less developing country write-offs are
added the figures rise to Dollars 398m, against Dollars 759m a year ago.
Total staff at the end of last month was 39,974, down by 4,528 since the
merger was first announced last July.
On Wall Street, Chemical's share price was marked Dollars 1 lower to Dollars
36.

recovery

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in US bank earnings was further illustrated yesterday by strong
performances from regional banks in the midwest, California and the middle
Atlantic regions.
Banc One, the successful Ohio-based institution that has expanded rapidly
through acquisitions, yesterday unveiled a 30 per cent increase in
second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 181m.
Earning per share were 24.3 per cent improved at 87 cents.
Net earnings for the first six months of 1992 were Dollars 360m, up by 33.9
per cent on last year's first half.
Banc One's annualised average 1.52 per cent return on assets remained at the
highest level of US banks.
Mr John McCoy, chairman, said earnings were helped by a continued strong
interest margin, which averaged 6.53 per cent in the second quarter, against
5.83 per cent.
Mr McCoy said asset quality had improved in recent months, with
non-performing assets of Dollars 621m, up on the level of Dollars 514m in
the same period last year, but down from the Dollars 645m at the end of
March 1992.
The bank noted the figures were not directly comparable because of the
inclusion since last autumn of banks acquired in Texas.
Bad debt provisions in the second quarter were Dollars 107.5m, up from
Dollars 89.2m, but down from Dollars 160.9 at the end of March 1992. Net
loan losses were Dollars 96m, up from Dollars 66.2m a year ago and down from
Dollars 129.2m at the end of March 1992. Wall Street marked Banc One's share
price Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 44 1/4 .
Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank that saw nearly all of its 1991
profits wiped out by bad debt provisions, continued the solid recovery it
began in the opening months of 1992.
Net earnings of Dollars 82m or Dollars 1.33 per share were dramatically
better than the Dollars 14m net profit or 21 cents recorded in the second
quarter of last year.
The bank said lower bad debt provisions, higher interest income and growth
in fee income contributed to the recovery. The bad debt provision was
Dollars 300m for the second quarter, down from Dollars 350m a year ago.
Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman of Wells Fargo who came under regulatory
pressure last December to make heavy provisions on property loans, noted
that economic conditions remained 'tenuous', particularly in California. He
said loan demand was still weak and asset quality slow to recover.
For the first six months, net profit was Dollars 201m, against Dollars 166m
last time.
Wells Fargo shares fell Dollars 2 3/8 in late trading yesterday, to Dollars
70 7/8 .
Mellon Bank, based in the heart of the middle Atlantic regional economy,
unveiled a 30 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars
90m. Net earnings per share were 18 per cent higher at Dollars 1.41.
The bank's non-performing assets decreased by 5 per cent, to Dollars 825m,
while bad debt provisions were unchanged at Dollars 50m and loan losses were
Dollars 10m higher year-on-year at Dollars 66m.
Mellon, which has Dollars 30bn of assets, achieved its recovery on the back
of 18 per cent higher net interest revenues of Dollars 281m and service fee
revenues that were 5 per cent better at Dollars 199m.
Net profit for the first six months of 1992 was Dollars 176m, against
Dollars 138m last year. Mellon's share price yesterday stood at Dollars 40
1/2, down by Dollars 1/4.

AMERICAN Brands, the tobacco and consumer products conglomerate, yesterday
reported an 8.7 per cent increase in second-quarter profits, at Dollars
202.6m after tax, writes Nikki Tait.
Total revenues rose by 10.5 per cent, to Dollars 3.25bn, and net profits for
the first six months of the year were up by 11.3 per cent at Dollars 447.8m.
Yesterday, the company's chairman, Mr William Alley conceded the economic
environment had been tough, and price competition had intensified 'in almost
every market'.
Operating profit from tobacco, the largest single division, increased by 7.2
per cent in the second quarter, to Dollars 231.2m, while life insurance
profits were up by 15.9 per cent, at Dollars 42.9m. The drinks side saw the
largest profits improvement, up 35.3 per cent at Dollars 44.5m, but this
partly reflects the acquisition of seven spirit brands from Canada's Seagram
at the end of 1991.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC lifted by
special item
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ONE-TIME gain on the sale of its interests in a German television network
helped lift second-quarter net earnings at Capital Cities/ABC, the US
television and newspapers group.
The company, which includes the ABC Television network, lifted net profits
to Dollars 147.4m, against Dollars 127.8m in the second quarter of 1991.
Earnings per share were Dollars 8.84, or 16 per cent higher than Dollars
7.60 a year ago.
The net gain of Dollars 24.9m was struck on the sale of interests in Tele-5
of Germany - after being partly offset by losses incurred in the disposal of
New York property holdings and asset write-downs.
Had the one-time net gain been excluded Capital Cities/ABC would have
achieved 7 per cent higher earnings per share of Dollars 8.16.
Net revenues were 2 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.39bn, while operating income
was 8 per cent higher at Dollars 268.7m.
Earnings from ABC Television increased modestly, thanks to the absence of
staff reduction provisions recorded a year ago.
The network's revenues were slightly better, primarily because of the
broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony.
Capital Cities said its broadcasting operations were still being affected by
the recessionary environment, while operating income from broadcasting was 3
per cent ahead at Dollars 236.6m.
Video operations saw a significant rise in revenues. This was primarily
attributed to the ESPN sports cable network.
However, radio revenues were down moderately because of weak demand for
radio advertising.
Publishing revenues increased by 5.7 per cent to Dollars 273.5m, while
operating income from this division, which includes the Fairchild fashion
group, was Dollars 40.1m, up sharply from Dollars 28.1m.
For the first six months of 1992 net profits were Dollars 189.3m, 2 per cent
higher on the first half of 1991.
On Wall Street, the Capital Cities/ABC share price was Dollars 5 lower at
Dollars 441 in late trading.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Outlook grim for US property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, concludes in a gloomy study of the
US property market that it will take about 12 years to absorb all the vacant
office space across the country.
The study reveals 'a nation that is awash in vacancies' and says there is
ample justification for the bearish state of the development and
construction industries.
The survey reports there are 62 sq ft of empty office space for every US
office worker and close to 52 sq ft of unoccupied shop floor for every
industrial worker.
Across the US, Coopers &amp; Lybrand says 1m hotel rooms a day are unfilled and
the equivalent of 3,800 shopping centres stand idle.
'These numbers indicate just how pervasive and enduring a problem was caused
by the massive overbuilding of the last decade,' said Mr Bjorn Hanson,
chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's national real estate division.
The report summarises significant land uses throughout the country across
property types, and it charts inventories, vacancy rates and the outlook.
The worst surfeit of space is among office properties, where the national
vacancy rate now exceeds 19 per cent. Absorption of vacant office space will
take at least 12 years and even under the most optimistic scenario, Coopers
&amp; Lybrand forecasts it will be 1999 before there is a return to traditional
rate of vacancy.
The hotel segment is about four years away from its normal supply-demand
equilibrium, in spite of the fact that its vacancy level of 38.7 per cent is
only running at 4.7 percentage points above the traditional rate.
On the industrial side, the survey concludes it will take three years at
current absorption rates to shave the segment's 9.7 per cent vacancy rate
back to more traditional levels of 5 per cent to 7 per cent.
An economic recovery would do little to help the retail segment, where the
study notes it will take at least three years to fill enough empty store
fronts to bring double-digit vacancies back to a normal range.
By far the brightest spot on the horizon for the property market is on the
residential side, where Coopers &amp; Lybrand finds potential tenants and owners
at least outnumber the available housing stock. Both single-family and
apartment occupancy could return to normal within a year if consumer
confidence continues to recover, according to the study.

CREDITANSTALT, the big Austrian bank, has announced a 13 per cent decline to
Sch1.3bn (Dollars 124.5m) in operating profit for the first half of 1992.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman, said the fall reflected the sharp rise in
short-term interest rates and the weakness of the Vienna stock market.
However, he predicted better results for the remainder of the year.
Partial operating earnings, which do not include profit from the bank's
own-account trading, declined 9.5 per cent to Sch845m. However, several of
Creditanstalt's regional banking subsidiaries managed higher profits.
Creditanstalt's performance is understood to be better than that of its
leading domestic rivals, however.
Bank Austria, the largest financial institution in the country, saw partial
profit drop 15 per cent in the six months, while GiroCredit has reportedly
suffered an even steeper setback. Neither of the two banks has yet published
results.

PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, snacks and fast-food restaurant group,
yesterday unveiled a 20 per cent improvement in second-quarter net profits,
with strong gains in overseas markets.
Net income for the three months to June 13 totalled Dollars 383m, or 48
cents a share, compared with Dollars 318.3m, or 39 cents, in the same period
last year. Sales advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 5.21bn.
Mr Wayne Calloway, chief executive, said earnings momentum had been based on
'strong and balanced operating results, with all three lines of business
achieving double-digit growth in both their US and international
operations'.
PepsiCo saw a 9 per cent increase in soft drink sales to Dollars 3.42bn,
with international sales for the division surging 18 per cent to Dollars
926.9m. Operating profits for the division rose 8 per cent to Dollars
452.2m.
PepsiCo's snack foods operations had operating profits of Dollars 459.1m, up
20 per cent, on sales which rose 8 per cent to Dollars 2.74bn. The
improvement was driven by strong gains overseas, where operating profits
soared 39 per cent to Dollars 125.5m.
For the first half, PepsiCo posted a 19 per cent gain in net income to
Dollars 624.5m, or 78 cents a share, on sales which rose 11 per cent to
Dollars 9.8bn.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowabunga] Risc management for Turtles -
Michiyo Nakamoto details the growth of a small semiconductor company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sophisticated electronics which allowed the film puppet versions of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon characters to smile and say
'cowabunga]' was developed by a small British company based in Cambridge.
Advanced Risc Machines, founded two years ago, developed the reduced
instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors which are at the heart of
computer controls inside the Turtles enabling the puppets to talk, pout,
blink and snarl.
ARM's risc chips were recently chosen by Apple, the US computer company, for
its new consumer gadget, an all-in-one portable electronic notebook, word
processor, fax machine and computer.
The success of the company, which has only 30 employees, is an impressive
achievement in an age when large and powerful semiconductor manufacturers
have been suffering in the face of intense competition and sharp price falls
in certain product areas.
It also turns on its head the notion that the UK is infertile ground for
nurturing entrepreneurial high technology companies.
The company was born out of one very good idea - a chip which offered high
performance at low cost and low power consumption. These characteristics
make the ARM chip ideal for portable products made in large volume, such as
small consumer electronics devices.
The chip was originally developed at Acorn, the UK computer offshoot of
Olivetti, the Italian computer and office equipment group.
Although International Business Machines invented risc chips in the early
1980s, ARM claims its original chip was the first to be commercially
available.
It was extremely popular among outside engineers, including a group at Apple
who liked the fact that it was easy to write software for it.
Acorn, faced with increasing development costs, decided to spin off the chip
into a joint venture, which was ARM.
Acorn retained 46 per cent, Apple held 46 per cent and VLSI Technology, a US
manufacturer of semiconductors, which had been a licensee of the technology,
had a minority holding.
The presence of Apple and Olivetti in the background helped open a few doors
to the budding company.
Nevertheless, much of the credit for ARM's success goes to the business
philosophy of Mr Robin Saxby, managing director, who was recruited to head
the group from European Silicon Structures where he was managing director.
The business model that Saxby adopted and which has enabled ARM to grow, is
one more commonly seen among small entrepreneurial companies in Silicon
Valley than in the UK.
Mr Saxby calls it 'partnering in multiple dimensions'. It is a strategy of
forming wide-ranging partnerships which enables ARM to concentrate mainly on
design, leaving other companies to provide additional expertise.
Each member brings to the partnership their own strengths and nobody does
what someone else can do better, Mr Saxby says.
ARM itself will research, design and develop its products. Its partners will
look after the manufacturing, which is a capital intensive undertaking that
can be of considerable risk for a small company, and much of the marketing
and sales efforts. It will, however, train its partners' sales personnel
intensively.
ARM licenses its technology to outside semiconductor companies but the
relationship goes considerably beyond the conventional one between
manufacturer and subcontractor.
The manufacturers, which Mr Saxby calls ARM's 'semiconductor product
partners', work with ARM on joint design, serve as its worldwide marketing
and sales force and provide local support.
For example, VLSI and GEC Plessey Semiconductors which are are the present
licensed manufactures, also market ARM's products. As a result ARM has
already been supplying chips to Japan where it does not yet have a presence.
ARM also works with universities on long-term research and development. It
is working with a group at Manchester University on advanced ARM
architecture ideas.
These partnerships are a large asset for a small upstart. 'We're the little
David fighting the big Goliath but sometimes the little guy can win
particularly if he has some big friends,' Mr Saxby says.
The strategy of using whatever outside resources it can, if it can do so
more effectively, extends to research funding.
Because the company has a modest budget it has put a lot of effort into
winning public funding for long-term research.
For example, ARM is a partner in a project that is being funded by the Open
Microsystems Initiative, an EC programme worth Ecu65m (Pounds 46m).
It has avoided the pitfall of many innovative companies of having brilliant
technologies but not being able to market them successfully, by sticking to
a strictly customer-driven business strategy.
While the company will research and develop technologies, it will wait until
it has found a specific customer who needs to turn those technologies into a
product, rather than implement them for their own sake.
'That is how you penetrate markets,' Mr Saxby says.
For now, ARM is focusing on those products where it has an edge, the ARM
chip and its family of related products.
The company is setting its sights on the Japanese market where it sees
potential in high volume portable consumer products in which Japanese
electronics companies are showing increasing interest.
For the Japanese, the ARM partnering strategy also provides a way for them
to achieve potential synergies, Mr Saxby says.
A series of presentations it made in Japan recently attracted huge crowds
and it expects to announce a licensing agreement with a Japanese chip
manufacturer by the end of the year.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reuters plans global TV expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters said yesterday that its 10-year television partnership with NBC
would allow it to explore new opportunities in global television with its US
partner, writes Andrew Bolger.
It will buy out minority stakes in Visnews, the international television
news agency, held by NBC and the BBC and eventually aims to put together its
conventional news agency operation with Visnews to form the world's largest
reporting network.
Visnews will continue to produce mainly raw news feeds to existing
programmes and networks, although it already produces some complete
programmes of its own.
It has 454 staff worldwide while Reuters has 1,100 reporters and
photographers.

Radius, the USM-traded computer systems and maintenance group, reported
profits of Pounds 525,000 before tax for the six months to May 31.
The outcome compared with Pounds 801,000 in the corresponding half but
marked a sharp improvement over the second six months of last year when
profits, before exceptional items, amounted to just Pounds 141,000.
Mr Michael Roberts, chairman, said the latest upturn reflected tightened
operational controls and cost reductions.
Turnover declined Pounds 12m (Pounds 14.7m) following 'recessionary
pressures' and the discontinuation of loss-making activities.
Earnings per share fell from 1.7p to 1p, but the interim dividend is

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King pushes case to Morland holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENE KING, the Suffolk-based brewer, yesterday pressed its bid for
Morland, its Thames Valley rival, with a reminder to its target's
shareholders of the 'substantial financial benefits' available under the
offer which closes on Friday.
These include a threefold increase, from 11.2p to 33.75p, in gross annual
income and a capital uplift of nearly 50 per cent, Greene King said.
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King chairman, maintained that the offer - worth
484p in convertible preference shares or 450p cash - was generous.
Greene King's share price has increased from 507p to 520p since it announced
its offer. Over the same period, the regional brewers' index has fallen by
more than 11 per cent and the FT-SE 100 has fallen by more than 10 per cent.
'This strong performance indicates that the stock market does not give any
credence to what we consider to be the misdirected criticisms of Greene King
and its management which Morland's board has been making,' Mr Redman added.
Greene King said last week that it had control of 46.9 per cent of Morland's
shares.
Yesterday, however, SG Warburg, on behalf of Morland shareholders, lodged
with Greene King notices of withdrawal in respect of 223,408 shares
previously assented to the offer. They amount to 1.05 per cent of Morland's
issued share capital and bring the number of withdrawals lodged since July
14 to 322,522 shares or 1.52 per cent of Morland's share capital.

Abtrust Scotland Investment, which concentrates its portfolio principally in
unlisted Scottish companies, reported a net asset value of 32.2p as at May
31 - a rise of 5.2 per cent over the year.
Mr Calum MacLeod, chairman, said the north-east of Scotland had 'appeared to

the trust committed funding of more than Pounds 700,000 to three
investments, all in the Grampian region.
Net revenue rose to Pounds 258,645 (Pounds 223,072), equal to earnings of
0.77p (0.75p) per share on the increased capital. The single dividend for
the year goes up from 0.55p to 0.6p.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Reuters share price cut by sluggish revenue outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Reuters Holdings closed 25p lower at 1126p yesterday after the
international financial information and news company was unable to predict
any improvement in its revenue growth rate.
The group reported a 10.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
187.4m for the six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 748.4m, a rise of
6 per cent.
However, the profits figure was boosted by a jump in interest received from
Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 32.5m. Operating profit before interest rose by 4.5
per cent, to Pounds 154.7m.
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said there had been a slowdown in revenue
growth, as forecast, largely reflecting the lower level of orders taken for
the group's financial information services last year. He added: 'While there
is a modest improvement in the order level, this is being offset by measures
we are taking to fortify our long-term market position. These include
packaging of new facilities into existing services free of charge where
previously we might have sold them for an extra fee.'
Phase two of Dealing 2000, the automated foreign exchange trading system,
and Globex, the screen trading system for futures and options, were proving
themselves technically, but the extent of their contribution to revenue
could not yet be gauged.
Reuters also announced plans to increase its role in television by
establishing a joint venture with NBC of the US and taking full control of
Visnews, the international television news agency.
The UK-based group already owns 51 per cent of Visnews and will acquire
NBC's 37.5 per cent. It has also agreed in principle to buy the BBC's 11.25
per cent share of the agency, but declined to say how much it was paying for
the minorities.
Mr Job said: 'We intend to invest in television and make Visnews a more
powerful force by extending its operations into Reuters' network of 118
reporting bureaux worldwide.'
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, the television
production and services group, is joining the board of Reuters as a
non-executive director.
Reuters' earnings per share increased 11.4 per cent to 30.3p (27.2p), and
the interim dividend rose by 12.8 per cent to 5.3p (4.7p)

FT  22 JUL 92 / SmithKline Beecham lifts profits 10%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYANT pharmaceutical sales helped SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs
and consumer products group, report pre-tax profits up 10 per cent from
Pounds 230m to Pounds 254m for the second quarter.
Sales increased 9 per cent from Pounds 1.155bn to Pounds 1.261bn. However,
both sales and profits benefited from favourable exchange rates: at
comparable rates, sales and profits would have been 4 per cent and 5 per
cent higher.
Earnings per share and per equity unit, following a share split in the UK
this month, were up 12 per cent to 6.2p and 11.7 cents.
Mr Robert Bauman, chief executive, said: 'We are particularly pleased with
the performance of pharmaceuticals. Our strong marketing capacity has
allowed us to expand existing products and successfully launch new ones.'
He pointed to the success of Relafen, a new arthritis treatment which was
launched in the US in February. The drug had worldwide sales of Pounds 40m
for the first half of the year. Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic, increased
24 per cent during the first quarter at constant exchange rates.
Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug, fell 2 per cent.
Mr Bauman said the company still lacked marketing depth in Japan, the
world's second largest market. The group would look to expand its sales
force and set up more co-marketing agreements with indigenous companies.
Sales from pharmaceuticals increased 13 per cent from Pounds 607m to Pounds
686m. The division's trading profits rose 7 per cent from Pounds 163m to
Pounds 176m, while margins declined from 26.8 per cent to 25.6 per cent. The
company said this was caused by increased spending on marketing to support
the introduction of new products.
Sales of consumer brands rose 7 per cent from Pounds 331m to Pounds 355m.
Trading profits increased 14 per cent from Pounds 49m to Pounds 56m. Margins
improved through better sales and sales of non-core operations.
Mr Bauman said the group had been disposing of products which were not
health-related or were not growing sufficiently fast.
Operating profits at the animal health division fell 25 per cent from Pounds
14m to Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 76m (Pounds 77m). Clinical
laboratories' trading profits increased 15 per cent from Pounds 19m to
Pounds 21m on turnover of Pounds 144m (Pounds 140m).
The company proposed a second interim dividend of 2.075p (1.875p) per
ordinary share and 5.279 cents (4.216 cents) per equity unit.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Staying on at work becomes an old fashion in the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKING PAST the age of 55 is going out of fashion in the industrialised
world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
In Italy, only 10.9 per cent of men of that age work, compared with 33 per
cent in Britain, 28 per cent in France and 37 per cent in the US, the OECD's
latest Employment Outlook reports. The exception is Japan, where 60 per cent
of men aged 55 and over work.
The figures for women in this age group in the UK and Japan are about half
of the men's - at 15.7 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. In France, it
is 17.6 per cent.
The OECD does not approve of this waste of resources. It says that 20 years
ago in most industrial countries between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of men
aged 55 and over worked. The figure now is on average between 20 per cent
and 35 per cent.
This is one reason for the high levels of what the OECD calls
'non-employment' - referring to people of working age who are either
unemployed or not taking part in the labour market.
The OECD blames government social security rules, occupational pension
schemes and a big increase in people covered by sickness and invalidity
schemes for the drift away from the labour market by older workers.
To minimise conflict with employees and unions, the OECD says, companies
have designed redundancy packages which allow people to retire at 53 or 54
with almost the same benefits as if they were to work until 60.
The OECD complains that this is throwing away valuable skills and calls for
more flexible retirement ages. But a senior official at the Department of
Employment said attempts to lure older workers back into jobs in the late
1980s had been unsuccessful.
'We had a furious reaction when we suggested to older people that they might
take jobs rather than just stay at home receiving benefit,' he said.
Concern, the UK charity, maintains that the OECD figures are further
evidence of discrimination against older people.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Top civil servant forced out after clashes with minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Kemp, the top civil servant who masterminded the introduction of
private sector management techniques into the civil service, has been forced
to take early retirement after disagreements with Mr William Waldegrave, the
public service minister, it emerged last night.
As part of a Whitehall shake-up, Downing Street will today announce that Sir
Peter, the permanent secretary who heads the Office of Public Service and
Science, is to retire two years before the normal civil service retirement
age of 60.
Sir Peter first came to prominence as project manager for the Next Steps
programme, under which civil service functions are being hived off into
arms' length executive agencies.
He was appointed to his present job less than three months ago, when his
department was set up after the general election to oversee the government's
plans to shake up the civil service and push forward the Citizen's Charter.
There have been persistent rumours of clashes between Sir Peter, Mr
Waldegrave and Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, who is
attached to the OPSS.
Mr Waldegrave is understood to have told Mr Major that he could no longer
work with Sir Peter. In the absence of a suit-able alternative post, early
retirement was seen as the only option.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division
Civil Servants, last night described Sir Peter's departure after such
disagreements as 'unprecedented'.
'Those who talk about civil servants having a job for life are clearly
ignorant of the realities of the modern civil service,' she said.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Baghdad's defiance of UN team raises possibility of
air-attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR-STRIKE by the Gulf war allies against targets in Iraq is more likely
now than at any time since the war because of Baghdad's defiance of United
Nations weapons inspectors, US and British officials said yesterday.
But Iraq's UN ambassador said dropping 'a bomb or two' on Baghdad or any
other city would not force his country to let the weapons inspectors search
its agriculture ministry.
Diplomats at the UN said there was unanimity among the 15 members of the
Security Council that Iraq could not be allowed to get away with barring the
weapons team from a ministry building in Baghdad. In the face of increasing
harassment, relays of inspectors have parked outside the building for 17
days.
The US, Britain and France have begun consultations on possible use of force
unless Iraq yields.
The revival of a serious military option follows growing concern and
frustration, not just at Iraq's defiance of the inspectors, but also at
other rebuffs to the UN and a spate of attacks on UN guards in northern
Iraq.
Furthermore, US officials said the Security Council was determined not to be
seen as a pushover during tense operations in Cambodia and the former
Yugoslavia. 'The council is not at this point going to allow itself to be
regarded as a pussycat,' one diplomat said.
Sir David Hannay, British ambassador to the UN, said publicly on Monday that
military action against Iraq had not been ruled out. In private, British
officials said UN patience with Iraq was running out. They believe an
air-strike could be made without further UN resolutions.
Nevertheless, US and British diplomats in New York shied away from reported
comments by an anonymous Security Council diplomat suggesting that a strike
against Iraq was 'inevitable' and would take place within 10 days.
Dismissing the military threat, Mr Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador,
told reporters: 'The use of force would undermine the authority of the
council because, I tell you, it is not going to change the Iraqi position.
'Throwing a bomb or two, whether on Baghdad or here or there, is not going
to change (matters). To the contrary, it shows that the council, without the
co-operation of the Iraqi government, cannot do much.'
The raised tension came amid unconfirmed reports that Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein had been assassinated. The reports, filed originally by the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency, were apparently prompted by interruption in normal
service on Baghdad radio yesterday morning, when programmes were replaced by
readings from the Koran. But normal service resumed yesterday afternoon and
there was nothing to confirm the rumours.

As Europe embarks on its hols, spare a thought for the poor Russian
motorist.
Petrol stations are few, and filling up the family car can often involve
several hours' queueing. Indeed, some towns near Moscow have been known to
ban the sale of petrol to visitors from the capital in order to conserve
their own scarce supplies of fuel.
Hence, it comes as no surprise to learn that farmers in the Kursk region are
turning to a more reliable and purer source of horsepower. The price of a
'good workhorse' has been rising sharply. It is now between 15,000 and
20,000 roubles, or between Dollars 110 and Dollars 150. That may not sound a
lot by western standards, but it is three or four months' salary for local
people.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
You won't find the name of 44-year-old Sarosh Zaiwalla in Who's Who or
Debrett's People of Today, but when it comes to Britain's growing network of
Asian millionaires, Zaiwalla is better connected than most.
His latest venture, putting together Europe's first Hindi-language satellite
TV station, is a reminder of how easily he flits between the worlds of
international big business, showbiz and politics.
Zaiwalla, senior partner in his own London law firm, has been hovering
around the fringes of the Conservative party for several years but first
came to national attention when he organised a pre-election 'power dinner'
for Asian businessmen at Number 10.
Now he is giving the same sort of attention to TV Asia, a Pounds 7m project
which brings together Faisal Sherjan, Pakistan's TV king, a wealthy
politician close to Benazir Bhutto, and Ajitabh Bachchan (brother of Indian
movie star Amitabh).
Like many lawyers, he finds no difficulty juggling a sometimes controversial
client list, which includes Bachchan (for whom he acted in the Bofors arms
controversy), Greek shipowners, and some of the more wealthy BCCI
depositors. The Indian government is an ex-client; relations soured with New
Delhi after a tiff over unpaid fees of Pounds 350,000. M'learned friends
have been instructed.
And could there be a starring role for him on TV-Asia? Hosting a show on
legal problems would seem a fitting choice.

Michael Green's arrival on the Reuters' board is an important step in the
City's rehabilitation of a whiz-kid who had been almost written off two
years ago.
Unlike some of the shooting stars of the bull market in the late 1980s the
44-year-old chairman of Carlton Communications has shown real staying power.
Two years ago Carlton's shares collapsed after the market latched on to a
cautious trading statement, but Green, an old friend of Gerald Ratner and
Charles Saatchi, persevered and won the London weekday ITV franchise from
Thames.
His standing in the City should rise further now that Reuters' chairman Sir
Christopher Hogg has given his stamp of approval.

The skirmish in the normally friendly world of motor dealers is turning
nasty. T Cowie, bidding Pounds 26m for Henlys, is going through the usual
process of condemning Henlys' management, rubbishing its strategy and
picking apart its businesses.
So why, puzzles Robert Wood, Henlys' chief executive, if Henlys is such a
dud outfit, did Gordon Hodgson, chief executive at Cowie, twice buy Henlys
shares for his PEP last year and this?
Hodgson is, by the way, showing a tidy profit on the shares.

Having failed to tempt Paul Dacre to leave the Mail stable for the editor's
chair at The Times, is Rupert Murdoch now going to give the helm of his UK
flagship newspaper to an insider?
Although Rupert Pennant-Rea, who followed News International chairman Andrew
Knight into the editor's chair at the Economist, is rumoured to have been
sighted near The Times' Wapping HQ, an emerging favourite seems to be deputy
editor Peter Stothard, a protege of former Sunday Times editor, Harry Evans.
It would certainly be a relief for those Times hacks who feared that the
likes of Dacre would drag the ship far too downmarket.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Observer: Nelson loses his touch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who's to blame for the peculiar affair of the too successful National
Savings Bond? It is rare indeed for the government to be pushed around by a
building society, let alone a second division one.
Did the authorities just get the rate wrong or did they, more seriously,
underestimate the sheer scale of protest? A post-mortem need not take too
long. For a start, there is no point in blaming the poor old National
Savings movement. It is doing everything the government wanted. Besides
having more than doubled its contribution to Treasury coffers, it is
behaving remarkably commercially, helped by the presence on its board of
Mark St Giles and Roy Heape, two leading lights in the UK unit trust
industry.
No one can sensibly argue that the people running National Savings had no
feel for the likely impact of any rate move. They knew what they were doing,
as the government should have. If the Treasury was unsure, it could have
tapped the chancellor's old adviser, Alastair Ross Goobey, who sits on the
board of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, which has been
kicking up all the fuss.
Clearly, the government had access to plenty of advice but ignored it. If
anyone is to carry the can, it is Tony Nelson, the ex-Slater Walker hand,
who is now Treasury economic secretary and the minister responsible for
National Savings.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Transport in Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY HAS a UK government agonised so long and hard about an apparently
simple question. But where to relocate 2,000 Department of the Environment
civil servants will ultimately be decided by Downing Street, after scrutiny
by a special sub-committee containing five Cabinet ministers.
Two years ago, in its enthusiasm for private sector funding of
infrastructure projects, the government persuaded Olympia &amp; York, creators
of the biggest development in London's Docklands, Canary Wharf, to
contribute Pounds 400m to the Pounds 1.7bn cost of extending the Jubilee
line into east London. Since the value of Canary Wharf would rise if it were
linked to central London by underground, it seemed fair that the project's
owners should help pay for the line. In fact, the Pounds 400m was to be
staggered over many decades. If the payments were made in one lump, they
would be worth only Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m.
In the event, Canary Wharf's capacity to pay even its modest contribution
has been undermined by its financial difficulties. It is now in the control
of administrators, who are under no legal obligation to make the
contribution. Yet the Treasury has insisted there will be no Jubilee line if
the sums are not paid in full.
The administrators acknowledge that Canary Wharf is more likely to re-emerge
as a going concern if the line is built. But they feel they have only one
source of funds for a first tranche of the payment: the government itself.
Two months ago, the government disclosed that it had chosen Docklands as the
new home for officials of the Department of the Environment and that it had
a short-list of three possible sites, including Canary Wharf. Thereupon the
administrators offered either to sell a building to the government and
afterwards remit the proceeds for the Jubilee line or lease the building,
refinance it and again remit the proceeds.
In this way, what should have been a straightforward evaluation of the value
for money offered by the three buildings has become embroiled in far bigger
issues. A further complication is the government's fear that it will be
accused of bailing out a friend, if it moves to Canary Wharf.
What must the government do?
First, whether or not to relocate civil servants must be kept separate from
decisions about transport investment in London as a whole. Relocation of the
civil servants seems to make sense, however, because of the low rent.
Second, whether or not a developer makes a modest contribution should not
determine the line's fate. The government must, instead, do what has never
been properly done: assess whether the benefits of the Jubilee line outweigh
the costs.
Third, any evaluation must take account of the additional transportation
that is on the way. By this time next year, the completion of a Pounds
1.65bn road-building programme will enable traffic to pour into the area. In
addition, the Docklands Light Railway will have been converted into a mass
transit system at a cost of Pounds 800m.
The government should make its decisions in the light of the future
interests, first, of taxpayers at large and, second, of people who live or
work in London, whose concerns also include the sensible long-term planning
of the capital. All else - not least the prestige of those who promoted
Docklands and the money sunk into it - should be disregarded.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Trip a heavy Finn tango - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY colleague Christopher Dunkley is away on holiday, so I have been drafted
in again to take his place on the historic green sofa. Invariably, people in
the gallery world which is my usual beat react with moues of sympathetic
disgust when they hear I am switching to pictures that move. In public at
least, the super-refined Courtauld graduate still feels it necessary to
react as if television was a dirty word.
And besides, hasn't everyone heard ad infinitum that British TV is going
down the drain? But after a week of square-eying, my impression is that
there is an extraordinary amount on the box which rates not just as
passable, but as good, even memorably good.
Admittedly, the circumstances of a TV critic are special. There, stacked up
on the carpet, is the pick of seven days' viewing. The dormouse factor
becomes no obstacle to sampling, for example, Tuesday's Donahue, an
after-midnight discussion which involved 'a 33-year-old virgin, with a
doctor's certificate to prove it, who is looking for a man'.
The awesome responsibility of taking on Mr Dunkley's job necessarily means
one's tastes become far more catholic. I marvel at what a prodigiously
well-stocked mind he must have. All of us construct ring-fences to keep out
subjects we believe do not interest us, when in reality it is just a way of
keeping some kind of grasp on the things that do. Cut even a modest hole in
the fence, and it is amazing the things which clamber inside.
Take Finland, a country which I admit ordinarily slips off my mental map -
although it edged back on a few years back, after I learned that they have a
weekly news broadcast in Latin. But Finland will truly never seem quite the
same again after the excellent and howlingly funny Tango in a Minor Key
(Saturday, BBC 2), part of the long-running Rhythms of the World.
Tango is big in Finland, and has been ever since 1913. Since 1940, it seems
tango has become a national obsession, spiced a little with rock for the new
generation, but still playing a crucial role in Finnish popular culture -
not least, in putting shy Finnish man in touch with Finnish woman.
Aki Kaurismaki, Finland's top film-maker, sat hunched beside a birch-tree
and a lake, fag in hand. The tango, he assured the interviewer, actually
originated in Finland; Argentina only copied it. He uses it in every film he
makes - and given Mr Kaurismaki's philosophy of life, they sound like
Bergman crossed with Busby Berkeley. He says: 'When you walk on this earth
you have to be serious all the time. I hate people who laugh. It goes in my
ears. That's why I never laugh.'
Tango does not make Finns laugh, or even smile. But on the endless summer
nights it attracts Finns to wooden community huts in the forest, ringed by
car-parks and hot-dog and booze-stands.
Inside, men of all ages sit along on one side on a bench, wearing
short-sleeved shirts and expressions ranging from gloom to fury. The women
face them on the opposite bench. An electronic display-board announces which
sex has the honour of asking for a dance. And you must accept unless the
prospective partner is drunk - which is fairly often the case.
No one talks. Finns 'are not prone to engage in small talk.' No one laughs.
It is not hard to dance the Finnish tango, which is marked lentissimo - like
life itself, after all. The lyrics are pretty much the same as popular music
everywhere, about love'n'death, except for a particular attachment to songs
about following the birds and escaping across the endless water to a blessed
isle.
An island with palm trees, as it would seem from the painted backdrops.
Singers are, if possible, even more lymphatically sad than their audiences.
Reigo Tappale used to be a poor wood-chopper, but for decades he has been
the king of Tango. His recipe for success is 'not just to stand there
thinking of breakfast' and to take the lyrics very seriously indeed.
But Tappale does just stand there and belt it out. Gyrating would be seen as
unserious. Besides, there is the great example set by the Tango singer of
all time, Olavi Virta, who died in 1966. His gift, as an enthusiast
explained, was to express the very soul of his native land. Plus: 'he had
enormous personal difficulties, also typical of Finland'.
It seems that Virta's records still sell in huge quantities. How huge we
were not told; if I have a criticism of this glorious programme, it was the
absence of figures to back up the claim for tango's dominant position in
Finnish cultural life. Do the people who lap up the Latin broadcast, also
tune into the tango programmes on Radio Suomi?
There was something surprisingly down-beat about Robert Hughes's Barcelona,
the Omnibus special (Thursday, BBC 1). This was billed as a personal
exploration of the city by Mr Hughes, renowned Australian cultural historian
and art critic for Time magazine. He fell in love with Barcelona in 1968.
But the tenor of the film suggested that either the love affair has cooled
and Mr Hughes would rather be somewhere else, or he has a streak of the
Finnish temperament.
There was no excitement in what he had to say about Barcelona. The film was
lumbered with an over-long historical introduction pitched at the level of
the tourist hand-out. Hughes's more idiosyncratic contributions amounted to
not a lot, and were dominated by the splenetic reactions of the art critic.
He visited a post-modernist night-club where spikey balls are hung under the
table to ladder your tights. As proof of Barcelona's 'obsession with
design', he evoked the nightly cruising of Barcelonans to admire the neat
surgery on the bodies of transvestite prostitutes. He hosted a dinner-party
where a miscellaneous bunch of Barcelona intellectuals all spoke at once and
rubbished Gaud's church of La Sagrada Familia.
Then he left town, pausing to attack the shoddy design and dirty windows at
the new airport. Hard to see what makes that a distinctively, revealingly,
Barcelonan phenomenon.
Two consecutive programmes in the Secret History series (Channel 4, Monday,
9pm) have been well-made and and informative. Last week's dealt with October
17 1961 in Paris. Bystanders, journalists and policemen recalled what
happened when police (headed by Maurice Pappon, now under investigation for
wartime complicity in the deportation of Jews) brutally attacked Algerian
demonstrators.
The police fired on the demonstration, made 11,000 arrests, and then
continued over days to torture and kill the prisoners. Bodies were found
floating down the Seine. It is widely thought that there were 50 deaths,
although the official figure remains at only two. However, with the growth
of support for Le Pen, the massacre is now beginning to be marked as a day
worthy of commemoration.
The Last Days of Aldo Moro, this week, was quite as interesting. The extra
fillip came from interviews with Red Brigades terrorists who were involved
in Moro's kidnap and eventual murder. The executioner spoke from his caged
interview room, but the mastermind of operations who wanted to talk, was
forbidden to take part by the prison authorities.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Montreal Jazz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAROLD VON KURSK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT would be difficult to imagine a more successful festival on any level
than this year's Montreal international jazz festival. Held earlier this
month, it not only attracted street crowds estimated at 1.3m, but it also
showed how a musical form that originated with black performers in the
southern US has gone on to influence a variety of styles.
The festival was a tribute to the diversity of jazz, ranging from the blues
and boogie riffs of John Lee Hooker, the soaring tenor sax of Sonny Rollins
and the guitar wizardry of Al Dimeola, to the Sinatra-like vocals and
arrangements of John Pizzarelli and the piano of Oliver Jones and Paul Bley.
It also stretched musical boundaries, to include hard rock (the Jeff Healey
band) and world beat (King Sunny Ade).
There were indoor performances at the Place des Arts, the concert hall where
Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra traditionally hold court,
while several streets in the centre were closed to accommodate massive
crowds at free evening concerts.
Festival founders Andre Menard and Alain Simard deserve much of the credit
for laying on such a musical outpouring in Montreal, a city which had a rich
jazz and blues history in the 40s and 50s.
The performances themselves testified to the organisers' ability to attract
some of the top artists from across the jazz spectrum. Montreal jazz
audiences are noted for their sophistication, so the musicians enjoy the
venue as a place where they can reach the true aficionado.
Heading the festival was the much-heralded appearance of John Lee Hooker,
marking a stop on what the black boogie master has described 'as my last
tour'.
At the age of 74, Hooker's guitar work has slowed to a brief series of nasty
riffs, but his voice has not deserted him. Stepping on stage in dark
sunglasses and a Thirties-style hat, Hooker sang and played a number of
classic tunes. Most remarkable was a version of 'Crawling Kingsnake' that
revived memories of the ageing bluesman's powerful legacy. 'There's not a
lot of us left,' said Hooker, acknowledging that most of the great
performers of his era - John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk, for example - have
been dead for many years.
Hooker's set was preceded by a lively session from Charles Brown, a
marvellous piano player who has laboured largely in obscurity over the
years. Although he is only four years younger than Hooker, Brown's piano
playing was impressively animated and his singing just as outstanding. Brown
and his four-piece band tore through a series of blues, jazz and boogie
selections that left the audience, almost all of whom had come to hear
Hooker, begging for more.
Not as inspired however was the concert given by Branford Marsalis (brother
of the much-deified Wynton), which had none of the energy and rapport with
the crowd that the much older Brown and Hooker were able to generate.
Without question, Marsalis is a virtuoso saxophonist, yet his Montreal
session lacked the electricity his reputation might have suggested. This
jazzman was simply too cool.
One of the great discoveries of the festival was John Pizzarelli, who played
nightly at the Club Soda, a 300-seat venue whose intimate surroundings
perfectly suited the ebullient lounge-lizard charisma of Pizzarelli. The
32-year-old American performed with the effortless grace of a Sinatra and
moved through classic tunes such as 'My Baby Just Cares for Me', 'My Blue
Heaven', and 'The More I See You', with such poise that one felt thrown back
to an earlier era of big bands, bobby-soxers, and the crooners of yesterday.
Pizzarelli's shows were sold out continuously through the festival, and
local reviewers were wildly enthusiastic about his musical grace and
abundant charm. His father was Bucky Pizzarelli, a noted guitarist who
played with Benny Goodman and whose living-room guests often included Joe
Pass, Zoot Sims, and Les Paul. 'I grew up with Forties music in the house,
so it just became a part of me,' said the younger Pizzarelli.
Other highlights of the festival included the magnificent improvisational
sets of Montreal-born pianist Paul Bley, George Benson's smooth guitar set,
and a hellish session from Sonny Rollins, generally acknowledged as the
finest tenor sax player of his generation.
Rollins' eerie intensity enthralled the sold-out hall, many of whose
spectators had waited to hear Rollins again, three years after his last
performance at the festival. It takes a musician of Rollins' rare genius to
show that music can reach new levels of mood and meaning when played with
such hypnotic touch. Every festival needs an artist of this dimension, and
the Montreal event, as on every other count, did not disappoint.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: A case of sink or swim -
Politicians and businessmen are working together to clean up the
Mediterranean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the dust settles on last month's Earth Summit in Rio, environmentalists
are shifting their focus from global to regional issues in a series of
post-Rio gatherings designed to assess the implications of the summit for
specific parts of the globe.
The first big meeting of its kind came earlier this month, with a two-day
conference of business and political leaders to discuss ways of improving
environmental protection in the Mediterranean without sacrificing industrial
development and growth.
Organised by the Aspen Institute in Italy, the meeting, appropriately held
on a cruise liner sailing between Genoa and Corsica, brought together
environmental luminaries such as Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European
Community's Commissioner for the Environment until earlier this month, and
Giorgio Ruffulo, the former Italian environment minister, whose job Ripa di
Meana has just taken.
Among the senior businessmen present were Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of
Italy's state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, while the whole affair
was chaired by Gianni De Michelis, Italy's former foreign minister.
The Mediterranean is a test case for many wider environmental issues,
notably oil and marine pollution. Aspen rules mean all discussion is off the
record, and delegates cannot be quoted.
However, as one senior Egyptian floridly, noted: 'We, the 17 countries of
the Mediterranean basin are hosts and guests, serving and being served at
the one common round table, the sea, our common but colourful dish. We get
what we produce and what we present; whatever we give to the sea, it gives
back to us, multiplied and magnified; if good we reap the best and if bad we
harvest the worst.'
The Mediterranean's problems are immediately apparent. Three years ago,
millions of holidaymakers curtailed their seaside vacations unexpectedly as
an army of summertime algae invaded Adriatic beaches. The problem has not
recurred, at least as severely, but the Mediterranean continues to serve as
one of the world's biggest liquid dustbins.
Some 120 coastal cities discharge their sewage into its waters, around 85
per cent of it untreated. It is estimated that 24 per cent of Mediterranean
beaches are unsuitable for swimming because of the sewage risk alone.
Meanwhile, within the cocktail of industrial waste finding its way into the
sea are around 120,000 tonnes of mineral oils, 60,000 tonnes of detergents,
3,800 tonnes of lead, 2,400 tonnes of chromium and 100 tonnes of mercury.
Intensive agriculture in countries bordering the Mediterranean means that
huge quantities of farm chemicals also drain into the sea. And estimates of
other chemical discharges include 800,000 tonnes of phosphorous, 320,000
tonnes of nitrogenous compounds a year and 120,000 tonnes of phenols.
Delegates saw little sign of the chemicals. But sailing from Genoa, Italy's
leading oil port, they had first-hand evidence of one of the biggest
pollution hazards afflicting the Mediterranean. Around 35 per cent of the
world's petroleum products transported by sea pass through its waters,
contributing to the roughly 500,000 tonnes of crude oil pollution a year,
according to one estimate.
Not surprisingly, discussions were long on the problems and short on
solutions. However, the conference brought a range of regional environmental
issues into relief.
None more so than the potential conflict between the need for urgent
industrial development in less-developed Mediterranean states and the
environmental risks. Faster economic growth is a priority for poorer states
in the region, which are also facing huge population increases, as many
north African delegates underlined.
Algeria's population will have grown fivefold between 1950 and 2025 if
current predictions prove correct. By contrast, it would take France 2,000
years to raise its population as much, based on the current rate of change.
And whereas in 1950, two thirds of the total populathen 350m people - lived
in countries on the sea's northern fringe, by 2025 the same proportion will
be to the south, while the overall population will have risen to 540m.
Meawnhile, income differences are likely to become more acute. As matters
stand, per capita annual income in the region ranges from only Dollars 600
in Egypt to Dollars 19,490 in France, according to World Bank figures.
But while environmental concerns have grown in rich, industrialised
countries like France, Italy and Spain, which border the Mediterranean and
use its waters to service a variety of seaboard and water-dependent
industries, many of the less-developed countries in the region, particularly
in north Africa, aim to create just a fraction of that coastal industrial
infrastructure.
The demand for electricity alone is set to rocket in states on the
Mediterranean's southern and eastern flanks. From a present annual
generating capacity of around 110bn kWH, capacity is expected to rise to
900-1,100bn kWH by 2010, according to one expert. In the absence of new
technologies, the increase will have immense effects on water use for
cooling and evaporation.
Hence the main focus of the meeting was on the potential role of European
business in helping the Mediterranean's poorer nations continue their
industrialisation process, which is essential to provide the resources for
their growing populations, without destroying their own environments and the
common heritage formed by the Mediterranean itself. With the sea recognising
no political boundaries, pollution from one Mediterranean country can
quickly end up elsewhere at the whim of the wind and tides.
Surprisingly, demands for more resources, either from individual governments
or from the EC, the most important political entity in the region, were
conspicuous by their absence. Numerous environmental measures for the
Mediterranean are already in place, both at EC level and unilaterally on the
part of certain member states. 'Money which comes from the developed
countries can only be supplemental,' noted one speaker.
Likewise, few present called for halting industrial development in poorer
parts of the region. Even committed environmentalists accepted that the
economic needs spurred by explosive population growth meant greater
industrialisation was inevitable, and indeed desirable, if political systems
were not eventually to collapse under the demographic strain.
Instead, the emphasis was on 'sustainable development' for the region, and
closer monitoring of environmental risks and new industrial projects which
could worsen the damage.
In an on-the-record press conference after the meeting, De Michelis stressed
the conference's call for the prompt application in the Mediterranean of
Agenda 21 - the environmental programme approved in Rio - to make the region
a guinea pig for similar action elsewhere.
His demand for a new Mediterranean Investment Bank drew less approval from
delegates, many of whom stressed the adequacy of existing bodies for
development aid and environmental monitoring.
But all agreed that better co-ordination between such institutions was an
essential for governments and big business in the region to tackle the
linked priorities of environmental protection and sustainable development.
Only by improved co-operation between existing environmental bodies and
organisations like the European Commission could action be taken to 'map'
the environmental problems of the region prior to closer assessment. And
only by improved 'networking' between big companies could industry
contribute to regional needs by 'benchmarking' to learn from the example of
companies already performing best on environmental protection.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Management: Quest for good connections - Damian Fraser meets
the man charged with modernising Mexico's telephone service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlos Slim, the Mexican businessman who controls Telmex, the country's
recently-privatised telephone monopoly, has one of the most demanding jobs
in Mexican business: to turn the woefully inefficient Telefonos de Mexico
(Telmex) into a modern, internationally competitive telephone company by
August 1996.
On this date, Telmex's lucrative monopoly on long-distance and international
calls runs out. Between now and then, Telmex has to meet - under pain of
penalties - a series of government-mandated 'quality of service' targets.
Jacques Rogozinski, who was in charge of privatising Telmex, sums up the
challenge facing Slim and his two foreign partners, Southwestern Bell and
France Telecom. 'The owners of Telmex have a gun at their head. By 1996,
there has to be a world-class telephone service at international prices.'
Or, he implies, there will be trouble.
Slim, the son of well-off Lebanese parents, has become probably the
country's richest businessman thanks to a series of shrewd acquisitions of
under-priced Mexican companies in the mid-1980s. He describes his business
philosophy as 'low costs and low overheads', to which others add tough, and
sometimes ruthless, negotiating.
Slim's most significant, and controversial, managerial impact has been in
his negotiations with suppliers, that he says reflects the businessman's -
as opposed to the public official's - concern to reduce costs and optimise
investment. Last year, Telmex cut heavily inventories of cables and other
equipment that in many cases were equivalent to a year's supply.
This year Telmex, at the behest of Southwestern Bell, brought in a third
supplier, A T &amp; T, and forced Ericsson and Alcatel, the two existing
suppliers, to cut their prices for installing central offices and lines -
saving about Dollars 250m a year.
In the 18 months since privatisation, this strategy has done wonders for
Telmex's investors. Costs have risen much less than analysts predicted, and
the controlling group's original 20.4 per cent stake is now worth about
Dollars 6bn, compared with Dollars 1.76bn in December 1990.
However, some argue that Slim has been too keen to cut costs for the
customer's good. A former Telmex director says stocks of some key parts ran
out at the end of 1991 causing disruption.
Slim is also criticised for centralising labour, management and purchasing
decisions in Mexico City. Telmex, when in government hands, had decided to
divide itself into regional and fairly autonomous profit centres. The
decision to re-centralise may have cut financial and operating costs but,
says the former director, it has reduced the ability of the company to
respond to local telephone needs.
Such criticisms are strenuously rejected by Slim, and Juan Perez Simon,
Telmex's general director, but there is little argument that service has yet
to improve. In 1989, the year before privatisation, Mexico's consumer
protection agency received 13,277 complaints about Telmex - ranging from
over-billing to shortcomings in its service. In 1991, complaints increased
to 63,996, and in the first quarter this year there were another 21,822.
Telmex receives about 40 per cent of all consumer complaints in Mexico.
The management says, almost in unison, that the company did not deteriorate
overnight and it is not going to improve overnight either. Technologically,
Telmex matches the position of most US telephone companies in the 1970s -
using mostly unreliable analogue technology that requires, for example,
12,000 operators to fill in by hand 8m long-distance billing tickets every
month. There is still a backlog of about 1m lines, and the waiting list is
more than a year.
Perez Simon says that now the company has identified most of the cost
savings, its priority is to improve quality. In this the management's hand
has largely been forced. In return for extremely light regulation of prices
and generous tax treatment, the government has required Telmex to invest
Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn a year to improve service. As a public company
Telmex was starved of cash and unable to invest sufficiently to improve
service.
Telmex is thus investing nearly Dollars 8bn from 1991 to the end of 1993 in
increasing the number of lines to 7.5m, from 5m in 1990; installing 13,500
kilometres of fibre optic cables which will connect just about all
long-distance calls; and replacing old central exchanges with automatic
digital ones, so that by 1993, 60 per cent of local exchanges will be
digital, from 29 per cent in 1991.
By 1996, every city in Mexico will have digital telephones and just about
all long-distance calls will be relayed through fibre-optic cables.
'Mexico,' says Perez Simon 'will have by 1996 as good as or even better
telephone service than most parts of the US.'
Slim evidently does not believe that this would have been possible under the
old management of Telmex. Since taking over the company, he has fired 13 of
the top 17 directors and brought in some of his colleagues from Grupo Carso
 -the sprawling tobacco-to-telephones conglomerate that he runs from a
four-man office in Mexico City. He has also brought in hundreds of managers
from Southwestern Bell and France Telecom.
Slim suggests tactfully that the previous managers - all public sector
employees - 'did not have a vocation for business'. John Atterbury, head of
Southeastern Bell's Mexican operations, puts it differently. 'The whole
management style is different,' he says.
The result, according to Atterbury and Slim, is a host of improvements that
have cost little money, and two of which exemplify the company's commitment
to better service.
Before privatisation, it was difficult to report telephone faults to Telmex
since there was no operator to answer the phone. So the new management
negotiated with unions to double the number of operators working in this
area. Now customers can at least report broken phones, even if they are not
fixed any sooner. Starting in Puebla, Telmex is aiming to install phones
within 30 days. By the end of this year, says Atterbury, 40 per cent of
phones will be installed in under 30 days.
The change in Telmex is apparent to Mexico's two main suppliers, Alcatel and
Ericsson. 'Telmex is much more customer-service orientated than before,'
says Rodrigo Calderon of Alcatel. 'All they now have to put in place is the
hardware to meet customer needs.' Jorge Arredondo of Ericsson agrees. He
cites, for example, a 'drastic change in the way they plan telephone
switches. Before, if we had to install 600,000 lines we had to go to 800,000
places; now we have to go to half that many.'
Both these suppliers have lost most from Slim's tough, bare-bones approach
to running Telmex, with their profits dropping sharply last year. What is
still unclear is whether the ultimate beneficiaries will be, as of now, the
owners of Telmex stock, or Telmex's long-suffering customers.

MR Terry Maher, chairman of Pentos, which runs the Dillons bookshop chain,
has written to UK publishers urging them to drop support for the net book
agreement. He argued that a recent judgment from European Court of First
Instance rendered the agreement 'unlawful' in the UK and that the chances of
modifying it to reflect the court's concerns about its restrictive
implications were 'remote'.
'In our view the PA (the Publishers' Association) and its members should no
longer expend further time and substantial amounts of your money to salvage
arrangements which are anti-competitive, anachronistic and incompatible with
Community law,' he wrote.
The Publishers' Association has argued that the court's ruling is narrow and

FT  22 JUL 92 / Council mortgage scheme launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL tenants will soon be able to convert rent payments into part
ownership of their homes, according to a government consultation paper
published yesterday, Bethan Hutton writes.
The rents-to-mortgages scheme, a manifesto promise, is aimed at
local-authority tenants in England and Wales who cannot afford to exercise
their full right to buy.
Under the scheme's proposals, tenants will be able to take out a mortgage on
an equity share of their homes, with repayments equal to, or greater than,
their current rent. They will also be entitled to a discount on the purchase
price, in proportion to the amount of equity they take on. The remaining
equity share will stay in the hands of the local authority but can be bought
out later.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, launching the scheme at an Institute
of Housing seminar, said it would extend choice and opportunity for local
authority tenants. 'It could offer them a way of using money they would have
given to the landlord to acquire a stake in their home,' he said.
The scheme is likely to form part of a Housing, Land and Urban Development
bill in November.

<TEXT>
MORE EMPLOYERS are considering seeking approval from Investors in People,
the government's scheme to improve training for people in work, according to
a survey by the Industrial Society.
The survey, which regularly polls personnel and training managers, said that
in 1991, when the scheme was launched, only 25 per cent of respondents had
decided to apply for IIP status and only 8 per cent thought they would be
applying in the very near future. This year, 45 per cent of respondents were
considering applying for the kitemark that signifies approval of their
training programme.
IIP, promoted and run by Tecs, assesses how companies train their staff  -
including whether a company regularly reviews the training and developmental
needs of all its employees.
Take-up of the scheme has been slow, with 67 companies currently accredited,
including Unilever, Shell, Boots The Chemist and J. Sainsbury.
Tecs have no budget earmarked to promote the scheme and many Tecs have
complained that they have insufficient funds to drive it.
Tecs had hoped that government cash might pump-prime the initiative, but Mrs
Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, told the national conference of
Tecs last week there would be no additional funds provided by government.

FT  22 JUL 92 / When the best of friends turn to foes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON APRIL 10 the editors of the Tory tabloids were invited to celebrate Mr
John Major's election victory at a party in 10 Downing Street. Just three
months later the newspapers' fury over the prime minister's support for new
legal curbs on their reporting has sparked a state of virtual war.
It was Lord MacAlpine, a long-time Conservative fund raiser, who declared
that Sir David English of the Daily Mail, Sir Nicholas Lloyd of the Daily
Express and Mr Kelvin MacKenzie of The Sun were the real heroes of Mr
Major's campaign. Few who saw the bouts of panic that had gripped officials
at central office as polling day approached doubted his judgment.
The three tabloids were relentless in selling the central Tory message: that
Labour would preside over a big increase in taxes and that Mr Neil Kinnock
could not be trusted to run the country. Lurid front pages provided daily
advertisements for the Conservative cause.
Each of the editors was in constant touch with the senior ministers running
Mr Major's campaign. On more than one occasion the message the newspapers
delivered to Mr Major was that his strategy was a shambles. But they
remained fiercely loyal.
If Mr Major thought the tabloids' performance up to April 9 guaranteed him
an easy ride once he returned to Downing Street, he was soon disabused of
the idea. Within a matter of weeks the tabloids were reminding him that the
rules which operated during election campaigns did not apply in the long
intervals between them.
The Express and London's Evening Standard, another staunch supporter,
infuriated the prime minister by taking up the cause of the Tory
Euro-sceptics after the Danish voters had rejected the Maastricht treaty.
The Standard, and to a lesser extent, The Sun, joined a campaign against Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, over his failure to pull the economy from
recession.
But it is the issue of press privacy - now entangled with the allegations
about Mr David Mellor's personal life - which has sparked the most serious
rift. The seeds were planted last month when a book about the marriage
difficulties of the Prince and Princess of Wales provoked a flood of
speculative stories in the tabloids.
Mr Major, whose frequent contacts with the royal family are often
overlooked, was furious. The revelation a few weeks later that the first
child of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, had been born before
she married added to his anger. The result was a decision to refer again the
issue of personal privacy to an inquiry headed by Sir David Calcutt QC. But
Mr Major made clear that he had decided in his own mind that the tabloids'
excesses should be curbed by legislation to prohibit intrusions into the
personal lives of the royals and other public figures.
That message - delivered in an informal chat with a political correspondent
during an overseas visit - infuriated the editors who had backed him during
the election. Mr Paul Dacre, the newly appointed editor of the Daily Mail,
sought to warn off the prime minister in a full page editorial. The Sun
emblazoned its pages with the same message.
Scandals sell newspapers and editors are judged on their circulation
figures. But no one at Westminster guessed that Mr MacKenzie would respond
to Mr Major's anger over the publicity surrounding Mr Mellor with quite such
a devastating charge against an unnamed cabinet minister. If the allegation
is proved - and the editor has so far said he will not name names - then the
culprit will be forced to resign. The message for Mr Major is that best
friends can often make the worst enemies.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Pounds 250m earmarked for urban regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's Urban Regeneration Agency will ensure that the programme
for bringing 150,000 acres of derelict land back into use is more focused
and effective, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said
yes-terday.
In a consultation document on the powers the agency should be given,
published in preparation for legislation due in the autumn, Mr Howard said
the URA would work with local authorities and Training and Enterprise
councils, but would have reserve compulsory purchase and development control
powers. The agency is expected to begin work in about a year's time.
It will assume responsibility from the Department of the Environment for
administering city grants and derelict land grants, and will also
incorporate English Estates, which is sponsored by the Department of Trade
and Industry to help to provide land for commercial development in certain
areas.
Its annual budget will be about Pounds 250m, but ministers emphasised that
they expected it to stimulate up to five times that amount in private-sector
investment. The agency will be run by a board of at least six members, and
its cor-porate plan will have to be approved by Mr Howard and Mr Michael
Heseltine, the secretary of state for trade and industry.
Sir Idris Pearce, the chairman of English Estates, is to be deputy chairman,
under Lord Walker, the former Tory cabinet minister.
Ministers see the URA as part of the urban development programme, along with
the 11 urban development corporations. Lord Walker is to join the 11 UDC
chairmen at their regular meetings, which will be chaired by Mr John
Redwood, the local-government minister.
Co-operation will extend to the agency's helping UDCs as they wind up their
ac-tivities and transfer their assets.
Labour has denounced the initiative as merely a gimmick. Mr David Blunkett,
the party's local-government spokesman, warned that ministers were creating
layers of bureaucracy.
If ministers were really concerned to avoid duplication of effort, the
various schemes should be replaced by 'a single, expanded and flex-ible
urban programme administered by the Department of the Environment', he
added.

MOST British companies believe money spent on management training is money
well spent but only half are doing any formal training, according to a
survey published yesterday.
The survey was by the government-backed Management Charter Initiative, which
seeks to improve standards of management training. It found that companies
employing more than 500 people had the most managers involved in training
while small companies were less actively engaged in formally training
managers.
Mr Andrew Summers, chief executive of the MCI, said one reason might be that
small companies could spare less time for managers to be away from work.
Training, he said, should not consist just of sending people on courses.
According to the survey of more than 500 organisations, smaller companies
were least likely to agree that training increased loyalty or management
standards were useful in measuring performance.
The business services sector trained more managers than any other, while the
machinery, manufacturing and engineering sectors were least likely to be
training them.
The MCI, through local organisations including Tecs and chambers of
commerce, is seeking to influence more companies to improve training.

FT  22 JUL 92 / One-stop ticket towaste land renewal: Plans to aid
inner-city developers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN important feature of the new Urban Regeneration Agency (URA), according
to environment secretary Mr Michael Howard, will be its ability to offer a
one-stop service to developers who wish to invest in the UK's inner cities.
The URA will have powers to assemble parcels of land - if necessary by
compulsory purchase - and clear them for developers. It will control two
sources of government funding: derelict land grant, which is used for land
reclamation; and city grant, which is available for pump-priming development
of inner-city sites by the private sector.
English Estates, the quango that builds factories and offices in the
assisted areas, will also be absorbed into the URA, so that the agency can
tempt businesses into needy areas by providing premises.
The initial response to yesterday's consultation paper from the
professionals involved in inner-city regeneration was positive.
Mr Gerald Cary-Elwes, secretary general of the British Urban Regeneration
Association, said: 'The idea of a one-stop agency for identifying and
assembling packages of land which can be used for development is excellent.
'The URA follows the very successful pattern of similar organisations in
Wales and Scotland. It would be wonderful if Peter Walker, who will be the
chairman of the new agency, could repeat the success of his work in Wales.'
However, there will be disappointment if the URA is no more than a land use
agency.
'Urban regeneration is about more than just land and property development,'
believes Mr Victor Hausner, a consultant involved in many inner-city
regeneration schemes. 'It involves economic regeneration, training, housing
improvements and so on.'
Pulling together all those other elements at present means tapping into the
long list of government-backed organisations that can supply these other
elements of urban regeneration:
The 16 task forces run by the Department of Trade and Industry which are
responsible for stimulating enterprise and training people for new jobs.
Most local training is the responsibility of the 82 Training and Enterprise
councils under the employment department. In Scotland, the task falls to
Local Enterprise Companies. But the education department is in charge of
city technology colleges, which are supposed to concentrate educational
resources in urban areas.
Housing needs are dealt with by programmes to rehabilitate run-down housing
estates, such as Estate Action and the Priority Estates Project. If the
developer intends to provide low-cost social housing, local housing
associations will need to be involved.
The Home Office Safer Cities project encourages building, design and
employment initiatives to reduce crime.
An early port of call would have to be the local council. Of the 57 urban
priority areas, 31 have now won more than Pounds 1bn of government funds for
urban regeneration over the next five years from the City Challenge
programme.
Also indispensable in the eight cities where they exist are the City Action
Teams. These are led by different government ministers, which co-ordinate
the various inner-city initiatives and programmes run by different
government departments. And if there is an urban development corporation, it
 -rather than the URA - will be the organisation to turn to for development
needs.
The complexity of the arrangements has been repeatedly criticised by the
Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog. Having described the
programmes as a 'patchwork quilt' in a 1989 report, the commission said in
1991 that the quilt 'remains only loosely sewn together'.
It was that fragmentation that led to the introduction last year of City
Challenge, the bidding process that aims to bring together resources from
all the different programmes and concentrate them on projects proposed by
local partnerships between the public and private sector.
'City Challenge offers a multi-faceted solution to a multi-faceted problem,'
says Victor Hausner. 'The challenge for the URA will be to see whether it
can develop a comprehensive strategic approach in the same way as City
Challenge.'
The government is not unaware of the challenge. The Conservative election
manifesto included a promise to bring resources for targeted inner-city
programmes into a single budget. One way of doing so would have been to use
the URA as the organisation through which to focus the plan, perhaps by also
giving it responsibility for managing City Challenge.
However, yesterday's consultation paper says merely that the government is
'developing' its proposal to integrate inner-city regeneration funds. For
the moment, the agency will be yet another partner to be drawn into
inner-city programmes, rather than a one-stop solution to the developer's
problems.

FT  22 JUL 92 / State funding for Mersey barrage urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in the Mersey barrage are to press the government to change its
decision not to back the Pounds 1bn plan for an electricity-generating dam
between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tides.
They believe the government has misunderstood the project's finances and say
there would ultimately be no cost to public funds, instead possibly a
profit. They blame ministerial changes since the general election and the
absorption of the Department of Energy into the Department of Trade and
Industry for the government decision.
If it went ahead, the barrage would raise about 30 per cent of its
construction costs in one group of loans, based on electricity revenues of
3p a unit.
Shareholders want the remaining Pounds 700m as another group of loans, but
underwritten by the non-fossil-fuel levy - the money added to electricity
bills to develop renew-able sources of energy.
All or part of the Pounds 700m might come from the pool of money the levy
has already built up, or by charging an additional 4p a unit after
generating starts. In the latter case, such assured revenue would mean the
Pounds 700m could be borrowed commercially.
Whatever route were taken, the barrage company would repay the money to the
government. 'We are asking for a non-fossil-fuel levy loan, not a
non-fossil-fuel grant,' Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of Mersey Barrage,
said.
Repayment would be slowest if the 4p a unit route was followed, beginning
when the barrage was 20 years old. At that point, the barrage would be
starting to make large profits as a result of its owners' depreciating it
completely in the first 25 years.
The barrage needs Pounds 14m to proceed to final design and resolve
objections about navigation.
Sir Desmond said the company had until November before shareholders had to
decide whether to go further on their own.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Rescue fund plan for travel customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of a rescue fund for package tour passengers unprotected by
existing schemes was proposed yesterday by the government.
Plans are also under discussion by government and industry officials to
merge all such schemes into a central fund under a single authority.
The proposed fund for unprotected passengers, to be financed by a levy on
customers and guaranteed by operators' bonds up to an estimated Pounds 150m,
would be used to repatriate holidaymakers stranded overseas by insolvent
tour operators.
The move is designed to satisfy a European Community directive, due to be
implemented by the end of the year, which will require all types of package
tour customers to be protected from fraudulent or bankrupt operators.
The levy - probably around 1 per cent of a package holiday price - would be
raised from those travellers, such as ferry, coach and air charter
passengers, not covered under existing industry arrangements.
The latest proposals come at a difficult time for the travel package
industry, with the Association of British Travel Agents recently admitting
that its passenger rescue fund would be exhausted if another holiday group
collapsed. A price war in the industry is also putting operator margins
under severe pressure.
At present, protection is only given to customers of companies which are
members of travel industry trade associations, such as Abta. Members of this
Pounds 400m fund guarantee around 10 per cent of their turnover in the form
of a bond. Some 90 per cent of the 11m overseas package holidays sold
annually in the UK are covered by such schemes.
Yesterday's proposals would create a parallel scheme extending coverage to
all forms of organised package travel. These would include both domestic and
foreign holidays, as well as some business trips and social club outings.
Abta said yesterday: 'This is an important step forward in consumer
protection.'
The idea of a new fund and levy came from the five travel and holiday trade
associations which dismissed original government proposals as too expensive.
As part of its plans to create an eventual central fund, the government has
proposed that tour companies wishing to join existing schemes will have to
pay a bond of 25 per cent of its turnover. However, if the companies join
the new scheme, they will only have to lodge the bond valued at 10 per cent
of turnover.
The new fund would be administered by trustees appointed by the five
industry associations - Abta, the Tour Operators Study Group, the
Association of Independent Tour Operators, the Passenger Shipping
Association and the Bus and Coach Council - with the DTI acting as
regulator.
Draft regulations are expected shortly, with parliamentary approval in the
autumn ready for the arrangements to be in place by the end of the year.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Police authority agrees Halford settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEYSIDE Police Authority yesterday agreed to the early retirement on
health grounds of Ms Alison Halford, an assistant chief constable who said
she had been the victim of sex discrimination.
The authority said that Ms Halford, 52, would get 'the usual pension, to
which she has contributed, payable in such circumstances'. She will receive
a lump sum of Pounds 142,600 and an annual pension of Pounds 35,836.
As a result of the settlement, Ms Halford will withdraw allegations of sex
discrimination against Sir Philip Myers, inspector of constabulary for the
north-west; Mr James Sharples, chief constable of Merseyside;
Northamptonshire Police Authority and the home secretary. It is expected
that the sex discrimination case - which has been supported by the Equal
Opportunities Commission - will be formally withdrawn when the industrial
tribunal hearing it meets in Manchester today.
Mr David Henshaw, clerk of Merseyside Police Authority, said disciplinary
proceedings against Ms Halford would automatically cease as a result of her
retirement. She has been suspended from duty for the past 19 months after
allegations of misconduct arising from a swimming incident at the home of a
Merseyside businessman while she was duty officer in charge of the force.
A meeting of the police authority last Friday that had been expected to
approve terms for ending the case was adjourned, and yesterday the authority
agreed to the settlement only by 10-8 with three abstentions.
Some members left the meeting saying they believed the disciplinary process
against Ms Halford should have gone ahead. Others were concerned that the
effect on the EOC's budget may have been a factor in pressure for a
settlement.
Pressure for a negotiated settlement to the case had grown with the
knowledge that Home Office ministers were becoming concerned about its cost.
They were referring to the financial cost - at least Pounds 1m and set to
double if the industrial tribunal hearing which started in May had
continued. Ministers must, however, have been even more anxious about the
police service, already damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice.
Evidence from the opening weeks of the tribunal hearing left an impression
of police life at extreme variance to the professionally managed public
service that the government and senior officers are trying to create.
Ms Halford, the first woman to reach the rank of assistant chief constable
when appointed to the Merseyside force eight years ago, failed in nine
subsequent attempts for further promotion. She claimed that the failures
were a result of sex discrimination and began her industrial tribunal
action.
Mr Eldred Tabachnik QC, for Ms Halford, told the opening of the tribunal
that her professional competence and commitment to the job were beyond
challenge. But the 'woefully inadequate and ramshackle' promotion system to
which Ms Halford was subjected, suggested Mr Tabachnik, provided fertile
ground for 'personal dislike, prejudice, hostility and personal
discrimination to flourish'.
The tribunal then heard Ms Halford describe Sir Kenneth Oxford, her former
chief constable at Merseyside, as having a management style that was 'plain
outright rude'. She claimed he had treated her like a dog, describing him as
aggressive and dogmatic. Mr Sharples, the present chief constable, was
described by Ms Halford as having been devious and two-faced. It is not
unknown for industrial tribunals to hear such antagonistic evidence after a
breakdown in workplace relationships. Some of the evidence in the Halford
case, however, was on a different level - claims of a conspiracy involving
the special branch and the home secretary to bug Ms Halford's office and
home telephone.
Ministers will be relieved that yesterday's agreement removes the prospect
of further such allegations.
The settlement will not please those in the police service who saw the
tribunal as an opportunity for its promotion procedures, particularly as
they affect women, to be exposed to public examination. Women officers
complain that they were until recently prevented from undertaking many
operational roles - denying them the full range of experience needed for the
highest posts - and that they are disadvantaged by the service's macho
values.
The state of relationships between Ms Halford and her Merseyside colleagues,
whatever the cause, always made it unlikely that the tribunal could become a
forum for the calm examination of such topics. Even before the case reached
the tribunal, Ms Halford had been suspended from duty on disciplinary
grounds - an action later set aside by the High Court - and subsequently
suspended again.
The question of whether sex discrimination prevented one of the most senior
women ever to have served in the British police getting to the very top
remains unanswered.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Many historic buildings at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY LISTED historic buildings and ancient monuments in England are at risk
because of lack of reliable information and slack financial monitoring, the
National Audit Office says in a report published today.
The watchdog on government spending criticises the Environment Department,
which spends Pounds 120m in grants; English Heritage; and other agencies for
a big backlog in repairs and conservation. It accepts that progress has been
made in the presentation of some of the country's leading tourist
attractions.
The report accepts that determined efforts have been made to protect
heritage property by improved listing and scheduling, and the number of
listed buildings increased from 120,000 in 1970 to almost 500,000 in 1991.
It finds, though, that there is limited reliable information on the physical
condition of the listed properties.
English Heritage, established in 1984 to protect and conserve listed
buildings, estimated in 1991 that 37,000 heritage properties, or 7 per cent
of the total, were at risk because they were in bad repair, including 2,400
buildings in the top grades I and II.
A further 73,000 buildings (14 per cent) were found to be vulnerable to
neglect and in need of repairs. There was also concern about the condition
of many ancient monuments.
The NAO discovered that English Heritage did not monitor how far the advice
it gave to local planning authorities was considered when deciding on
listed-building consent applications, and neither were there checks on how
effectively some grants had been spent.
Nevertheless, grants had been successful in restoring many properties, and
costs were found to be well controlled. English Heritage had also secured a
significant increase in visitor numbers, and income had risen substantially
in real terms.
One of the less successful grants was more than Pounds 500,000 for repairs
to Brighton West Pier, one of only three Grade I listed piers in England. A
storm subsequently partly destroyed the pier, which now needs repairs
totalling Pounds 6m.
Among other English Heritage representatives, Sir John Bourn, comptroller
and auditor general and head of the NAO, will be examined on the report at a
Commons Public Accounts Committee hearing in the autumn. Environment
Department responsibilities were transferred in April to the National
Heritage Department.

BUSINESSES that are owner-managed expect to achieve an average 4.8 per cent
growth over the next 12 months, says a survey of 900 businesses by Mori for
accountants Ernst and Young.
Such confidence by owner-managers reveals a 'disturbing expectation gap'
given economic forecasts of zero or negative growth over the same period,
Ernst and Young said.
The firm urged realism: 'We suspect that the estimates are based on hope
rather than hard evidence. Forecasts that cannot be supported will undermine
confidence among companies' financiers.'
A total of 63 per cent of owner-managed businesses thought the economy would
improve over the next year and 66 per cent said the election result had
increased confidence. The companies surveyed all had annual sales of between
Pounds 5m and Pounds 100m - those with sales of more than Pounds 50m were
most likely to think the economy would improve.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Branson sets out timetable for rail service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN GROUP, the airline company headed by Mr Richard Branson, has worked
out detailed plans for running five trains a day each way between London and
the north from next summer.
The company aims to take advantage of the privatisation of British Rail by
setting up a network of inter-city services using trains leased from BR.
Mr Branson, accompanied by Electra Private Equity Partners and Steer Davies
Gleave, the transport consultants, outlined his plans to Mr John MacGregor,
the transport secretary, yesterday.
He hopes to lease four InterCity 125 diesel trains from BR, then heavily
refurbish them to airliner standards before putting them into service on
London-Scotland routes.
Service on board would be similar to that provided on Virgin's aircraft.
Mr Branson plans to run five trains daily from London to Newcastle, with
four continuing to Edinburgh or Glasgow. Other intermediate stops would be
chosen from Middlesbrough, York or Durham.
The service would be called the Virgin Flyer. It would form the prototype
for a network of other inter-city services serving up to 30 destinations
through the country.
Mr Branson said the services would operate in addition to BR's, not in place
of them, and fares would be the same or less.
BR privately questions whether Virgin could make them pay. BR also said that
it did not have trains for Mr Branson to lease and added that little space
was available on its congested tracks.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Doubts over two Yorkshire pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of two Yorkshire coal mines employing a total of about 1,800 men
is uncertain, British Coal said yesterday.
Kellingley, once known as 'the big K', will have to make substantial
manpower cuts if it is to survive, British Coal said.
Sharlston, a smaller pit also in the Selby group of mines in North
Yorkshire, is in a 'very serious' situation and must be closely monitored.
The news came at a quarterly meeting to review British Coal's Selby group.
Mr Alan Houghton, the group's director, said the group's other six pits were
performing well.
The Kellingley cuts are part of a strategy to turn the pit round. It lost
Pounds 2.6m in the first quarter, placing it among the 10 costliest pits in
Britain.
Kellingley, which employs 1,080 miners and is one of British Coal's largest
pits, has an output per man-shift of just under 6 tonnes, compared with an
average 10.21 for the Selby group as a whole.
Poor performance resulted mainly from new coal faces not being developed
quickly enough to maintain output, according to British Coal. The company
did not disclose its new strategy for the mines, or state how many job cuts
it might involve.
British Coal said, however, that there was no suggestion at this stage that
Kellingley would face the company's review procedure, which normally
precedes closure.
Mr Houghton said Sharlston colliery had turned in a disappointing
performance. Its main difficulty had been selling its poor-quality coal to
the electricity generators, British Coal's main customer. Instead, coal is
being stockpiled on site.
British Coal said that Sharlston, which employs nearly 700 men, was still
breaking even, but it would become a loss-maker if it could not sell its
coal.
Union representatives are relieved that the pits are not threatened with
immediate closure. But Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire
branch of the NUM, the miners' union, said the job losses would be
disastrous.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Brazilian markets hit by corruption claims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW allegations of corruption in Brazilian President Fernando Collor de
Mello's government set off another sharp drop in the country's stock markets
yesterday, agencies report from Sao Paulo.
The Sao Paulo stock market fell 3.9 per cent - after losing 6.8 per cent on
Monday - as the controversy undermined confidence in the government.
New evidence purportedly linked Mr Collor to a confidant under congressional
investigation for alleged corruption.
The latest development in the affair was triggered after the central bank
turned over thousands of cancelled cheques on Monday to a congressional
panel investigating the corruption claims.
The president and a former aide, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, have since May
battled corruption charges, initially set off by allegations from a brother
of Mr Collor. The panel is probing claims that President Collor profited
from an operation allegedly run by Mr Farias.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US scientist appealed yesterday to Aids doctors around the world to look
out for people with the symptoms of Aids but no sign of HIV, the virus that
normally causes the disease.
Dr James Curran, director of the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in
Atlanta, requested the details at the world Aids conference in Amsterdam so
that scientists can determine whether a new virus is causing an Aids-like
disease.
About two dozen cases have emerged of people with the symptoms of Aids but
no sign of the virus. If it is a different virus, or a mutation of HIV that
existing techniques cannot detect, then new tests might be needed to protect
the public blood supply from contamination.
However, Dr James Allen, Aids programme director of the US National
Institutes of Health, told a press conference after the session: 'What we
have heard does not in any way threaten the safety of the blood supply in
the US or in west European countries, that have systems to protect it from
infectious agents.'
Before the Amsterdam meeting started, Dr Curran knew of six people who had
the severely depressed immune systems that characterise Aids but in whom
scientists could find no trace of HIV, despite intensive testing with all
known techniques.
At an emergency conference session other US Aids specialists described cases
in which they could detect none of the known strains of HIV.
Dr David Ho, of the Aaron Diamond Foundation in New York, had 11 patients
from New York and Los Angeles - mostly homosexual men - who had few immune
cells and suffered from various secondary infections.
Dr Jeffrey Laurence of Cornell University gave details of five patients from
New York, four of whom had none of the usual risk factors for HIV infection
such as multiple sexual partners or intravenous drug use.
A few other doctors from the US and Europe said they had some patients who
seemed to fit the same pattern.
The emergency session was arranged after the US magazine Newsweek published
an article questioning whether a new Aids virus was emerging. Dr Curran was
attacked by some Aids specialists at the meeting for not taking the
initiative and releasing details of the six patients studied by the CDC.
But Dr Curran said the cases had not caused particular concern as they were
not connected and did not suggest the early signs of a new epidemic, as the
first reports of Aids in homosexual men had in 1981. He pointed out that the
US had 250,000 cases of Aids in which HIV was present.
Twelve experimental vaccines designed to protect people from HIV infection
are producing encouraging results in small numbers of healthy volunteers,
the world conference on Aids heard yesterday, writes Clive Cookson.
The clinical trials show a wide range of different vaccines can raise some
immunity to HIV, without side-effects. But none has yet been tested on large
groups of high-risk people. Dr Daniel Hoth, director of the Aids division of
the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was
time 'to prepare the infrastructure' for trials involving groups of
2,000-5,000 people, in developing and developed countries.
These could start as soon as 1994/95.

MR Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who last year
lost control of MGM, the Hollywood studio, was yesterday indicted in the US
on criminal charges of perjury and tampering with physical evidence.
The indictments were handed down by a grand jury in Delaware.
The charges relate to a lengthy hearing in the Delaware chancery court while
Mr Parretti and Credit Lyonnais, MGM's bank creditor, were fighting for
control of the troubled Hollywood studio.
Mr Parretti, who was backed by Credit Lyonnais when he acquired MGM from Mr
Kirk Kerkorian in 1990, was removed from the board by the French bank last
summer.
The Delaware court hearing began last August and ended in a ruling against
Mr Parretti last December.
Last spring Credit Lyonnais formally took control of MGM in a Delaware
foreclosure auction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has begun distancing himself from a
campaign to amend the constitution and win him the right to run for
re-election, vowing instead to deepen his free-market reforms.
On Monday Mr Menem said in a speech that he wanted to 'open this new stage
(of government) with grandeur, without thinking of future ambitions, without
hegemonic temptations, without delirious dreams of perpetuation.'
The president, who earlier this month reached the mid-point of his six-year
term in office, had hoped to remove a constitutional ban on successive
presidential terms by calling a national plebiscite later this year.
The plan ran into strong resistance from the opposition Radical party, from
members of his own Peronist party and from business.
With his speech Mr Menem has stated that he recognises a constitutional
amendment is impossible to secure at the moment, and has promised to
dedicate the second half of his term to broadening reforms.
Mr Menem's decision represents a victory for Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy
minister, and a defeat for some of the president's close allies and a
faction of the Peronist party which had urged him to dilute his reforms to
buy political backing for re-election.
Monday's speech outlined some of the policies Mr Menem plans to concentrate
on in the coming three years. These include strengthening the state's
regulatory role, bolstering the tax collection system, enforcing
competition, and improving social policies.
His pledge coincides with the public's growing disenchantment with reform as
the economy slows down and real incomes decline. Meanwhile, disgust over
widespread government corruption remains as strong as ever.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Representatives yesterday passed legislation overturning the
annual renewal of China's preferential trade status and prepared to pass
another bill to grant only a heavily conditioned renewal.
Neither bill is expected to survive a presidential veto, but the Democrats
are making the effort - as they did last year - to make a point about their
distaste for China's human rights record.
The renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status, which accords Beijing
the lowest tariffs available, was once passed every year with little
difficulty. But after the Tiananmen Square massacre the idea that trade
should be tied to human rights and weapons proliferation has gained support
among most Democrats and many congressional Republicans.
The latest version of the conditional MFN bill would deny tariff preferences
for goods made by state-owned enterprises. The aim is to avoid harming both
private Chinese companies and business interests in Hong Kong.
Any bill will be vetoed by President George Bush, as it was last year, with
little hope the two-thirds vote to overturn the veto can be mustered.
'The president has argued against all the evidence that China's record has
improved on all fronts,' said Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic majority
leader. 'But the reality is that his policy has failed. Beijing's brutality
cannot be ignored any longer.'
The votes came hours after Bao Tong, the most senior official arrested in
connection with China's 1989 pro-democracy protests, was sentenced to nine
years in prison, according to his family in Beijing.
The former aide to disgraced Communist party general secretary Zhao Ziyang
was arrested in 1989, one month before student-led protests were crushed
with troops and tanks around Tiananmen Square, with heavy loss of life.

THE FALKLAND Islands government has chosen two companies for a multi-million
pound seismic study of territorially disputed waters in the South Atlantic
from October, confirming its decision to exclude Argentina from the initial
search for oil.
But in a move which could lessen potential conflict between London and
Buenos Aires over the issue, Falkland Islands officials have agreed to allow
results of the survey to be made available to oil companies operating in
Argentina.
The UK Foreign Office is expected soon to give its formal seal of approval
to the licensing arrangements between the islands' government and the two
companies, Spectrum of the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New
York-based energy services group Schlumberger.
Both companies were picked from a list of groups that had expressed an
interest to the British Geological Survey, the UK government-funded research
organisation which is advising island officials.
Under draft arrangements approved by the Falkland Islands government, the
companies will spend more than Pounds 7m on high-technology seismic work
expected to be completed by October 1993. Revenue from the results' sale
will be shared between the companies and the Falklands government. The work
will be carried out within a 200-mile zone around the islands.
Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the Falkland Islands government, said
the islands had a policy 'to do our own thing within our own waters'. But
the decision to make the work available commercially is in part a concession
to the Buenos Aires government.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Greenspan takes up cudgels for the Fed: Central bank chief's
defence of monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, took to the
barricades yesterday to defend his monetary policy against several US
senators who say interest rates were cut too late.
He told the Senate banking committee that the Fed's recent reductions in
interest rates 'should help to shore up the economy and, coming in the
context of a solid trend toward lower inflation, have contributed to laying
a foundation for a sustained expansion of the US economy.'
Structural problems in the economy have been 'more severe and more enduring
than many had previously thought,' he said. Nevertheless, the Fed's monetary
policy had succeeded in 'fending off the classic 'bust' phase that seemed
invariably to follow speculate booms in pre-second world war economic
history.
'More rapid or more forceful easing actions more than likely would have been
interpreted by market participants as risking a resurgence of inflation.
That would have led to higher, rather than lower, long-term interest rates.'
Mr Greenspan had to endure strong criticism from Senator Donald Riegle, the
banking committee's Democratic chairman, who attacked the Fed's inability to
meet its monetary growth targets. 'I think the time has come for the Fed to
admit that monetary policy alone is not sufficient to deal with our economic
problems,' Senator Riegle said.
But Republican senators, as well as some Democrats, argued the Fed had cut
interest rates as low as it could, and that what was needed was a serious
effort to cut the federal budget deficit.
Senator Jake Garn of Utah, the banking committee's senior Republican, said:
'While you might have done some of the things you did in terms of interest
rates sooner, you can't hardly come down any lower with the discount rate.'
Mr Greenspan said structural improvements in the US economy - the rebuilding
of banks' capital, the strengthening of household finances, the
restructuring of business balance sheets - would be helped if the federal
government made significant progress towards bringing its budget into
balance. This would, he said, release savings for productive private
investment and brighten further the prospects for continued improvement in
living standards.
Mr Greenspan said a large majority of his fellow board members expected
economic expansion to strengthen moderately, from a range of 2 1/4 -2 3/4
per cent this year to a range of 2 3/4 -3 per cent in 1993.
This should help bring the unemployment rate down to between 7 1/4 and 7 1/2
per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, and 6 1/2 and 7 per cent at the
end of 1993.
He warned that the necessary structural adjustments after the overbuilding,
overbuying and overleveraging of the 1980s would continue to hamper growth,
although the situation had improved. 'Last year I characterised this process
as the economy struggling against a 50 mile an hour headwind. Today its
speed is decidedly less, but still appreciable,' he said.
Mr Greenspan said the Fed was making progress in understanding changes in
financial behaviour that have contributed to the slow growth of the M2 and
M3 broad monetary aggregates.
He said households had been restructuring balance sheets, channelling cash
flow away from monetary deposits and into other assets, or paying off debts.
This process, although it had powerfully depressed the growth of the money
supply, had exerted a less powerful constraint on spending. Instead, the
velocity of circulation of the monetary aggregates, especially M2, had
increased.
If this continued, Mr Greenspan said, the Fed would have to reassess its
target ranges for monetary growth. In the meantime the Fed had decided to
maintain its current ranges of 2 1/2 -6 1/2 per cent for M2, 1-5 per cent
for M3 and 4 1/2 -8 1/2 per cent for debt.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Mubarak may undertake visit to Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said yesterday he was ready to visit
Israel, but indicated further, substantial progress towards Middle East
peace was needed before he travelled to the Jewish state.
Opening a new chapter in relations with Israel, Mr Mubarak met the recently
elected Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, and said the two were
committed to advancing peace efforts.
The Egyptian leader has previously said he was prepared to travel to Israel
when the time was right. 'Mr Rabin invited me but frankly speaking, I need
no invitation,' Mr Mubarak said. 'My response is positive to Mr Rabin.'
But Mr Mubarak made it clear that Egypt was expecting 'much more' from
Israel towards halting settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Asked about the Rabin government's moves to freeze temporarily
settlement activity, Mr Mubarak declared, with the Israel leader seated next
to him: 'It is a good step on the right track and we appreciate it, yet we
need much more. But we leave it to him now.'
Neither leader mentioned any specific agreements about joint efforts to
revitalise the peace process, but it seems likely the two will co-ordinate
closely in the weeks ahead.
Mr Rabin welcomed an Egyptian offer to host bilateral talks between Israel
and her Arab neighbours, including Syria, Lebanon and a
Jordanian-Palestinian team. But he indicated that the negotiations launched
in Madrid last October would resume in Rome and may move to Cairo later.
Mr Rabin, who is on his first trip abroad since being sworn in earlier this
month, called on other Arab states to follow Egypt's example and make peace
with Israel. 'I believe the time has arrived ..for other countries, for
other peoples, to divert from war, from the course of confrontation, and
embark on the course of peace,' he said.
The Israeli Prime Minister laid a wreath at the tomb of the late President
Anwar Sadat whose 1977 visit to Jerusalem opened the way to Egypt's peace
with Israel in 1979. Mr Sadat, whose mission set off a firestorm of
criticism in Arab capitals, was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981.
The US Secretary of State, Mr James Baker, meanwhile, was exerting strong
pressure on Arab states to make compromise gestures towards Israel as he
continued his latest Middle East shuttle. Speaking in Jerusalem yesterday
before leaving for visits to Arab capitals, Mr Baker said he would be
'carrying a message that in my view there is a new opportunity to move
forward.'
The Secretary of State, on visits to Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia in the
next few days, seems likely to press the Arabs to consider lifting their
economic boycott against Israel, among other goodwill gestures.
His visit to Syria has been complicated by the death of President Hafez
al-Assad's mother. His talks with the Syrian president have been put off
until today - after Mr Baker has made a quick shuttle to Cairo for talks
with President Mubarak.
Mr Baker's return to the Middle East days after the installation of the new
Rabin government indicates Washington's desire for swift progress towards a
resumption of Middle East peace efforts. The Bush administration wants to
smooth relations with the American-Jewish community before the November
presidential elections by re-establishing warm ties with Israel, and
achieving progress in Middle East peacemaking to add lustre to its foreign
policy record.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Japan waits for economy's lucky number: The recovery will
take longer than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE numbers three, five and seven hold a spiritual significance for
Japanese, who celebrate when their children reach these symbolic ages. But a
saying now growing in popularity is that recovery will take three years for
Japanese manufacturing, five years for the banks, and seven years for the
property and securities industries.
Having confidently expected a recovery in the autumn, Japanese industry is
readjusting its sights, and even the optimistic Bank of Japan yesterday
conceded in a quarterly forecast that 'inventory adjustment', its euphemism
for economic downturn, will take longer than expected.
Japan 'must still undergo a considerable degree of adjustment for the time
being', the bank said, and there remains a 'lingering uncertainty about the
course of the economy'.
The realisation in recent days that recovery is still far in the distance
has undermined confidence in Tokyo share prices, which fell 4 per cent on
Monday and were weak again yesterday.
In part, the stock price weakness is a sign that Japanese companies, their
sales slipping and profit forecasts due for downward revision, are
confronted by difficult restructuring decisions that can no longer be
postponed.
There is also a recognition that even if the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) wins finance ministry approval for a supplementary budget of between
Y5,000bn (Pounds 20.9bn) and Y8,000bn, the country will not reach the
official target of 3.5 per cent economic growth for the year to the end of
March. Private forecasts vary greatly, but the 2-2.5 per cent range has
become a popular target.
Economic management remains a minor issue in the campaign for an upper house
election to be held next Sunday. Promises have focused on provincial
projects, and the leading opposition party, the Social Democratic Party
(SDP), formerly the Japan Socialist Party, fears that it could lose votes if
the flagging economy became a central issue.
But politicians are under pressure from small business owners, who are
feeling the financial pinch. A survey by the Small Business Credit Insurance
Corporation, a government agency, found that the number of companies
reporting difficulty in obtaining funds was 13.8 per cent higher than those
not having problems.
Conceding that the next few years will not see a return to the easy money
era of the late 1980s, several larger companies have announced reform plans.
Brother Industries, the office equipment and sewing machine maker, is
cutting its product line by 30 per cent. Leading securities houses are
reducing the annual staff intake, and steel makers are reviewing
diversifications that were affordable in the late 1980s, but an unnecessary
burden in the early 1990s.
However, many hard decisions on cutting staff and reducing products have
been delayed in the expectation of a relatively quick recovery. These
decisions will not wait much longer, and in the past few days, there has
been a steady flow of corporate announcements reflecting this realisation.
Sanyo Electric has scaled down plans for semiconductors and Honda Motor may
withdraw from Formula One racing.
The timing of the recovery is particularly crucial for the property sector,
which needs an upturn in the spring to help apartment builders weighed down
by heavy inventories and to assist banks which have accepted a postponement
in interest payments. These non-payment programmes are an attempt to avoid
confidence-shaking collapses, but the longer the property downturn, the more
pain Japanese banks will suffer.
Two signs of the increasing difficulties facing Japanese banks came last
week. EIE International, the troubled developer, said that it wanted to
renegotiate Y740bn in debt. And Watakyu Kensetsu, a Tokyo apartment builder,
admitted to being on the verge of collapse, owing Y145bn - its failure would
be the largest for the year.
In the wake of these announcements, the Japan Association of Corporate
Executives said companies are facing a credit shortage and called on the
Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate, which was lowered by 0.75
per cent to 3.75 per cent on April 1. The association said the need for a
lowering was emphasised by the record low 0.9 per cent June growth of money
supply.
The domestic downturn was also highlighted by a continuing expansion of
Japan's trade surplus, with exports rising 10.5 per cent in June, a sign
that manufacturers are exporting some of their excess domestic production
capacity. Industrial production in May fell 1.9 per cent month-on-month, and
8.8 per cent year-on-year, and the capacity utilisation index fell back to
95.7, similar to the 1987 level. But Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, director-general
of the co-ordination bureau of the Economic Planning Agency, said these
indicators are no cause for panic and, indeed, the economy is returning to
something like the pre-'bubble' normal state of 1987.
'If you just look at the 3.5 per cent growth estimate, maybe you will get
pessimistic. If you are prepared to accept 2.6 per cent growth, then maybe
you would not be pessimistic,' Mr Yoshitomi said.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US steel's dumping complaints sound
familiar - It will be hard to prove injury to the domestic industry when
production is rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and MATT KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN steel manufacturers could be excused a sense of deja vu with the
filing in the US last month of a formidable array of trade cases alleging
that they have been dumping subsidised steel products in the US market.
The same tactic was used or threatened in 1977, 1982, 1984 and 1989, and in
the end foreign competitors agreed to provide protection for US steel
producers through 'voluntary' quotas.
This time around 12 steel producers - including the six largest in the
country - have filed 84 cases against companies in 21 countries. But because
many mills have withdrawn from other production, the complaints target only
flat-rolled carbon steel, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of all
steel shipments (sales) in the US.
The tenor of the complaints is familiar. Worldwide overcapacity and a
softening steel market has made it attractive for producers to 'routinely
and systematically' dump in the US market 'far below fair market value and
often below the cost of production'.
This along with 'massive foreign subsidies' helped the US industry to a
Dollars 2.2bn loss last year. While foreign governments have been aiding
their industries to restructure, US steel has had to do it alone. In just 10
years it has slashed employment by 58 per cent - 225,000 jobs.
The last decade has brought other changes which make questionable any
assumption that the trade complaints will bring the industry the beneficial
results they have in the past.
Although the US economy is weak, it is in better shape than in 1982.
Interest rates are low; inflation is under control. After 7 1/2 years of the
'voluntary quotas', the industry - aided by the weak dollar - has become an
exporter.
Lawyers representing foreign clients are much more confident that this year
they will not be drowned in the tidal wave of complaints. They say it will
be difficult to prove that the US industry has been injured by imports when
American exports have risen steadily since the mid-eighties.
Meanwhile, according to Eurofer, the EC steel industry organisation, US
imports have dropped from 26m tonnes in 1984 to an annual 17m tonnes. During
the last three years, the EC exported no more than 70 per cent of its quota
share. The 'heart' of the American 'problem', Eurofer claims, is low prices,
driven by domestic competition and indirect subsidies, such as tax breaks.
Mr Pierre F. de Ravel d'Esclapon, who represents France's Usinor-Sacilor,
says the US International Trade Commission (ITC), the body which determines
injury, has become 'much more professional, more lawyerly and judicial'. By
often overruling the ITC, the district courts and the Court of International
Trade have forced the commission to pay close attention to the evidence that
is in the record.
Meanwhile, the commerce department - which determines the existence of
subsidies or dumping - has also been disciplined by the courts. In 1982, it
was 'a babe in the woods' playing politics, said Mr de Ravel. Its
proceedings are more court-like and its rulings more consistent and less
'arbitrary and capricious'.
Although it costs the US industry between Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 1m to
bring a trade complaint, the investment has in the past always paid off in
higher prices and, ultimately, protection. This time, however, it is taking
more of a gamble.
It has faced an outpouring of indignation from its closest trading partners
 -many of which, such as Japan and Korea, provided much of the Dollars 23bn
for the US industry's new investment over the past several years.
American steel exports must now face 27 countries with their own dumping
laws. Canada filed four cases immediately after the US action; Mexico had
two already under way. (Trade lawyers say that, because of its weak currency
and industry losses, the US is particularly susceptible to charges of
dumping and that the industry could be found guilty of receiving indirect
subsidies.)
President George Bush has virtually sworn that no more protection will be
forthcoming. He might be vulnerable to election-year pressure, but this
time, before agreeing to voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs), the
defendants are more likely to see the entire complaint process to the end.
That will not come until after the November election.
US steel prices, in real terms, are lower now than a decade ago, according
to Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel, who yesterday told the US
International Trade Commission (ITC) yesterday that 'pernicious' trade
practices have been injuring the US industry, Matt Kaminski writes from
Washington. 'The agony of the American steel industry has become part of the
national folk lore,' said Mr Alan Wolff, an industry lawyer. The ITC was
weighing testimony from US and foreign steel manufacturers for its
preliminary ruling on injury, due next month.
Although US exports have been rising, they face closed markets in the EC and
eastern Europe, American steel officials said.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: UK trade minister starts visit to HK and
China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister, arrives in Hong Kong today for
an eight-day visit which will also include China, writes David Dodwell.
The trip is intended to pave the way for a UK industry trade mission in
November, flagged by Mr Needham as 'the most important this country has ever
seen to China.'
In Hong Kong, Mr Needham will discuss export opportunities and the
territory's role as a springboard for business in China and across the
Pacific Rim, a region 'which offers the British economy and British
companies the biggest opportunity for growth of any area in the world,' he
said yesterday.
While in China, Mr Needham's discussions on bilateral trade will dovetail
with the forthcoming talks with the Overseas Development Administration on a
new line of concessional aid and the availability of export credit cover to
China. Britain's second line of credit to China - which was worth Pounds
300m - has now been used up.
'I am anxious that China fully understands that the British government,
commerce and industry are taking a long-term view of building business
across China in a whole range of sectors,' he said, conceding at the same
time that Britain had failed to exploit Hong Kong effectively both as a
market in its own right, and as a springboard for business in China.
Hong Kong is Britain's 15th largest export market, with exports rising by 13
per cent last year to Pounds 1.39bn, and a further 22 per cent up to May
this year, Mr Needham said. Britain's exports to China fell last year by 40
per cent to Pounds 322m, but are understood to have rallied by 20 per cent
in the first five months of this year.
The visit will be the first to China by a British trade minister since the
Tienanmen Square massacre in June 1989.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Tax rise on foreign companies 'would hurt
US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESSIONAL proposals to increase taxes on US subsidiaries of foreign
companies would hurt the American economy and undermine US tax treaties,
according to testimony yesterday before the House Ways and Means Committee,
writes Nancy Dunne.
Mr Evan Galbraith, chairman of the Board of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
and former US ambassador to France, vigorously attacked a bill he said would
discourage investment and cost US jobs.
'To impose capital gains tax on direct investment, impute taxable income
where none exists, tax insurance coverage, circumvent our treaty obligations
and discourage American penetration of overseas markets is intellectually
and economically indefensible,' he said. 'This bill is simply another
manifestation of protectionism.'
To counter past charges that foreign-owned subsidiaries are avoiding US
taxes, the Organisation for International Investment released a new study,
conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick, an independent accounting company, which
concludes that there is little difference between foreign and US firms.
Between 1983 and 1988 foreign-controlled companies paid an effective tax
rate of about 2.1 per cent on average compared with an average rate of 2.2
per cent for major US subsidiaries, the study said. The difference is
attributed to high start-up costs decade and a sharp depreciation of the
dollar which raised the costs of doing business in the US.
In 1988, the latest year figures are available, US subsidiaries paid Dollars
5.8bn (Pounds 3bn) in federal income tax, up 58.6 per cent from 1983.
Non-US companies, already upset about hostile Congressional sentiment to
foreign business, are alarmed about proposals by Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, to raise taxes on them.

THE Swedish Export Council has warned companies that they should export to
the former Soviet Union only on an advance-payment basis, after a survey
showed unpaid debt to Swedish firms had nearly doubled in six months, Reuter
reports from Stockholm.
In its survey covering 32 Swedish companies, the export council said
payments due from companies in the former Soviet Union, mainly Russia, grew
to Skr456m (Pounds 44m) in June from Skr256m in January.
'Our general recommendation is that Swedish companies should demand advance
payments or bank guarantees before delivering any goods,' Mr Staffan
Stenstrom at the export council said.
Swedish exports to the former Soviet Union totalled Skr2.3bn in 1991.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Italian lira, the sick currency of Europe: If Rome opts for
devaluation others may follow and the EMS could fall apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers have regarded the Italian lira as the sickest
currency in Europe for months. Its failure to respond to extensive Bank of
Italy support now makes it a prime candidate for devaluation, perhaps as
part of a general realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS),
according to London market analysts.
Devaluation of the lira would further weaken market confidence in the EMS.
Despite Monday's concerted intervention by central banks to prop up the
dollar, there is still pressure on the UK to devalue sterling against the
D-Mark, and even to leave the ERM altogether. Dealers in the foreign
exchange market fear that if the Italians devalue now, the move will
encourage other EMS member countries, such as Britain, to follow - and the
EMS could fall apart.
Since the spring, the Italian authorities have done everything in their
power to stop the fall of the lira. They have raised the discount rate by
1.75 per cent in the last fortnight, to 13.75 per cent, to make the rate of
return on lira investment more attractive. They have also actively
intervened in foreign exchange markets, buying lira and selling D-Marks to
keep the currency above its permitted lows in the EMS. The Italian central
bank's governor repeated this week that a devaluation of the lira was out of
the question.
But yesterday, the lira looked as anaemic as ever, falling dangerously close
to its permitted lower limit against the D-Mark of L765. 'The Italians could
well devalue the exchange rate at any time in the next three months,' says
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London.
Several factors have undermined the lira. Italy's political uncertainties
are chief among them. It took over six weeks to form a coalition government,
led by Prof Giuliano Amato, who now has a meagre 16-seat majority in
parliament. The government's difficulties in fighting organised crime are
also growing, with last weekend's assassination of a senior magistrate
involved in mafia investigations further undermining confidence in the
currency.
Economic uncertainty is increasing. The government's budget deficit for this
year was originally set at L128,000bn, but is now likely to overshoot by
L47,000bn unless an emergency budget is approved by parliament. Industrial
production is declining, falling in May by 5.6 per cent year-on year.
Italy's policy of raising its discount rate to strengthen the lira has
failed to impress markets. 'Every one percentage point rise adds 13 trillion
(million million) lire to the deficit,' says Mr MacKinnon. 'A vicious circle
has therefore set in: the lira falls, the Italians raise rates, the budget
deficit increases and the lira falls again as the markets lose confidence in
the economy.'
The currency is undermined by uncertainty over European Monetary Union
(Emu). The lira had benefitted from the conviction that Italy would be
forced to reduce its budget deficit to meet the Maastricht Treaty
convergence criteria. Since then the Danish 'no' vote to Maastricht and the
French referendum on the treaty in September have unnerved the markets.
'Currencies like the lira are open to speculation all the more, because the
market is willing to test the strength of the European monetary structure,'
says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London.
However, some analysts believe the Italian government need not act
immediately. Mr David Cocker, economic analyst at Chemical Bank in London,
says Italy retains large foreign currency reserves with which to fund market
intervention, estimated at about L38,000bn. There would also be little point
in devaluing before the French referendum, since a 'No' vote would make
devaluation politically easier.
Rome has also given priority to implementing a radical economic reform
package. This aims to cut L30bn off the deficit this year by a programme of
privatisation. Analysts say the government would be 'devaluing in a vacuum'
if it altered the exchange rate before the package has been ratified by
parliament in September.
But doubts remain over whether this package can be implemented by a
government with such a thin majority, while the lira is already overvalued
against the D-Mark by 25 per cent on a purchasing parity basis. 'Something
in the economy has to give if you stick to an unrealistic exchange rate,'
says Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB. 'The Italians are reaching the limits over what
they can do with economic policy.'
Analysts say EMS countries will probably allow a member to lower rates if it
has already done everything in its power to strengthen the currency. 'There
is a Europe-wide acceptance that Italy has specific problems, and that it is
doing all it can domestically to deal with them,' says Mr Lyons.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UN general says 40,000 troops needed in Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UNITED Nations peacemaking force of 40,000 would be needed to be effective
in Sarajevo alone, General Lewis MacKenzie, the senior UN soldier in the
Bosnian capital said yesterday, Reuter reports.
The general, who commands the troops guarding Sarajevo airport and keeping
open supply lines, said:
'This is the first time a (UN) peacekeeping force has been deployed when
there's no peace to keep.'
The UN had never converted a peacekeeping to a peacemaking force. 'You can't
move from one to the other - it's absolutely and totally impossible,' he
told a news conference broadcast live on Sarajevo radio and television.
Yesterday, the UN peacekeepers struggled to maintain an airlift of
humanitarian supplies for some 380,000 civilians trapped in Sarajevo.
Several cargo planes landed yesterday morning, but UN forces were then
forced to suspend flights after several mortar rounds hit the airport.
Operations were resumed about 90 minutes later, according to Gen MacKenzie.
The general, who hands over his command at the end of the month when French,
Ukrainian and Egyptian troops replace his Canadian battalion, said he had
been with nine UN missions, but that Sarajevo was 10 times as difficult as
the others put together.
'Mortars are set up beside hospitals, artillery beside schools, mortars and
other weapons are carried in ambulances - I've never seen the Red Cross
abused like that, on both sides . . . when you start to break the
international rules of war, its a downward spiral - it doesn't get better,
it gets worse.'
Gen MacKenzie, who was frequently heckled by his audience of Bosnian
journalists, accused both sides of shelling their own people to try to
influence events.
'We have evidence that both sides shell themselves in order to create a
particular image. I got so frustrated about this a month ago that I said to
both sides: 'If you'll stop shelling yourselves, maybe we'll have peace
around here.''
The general, who referred to his 'obsession with impartiality', said: 'The
citizens of Sarajevo assumed that our arrival would stop the war. People are
suffering here, being shelled and killed every day, and a bunch of guys
drive into town in white vehicles with blue berets on and they expect the
fighting to stop tomorrow. And when the shelling doesn't stop tomorrow
because that's not in our mandate, who are they going to blame? They blame
us - I understand that.'
He said the Serbs surrounding the city 'have a big problem'. If they removed
their heavy weapons the Bosnian forces were strong enough to make
significant gains against them.
'So what do they do? How do they get out of this? As a soldier I can tell
you it's a difficult situation, and I know you hate to hear me say this, but
the only way to resolve it is by talking.'
Gen MacKenzie said an international commission should be sent to Sarajevo to
give an unbiased opinion on events and constitutional and political talks
should agree a final settlement.
'My personal opinion is that if discussions do not take place, one side will
win and one side will lose and that is a tragic solution.'

FT  22 JUL 92 / SPD puts embargo monitoring in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S continued participation in the allied monitoring of the UN embargo
on Serbia and Montenegro was thrown into doubt last night by a challenge
from the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition.
A meeting of the SPD Bundestag members voted by a large majority for the
issue to be put to the federal constitutional court.
Before yesterday's round of talks, which will be followed by an emergency
Bundestag sitting today, some members wanted a ruling from the court which
would force the government to withdraw the destroyer Bayern and three
surveillance aircraft ordered to join the allied monitoring force last week.
Some, including Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary party chairman, claimed
the aim was simply to clarify a 'grey area' in the constitution, while
others supported the government line that Germany should be prepared to play
its full role in international affairs.
At issue is a vague clause in the constitution which has in the past been
generally accepted as confining German armed forces to within the Nato area.
It has not yet been tested in court.
The SPD, outraged that the government ordered forces to join the UN and
Western European Union monitoring exercise without consulting parliament,
appeared to be in danger of damaging its already fragile consensus.
Mr Hermann Heinemann, an SPD minister in the North Rhine Westphalia state
government, denounced the attempt to have the court rule, saying Germany
could not stand aside from measures aimed at securing peace.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Anger at funeral of Mafia's victims
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE of Palermo yesterday vented their anger and frustration over the
state's inability to curb the ever more brazen power of the Mafia.
Crowds jostled, jeered and insulted Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian
president, Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, and police chiefs as they
attended the funeral of five bodyguards assassinated on Sunday in Palermo
alongside Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate.
The crowd's frustration was also reflected in a potentially more awkward
move for the government. Seven of the 16 junior judges in Palermo working on
Mafia-related cases announced they were resigning. At the same time, Mr Aldo
Rizzo, mayor of Palermo, handed his resignation.
It was the second time in two months that government members have been
abused by hostile crowds at funerals of magistrates and policemen murdered
by the Mafia. The last occasion was the funeral of Mr Giovanni Falcone,
whose three-car armoured convoy was destroyed by a powerful bomb on May 23
outside Palermo.
Yesterday the mood was uglier and more frustrated over the authorities'
failure to prevent the car bomb attack on the bodyguards and Mr Borsellino -
a man known to have become the prime target for the Mafia.
Some 10,000 people gathered outside Palermo cathedral. A heavy police cordon
finally broke and people rushed inside at the end of the service.
The president and government members had to leave by a side entrance, their
escort scarcely able to hold back the jostling crowd.
The government's hostile reception occurred despite rapid action in
despatching nearly 3,000 extra police and troops to the island. The
government also promised to toughen existing anti-Mafia laws going through
parliament, and set in motion a large-scale plan of transferring imprisoned
Mafia bosses to high security jails on the mainland and on an isolated
island off Elba.

The rouble fell sharply against the dollar yesterday on the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange with the change in the chairmanship of the Russian central
bank being blamed by the Itar-Tass news agency, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The currency fell to 151.1 to the dollar from 135.4 roubles the previous
week, Tass said.
Tass said the fall was due to the naming of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, former
head of the defunct Soviet Gosbank, as Russia's central bank head. Mr
Gerashchenko has said money spent defending the rouble could have been
better used elsewhere.

A Czech republican government would be willing to assume responsibility for
the entire Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 4.86bn) foreign debt of the present Czech
and Slovak federal republic if the 'velvet divorce' of the republics goes
through at the end of September as proposed, according to Mr Vladimir
Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, writes David Dodwell.
Mr Dlouhy, in London to calm western fears over the Czech government's
determination to stand by its economic reform programme, said the break-up
of the federal state would involve difficult negotiations over the division
of foreign exchange assets and earnings - most significantly revenue from
the transit gas pipeline from the former Soviet Union.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Fed chief predicts pick-up in US economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC GROWTH in the US will soon pick up again, and any effort by
Congress to hasten the recovery by cutting taxes will probably be
counterproductive, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman,
said yesterday.
'I expect that the economic expansion will soon gain momentum, which lower
inflation should help to maintain,' Mr Greenspan told the Senate banking
committee in presenting the central bank's twice yearly report to Congress
on monetary policy and economic pros-pects.
Mr Greenspan faced a hostile congressional audience, led by Senator Donald
Riegle of Michigan who attacked him for lowering interest rates too slowly
and for believing that monetary easing alone would be enough to lead the US
economy to recovery.
'I don't hear you saying anything different to the people out there in the
country who are in trouble except: 'hang on',' Mr Riegle said.
Mr Greenspan acknowledged that the unemployment rate was much worse than he
had anticipated a year ago. This, however, was because a greater proportion
of the population than expected was entering the workforce, rather than
following alternatives such as further education or home-making.
The size of the federal budget deficit had severely limited the choices
available, he said, and any effort to 'jump start' the economy with a
package of tax incentives would be dangerous.
'I will not deny that there is a possibility that if some fiscal stimulus
were enacted we would accelerate near term. I think that is highly risky . .
. and could probably be counterproductive,' Mr Greenspan warned. 'I do not
believe this notion that we can jump start the economy . . . The relevant
analogy is turning an ocean liner around.'
In a session notable for its almost total lack of any reference to exchange
rates or to Monday's concerted intervention by central banks to halt the
slide of the dollar, Mr Greenspan spent much of his time defending the Fed's
slow but steady policy which has resulted in 23 easings of monetary policy
over the past three years - the last of which cut the discount rate (at
which the Fed lends to banks) to 3 per cent earlier this month.
Any attempt to lower short-term interest rates faster, he said, would simply
have pushed long-term rates higher because it would have provoked fears of a
revival of inflation.
Mr Greenspan said the Fed expected consumer prices to rise by between 2 3/4
per cent and 3 1/4 per cent next year. 'Were this to be realised, inflation
would be about back to a pace last seen on a sustained basis around a
quarter century ago,' he said.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Rate rise still a danger, say societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD, EMMA TUCKER and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies warned the government yesterday that they were still
under pressure to put up their interest rates despite the Treasury's
decision on Monday to cut interest paid on the National Savings First Option
Bond.
As the threat of early mortgage rate rises receded, however, shares ended
mostly firmer in London where the FT-SE 100 index closed up 11.9 at 2,415.6.
The societies' warning coincided with the publication of figures showing
that building societies are still under severe pressure for their funding
with a net outflow of Pounds 314m from their savings deposits in June, the
worst monthly figure in nearly six years.
Fears of a rise in home loan costs in the short term subsided as the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, announced it would not
go ahead with a planned increase in its standard mortgage rate from 10.75
per cent to 10.99 per cent.
While the C &amp; G's change of heart was good news for the government,
yesterday saw little relief for sterling. The pound remained weak against
the D-Mark which continued to strengthen in spite of Monday's concerted
intervention by central banks to damp its recent rise.
Sterling did gain some ground in late London trading, however, to close
unchanged on the day at DM2.8425. In New York it slipped to DM2.8388.
The dollar, meanwhile, held on to most of Monday's gains while the lira
continued to weaken.
Against a background of growing worries about the economy and pressures on
public finances Mr John Major, the prime minister, will spell out the tight
restraints on this year's public expenditure round at a meeting of the
Cabinet today.
That message was emphasised by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who
yesterday said there was no alternative to his policy of bearing down on
inflation.
Mr Major is expected to reiterate his warning to colleagues that tax cuts at
the end of the current parliament are entirely dependent on austerity
measures now.
The prime minister is expected to stress that he is backing the Treasury's
attempts to hold down total spending next year to Pounds 244.5bn, in spite
of the surge in unemployment benefits payments.
The C &amp; G move led Abbey National, the second largest mortgage lender, at
the last minute to cancel plans to announce a similar rate increase.
This would almost certainly have forced the rest of the market to follow.
'One problem has been alleviated but any others that were there remain. We
don't imagine that we are going to see a big inflow of savings,' said Mr
Andrew Longhurst, C &amp; G chief executive.
The size of the outflow of savings during June, a month before the
introduction of the First Option Bond, is alarming to the societies.
Total building society net receipts in the first six months of the year were
just Pounds 343m, compared with Pounds 4.64bn in the same period last year.
The First (or fixed interest rate savings tax-paid) Option Bond was launched
with a gross interest rate of 10.34 per cent, which attracted funds away
from the building societies. On Monday the rate was cut to 9.67 per cent.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
there had been a shift towards investments in other savings products, and
particularly National Savings. The societies also face stiff competition
from guaranteed income bonds.
Some societies believe the savings outflow also reflects a tendency by
savers to withdraw money to pay off loans. 'If this situation continues, the
societies will have no alternative but to put their rates up in another two
months or so,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Cabinet denies leaking Ashdown smear to paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was thrown on to the defensive yesterday after allegations of
'dirty tricks' during the general election forced Conservative Central
Office to hold an inquiry which produced denials of involvement from every
member of the cabinet.
The claim by Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, that an unnamed
'prominent cabinet minister' had offered him inaccurate information
concerning Mr Paddy Ashdown prompted an immediate row at Westminster.
It came as Mr David Mellor, the embattled national heritage secretary,
struggled to resume normal working at his department in spite of continued
press investigations into his relationship with 31-year-old actress, Miss
Antonia de Sancha.
After a day-long inquiry including emergency talks between Sir Norman
Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, and Mr John Major yesterday
afternoon, Central Office released a statement last night rejecting The
Sun's charges.
It said Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor and the then party chairman,
and Lord Wakeham, who was also responsible for press liaison during the
election, had 'categorically' denied the claim, as had every other cabinet
minister. Mr Kenneth Baker, retired from the cabinet, associated himself
with the statement and efforts were underway to contact Mr Peter Brooke,
Lord Waddington and Mr Tom King. The denials are unlikely, however, to
satisfy opposition parties who earlier yesterday demanded an explanation
from the government.
Mr John Smith, the newly-elected Labour leader, called on Mr MacKenzie to
reveal the name of the minister, saying that if the charge was true it was
'quite disgraceful'. He added: 'I don't know how a cabinet minister who did
anything like that can possibly remain in his post.'
The Liberal Democrats, in a statement, said: 'It is now up to the
Conservative party to clear this matter up and they should do so as soon as
possible.'
One senior cabinet minister privately agreed that the claim by the editor of
the Sun, made in an editorial yesterday, had come as a severe embarrassment
to the government after widespread Conservative indignation at newspaper
reporting of the affair.
Admitting that a resignation would be inevitable if Mr MacKenzie's claim was
substantiated, he added: 'These are dangerous times.'
In his editorial, Mr MacKenzie alleged that in the second week of the
election campaign he received a telephone call from a cabinet minister
offering the names and addresses of three women allegedly linked to the
Liberal Democrat leader.
It went on: 'It was no coincidence that the smear on Mr Ashdown was planted
at a time when the Tories' election campaign was at a low ebb.' Subsequent
checks revealed the allegations to be untrue, the editorial said.
Yesterday Mr MacKenzie also claimed that during the general election a
Labour MP had made serious allegations to him about Mr Neil Kinnock, then
leader of the party.
'They turned out not to be true but Neil Kinnock then started accusing us of
trying to smear him,' Mr MacKenzie told ITN. A Labour spokesman said there
seemed to be 'no basis' for the accusation.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Oslo struggles to shake off its
depression - Karen Fossli reviews the prospects for the bourse as it
languishes at a three-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OSLO is finding it difficult to shake off the depression which has pulled
the stock market down by 10.5 per cent this year, but domestic analysts
believe that the second half will bring a change for the better.
On Monday, the all-share index hit a three-year nadir of 369.99, forcing 19
stocks to their lows for 1992. It finished at 378.11 yesterday. Oslo has
been plagued by bad news carried over from last year, and the Bundesbank's
discount rate decision last week has extinguished any glimmer of optimism.
The market is particularly sensitive to external influences, due to the high
dependency of its blue chip industrial and shipping stocks on
dollar-denominated export earnings.
Its industrial index has fallen by 4.1 per cent since the start of the year,
but the shipping sector has plunged by 30.2 per cent as shipowners struggle
to cover operational costs, as charter rates sag and the dollar weakens.
Export companies have lost up to 20 per cent in revenue due to the weak
dollar, analysts estimate. Domestic factors such as uncertainty over
membership in the European Community (EC) and a slower than expected
recovery in the economy have also taken their toll on sentiment.
This holds true to a lesser extent for bank and insurance shares, whose poor
performance this year can be attributed to the successive years of major
losses and a general lack of confidence in the country's banking system.
However, analysts believe that banks have seen the worst.
The failure of Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, to create a
Scandinavian insurance giant with Sweden's Skandia in an alliance involving
Danish and Finnish insurers, has led to unrest in the market.
Uni's undesirable Skandia situation - a 28 per cent stake worth NKr4bn
(Pounds 673m), achieving nothing - is inhibiting the company's own domestic
equity investment, which in turn has sapped liquidity from the market. Uni's
'A' shares, too, have been trading about 50 per cent lower at NKr25 since
the end of last year.
Norway's domestic strength, in North Sea oil and metals, is producing
cautious optimism, at best, for the second half. The country is Europe's
biggest oil producer, alongside Britain, with crude output of about 2.1m
barrels a day, but it is also a large exporter of light metals. It is no
surprise, therefore, that the economy's health depends on oil prices and the
dollar.
The caution is demonstrated by Statoil, the state oil company, which has
mounted yet another cost-cutting campaign in which it aims to trim NKr2bn
from operational budgets in an effort to withstand low crude oil prices.
However, Mr Tom Skjaerstad, a broker with the Oslo-based Norse Securities,
believes that the market has bottomed out and that there is hope for
recovery in the second half. 'Oil prices have firmed at around Dollars 20 to
Dollars 21 a barrel, our political climate is stable and there exists a
commitment internationally to support the dollar,' he says.
On shipping, Mr Skjaerstad thinks rates for VLCCs (very large crude
carriers) will firm in August and September, and that scrapping of old
tonnage will continue.
Mr Tormodd Andreassen, managing director of Alfred Berg Securities in Oslo,
dismisses the market's performance in the first half of 1992 as dismal but
sees only gradual recovery in the second half.
'Financial consolidation in Norway has come a long way and this implies that
consumption will pick up, leading to recovery,' he says. 'There will be some
improvement - maybe even more improvement than in other countries - but
there will be no really solid gains in the capital markets, unless the
dollar strengthens considerably and German rates come down.'
Mr Andreassen adds that, this autumn, three outstanding political issues
will affect the market:
Parliament is meant to ratify the European Economic Area agreement, linking
the EC and Efta, in which Norway is a member;
an application to join the EC will also be decided by the government;
and in October an 'election budget' will be presented.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent stages a technical
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST continental bourses staged a technical rebound after two days of heavy
losses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was heartened by the dollar's gains after concerted intervention
on Monday, the DAX index recovering 10.10 to 1,659.77. But investors
remained on the sidelines as turnover eased from DM6.9bn to DM6.5bn.
From Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, Mr Michael Zapf gave investors some
encouragement. 'All cyclical indicators,' he said, 'suggest that the
economic weakening which had been in progress since the second quarter of
1991 is over.'
The bank's charts on growth of production and incoming orders show a
turnround and the same cyclical pattern 'is also showing for such still
struggling industries as steel . . .'
Steels rose in concert yesterday, led by Klockner-Werke, up DM2.50 to
DM108.50, and Hoesch, DM4.10 higher at DM241.10. However, the sector has
been anticipating economic recovery for at least the last three months, and
domestic analysts are divided about its appeal.
Another cyclical stock, meanwhile, came unstuck. PWA tumbled DM19.50 to
DM201.50 after forecasting that the 1992 dividend would be at least halved,
and that net profits in the first six months had dropped by 89 per cent to
DM6m on flat sales.
Lufthansa rose DM3.80 to DM113.80 in active trade on news that the
government plans to sell all of its 52.95 per cent stake in the airline at
some stage in the future. Lufthansa has been standing close to its 1992 low
on poor profit prospects.
MILAN steadied after Monday's sharp losses but sentiment remained fragile.
Dealers expect trading to remain volatile for the rest of the week. The
Comit index eased 0.96 to 411.71 in turnover estimated at less than Monday's
L139bn.
Fiat, which tumbled 6.7 per cent on Monday, eased just L1 to L4,574 and
recovered to L4,590 after hours. The telecom sector also found its footing,
with Sip adding L15 to L1,047 and Stet unchanged at L1,445. The board of Iri
is due to meet tomorrow to discuss the sector's reform and, in particular,
how to reorganise the former ASST's assets.
There was still some fallout from Monday, however, with Ambroveneto
suspended from trading temporarily because of excessive losses. The stock
was eventually fixed down L69 at L3,436.
PARIS ended lower after a volatile day, as the CAC-40 finished 5.23 down at
1,762.67 on modest turnover of just under FFr2bn. Dealers said there was
some buying of defensive and quality stocks, with Alcatel adding FFr6 to
FFr624 and L'Oreal adding FFr17 to FFr934.
Euro Disney fell FFr2 to FFr100. A report in a UK newspaper yesterday said
that disappointing attendances and hints from British tour operators that
they would drop the theme park from their programmes have prompted Euro
Disney to restructure its prices.
AMSTERDAM improved in spite of a lack of corporate news. The CBS Tendency
index finished up 1.00 at 117.6.
News that British Airways was to take a 44 per cent stake in USAir had
little real negative impact on KLM. The Dutch and UK carriers have been
holding talks for months but the market had already discounted the
possibility of a merger. KLM closed down 50 cents at Fl 32.00. Fokker
improved Fl 1.10 to Fl 30.10 on hopes that talks between Dasa of Germany and
the Dutch government, which began on Monday and are scheduled to continue
tomorrow, will be successful.
Companies with strong US exposure performed well, with Hunter Douglas
gaining Fl 2.50 or 4 per cent to Fl 61.30.
ZURICH majored on blue chips, and the SMI index of leading shares added 29.5
to 1,786.1, Nestle bearers topping the active list as they rose SFr150 to
SFr9,330.
Roche certificates came second in the list and rose SFr110 to SFr3,260. The
pharmaceutical company said that it expected markedly higher current year
profits after a 19 per cent rise in turnover for the first six months of
1992.
STOCKHOLM recovered in thin trade, turnover dropping from SKr352m to SKr283m
as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 10.7 to 860.5.
Most Swedish blue chips with key markets in the US or products denominated
in dollars rose, Volvo B recovering SKr5 to SKr338, Ericsson B SKr3 to
SKr123 and Electrolux B by SKr7 to SKr225.

FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo's rebound gives
support to the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in short-term interest rates encouraged investors, and the Nikkei
average gained for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 117.93 firmer at 16,002.41, after touching a day's
low of 15,770.67 and high of 16,055.30 on arbitrage unwinding and buying by
investment trusts.
Volume remained flat at 200m shares. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei,
other market indicators reflected underlying weakness. Declines led advances
by 472 to 429, with 171 issues unchanged. A total of 136 stocks fell to new
lows for the year, and the Topix index of all first section issues shed 0.76
to 1,229.38. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.30 to 962.46.
Weakness in overseas markets on Monday prompted futures-linked arbitrage
unwinding, but shares then recouped losses on heavy index-linked buying by
investment trusts and dealers. Some traders found comfort in the fall in the
overnight call rates, as a prelude to monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.
However, overall activity by investors has dried up, and the low volumes
leave share prices vulnerable to movements in the futures markets, and
arbitrage activity. Ms Kathy Matsui at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Most
investors, especially the foreigners and individuals, have adopted a
wait-and-see attitude.' She added that investors will want to see some
semblance of concern from the authorities about the market's weakness before
coming back again.
Dealers bought speculative stocks for short-term trading purposes. Meiji
Milk Products gained Y30 to Y930 and Taiyo Fishery Y6 to Y452.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y4,000 to Y598,000 on selling by
financial institutions, while bank issues weakened on sales by leading
foreign brokerages. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y20 to Y1,670 and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Y10 to Y1,210.
High-technology issues, which dropped on Monday on fears of sharply lower
profits for the current year, rallied on bargain hunting. NEC rose Y22 to
Y808 and Sony Y70 to Y4,030, but Hitachi slipped a further Y8 to Y752 and
Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, was Y8 lower at Y612.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 17.18 to 18,351.07, declining for the
fourth consecutive day. Volume increased to 15.8m shares from 9.2m.
Roundup
TOKYO'S rebound gave support to most markets in the region.
HONG KONG ended moderately higher on strong buying interest in HSBC Holdings
after its Marine Midland Bank division reported a turnround in first-half
results on Monday. The Hang Seng index appreciated 23.95 to 6,010.44 in
turnover of HKDollars 3.13bn.
HSBC added HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 54.5 and Hang Seng Bank climbed
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53.
AUSTRALIA was helped by the rise in Tokyo. The All Ordinaries index improved
4.4 to 1,609.3. Resource issues remained weak, although gold shares
continued to rally as the bullion price touched a seven-month high.
National Australia Bank attracted interest after announcing a takeover bid
for Bank of New Zealand, the shares rising 8 cents to ADollars 7.87. Westpac
continued to suffer from an impending rights issue, closing 3 cents easier
at ADollars 3.14.
NEW ZEALAND recovered some of the ground lost on Monday, the NZSE-40 capital
index ending 5.08 better at 1,560.08 in turnover of NZDollars 27.2m. Bank of
New Zealand dipped 3 cents to 76 cents after National Australia's NZDollars
1.48bn takeover bid.
MANILA finished lower after lacklustre trade. The composite index weakened
19.96 to 1,433.04 in combined turnover of 371.6m pesos.
TAIWAN rose, with paper issues stronger on reports of cheaper pulp prices.
The weighted index, down more than 70 points in early trade, closed a net
11.43 up at 4,159.02. Turnover came to TDollars 23.73bn (TDollars 22.88bn).
Ban Yu Paper rose 30 cents to TDollars 18.90.
SINGAPORE declined, with some analysts noting that interest remained in
over-the-counter Malaysian stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index shed
11.29 to 1,434.46 in volume of 54.58m shares. Falls led rises by 124 to 102.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index put on 2.40 to 605.16 in active trade,
concentrated in speculative stocks.
SEOUL staged a technical rebound, the composite index moving ahead 6.54 to
511.84. Turnover was still thin, at Won107.53bn.
Hyundai group shares were actively traded as six of the 17 listed group
shares reached their daily upper limits. Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Precision
and Industries added Won800 apiece at Won16,400 and Won17,500 respectively.
KARACHI fell for the fifth straight session amid political uncertainty over
democracy moves. The KSE index closed 16.42 lower at 1,400.56.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum falls in hectic
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM'S PRICE fell sharply in hectic trading in London and New York
yesterday following an announcement that another automotive catalyst using
palladium instead of platinum had been developed in Japan.
In spite of assertions by the industry that the Japanese development would
have little, if any impact, on the platinum market, it sparked two waves of
selling - initially among professionals as the news broke and later by US
funds before trading began in New York.
Platinum closed in London at Dollars 380.85 a troy ounce, down Dollars 9.85.
Dealers suggested that the Japanese development was simply used as an excuse
to sell by investors who had recently bought platinum because of growing
political tension and violence in South Africa, the world's biggest producer
and responsible for more than 65 per cent of supply.
However, chances of a serious interruption to platinum production seem to be
drifting away. For example, a draft peace charter was drawn up in South
Africa last week by unions and business leaders which might be ratified
soon. The accord could head off the general strike planned for August 3 and
limit it to one day.
Why European and New York markets did not react to this development on
Monday is not clear.
However, yesterday the Japanese National Institute for Resources and
Environment (NIRE) brought attention back to platinum briefly by announcing
it would give details of its new automotive catalyst next week. Automotive
catalysts provide platinum's biggest market but Mr Brian Nathan, managing
director of Ayrton Metals, pointed out that NIRE referred only to diesel
catalysts which already are based on palladium, a cheaper material, rather
than platinum or rhodium.
He also pointed out that NIRE had given no indication when the new catalyst,
based on magnesium-alumate and palladium, would be available or in use.
Some analysts suggested last night that, as political tension eases in South
Africa, the platinum price could ease back to Dollars 370 an ounce or even
to Dollars 360 where it stood before its recent rise.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India seeks rise in leather
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA IS aiming for a 13.5 per cent growth in leather and leather products
exports to Dollars 1.48bn in 1992-93 (April to March).
According to the Council for Leather Exports, India is capable of achieving
this growth in spite of the continuing recession in European Community, the
destination for more than 60 per cent of its leather exports, and the
economic constraints on Russian buyers.
Last year, however, India's leather exports declined by 8 per cent in dollar
terms.
Having already banned overseas sales of semi-finished leather, India will
seek to raise further the share of value -added leather products in its
export total by 3 per cent to 77 per cent in the current year.
The export target for leather garments is Dollars 370m, for shoe uppers
Dollars 320m, for footwear Dollars 240m, for other leather goods Dollars
255m and for finished leather Dollars 295m. The country plans gradually to
phase out the export of finished leather.
The council has urged the federal government to give Russia immediately a
technical credit of Dollars 40m to enable it to pay for last year's imports
of shoe uppers and garments and also open letters of credit for fresh
imports. A large number of Indian exporters to Russia have closed shop
because they have not been paid for earlier shipments.
While Germany will remain by far the largest importer of Indian leather, the
council points out that the US, the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Australia
are also important buyers.
Leather export prospects have improved following the steps taken by Indian
manufacturers to control the incidence of carcinogenic substances in
leather.
India has the largest bovine population in the world, estimated at 250m.
This gives an idea of the unrealised export potential of leather. But the
country has still not been able to organise scientifically the collection of
carcasses and the preparation and preservation of the hides.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals upsurge showing signs of
tarnish - Why there are fears of another false dawn among LME traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES ON the London Metal Exchange have been rising strongly in recent
weeks, turnover is high and some traders have dusted off the vintage
champagne bottles to celebrate. The casual observer might well mistakenly
assume that the LME's upbeat mood is signalling that a full-blown world
economic recovery is on the way.
After all, LME traded metals - aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc
 -are essential to the industrialised world and are used for a wide variety
of products.
But the LME is giving some distorted signals.
One reason for the present buoyancy is that US-based commodity funds have
piled in with big 'buy' orders. These funds have been excessively influenced
by the tentative economic revival in the US, suggests Mr Neil Buxton,
research manager at Metal Bulletin Research.
He says: 'They see investment in metals as a good way to play that economic
recovery. Metals prices have been falling since 1988-89 and other financial
markets are not offering such good returns as in the past.'
That is not to suggest the funds are entirely wrong. Most analysts believe
that metals prices will finish this year at a higher level than they started
it. 'That's not saying much,' Mr Buxton points out, 'because they started at
such a low level.'
However, it will take some time before the overpowering economic gloom lifts
sufficiently to justify a strong rise in metals prices.
As Mr David Humphries, an economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's
biggest mining group, suggests, metals demand in Japan, which accounts for
about 18 per cent of world usage, will fall this year. Prospects in the
European Community, accounting for 30 per cent, are looking dim because
Germany, the driving force, is 'coming off the boil'. Only in the US,
accounting for 25 per cent of world metals usage, is demand showing
tentative signs of recovery.
Mr Graham Deller, analyst at the Metals and Minerals Research Services
consultancy group, points out that OECD industrial production - an important
indicator of potential metals demand - was lower in the first quarter this
year than in the final quarter of 1991 and was unchanged in the 1992 second
quarter. MMRS is looking for industrial production to improve by only 0.5
per cent this year.
'As industrial production usually leads metals prices by about six months,
even if there is a pick-up in the second half of this year, we would not see
any big pick-up in metals prices until late 1993 or even 1994,' Mr Deller
says.
What do the statistics tell us about metals markets in the first half of
this year? The sharp price rises in June saw all the LME traded metals
finish the month higher than they were in January (see table).
However, average prices of aluminium, copper, lead and nickel over the six
months were all below their 1991 level. Tin's average price was up, braced
by severe producer cuts that will leave the market substantially
under-supplied this year.
The average zinc price was sharply up (by nearly 9 per cent) but this was
caused by traders playing games and using options to cause a nasty technical
squeeze in the LME's market for the second time in only six months.
The LME executive eventually had to step in on June 15 to limit the daily
backwardation (the premium charged for metal for immediate delivery). This
eased the situation but the LME is having to continue monitoring zinc
because it seems very likely that the squeeze will re-emerge strongly in
October.
Analysts suggest the same group of traders and producers who squeezed the
zinc market in June have rolled their positions over to October. 'They like
this market and have no intention of selling. They are probably going to go
longer,' said one trader. 'They have a million tonnes (a year) of production
between them.'
Copper, which recently touched its highest price in 18 months, is also being
buoyed up by the threat of another LME squeeze in the fourth quarter of this
year and early 1993. Traders suggest that Sumitomo of Japan, which caused an
options-related squeeze last year and forced the LME executive to intervene
in the copper market, is moving in the same direction again.
However, copper, the LME's 'flagship' contract and the most heavily-traded,
is also benefiting from the usual supply disruptions at a time when demand
is holding up reasonably well. Most analysts say copper supply and demand
are more or less in balance.
While there has been some drop in demand from Japan because of that
country's slowing growth, the Chinese have re-emerged as substantial copper
buyers this year. Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, points
out that the Chinese might buy 200,000 tonnes of copper in 1992, 'which
would take up all the slack from Japan'.
Other metals are also likely to feel the impact of China's recent dramatic
economic growth - its industrial production was up by an estimated 18 per
cent in the first half of this year. 'The potential for increased base metal
demand from China is huge - and it will be tempered only by the availability
of foreign exchange and the country's existing infrastructure,' says Mr Euan
Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg, the financial services
group.
Meanwhile, disturbances caused in metals markets by the collapse of the
Soviet Union are by no means at an end.
'Although total exports from the former communist countries could be
slightly down from the 1991 levels because of depressed prices, coupled with
shortages of raw materials and closures because of environmental concerns,
exports are still likely to be high by historical standards. They will
therefore continue to act as a depressive influence on prices,' says Mr
Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez
Group.
Aluminium and nickel will be hit particularly badly because exports of these
from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the former eastern Europe
have a bigger impact on western supply-demand balances than other metal
exports.
On the positive side of the metals equation, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord
Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, points out that stock levels
remain relatively low, at less than 10 weeks of consumption compared with 15
to 20 weeks at the end of past recessions. The exception is aluminium,
because of the Russian exports. But all metal stocks are likely to shrink
quickly when demand picks up, he suggests - and prices go up as stocks go
down.
LME traders meanwhile hope that the recent upsurge in business is not
another false dawn. One said: 'We've been staggering along for 18 months on
wafer-thin margins and low prices. Now business has at least doubled. But
will it hold?'
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, is hopeful. He says: 'On the LME genuine trade
business from producers and consumers has risen. Brokers have increased
their position-taking and there has been growing speculative interest from
managed funds. There is a feeling that the metals cycle is on the turn.'

FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guttman prepares to defend
futures charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOU Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's
largest energy market, has been forced to take a leave of absence from his
duties, effective July 31, because of possible civil charges against him
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry
regulator.
Earlier this month, the CFTC's enforcement division served notice on Mr
Guttman that it was preparing to ask the commission to file an
administrative complaint against him and a former partner, Mr Harold Magid,
because of a series of allegedly pre-arranged trades in 1989.
With that notification, the CFTC invited a response from Messrs Guttman and
Magid, and once they have replied the commission will vote on whether to
bring charges. The supposedly prearranged trades, which were executed by Mr
Magid for the Guttman-Magid trading partnership called Harley Futures, did
not involve customer monies and therefore do not entail charges of fraud.
The joint venture was liquidated in 1990.
In a letter to the board of Nymex, Mr Guttman emphatically denied that he
was responsible for any wrongdoing.
Mr Barry Bohrer, Mr Guttman's lawyer, says that Mr Guttman will respond to
the CFTC by the end of the month, arguing that the Nymex chief should not be
held responsible for the allegedly illegal trades because he had nothing to
do with them.
Mr Guttman has been Nymex chairman since 1988 and was not actively engaged
in his trading partnership. He decided on taking a leave of his day-to-day
duties as Nymex chairman in order not to have a cloud over the exchange. The
futures industry has frequently been rocked by trading scandals and Mr
Guttman appears to want to leave Nymex as untarnished as possible.
In 1990, Mr Karsten Mahlmann, then chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade,
was forced to resign from his post because his trading firm, Stotler &amp;
Company, was charged with fraud.

LONDON Metal Exchange contracts generally rallied yesterday afternoon after
values had been hit in early trading by a wave of liquidation. Most base
metals closed with losses still showing, but the rally continued in
after-hours 'kerb' trading. This took LEAD, which closed Pounds 4 down for
cash at Pounds 334 a tonne, near to a fresh 12-month high as the market was
supported by trade buying and reports of Chinese offtake. ZINC resisted the
early downtrend and support held at around Dollars 1,320 a tonne for three
months metal, although it was unsettled by Monday's LME announcement that
the market was again being 'closely monitored' because of concern over a
developing technical supply squeeze. The later rally carried the three
months zinc price to Dollars 1,344.50 at the close, down Dollars 14 on the
day, and to Dollars 1,355 a tonne by the end of kerb trading. TIN rallied
particularly strongly, as early short-covering prompted fresh buying, and
ended with a substantial recovery from the recent decline. The cash position
closed Dollars 170 higher at Dollars 6,880 a tonne and made a further gain
after hours. COCOA futures rallied from early lows, raising hopes of

FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia in call for oil
investment lifeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN oil production could fall by 15 per cent both this year and in 1993
without foreign investment, an aide to Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting Russian prime
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Sergei Roginko, an adviser on foreign investment projects in Mr Gaidar's
secretariat, was in London to promote OGE '92, the first international oil
industry trade fair in the autonomous republic of Tatarstan in October.
The exhibition is jointly backed by the Russian energy ministry and the
Tatarstan government to highlight investment opportunities for foreign
companies, despite Tatarstan's vote for self-rule in March, and a dispute
between the two governments over shares of oil revenues.
'We are trying to stress our common interests,' Mr Roginko said. He added
that at least 5m tonnes of oil had been sold illegally in the past year by
'speculators' who were 'bleeding Russia dry' by buying oil cheaply for
roubles and selling it for hard currency on the world market.
He pledged, however, that 'serious' foreign investors prepared to make a
long-term commitment could be exempted from the punitive Ecus28 a tonne
(roughly Dollars 5 a barrel) export tariff the Russian government had been
forced to implement to combat illegal exports.
Gulf Canada and Conoco had both recently secured exemptions from export
tariffs, Mr Roginko said, and the White Nights project, operated by US
companies Phibro Energy and Anglo Suisse with Siberian producer
Varyeganneftegaz, was also negotiating possible exemption. The pledge will
be welcomed by western companies, for which the export tariff has been a
major disincentive for investment.
Raising Russian oil prices to world market levels could solve the problem of
fraudulent exports, but the Russian government had concluded this could only
be done gradually, otherwise it would 'turn our economy upside down' and
aggravate inflation, Mr Roginko said. He predicted the process would take 'a
couple of years'.
Mr Roginko said investment of Dollars 5bn to Dollars 10bn was needed to halt
the decline in output.
He said western technology could significantly extend the life of some
fields and re-open many of the 15 per cent of wells now standing idle.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank's note auction shows Ecu
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday completed an auction of Ecu500m three-year
Treasury notes, although at far higher interest rates than the last auction
in April.
Around 80 per cent of the notes on offer yesterday were sold at a yield of
10.04 per cent. The highest yield accepted at the first auction of Ecu1bn
notes in January was 8.6 per cent, rising to 8.87 per cent in April.
The results underlined the dramatic reversal in the Ecu bond market since
its peak at the end of last year. Ecu bonds have under-performed the
government bond markets of the countries which make up the Ecu currency
basket.
In December, three-year Ecu bonds were yielding 85 basis points less than
the 'theoretical' basket of underlying government bonds suggested they
should, reflecting the strength of demand for Ecu-denominated securities.
Yesterday, this differential had narrowed to 30 basis points. At the longer
10-year maturity, Ecu bonds now yield more than the theoretical level for
the first time since January 1990.
However, although yields have risen in line with the secondary market,
demand for short-dated Ecu bonds remains buoyant. The Bank of England
yesterday received bids for Ecu1.26bn notes, covering the paper on offer by
2.5 times.
Funds raised from the auction will bolster the government's foreign exchange
reserves, rather than funding the public sector borrowing requirement.
According to the prospectus issued late last year, the next auction is due
October 20. The Bank of England is unlikely to cancel an auction, but it can
reject all the auction bids if it believes the prices offered by investors
are too low.
The Bank believes that issuing Ecu notes still makes sense, and that the
three-year note programme improves the liquidity of the Ecu bond market in
London.

DEUTSCHE Bank is to amalgamate its futures and options broking businesses in
London as part of a move to build its small market share of derivatives
trading.
The bank said yesterday it was merging activities undertaken in Deutsche
Bank's name in London with those of Morgan Grenfell, its merchant banking
subsidiary. The merger affects only exchange-traded instruments, not
over-the-counter ones.
Each part of the group currently maintains around 12 people on the floor of
the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Deutsche
Bank has specialised in D-Mark products and Morgan Grenfell in sterling,
though moves into other currencies have created overlaps between the two
sides.
The merger was intended to improve economies of scale, said Mr John Lake, a
managing director of Deutsche Bank in London.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese yields tumble as
rates ease
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE government bonds yesterday reached levels not seen for nearly three
years as the Bank of Japan allowed money market interest rates to drift
lower.
The tumbling bond yields are the latest sign that investors expect the
authorities to react soon to the steady weakening of the Japanese economy by
relaxing their monetary stance still further.
Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark bond No. 129 dropped to 5.11 per cent
from 5.17 per cent on Monday. At the same time, the futures contract rose
tentatively above the psychologically-important 104.00 level, before
slipping slightly.
Further evidence of underlying economic weakness from depressed industrial
production, consumer demand, and sluggish monetary growth, is behind the
long rally in the government bond market. Yields on the No. 129 have fallen
over 30 basis points since quarterly GNP figures were announced in mid-June.
The plunge in the stock market, with the Nikkei stock average falling below
16,000 in late-June, also encouraged market participants. Three months ago,
as the Nikkei first dived, the bond markets took fright at the state of the
Japanese financial system. Since then, bond investors have recovered their
equanimity. The slump in stocks has forced life assurers and investment
trusts to increase investments in the bond market. Life and non-life
insurers, net sellers during the first half of 1991, turned net buyers of
Y2,118bn in public and private bonds.
Investment trusts bought a net Y1,909bn, as a bulk of new funds were bond
funds, reflecting the decline in investor confidence among individuals.
Foreign investors purchased a net Y4,983bn, mostly in Treasury bills.
Bond market participants have also been focusing on the yield gap to have
emerged among bank debentures, issued by the three long-term credit banks -
Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank.
Yields on the debentures have traditionally been the same, and were
considered by institutional investors as interchangeable. However concerns
over the deteriorating loan portfolio at NCB, the smallest of the three
banks, have lifted NCB's five-year debenture yield to around 5.3 per cent,
20 basis points higher than IBJ's.
The three long-term credit banks have been responsible for most of the
long-term industrial financing since 1945, and have been allowed to issue
debentures to procure long-term funds.
The yield differentials point to the growing maturity of the bank debenture
market, as investors become more aware of credit risk, said Mr Marshall
Gittler, fixed income analyst at Merill Lynch in Tokyo.
While investors are looking for the Japanese discount rate to fall further,
last week's rise in the German discount rate has raised uncertainty over the
timing of monetary easing due to the effects on currency movements.
Economists believe the Bank of Japan will be reluctant to move until the
government decides on its fiscal stimulus package.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Bonds: American Express poised for Dollars 1bn
asset-backed deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express is next week expected to launch a Dollars 1bn global
asset-backed bond issue, its first bond offering backed by charge card debt.
The deal will be lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, a subsidiary of the credit
card group. Bankers were yesterday anticipating a deal comprising two
Dollars 500m tranches of five-year and seven-year paper.
The deal is likely to be structured as a global bond issue, with registered
bonds traded simultaneously in the US, Eurobond and east Asian financial
markets.
Citicorp has already used global asset-backed bonds to securitise credit
card debt. However, the assets backing the American Express deal will have
slightly different characteristics. Charge card holders are not allowed to
maintain unpaid balances. American claims a lower default rate than on
credit cards.
Elsewhere, Nationwide Building Society yesterday raised Pounds 100m capital
from an issue of 15-year subordinated bonds, callable after 10-years.
Nationwide will pay a punitive rate of interest if the call option is not
exercised, so the the deal was viewed as a 10-year issue, yielding 135 basis
points more than gilts of the same maturity. If the bonds are not called,
the coupon will be raised to a level where the yield is 250 basis points
over gilts.
The structure is designed to ensure that Nationwide can count the full
Pounds 100m as capital for 10 years. The Building Societies Commission, the
industry regulator, demands that subordinated bonds gradually cease to count
as capital in the five years prior to maturity.
The deal, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, was seen as
aggressively-priced by some sterling bond underwriters. Outstanding
Nationwide eight-year subordinated paper trades at a yield spread 150 basis
points over gilts. Subordinated debt issued by building societies of similar
credit quality trades at a lower yield spread than yesterday's issue.
Two Japanese companies launched equity warrant bond issues, in a rare flurry
of activity in the sector. Penta-Ocean Construction launched a Dollars 200m
issue lead-managed by Yamaichi International, while Kuraray raised Dollars
150m and SFr100m via Daiwa Europe and Credit Suisse.
The two Eurodollar issues saw strong demand trading up to 103 7/8 bid and
102 7/8 bid respectively, both from an issue price of par. The deals
benefited from the paucity of new issues this year.
The bonds carry a coupon of only 2.25 per cent, but in most cases the
warrants to buy shares are stripped from the bonds and sold separately. Once
stripped, the bonds trade at around 86 per cent of face value, for a yield
of around 6.25 per cent.
Although yesterday's performed well, bankers do not expect a flood of new
deals.

SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services group, increased
second-quarter net income by 15.5 per cent to Dollars 345.8m from Dollars
299.4m a year ago.
The company's insurance, brokerage and real estate divisions all gained
solidly during the quarter, but its struggling merchandise group suffered a
50 per cent drop in income to Dollars 78.5m from Dollars 156.9m. Merchandise
group revenues fell 1.1 per cent to Dollars 7.57bn from Dollars 7.65bn.
Per share earnings for the period ending June 30 were 90 cents, against 87
cents last year, reflecting the dilutive effect of a stock offering.
Revenues rose 1.3 per cent to Dollars 14.27bn from Dollars 14.09bn.
Mr Edward Brennan, Sears chairman, said the slower pace of the US economic
recovery and intense retail competition resulted in lower gross margins.
The merchandise group also lost revenues following a scandal involving its
automotive repair shops and accusations of unneeded repairs. The matter is
being investigated in several states and Sears has had to expend
considerable funds on advertising to explain its side of the story.
The merchandise group's results were also affected by decreases in and
changes to the company's catalogue business, including a Dollars 20.2m
pre-tax expenses to close catalogue pick-up counters in its stores.
Second-quarter income at Allstate Insurance rose 68.3 per cent to Dollars
235.3m from Dollars 139.8 last year. Revenues were up 4.4 per cent to
Dollars 5.02bn from Dollars 4.81bn.
The Dean Witter Financial Services Group reported income of Dollars 97.9m,
up 8.1 per cent from Dollars 90.6m. Revenues were up 4.9 per cent to Dollars
1.28bn from Dollars 1.22bn. Coldwell Banker, which handles residential real
estate, reported income of Dollars 10.3m, turning round a year-ago loss of
Dollars 3.1m. Revenues were up 4 per cent to Dollars 455m from Dollars
437.7m.
For the first six months, consolidated net income rose 24.4 per cent to
Dollars 667.6m from Dollars 536.6m last year, partly reflecting the
company's success in cost cutting. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.79
against Dollars 1.56.

PFIZER, one of the biggest US drugs companies, yesterday posted a 14 per
cent improvement in second-quarter net earnings on sales which rose only 4
per cent.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 203.8m, or 61 cents on sales of
Dollars 1.69bn, against earnings of Dollars 179.1m, or 53 cents, on sales of
Dollars 1.63bn a year earlier.
Pfizer, which has divested or closed several businesses in the past two
years, said sales from on-going operations rose 13 per cent in the latest
quarter while net income from those operations increased 10 per cent.
The sale of Pfizer's Coty fragrance and cosmetics business contributed a
Dollars 3m after-tax gain in net income and Dollars 56.5m in restructuring
credits to operating income.
Sales of new pharmaceutical products contributed to a 17 per cent
improvement in pharmaceutical sales growth in the quarter. The company said
the improvement was almost entirely due to higher volume, since no
pharmaceutical prices were increased in the quarter.
Second-quarter earnings from Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare products
and pharmaceuticals group, were also strong. Net income rose 14 per cent to
Dollars 464m, or 70 cents a share from Dollars 406m, or 61 cents a year ago.
Sales increased about 13 per cent to Dollars 3.41bn from Dollars 3.03bn.
For the first six months, net income rose about 13 per cent to Dollars 928m,
or Dollars 1.40, from Dollars 824m, or Dollars 1.24 last year. Sales were 10
per cent higher at Dollars 3.34bn from Dollars 3.08bn.
Sales growth was led by Johnson &amp; Johnson's profession segment, which
includes products used in less invasive surgery, where domestic sales rose
17 per cent and overseas sales advanced 15 per cent.
Warner Lambert, another large US pharmaceuticals company, posted net
earnings of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, up 15 per cent, on the
back of an 11 per cent improvement in sales to Dollars 1.37bn. A year
earlier, the company had net income of Dollars 155m, or Dollars 1.15, on
sales of Dollars 1.24bn.
For the first half of 1992, net income was Dollars 341.5m, or Dollars 2.54,
compared with Dollars 188.1m, or Dollars 1.40, a year earlier. The previous
year's results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars 106m, or 79
cents a share, related to an accounting change. Sales in the six months were
Dollars 2.68bn against Dollars 2.46bn.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: SecPac charges hit Bank of
America
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF America has blamed special charges related to its recent takeover of
Security Pacific for an 11.8 per cent decline in second-quarter net
earnings. The bank is now the second largest in the US, with Dollars 188.6bn
of assets.
The results - the first since the merger was completed on April 22 - were
hit by a net Dollars 181m of non-recurring items, including Dollars 395m of
merger-related restructuring write-offs and a Dollars 157m gain on an asset
sale.
Because of the charges, Bank of America's net profit in the quarter was
Dollars 240m, compared with Dollars 272m a year ago. Earnings per share were
63 cents, against Dollars 1.16. The bank said earnings per share would have
been Dollars 1.19 but for the one-time charges, while its net income would
have been Dollars 421m.
The bank stressed that the results were not comparable with results in the
same period of last year. However Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, said he
was pleased with the progress in integrating Bank of America and the former
Security Pacific.
Bad debt provisions in the second quarter amounted to Dollars 240m against
Dollars 175m a year ago. For the first six months of 1992, these provisions
totalled Dollars 470m, compared with Dollars 320m in the first half of 1991.
Non-performing assets were Dollars 4.56bn at the end of last month,
reflecting the problems among combined assets of both banks; the same
measure for Bank of America alone was Dollars 3.08bn a year ago.
Net loan losses amounted to Dollars 194m, up from Dollars 169m a year ago.
The second-quarter 1992 losses consisted of Dollars 402m of write-offs and
Dollars 208m of recoveries. The write-offs were related mainly to credit
card and other consumer loans, and the recoveries mainly to the sale of
sovereign debt and recoveries on previous write-offs.
Net income for the first six months of 1992 was Dollars 543m, down from
Dollars 554m last year.
Net interest income after bad debt provisions was Dollars 1.44bn, compared
with Dollars 916m a year ago for Bank of America alone.

UNION CARBIDE, the US chemicals company, recorded a 46 per cent rise in
second-quarter net income, to Dollars 73m.
The company was at pains, however, to separate its Dollars 37m
second-quarter net earnings from continuing operations, against Dollars 18m
a year ago.
On June 30, Union Carbide completed the spin-off of Praxair, its former
industrial gases subsidiary. This business produced Dollars 34m of net
income in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 28m a year ago.
Overall earnings per share in the second quarter were 51 cents, up from 35
cents a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations were 28 cents, against
13 cents.
Total net sales for the Connecticut-based chemicals company were little
changed at Dollars 1.26bn, against Dollars 1.21bn.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the results reflected continuing efforts
to drive down fixed costs. He said polyethylene and ethylene glycol volumes
were better than last year, but added that margins continued to be tight in
these markets.

UNITED Technologies, the US technology group which is being restructured,
reported second-quarter net income nearly quadrupled from an unusually
depressed 1991.
The company announced net income of Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.18 a share,
compared with Dollars 44m, or 28 cents, in the same period of last year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 5.4bn. The figures were broadly
in line with market expectations.
In last year's second quarter, earnings were abnormally depressed by a
Dollars 148m pre-tax charge to restructure a contract at Norden, the group's
radar system manufacturer.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said the company was seeing strength in three
of its business segments - building systems, which includes Carrier, the air
conditioning company, and Otis, the elevator group; flight systems, which
includes Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer; and automotive components.
It was also encouraged by the early results from its restructuring
programme, announced last January. So far it has cut the workforce by 4,650
jobs, or 65 per cent of the 1992 goal.
'We are meeting our schedule for restructuring and increased earnings,' Mr
Daniell said. 'We expect additional modest benefits from a slowly improving
economy and continuing gains from the restructuring programme.'
The company's power segment, the Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine manufacturer,
reported an operating profit of Dollars 116m, down from Dollars 123m a year
ago. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 1.8bn.
The company said there was a higher contribution from spare parts for
commercial engines, and pointed out that the 1991 figure was boosted by some
Dollars 100m in participation fees for the PW4000 engine.
However, Mr Daniell described the overall condition of the commercial
airline industry as 'troubling and indicative of continuing financial
pressures on the major airlines'.
The flight systems business made Dollars 65m on sales of Dollars 968m,
compared with a loss of Dollars 72m on sales of Dollars 986m; building
systems made Dollars 164m on revenues of Dollars 2.4bn, up from Dollars 124m
on sales of Dollars 2.1bn, and automotive made Dollars 38m on revenues of
Dollars 633m, compared with Dollars 28m on sales of Dollars 541m.
For the six months United Technologies made Dollars 275m, or Dollars 1.95 a
share, against Dollars 84m, or 53 cents, last year while revenues rose to
Dollars 10.9bn from Dollars 10.2bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to float East Japan Railway (JR East), part of the former state-run
Japan National Railways (JNR), have triggered concern in the Tokyo stock
market.
The Japanese transport ministry and JNR Settlement Corporation, which took
over the debts of JNR, plan to offer a tranche of the 400m government-held
shares during the year to March 1993. However, the decision comes as steep
falls in Japanese stock prices have dented investor confidence.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, Tokyo stock exchange chairman, expressed his worries
yesterday, following an announcement by an advisory committee to JNR
Settlement, recommending at least one of its six railway companies be listed
this year.
'Japan's stock market sentiment is not sufficient enough to absorb the
heavyweight Japan railway stocks,' he said.
Adverse market conditions have held up the flotation plans, originally
slated for the last fiscal year. In 1987, the railway operations of JNR were
split into six regional passenger railway companies, while most of the
assets and debts were passed on to JNR Settlements.
Investor confidence has been hit by the sharp declines in the shares of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the former government-owned
telecommunications company, listed in 1986.
The number of shares and offer price are yet to be decided. The advisory
council proposed the proportion of JNR shares auctioned in order to fix the
public sale price should be higher than that of the first public sale of NTT
shares.
Japanese brokers believe JR East's shares, with a face value of Y50,000
(Dollars 207) are worth about Y200,000.
However, Mr Keiwa Okuda, transport minister, expressed dissatisfaction of
such estimates, and added the shares should be sold for the highest price
possible. The advisory council has recommended that the shares be made
available to foreign investors.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nortel suffers reverse for first
time in three years

NORTHERN Telecom suffered a one-third drop in second-quarter earnings, the
first profit setback for the fast-growing Canadian telecommunications
equipment maker in almost three years.
Although a decline in earnings was expected, the size of the drop took
investors by surprise. Nortel's share price plunged by CDollars 5.38 to
CDollars 40 in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, but
recovered part of the loss later.
Second-quarter earnings were USDollars 72.3m, or 28 cents a share, down from
USDollars 106.5m, or 42 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped to Dollars
1.95bn from Dollars 2.1bn.
The company ascribed the setback to the disposal of several businesses which
it bought as part of the acquisition of Britain's STC in early 1991.
This was as well as deferred orders for central office switches by US
regional telephone companies, which are among its biggest customers.
The drop in revenues was also due to the accounting treatment of sales by
Motorola-Nortel, a joint cellular-phone venture which started operations in
the US earlier this year.
Dr Paul Stern, chairman, said he was disappointed by the results, but noted
that orders climbed by 6 per cent in the latest quarter, reaching a record
backlog of over Dollars 3bn on June 30.
He said the company had recently won substantial contracts in the US,
Canada, Australia, Korea and Spain.
One Toronto analyst said investors were especially unsettled by a 'serious
deterioration' in gross margins from almost 41 per cent to 39 per cent, and
an increase in research and development spending from 12.2 per cent of
revenues to 13 per cent.
However, he added that Nortel appeared to be maintaining market share and
remained 'an extremely strong competitor'.
It had focused for the past two years on reducing its dependence on North
America through expansion overseas. Besides the STC acquisition, it unveiled
an alliance last month with Matra, the French telecommunications and
electronics group.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Smith Corona to close its last
US typewriter manufacturing plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SMITH Corona, the manufacturer of portable typewriters which has spent years
fighting alleged Japanese cut-price 'dumping' of products in the US,
announced yesterday it was closing its last US manufacturing plant and
relocating production to Mexico to save costs.
The news came as Smith Corona, 48 per cent owned by Britain's Hanson,
announced a rise in fourth-quarter net income from Dollars 2.3m, or 8 cents
a share, to Dollars 6m, or 20 cents a share. Net sales were up from Dollars
77.2m to Dollars 86.2m.
Smith Corona said it would phase out manufacturing operations at Cortland,
in New York state, over 12 months, with a loss of 775 full-time and 100
part-time jobs. Some 370 engineering, design and administrative workers will
remain in Cortland.
The move will cost Dollars 15m pre-tax, of which Dollars 9m will be recorded
in a special charge in the first quarter. However, the company expects to
save Dollars 15m on an annual basis in manufacturing costs.
Smith Corona's battle against alleged dumping has brought the company
several legal victories, but little practical benefit in the market place.
However, the struggle may have encouraged Japanese typewriter and word
processor companies to establish assembly operations in the US.
Brother Industries, the main target for Smith Corona's action, has even
accused the US company of dumping itself, since Smith Corona now has a large
manufacturing operation in Singapore. Brother is likely to redouble these
accusations over the Mexican move.
Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, said the move was being made very
reluctantly but was 'absolutely necessary in view of the predatory pricing
by foreign competition in our industry.'
'The last US factory of the last American consumer typewriter company is
closing, forced to move as a direct result of these competitors openly
thumbing their noses at our trade laws.'
Criticising the US Government's 'unwillingness' to enforce the trade laws,
he said the company would continue to use its US suppliers, so the US
content of its machines would continue to be higher than those of its
competitors.
Mr Thompson said that in the fourth quarter the company increased unit sales
and revenues of both typewriters and personal word processors. International
sales benefited from sizeable shipments to a large European distributor.
However, there were signs of recovery in the domestic market.
For the full year, the company reported net income was Dollars 22.1m, or 73
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 371.7m, against Dollars 19.6m, or 65
cents, on sales of Dollars 383.4m.

FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: GTE registers 13% gain after
Contel takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported a 13
per cent increase in second-quarter earnings, helped by volume growth in its
telephone business and efficiency gains from last year's Dollars 6bn
takeover of telecommunications group Contel.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 446m, or 49 cents a share, from
continuing businesses, compared with Dollars 394m, or 44 cents, last year.
Revenues and sales rose from Dollars 4.85bn to Dollars 5.06bn.
The figures, in line with market expectations, do not include the group's
electrical products business, which it has put up for sale.
The company's local telephone operations reported operating income 9 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.02bn, although the increase totalled 5 per cent
when a Dollars 30m 1991 provision was stripped out.
Revenues totalled Dollars 3.98bn, up from Dollars 3.85bn, thanks to a 7 per
cent increase in usage of the company's local network for long distance
calling and a 3.7 per cent annual increase in access lines. These increases
were partly offset by lower tariffs charged by long-distance carriers for
access to its local network.
Its telecommunications services and products business produced operating
income of Dollars 65m, up from Dollars 42m, on revenues 8 per cent higher at
Dollars 1.09bn.
Its cellular telephone business produced revenues of Dollars 252m, up 30 per
cent. Some 56,000 cellular customers were added during the period, bringing
the total to 920,000, up from 682,000 a year ago. Average revenues per
subscriber rose slightly from the previous quarter to Dollars 78 a month.
For the six months income from continuing operations were Dollars 873m, or
96 cents, against Dollars 591m, or 65 cents, a year ago, when it took a 23
cents a share charge against earnings. Revenues totalled Dollars 9.89bn, up
from Dollars 9.54bn.

44%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday reported a 44 per cent
increase in second-quarter earnings, helped by high timber prices and
improved productivity.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 92.9m, or 45 cents a share, up
from Dollars 64.5m, or 32 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales were
up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn.
Mr John Creighton, president, said the figures reflected 'a slowly improving
economy and solid accomplishments within our business improvement plans'.
The company's forest products division was helped by the controversy over
saving the Northern Spotted Owl, which has curtailed the supply of timber
from public lands in the western US and sent the price of supplies
rocketing. Operating earnings here were up 13 per cent at Dollars 126.5m.
The company's pulp and paper business saw profits rise 84 per cent to
Dollars 68.3m, helped by better pricing of some products, reduced
maintenance spending as well as improved productivity in pulp and corrugated
box manufacturing.
In the first half the company made Dollars 179.5m, or 88 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 51.4m, or 26 cents, a share after a 1991 accounting
change which cut 30 cents a share from the total. Sales were up 4 per cent
at Dollars 4.5bn.
For the second half, Mr Creighton said lower long-term interest rates should
produce some improvement in single family home construction, while no
resolution of Northwestern timber shortages should also help keep wood
product values strong.
Weyerhaeuser, the largest exporter of US forest products, would also benefit
from the weak dollar.

UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group, will

insurer also announced that the bank's managing director, Mr Didier
Renaudin, is to step down.
The insurance group said that Worms would get an injection of between
FFr500m (Dollars 100m) and FFr700m, but declined to comment on the figures.
Banque Worms posted a net loss of FFr179m in 1991, including a FFr310m
provision against property risks. This year property provisions are expected
to be smaller.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROCHE, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals group, has reported a 19 per cent increase
in sales to SFr6.6bn (Dollars 5.03bn) for the first half of 1992 and
forecast 'a considerable improvement' in profits for the full year.
Extracting distortions from currency conversion, the sales growth was 14 per
cent.
Roche said the acquisition of the Nicholas over-the-counter medicines
business last year added about SFr140m to first-half sales, while last
year's disposals removed roughly SFr60m.
The 23 per cent growth in sales by the pharmaceuticals division to SFr3.5bn
was due to strong gains of existing drugs - including Rodcephin, an
antibiotic, Roaccutane, an acne drug, and Dormicum, a hypnotic - and to
acceptance of new products - such as Neupogen, a drug for reducing the
side-effects of chemotherapy, Aurorix, an anti-depressant, and Inhibace,
which lowers blood pressure.
Sales of non-prescription medicines also increased, and the group predicted
the new Roche Nicholas over-the-counter business would achieve sales of
SFr1bn in the full year.
Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals jumped 19 per cent to SFr1.6bn, and the
US service laboratories contributed significantly to the 17 per cent rise in
the diagnostics division sales to SFr800m.
Sales of fragrances and flavours were up 10 per cent to SFr723m, even though
the fragrances market was stagnant.

<TEXT>
WESTLB, the acquisitive state bank of North Rhine Westphalia, seems set to
take a substantial stake in Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, the state bank of
its closest southern neighbour.
Formal talks are about to begin following a decision yesterday by the
Rhineland Palatinate government to sell a 50 per cent holding in its state
bank.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, prime minister of the Rhineland Palatinate, said
preliminary talks with Dusseldorf-based WestLB, and its collaborator,
SudwestLB from Baden-Wurttemberg, suggested 'the goal would be reached'.
WestLB, meanwhile, is co-operating with NordLB from Hanover in negotiations
for a stake in the Kiel-based state bank of Schleswig Holstein.
If successful, the deals would mark substantial progress in the long-awaited
restructuring of Germany's regional banking network.
WestLB, led by Mr Friedel Neuber, is the biggest German state bank, with
operating profits expected to reach DM1bn (Dollars 675.6m) this year. It is
also the most adventurous.
Overseas ventures include a link in 1989 with Standard Chartered of London
designed to build up WestLB's merchant banking side and extend its foreign
coverage. Most recently, WestLB took a share in Thomas Cook, the UK travel
and travellers' cheques company.
LTU, Germany's biggest charter operator, in which WestLB has a 34 per cent
stake, bought 90 per cent of the former Midland Bank subsidiary, while the
bank took 10 per cent on its own account.
Domestic expansion has been less dramatic, however. Even though it has long
been agreed that rationalisation of state banking is necessary to compete
with the commercial sector, few of the lander banks have been prepared to
surrender their independence.
The traditional role of the banks is to finance state and local authorities
and act as umbrella organisations for regional savings groups.

<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is taking its
UK-based global instrumentation business off the market after a four-month
search for buyers failed to produce a deal.
ABB yesterday said that after having reviewed several offers it would keep
the business, which has annual sales of nearly Dollars 450m, employs 4,500
people and produces water meters, instruments and control valves.
The move is a temporary setback for ABB's strategy of concentrating on its
core activities in electrical engineering.
Zurich-based ABB had put the business up for sale in March, with Morgan
Stanley International retained as financial adviser. ABB said then that a
business that was more than 50 per cent related to water meters was not
closely related to its core.
ABB yesterday put a brave face on the decision to keep the business. 'It
does not speed up our streamlining process, but it's not so very odd a
business for ABB to keep, and it has no negative impact on ABB as a whole,'
said the company. It added that other ABB businesses might come up for sale
instead.
The possible sale of the business produced several offers from a number of
countries. However, in current market conditions it was not easy to sell
businesses of such a size, ABB said.
It indicated that price was one reason why a deal could not be reached, but
not the only reason. 'The company has a good market potential, and a good
standing in the water meter business, especially in the UK. It was not
necessary to dump it, and we don't sell at the wrong price.'
RWE, the diversified German energy group, has not yet made a final decision
on a possible capital increase, Reuter reports. RWE, subject of intense
rights issue speculation, said the final decision would be made in October.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB), a leading Australian bank, yesterday bid for
Bank of New Zealand. Its offer of NZ80 cents a share values BNZ at NZDollars
1.48bn (USDollars 813m).
BNZ's main shareholders - the New Zealand government (with 57 per cent) and
Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank (with 27 per cent) - have
accepted the offer.
Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's finance minister, welcomed the deal,
saying the government did not consider itself a long-term shareholder in
BNZ, New Zealand's biggest bank.
BNZ has been weighed down by bad debt problems. Under a programme to
recapitalise the bank in 1990, the government set up Adbro, a separate
company to hold bad debts totalling NZDollars 1.4bn.
The government will receive NZDollars 850m for BNZ. It will also receive
'full value' for its investment in Adbro, which NAB will wind up so that the
government receives its initial investment of NZDollars 420m plus a return
of 15 per cent over the next three years.
Ms Richardson said that, if the government and Fay, Richwhite had not agreed
to accept risks associated with Adbro, NAB would have heavily discounted its
offer. The agreement covering risks over litigation, tax and assets of Adbro
would run for seven years.
NAB sought these assurances in line with 'normal commercial practices', but
was not requiring ordinary BNZ shareholders to accept the risk.
BNZ shares traded at 80 cents on the New Zealand Stock Exchange yesterday
morning, but closed after the announcement at 76 cents.
Fay, Richwhite is also being offered 95 cents for its holding of specified
preference shares.
Mr Don Argus, an NAB general manager, said BNZ would keep a strong local
identity and its name. The bank, which reported net profits of NZDollars
171.1m for the year to March, had made very good progress in restructuring
over the past two years.
Asked about possible management changes, Mr Argus said BNZ would not be
'inundated with Australians'. NAB's management style was not to lay off
thousands of workers. 'We'll be the invisible owner.' NAB would probably
merge its 35 New Zealand branches - which last year lost ADollars 9m
(USDollars 6.7m) - into BNZ.
Mr Lindsay Pyne, the BNZ chief executive credited with turning around the
bank, said the sale would be 'very good' for the bank. He cited the
difficulties in a bank being government owned.
The BNZ purchase will give NAB total assets of ADollars 109.77bn and
increase shareholders' equity to ADollars 8.74bn from ADollars 8bn.

IMPROVED performances from Randfontein and Western Areas helped the gold
division of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) lift after-tax
profits by 19 per cent to R70.9m (Dollars 25.9m) in the June quarter.
Profits at Randfontein rose to R55.7m from R50.3m. At Western Areas profits
increased steeply to R9.4m from R1.9m.
Mr Bill Nairn, managing director of the gold division, said Randfontein's
grade, which improved to 3.67 grams a tonne (from 3.6 grams), was at its
highest level since 1987. But a 5.8 per cent decline in ore mined from
underground saw total production fall to 7,817kg from 8,014kg.
At the net level, the gold division's results were boosted by a R13m drop in
the tax bill, associated with an increase in capital expenditure.
Western Areas had an excellent quarter for production, lifting its grade by
15.4 per cent to 5.99 grams a tonne, thanks to concentration on quality ore
and improved productivity. This helped convert a R5.4m working loss on gold
production last quarter into a R700,000 profit.

THE merger of Finmeccanica, which controls the engineering and aerospace
activities of Italy's state-owned IRI group, with Sifa, a stock
market-listed holding company owned by IRI, was approved yesterday.
The merged group, to be called Finmeccalica, has combined assets of L3,128bn
(Dollars 2.77bn). The enlarged group hopes to obtain a bourse listing in
November this year.
The aim is to achieve through a subsequent share issue a nominal
capitalisation of L1,638bn, of which 47 per cent of ordinary shares and 71
per cent of saving shares will be in third-party hands.
The move was set in train well before the government decided 10 days ago to
convert IRI, along with three other state entities, into joint stock
companies in order to accelerate the privatisation process.
The merger envisages a L511bn capital increase via the issue of 1,022bn
shares on the basis of four ordinary Sifa shares for every nine Finmeccanica
shares.
Finmeccanica has net liabilities of L4,862bn. Last year, the group made a
L525bn loss, in part due to the repayment of L615bn to IRI which the
European Commission declared was an illegal subsidy.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST MODWEN Properties, the Birmingham-based investment and development
company, yesterday defied the general sector trend by announcing a marginal
increase in interim profits.
For the six months to May 31 profits rose from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 1.04m
at the pre-tax level. Turnover was Pounds 11.4m, against Pounds 33.4m last
time when sales were inflated by one unusually large property sale. Earnings
per share were unchanged at 0.6p.
The company is now receiving rental income in excess of interest payments
and, according to Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, by the end of this financial
year rental income will cover both interest charges and management costs.
Gross rental income during the first half was Pounds 3.3m, but interest
charges were Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.2m). The company does not capitalise its
interest charges. Gearing was fractionally reduced to 85 per cent but is
expected to show a modest rise by the year-end.
Mr Clarke, through a personal company, is injecting Pounds 1.56m into
Uttoxeter Leisure &amp; Development, 81 per cent controlled by St Modwen and
owner of the Uttoxeter racecourse. The injection, in exchange for shares,
will have the effect of eliminating the racecourse company's debts to St
Modwen and provide funds for course improvement.

the red

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AER LINGUS, the Irish national carrier, reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds
3.1m (Pounds 2.9m) for the year to March 31, its first deficit for 10 years.
Profits last time were IPounds 6.6m.
The after-tax deficit amounted to IPounds 11.8m (IPounds 8.3m profits).
The airline has been badly hit by the slump in international air transport
and difficult trading conditions in ancillary services.
Losses on its core air transport business fell by 11 per cent to IPounds
37.9m (IPounds 42.5m). Traditionally these have been offset by profits in
ancillary services but the impact of recession in the UK and the US forced
the group into loss. Turnover rose by 8 per cent to IPounds 849m (IPounds
784m).
Mr Cathal Mullan, chief executive, said the losses in the air transport
division were 'particularly disappointing'.
Revenue traffic on IATA airlines fell by 4 per cent during 1991. European
airlines saw passenger numbers fall by 6.5 per cent on internal European
routes.
The aircraft maintenance and ground handling division saw profits fall 29
per cent to IPounds 14.6m (IPounds 20.7m), reflecting the impact of the
recession in the industry worldwide.
Profits at its hotel division, which includes the Copthorne chain in the UK,
felt the impact of the recession and declined 3 per cent to IPounds 12m
(IPounds 12.4m). The sale of the Berkshire Place Hotel in New York helped
offset the poor trading results.
The biggest decline, however, was in the commercial holdings division, which
includes the 9 per cent stake in GPA Group, where profits fell 49 per cent
to IPounds 8.2m (IPounds 16m).
The group has adjusted the value of its GPA stake 'in line with indicated
market value,' Mr Mullan said. The collapse of GPA's planned stock market
flotation last month was a blow to Aer Lingus, which had hoped to sell 4m of
its 19m shares in the aircraft leasing company to reduce debt.
Total passenger numbers carried by the group in the year rose by only 1 per
cent to 4.3m. Its passenger load factor fell from 71 per cent to 68 per cent
and its overall load factor from 68 per cent to 66 per cent.
No dividend is declared for the year. Last year the group reluctantly paid
out IPounds 500,000 after a dispute with the Irish government, its sole
shareholder, which insisted on a dividend despite a fall in profits. Gearing
climbed from 109 per cent to 133 per cent.
Mr Mullan said the international recession showed little sign of abating,
and in addition price wars and excess capacity had combined to drive down
revenues on some of its principal routes. Targeted improvements in air
transport results would be 'very difficult to achieve,' he added.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ASH sharply lower at Pounds 6.55m as
reconstruction gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), the electronic security company which is on
the verge of selling its loss prevention side for Pounds 150m, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits more than halved from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 6.55m
in the six months to May 31.
Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, stressed that the imminent sale to Sensormatic of
the US - to be closed between Monday and Wednesday next week - was only part
of the significant refocusing the company has undertaken.
There was the sale of the 26.4 per cent stake in Scantronic, the security
alarms maker, in April and the rationalisation and reorganisation of the
core Security Systems in the UK, which was started in February. The latter
was represented in exceptional charges of Pounds 4m, which accounted for a
substantial portion of the decline in profits, along with a Pounds 1.1m rise
in interest payable to Pounds 8.93m.
The loss prevention sale kills several birds with one stone.
ASH had considered a flotation 'a la Vodafone' to stymie potential bidders -
its rival ADT had taken a 3 per cent stake in spring 1990 - but this came to
nothing and a sale was sought.
Aside from this 'defensive' function, Mr Buffett said the sale should change
the market's perception of ASH as a highly indebted company liable to go the
way of 'Maxwell, Polly Peck or Brent Walker'. All sterling bank borrowings
would be eliminated, though dollar borrowings would remain against dollar
assets, he added.
The sale would realise an extraordinary profit in the second half of about
Pounds 80m, give an increase of 70p in assets per share and remove
'misunderstood' finance leases from the balance sheet, another City bugbear.
Mr Buffett said that also within two years, Sensormatic and ASH would be
'eating each other in Europe'; both companies would have expanded
considerably and a later sale would have foundered on competition rocks.
Group turnover in the half slipped to Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 97.3m), though
the latter figure included Pounds 2.2m from discontinued businesses. Trading
profits fell to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 21.1m) and earnings tumbled to 1.9p
(7.8p) per share or 4.9p before the exceptional.
Had the sale to Sensormatic gone through within the six months, ASH's
half-year figures would have looked better. It has produced pro forma
figures to reflect its post-sale position.
These showed a sharp decline in turnover to Pounds 65.3m and, after a Pounds
7.5m adjustment reducing interest payable to Pounds 1.4m, pre-tax profits
would have emerged at Pounds 8.7m. Pro forma earnings would have worked
through at 3.5p, or 6.5p before the exceptional costs.
Because of the Sensormatic sale and the pro forma profits, the interim
dividend is lifted to 2.25p (2.07p).

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: US side holds Prudential back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCHANGE RATE factors restricted Prudential, the UK life assurance company,
to a slight fall in new business during the first six months of this year,
according to figures released yesterday.
In sterling terms, worldwide annual premium business fell slightly to Pounds
310m (Pounds 315m) while single premiums were static at Pounds 1.84bn. Both
figures would have shown an increase in constant exchange rate terms.
Interest centred on the figures for Jackson National, the US life insurance
company which Prudential bought in 1986, where new business figures fell
sharply. In sterling terms, annual premiums fell from Pounds 48m to Pounds
30m, and single premiums from Pounds 851m to Pounds 519m.
Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive, said: 'Low US interest rates have
made the market for fixed interest annuity products much more difficult.
However, the decline also reflects a planned slow-down by Jackson in the
sales of term assurance business.'
Analysts had been worried that Jackson, a market-driven company, had been
expanding too fast, and welcomed these figures, although US business dropped
more than had been expected.
Jackson concentrates on term assurance because it offers an easy way for its
sales representatives to make new contacts. However, the Prudential said
that it was unhappy with the low profit margins generated by the business,
and with the high initial commissions paid to salesmen. It was therefore
glad to see the amount of term business decrease.
Annuities also suffered. Annuity rates tend to be closely linked to base
rates, which are low in the US. This has prompted investors to buy mutual
funds - the US equivalent of unit trusts. The Prudential said 'the rates on
offer from the annuity bond were quite attractive. It's just a fashion in
the US for mutual funds.'
Mr Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Smith New Court, said 'it's quite right and
proper that you should get a slow down at Jackson National at some time, and
make some profit from it. It's shareholder owned and shareholders expect to
get something back.'
Jackson's figures concealed strong growth in the UK, where annual premium
business increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 172m - following a slight fall
over 1991 as a whole - while single premiums increased 56 per cent to Pounds
1.06bn.
The figures were in part aided by the recession as consumers made
conservative investment decisions.
The Prudence Bond, a heavily marketed single premium with profits product,
took in Pounds 350m and helped single premiums for life and general annuity
products to increase almost fivefold from Pounds 63m to Pounds 361m.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowie letter attacks Henlys' management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 25.9m takeover battle between T Cowie and Henlys, both motor
traders, intensified yesterday as Cowie wrote to its target's shareholders
attacking Henlys' management.
The letter quoted Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker acting for Henlys, saying
Cowie shares were cheap. It also quoted Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of
Henlys, saying he had a 'very high regard' for Sir Tom Cowie, chairman of
Cowie.
The letter went on to say that Henlys' management team was not new, as
Henlys has said; that it achieves a lower return from its motor dealerships
than Cowie does and questioned the ability of Henlys' management to turn
round the loss-making bus and coach building business.
Cowie said Henlys had 'a failed strategy implemented by a weak management'.
Cowie's share price fell 2p to 137p, making its all-paper offer worth 68 1/2
p per share. Henlys shares were unchanged at 70p.
Mr Wood said that Mr David Matthews, Henlys' former chairman and chief
executive, had left the company last November and he had become chief
executive then.
Two other executive directors had left last year and, including himself,
four board appointments made.
He said that Henlys' and Cowie's motor dealerships were not comparable as
Cowie had a substantial leasing business. It was not known how profits were
divided between the two activities.
Mr Wood also said that while he respected Sir Tom as a motor dealer, the
letter showed that Cowie did not understand manufacturing.
He said he was saddened that the battle had focused on personalities but
added that 'it suggests their case is not so strong'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Endowment Policy Trust, an investment trust investing in unmatured
endowment policies, was fully subscribed and raised more than Pounds 30m at
launch, it was announced yesterday.
The maximum size for the trust had been set at Pounds 30m due to worries
about the total supply of suitable policies in the UK.
Institutions had taken Pounds 22.5m in a placing, leaving the balance for
private investors and intermediaries. Applications were received for
ordinary shares worth Pounds 7.88m.
Applicants for up to 250,000 ordinary shares have been accepted in full,
while applicants for more than that number shares will receive 70.77 per
cent of the total for which they applied.
The launch goes against the recent trend for unsuccessful new issues,
although this was partly because the trust's investment policy was regarded
as being unusually conservative.
Mr Ben Siddons, chairman of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trust Management,
said he was 'delighted' by the level of response, and added: 'We are very
pleased to see that the majority of the money has come from stockbrokers,
intermediaries and the public.'
Share certificates will be posted on Friday, July 24, and dealings in the
shares are expected to start on Monday, July 27.

Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director of Kalon, yesterday said that he had
been 'inundated with inquiries' from companies interested in acquiring the
Mander Centre.
This is the office and retail development in Wolverhampton Kalon would own
if it was to win its hostile Pounds 91.5m battle for rival paint maker
Manders (Holdings).
Kalon has frequently said it would not keep the Mander Centre, though it has
consistently stressed it would be under no pressure to sell it.
'The gearing of the deal means that it's not essential for us to sell it
quickly, or even at all, if conditions don't permit,' Mr Hennessy said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charterhouse Estates and its CEL Liverpool subsidiary, property companies
owned by the water authorities' pension fund, have been put into
administrative receivership with secured debts of over Pounds 10m.
The two companies are involved in inner city regeneration. CEL Liverpool
owns several hundred residential and corner shop proper-ties in Liverpool
while Charterhouse Estates owns development sites in Southwark, Lambeth and
West London.
Mr Chris Barlow, of Cork Gully in London, who with Mr Mark Palios, of Cork
Gully in Liverpool, was appointed a joint administrative receiver, said he
was unable to put a value on the companies' assets.
'Given the complexity of the property situation and the state of the market,
at this stage I cannot be precise about what our strategy for disposing of
the properties will be so it is too early to estimate the likely realisation
from the property portfolios,' he said.
Mr Barlow said the total size of the companies liabilities was unclear.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Fine Foods passes final
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXCEPTIONAL charge of Pounds 550,000, against a credit of Pounds 410,000
last time left pre-tax profits at Northumbrian Fine Foods 41 per cent lower
at Pounds 155,000 in the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 264,000.
After a tax credit of Pounds 119,000 (Pounds 117,000 charge) earnings per
share came out at 0.97p (0.51p). It is proposed to pass the final dividend
leaving the interim of 0.75p for the year compared with last year's
uncovered total of 1.75p.
The shares, traded on the USM, lost 6p to close at 22p, the lowest level for
the year.
Turnover almost doubled to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 8.62m) following the
acquisition of John J Lees, Biscuits for the Connoisseur and Cakes for the
Connoisseur. Operating profit advanced to Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 279,000) and
the net interest charge was little changed at Pounds 423,000 (Pounds
425,000).
Mr Kevin O'Keeffe, chairman, said that prudence had dictated substantial
adjustments to the Lees balance sheet and goodwill from the Connoisseur
acquisitions had been written off. That had left net assets of Pounds 6.76m
against net borrowings of Pounds 5.82m.
He added that trading had been tough in last months of the year and the
difficulties had persisted into the first quarter of the present year.
However, real signs of recovery were being seen and the impact should be
evident by the autumn.
Mr O'Keeffe said the company was still searching for a permanent chief
executive following the departure of Mr Richard Adams as chairman and chief
executive in June.
The exceptional charge included costs relating to Mr Adams's departure as
well provisions for slow moving and obsolete stocks of packaging materials
and a discount given to the purchasers of Danish Natural Foods in return for
early settlement.

FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Holmes Protect loses debt in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security company quoted in the UK, and where Sir
Ian MacGregor is chairman, yesterday announced its long-awaited debt
restructuring, as part of which it is issuing new shares to raise Dollars
37m (Pounds 19.3m).
The deal will eliminate Dollars 72.6m of loan notes and accrued interest,
leaving Holmes almost debt-free with net assets of Dollars 42m. In return US
institutions currently holding the loan notes will receive at least 19 per
cent of the enlarged capital and up to Dollars 28m cash.
Existing institutions mainly participated in the restructuring which prices
new shares at 62 1/2 p, equivalent to 2 1/2 p before a 1-for-25 share
consolidation which will take place after a special general meeting. The
shares fell from 4p to 3 1/2 p.
Mr Eric Kohn, chief executive officer, said having sorted out the balance
sheet, management could concentrate on the group's operations. 'The market
is generally difficult in US (where Holmes has most of its activities) but
for Holmes it is better because we are in niche markets.'
The announcement ends a controversial period in which the previous
management defaulted on loan repayments and interest last year after
spending Dollars 140m on 23 acquisitions in rapid succession.
A new management team, led by Mr Kohn and Sir Ian, a former chairman of
British Steel, then led a revolt and was appointed to the board last
September.
Yesterday's restructuring was a mixture of firm placing and underwrited open
offer for existing shareholders. Of the 41.3m shares to be issued, 5.2m have
been firmly placed with institutions. Sir Ian is taking up shares worth
Dollars 500,000.
The lenders' 19 per cent stake accounts for 7.8m shares. An additional 10.2m
shares have been conditionally placed with UK institutions. A further 15.36m
shares, which the lenders have in effect agreed to underwrite, will be on
offer to existing shareholders at a 1-for-9.26 conversion rate.
The lenders will also receive warrants to subscribe to an additional 5 per
cent of the enlarged capital, at the 62 1/2 p placing price, and they will
receive Dollars 2.2m in reimbursement of costs.
In a circular to shareholders, Mr Kohn said the group planned to increase
the rate of retention of existing subscribers and better utilise the
operating companies' security monitoring capacity.
'We have put the accounting on to a transparent and conservative basis, we
have got rid of the debt and we have five excellent operating companies,' Mr
Kohn said.

FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In its quiet way, SmithKline Beecham is turning out the glamour stock of the
UK pharmaceuticals sector. Since the start of the year it has outperformed
Glaxo by some 25 per cent and Wellcome by nearer 30 per cent. It was always
going to take several years for the market to be satisfied of the success of
the merger. It also took time for equilibrium to be established between US
sellers and UK buyers of the merged stock. But yesterday's second quarter
figures - underlying pre-tax profits up by 15 per cent, in spite of zero
price increases and a 2 per cent fall in Tagamet's volume - show there is
still growth after the immediate cost savings from the merger have worked
through.
For the sector, of course, the overshadowing influence this week is the
Wellcome sale. But however that may be scaled back, it will surely not be
pulled. The Wellcome Trust, after all, is merely swapping assets within the
equity market. For purposes of charitable funding, locking into an indexed
fund on a starting yield of 5.1 per cent is a remarkable opportunity. With
all that, it is worth recalling that SB is on a substantially lower multiple
than Wellcome and on only a modest premium to the market as a whole.

FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Reuters Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company in the communications business, Reuters sets an
extraordinarily bad example. It does not regard the price it is paying to
buy out the minority interests in Visnews as material to its shareholders.
It does not claim to know exactly how much investment will be required to
build up its video news service. It offers only the vaguest of explanations
as to where Pounds 15m in rationalisation costs went in the first half. And
it does not see any need to disclose the transaction volumes on its
newly-launched dealing systems.
There is, however, no escaping the lacklustre indications underlying
yesterday's announcement of a 10.2 per cent increase in interim profits.
Higher interest income accounts for nearly two thirds of the advance and the
company admits to disappointment on revenue growth. It has stopped
surcharging customers for packaging new facilities into existing financial
services and admits to doubts about when demand will be strong enough to
permit resumption of this once lucrative pricing policy.
It is thus legitimate to ask whether Reuters' heady growth of recent years
is now history. Certainly, there cannot be much joy in selling banking
products in Japan these days, or in the US, for that matter, where mergers
are shrinking the market. The newest dealing products are off to an
unexciting start. The thought occurs also that the managers who developed
Reuters' great money-spinners like its Monitor service have long since moved
on.
Perhaps the Visnews announcement is trivial in itself and timed to distract
attention from such worries. Perhaps it really is intended to add a
significant new dimension to Reuters' news activities. That would make
strategic sense. But it would also require heavy investment in a side of the
business which has never distinguished itself in terms of margins or
earnings growth. Whatever the answer, the shares look expensive on a running
multiple just below 19.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, looks like a man
determined to keep his options open. Those looking for hints of further
easing in yesterday's congressional testimony may draw some satisfaction
from his admission of disappointment with the pace of economic recovery in
the second quarter. The same goes for the assertion that US inflation is to
sink to a level lower than has been sustained for 25 years. Those expecting
no change in policy will point to the forecast of increased economic
momentum and the excuse, in the form of changed velocity, for money supply
growth stuck below target.
The Fed may now be in a reactive mode in which it will ease policy again if
the recovery does not pick up over the summer. But implicit in Mr
Greenspan's remarks is a degree of doubt on whether a further fall in short
term rates would help. The real need is to keep long term rates headed lower
to encourage mortgage refinancing and ease the burden of consumer debt. If
Mr Greenspan's natural inclination yesterday was to reassure the politicians
about growth, he will also have been anxious to ensure that the markets
heard his message on inflation.

FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BA's high price ticket
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways' deal with USAir is a vivid illustration of the unique
nature of the world airline business. The proposition is that BA should pay
Pounds 393m for a 32 per cent stake in a business whose entire market
capitalisation on the day before the deal was Pounds 319m. On a voting
basis, BA's stake will be only 21 per cent. Granted, BA will get preference
stock yielding 7 per cent, whereas USAir's equity yields nothing at all. It
is also claimed that putting the two businesses together will produce
handsome cost savings, if not for another couple of years. But if
yesterday's mere 10 per cent rise in USAir's share price is a guide, Wall
Street, with its long and depressing experience of US domestic airlines, is
in no hurry to be convinced.
The 4 per cent rise in BA's share price yesterday will have been partly due
to relief that among the various deals which the company was working on, it
has settled for one which will not involve a rights issue. On the other
hand, gearing will be pushed to nearly 100 per cent. Given that the deal
could ultimately involve a further payment of up to Dollars 600m and that BA
plainly has ambitions for other link-ups elsewhere in the world, the threat
of a future cash call should perhaps not be dismissed.
On the bright side, it should be pointed out that USAir gives BA its entry
into the US domestic market, besides offering a leading position in a
handful of US east coast airports which account for some 40 per cent of
transatlantic travel. It also brings in a business with Pounds 3.8bn of
turnover to add to BA's Pounds 5.2bn. It is also plain that the US domestic
airline industry cannot continue as it is: it must either get a good deal
better or a good deal worse. But it is still sobering to reflect that if BA
and USAir had been formally combined last year, their pre-tax margin on
joint turnover of Pounds 9bn would have been just 1.3 per cent.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Shrinking savings 'cake' behind weak consumer
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS DILLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The claim that building societies are losing deposits to National
Savings is only part of the truth ('Building society lifts home loan rate',
July 18). Taking the sum of inflows into building societies and National
Savings together, the total in the first half of this year was Pounds 3.2bn,
compared to Pounds 5.5bn in the same period last year. Therefore, the
problem is not that National Savings are taking a bigger share of the
savings 'cake', but that the cake has shrunk. This is not due to people
choosing instead to repay debt. Building society figures show that mortgage
repayments in the first five months of this year were actually lower than
last year.
Instead, the problem is that total individual savings (be they acquisitions
of financial assets or repayments of debt) are extremely low. This does not
show in personal savings data because these include the dividend income of
life assurance and pension funds and employers contributions to such funds;
such incomes are, in effect, 'forced savings'.
This low level of individuals' savings implies that the weakness of consumer
spending is not due mainly to people being 'scared to spend', but simply to
the fact that real incomes (excluding pension funds' dividend incomes) have
been falling as employment has fallen. It follows that lower interest rates
are not the only means of stimulating spending. Any policy which boosts real
income - such as increased public spending - will also do so.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Cash flow pressures on N Sea operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HAROLD HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The innuendo at the conclusion of Ian Rutledge's letter (July 20),
about the tax regime applying to offshore oil and gas activity, and the
working relationship between oil companies and government, is misplaced. The
North Sea is in world terms a high-cost operating province. Predictions of
flat real international oil sterling prices, coupled with unit costs of work
offshore that are now rising much faster than monetary inflation, are giving
the UK offshore companies a thin time. Indeed some are experiencing negative
cash flows for their current overall activities. Does Dr Rutledge believe in
taxing negative cash flows?
A stable fiscal system is necessary to keep interest alive in the North Sea
under such economic conditions, and this is certainly in the country's
short- and long-term interest, especially from the aspect of the industry's
substantial (Pounds 7.6bn per annum in 1991) contribution to GNP and to the
UK's balance of payments position.
Nevertheless, marginal tax take on the larger, generally older, fields
remains at some 86 per cent. The technological progress and business skills
of the industry need the complement of a responsive tax regime to give
confidence to companies when they contemplate continuing to extend their
investment in the North Sea under the very tight economic returns it now
offers. There are plenty of oil and gas investment opportunities available
elsewhere in the world if the UK gets this wrong.

Sir, As a devoted reader of the last item in your Observer column, may I
point out that the three protagonists featured in 'At the core' (July 20)
all have the facts completely wrong.
The Englishman and the Frenchman seem to believe that it was Adam who
offered the apple to Eve, when we all know on the best authority (Genesis,
3) that it was the other way round. And far from having nothing but an apple
to eat, as the Russian asserts, they could eat the fruit of all the trees in
the Garden of Eden, except that from the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and the tree of eternal life.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: No not a maybe to leaving ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DAVID CURRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For the record, my answer to the question 'Would leaving the ERM help
Britain?' is an emphatic no, not a maybe as you report (July 18).
To leave would be to throw away the prize of inflation to be won from the
pain of the last two years. Equally, a devaluation within the ERM would be a
serious error, though there may be circumstances in the future (with
inflation and government borrowing under control and an independent Bank of
England) where a devaluation within the ERM would be less damaging.
The government has no alternative but to stick to its current policies:
these offer the prospect, for the first time for a generation, of low and
stable inflation. The alternatives would throw away this prize.

<TEXT>
Sir, Notwithstanding InterCity director, Brian Scott's defence of extended
journey times between Bristol Parkway and London (Letters, July 20), I know
that commuters in several parts of Britain are wondering why some rush hour
timings have been extended since the introduction of targets under the
Passenger's Charter.
At my home station, Brockley, the average journey time of trains to London
between 7am and 9am was increased in the May timetable from 9.1 minutes to
10.8 minutes. This is a rise of almost 20 per cent for this journey of 3 3/4
miles. I am not aware of any engineering works affecting this route.
To measure 70 years' progress, I looked up the same range of rush-hour
trains in a 1922 Bradshaw timetable; the average journey time then was 10.2
minutes.

Sir, In your leader, 'They must be stopped' (July 16), you talk of the
failure of the international community to do anything to 'prevent the ethnic
cleansing' carried out by Turkey in Cyprus.
May I point out that the 'large numbers of people forcibly driven from their
homes and killed' were the Turkish Cypriots in the first instance, not the
Greeks.
This 'ethnic cleansing' was done while Turkey waited patiently for 14 years
for the international community to do something about it, as 'violence and
ethnic cleansing' were not acceptable to Turkey either, only in this case it
was not mere cleansing, but killing.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Foreign Affairs: The real issue in Iraq - Any new military
action against Saddam Hussein must be part of a political strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Saddam is staying for ever,' chanted thousands of Iraqi demonstrators who
marched past the UN inspection team outside the agriculture ministry in
Baghdad on Monday. The Ba'ath party organisers who coined that slogan
understood correctly what the real issue in Iraq is.
Not that the weapons programmes which the UN team is investigating are
unimportant. The thought that Iraq is probably still producing and
developing weapons of mass destruction is deeply worrying, and the Security
Council is right to take a serious view of the regime's continued
prevarication on that issue.
Moreover, its refusal to co-operate with the UN inspectors is a clear breach
of the ceasefire terms enshrined in Security Council resolution 687, and
therefore provides member states with legal justification for any action,
including military action, that they may decide to take in response.
But the crisis over the UN inspection team is only part of a broader crisis
in which the issue is the continuance of President Saddam Hussein's regime;
and his refusal to admit the team to the agriculture ministry is only one of
a number of recent defiant gestures towards the UN:
He has rejected UN terms for limited sales of Iraqi oil to finance imports
of food and medicine.
He has failed to renew the memorandum of understanding with the UN under
which international humanitarian agencies are working in Iraq.
He has stepped up harassment of UN and other agency staff, using agents to
throw grenades or place car bombs in the northern Kurdish area which allied
air cover has put outside his direct control.
He has withdrawn his representatives from the UN commission which is tracing
the Iraq-Kuwait frontier.
He has continued military operations against Shia refugees in the marshes
north of Basra. As well as constant shelling, these operations include the
deliberate pollution of the marshes with containerised sewage, and
preparations to drain them with a view to bringing in armoured vehicles.
Since an Iranian air attack on the base inside Iraq of an Iranian opposition
group in early April, the Iraqi air force has resumed flights by fixed-wing
aircraft - another breach of the ceasefire terms.
There are two interpretations of this behaviour. The gloomy one is that Mr
Saddam feels increasingly confident about his hold on power, and therefore
able to defy the UN with impunity. The optimistic one is that his defiance
is a desperate attempt to overawe an increasingly restive population which
sees his authority gradually weakening, and to restore the morale of his
supporters and subordinates. Probably both are partly true.
There is plenty of evidence that sanctions are biting, and the fact that Mr
Saddam's writ does not run in the north of the country, while some Shia
resistance continues in the marshes, must tend to undermine his authority in
the rest of it. But he probably also calculates that another serious
international effort to deal with him is unlikely.
There are many good reasons for not wanting Mr Saddam to get away with it,
ranging from the welfare of the Iraqi people through the stability and
security of the Middle East to the global interest in stopping the spread of
weapons of mass destruction. But those who do not want him to get away with
it, including the governments of Britain, France and the US, need a clearer
strategy for dealing with him.
Their policy since the ceasefire on February 28 last year has been too
reactive. After failing to support the March insurrection in both north and
south, at a moment when the regime was reeling from its defeat in the war
and might easily have disintegrated, they intervened in extremis, and under
strong pressure from public opinion, to secure a 'safe haven' for the Kurds
in the north, while the unfortunate Shias in the south, being largely out of
sight of TV cameras, were left to their fate.
The Security Council did pass resolution 688, urging the regime to desist
from repression throughout Iraq and to co-operate with UN humanitarian
agencies, and instructing the secretary-general to monitor compliance and
report back. But that resolution, unlike those concerned with the Gulf war
and the ceasefire, has no coercive force unless or until it is backed up
with further resolutions aimed at enforcing it.
To get a majority for such resolutions might be difficult, given the direct
interference in Iraq's 'internal affairs' that would be involved; but not
necessarily impossible if the US exercised the leverage over other member
states of which it has shown itself capable when it wants something badly
enough. Anyway, in the Kurdish case the western powers did not trouble
themselves with legal arguments: they simply acted.
More action is needed now. It would be tragic if it took the form of bombing
raids, aimed presumably at targets believed to be connected with Iraq's
weapons programme, but with no strategic aim other than to demonstrate
western governments' displeasure and so make them 'feel better'. Instead,
any military action should be part of a political strategy whose clear aim
would be the deposition of Mr Saddam and his replacement with a regime
chosen by the Iraqi people.
The relative success of the 'safe haven' in the north shows that air power
can be used effectively to undermine the regime's authority by interdicting
its use of military force for the purposes of repression. The danger of that
tactic as used so far is that it has created a quasi-independent Kurdish
state, contrary to the declared aim of all the governments concerned to
respect Iraq's territorial integrity.
Luckily, the Kurdish leadership has realised the risks involved. Although
free elections held in Kurdistan in May gave it an unquestionable authority
and legitimacy, it did not use them to declare independence, but instead
sent representatives to the Iraqi National Congress, held in Vienna last
month, which 'endorsed the total equality of all citizens including the
people of Iraqi Kurdistan, recognising their right to self-determination
short of secession (my italics) and within a unitary Iraqi state'.
The two main Kurdish leaders, Mr Masoud Barzani and Mr Jalal Talabani, are
expected to form a pan-Iraqi delegation, with two Shia and two Sunni Arabs,
to meet Mr James Baker in Washington next week. His willingness to receive
them is an important signal that the US supports a democratic alternative
for the whole of Iraq, and not only for Kurdistan. He should follow it up by
promising to support a provisional Iraqi government, based initially in the
north, and to help it expand its authority southward by using air power to
neutralise any armed forces that Mr Saddam tries to use against it.
The ultimate objective must be the extension of the 'safe haven' until it
includes the whole country. Meanwhile, it should be clearly recognised that
the target of sanctions is not the Iraqi people but Mr Saddam's regime. The
present absurdity of applying the sanctions to the 'safe haven' which the
allies themselves created should be ended at once.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Personal View: Credibility gap in policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir KIT MCMAHON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many people are sadly puzzled that there is still no sign of economic
recovery. It is right to be sad, but wrong to be puzzled. Why on earth
should we expect recovery on present policies?
Has there ever been a serious and sustained recovery (ie: a return by the
economy to its underlying growth path) with real short-term interest rates
maintained at more than 6 per cent? It is hard to find precedents. In the
balmy decades of zero to 2 per cent inflation, a bank rate of 6-8 per cent
was regarded as a crisis measure - not one to be maintained for years at a
time.
There is one apparent precedent: the mid-1980s recovery from the last
recession when real interest rates, although not as high as now, ranged from
3-5 per cent in the years 1982-84, rising further as expansion gathered pace
in 1985 and 1986. Some may feel encouraged by this, arguing that then, as
now, policy was driven by the need to crack down on inflation and
inflationary expectations; and that as these duly fell, a strong and
sustained recovery took place - the only problem being that it was too
sustained.
The precedent, however, is misleading. The initial policy shock was
administered by means of a tight fiscal policy, a high exchange rate and
(initially) low real interest rates, imposed on an economy that was
relatively under-borrowed (1980 registered the peak postwar personal savings
rate of 16.5 per cent). Recovery from the recession was driven by two forces
not in prospect now: a sharp fall in the exchange rate (13 per cent between
1982 and 1984) and a massive expansion of credit throughout the period
associated with financial deregulation. (Deregulation was seen as a
supply-side measure at the time, but no less an authority than Mr Nigel
Lawson has recently drawn attention to the substantial and significantly
underestimated effects on demand.)
This time round, the authorities have for three years been working to curb
the inflationary excesses of a seriously over-borrowed economy with high
real interest rates, a loose fiscal policy and a fixed exchange rate. The
excessive credit expansion of the 1980s is being unwound with a vengeance,
but will continue, as the infernal machine of compound interest takes its
toll, to exert a downward pressure on the economy for some time to come.
A man from Mars would find our official policy stance surprising. So indeed
might a man from the United States, where, confronted by a similar hang-over
from a credit boom and although stuck with gigantic fiscal deficits, the
authorities have acted in a classically appropriate way by dropping interest
rates and letting the exchange rate fall. They are being rewarded by some
recovery, although the slowness and apparent fragility of this testify to
the dragging power of debt deflation, even when it is being tackled
appropriately.
Why then is the British economy being put through this particularly painful
wringer? The first answer is, as it was in the early 1980s, to squeeze
inflation out of the system. If, because inflationary expectations are so
stubbornly embedded in the UK, it is necessary to produce a deep and
long-lasting recession to get retail price expectations down from say 4-5
per cent to 2 per cent, then so be it. As the years go by and the damage
mounts, one might query whether this game is worth the candle. But if it is,
the situation cries out for tight fiscal policy - another 'Howe' Budget
(with savage expenditure cuts, tax increases or whatever was necessary) to
allow interest rates to drop.
But of course the main reason given for maintaining interest rates at
current levels is our membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System. It is true that the maintenance of our present ERM
parity is not consistent with the substantial (at least 2-3 per cent) drop
in interest rates that we need. And we are told that a devaluation within
the ERM, let alone allowing sterling to float for a period, would produce a
blow to confidence and a loss of official credibility that would be quite
unacceptable.
Our situation is so serious that there is unlikely to be any way out of it
that is not messy, embarrassing and risky; and does not involve eating a lot
of official words. But, having entered the ERM, after 11 years' delay, at
the wrong time, at the wrong rate and in the wrong manner, must we really
regard the indefinite maintenance of the parity then chosen as the ultimate
touchstone of political and economic credibility?
For one thing, we shall not be able to hold the present exchange rate for
ever. By the end of this year we shall have notched up a cumulative deficit
of Pounds 70bn since 1987 (and a net deficit of Pounds 50bn since North Sea
oil first arrived). If and when the economy recovers the deficit will expand
beyond its rate of Pounds 10bn a year. Of course, no one can say how long
this deterioration in our balance sheet, with its cumulative effect on our
invisible earnings, can go on. Maybe for years. But this tree will not grow
to the sky.
Commitments to an exchange rate are meant to be difficult to abandon: that
is their purpose as a policy tool. But they are not meant to be impossible
to abandon until there is a single currency. The way towards a single
currency lies through a serious and sustained integration of the economies
concerned, not through gestures which can be widely seen to have
inappropriate economic consequences. (If by historical accident we had not
yet joined the ERM, who can doubt that our interest rates would be lower?)
The recently ended series of optimistic forecasts from the chancellor, each
falsified in turn, indicates that the government itself did not expect or
will the effects on the economy that we are suffering.
For the moment, however, we cannot expect a serious shift towards tight
fiscal policy, lower interest rates and a lower exchange rate. It is more
than 20 years since the UK has operated in a fixed exchange rate regime, and
many people have forgotten, or never knew, the paralysis which that is apt
to produce in British policymaking. Serious action is unthinkable until it
happens. In the meantime, activity will perhaps inch up as inflation inches
down and that may be thought to be enough, at least during the British
presidency of the European Community. But one day, something really will
have to be done.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Urban agencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A ONE-STOP funding agency for urban regeneration is urgently needed. Its
most important role would be to provide a single port of call for developers
and local authorities who now deal with many different government bodies,
departments and agencies. It must control the urban regeneration budget of
almost Pounds 900m a year which is currently dispensed through a plethora of
government initiatives.
The plans announced yesterday for a new Urban Regeneration Agency fall far
short of what is needed. The URA will take over only Pounds 130m of the
government's spending - leaving huge patronage under ministerial control.
Rather than replacing existing agencies in the inner cities, it will add
another. By modelling itself on the urban development corporations, it risks
perpetuating the top-down approach, rather than encouraging local
partnerships between the public and private sector. And it abandons the
strategic approach adopted with City Challenge which emphasises the role
played in urban regeneration by economic revival, training and housing.
Without such strategic elements, the URA will be just another land
development body rather than an urban development agency which can genuinely
revive Britain's run-down and rebellious inner cities.
The government should rethink the URA idea, to create an agency accountable
to parliament through ministers, but with clear and monitored targets. Such
an agency could and should control most of the government's urban programme.
Government should also encourage the URA to extend the strategic approach
adopted in City Challenge more widely (minus the threat to withhold funds
entirely). Merely creating another agency on top of the rest adds to the
confusion and reduces cost-effectiveness.

<TEXT>
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, has gained massive press attention
by opposing the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) on the grounds that it is
too expensive and complex for Germany's future needs. Germany has refused to
commit funds for the production stage and Mr Ruhe has called for a lighter
and cheaper aircraft to be developed. He has seemingly calculated that his
personal popularity and ambitions to be chancellor will be boosted. However,
he has also shown signs either of understanding little of the complexities,
realities and inflexibilities of defence procurement, or of having a hidden
agenda involving a political preference for a French or US aircraft.
Significantly, some considerations indicate that his initiative could
backfire and that EFA could seriously damage his career. The worst thing for
Mr Ruhe would be for the three other partners (Britain, Italy and Spain) to
press on with the project, complete development and go into production.
Germany would be obliged to complete its share of development at a cost of
at least a further Pounds 1bn. Although the German obligation is technically
not legal, since it is based on a memorandum of understanding rather than a
treaty, it is almost unthinkable that Germany could abandon its commitment
unilaterally. German credibility in all fields would be damaged. In
addition, Germany would be obliged to hand over, without payment, the
technology involved so the remaining partners could manufacture the aircraft
themselves. The partners could decide to contract some production to German
companies, if price gains could be won, but there would be no guarantees of
work for Germany which would then have spent more than Pounds 2bn to
subsidise someone else's aircraft while leaving its own combat aircraft
industry, built up since the 1950s, in disarray. Could any politician
survive such an abuse of his country's resources and interests?
By 1997, as Mr Ruhe accepts, Germany will need to order a replacement for
its F-4 Phantoms and, given the aircraft available from the US, France and
Russia, EFA seems likely to offer the best value for money. Both the
Luftwaffe and a German parliamentary committee have compared EFA with its
potential rivals: the Luftwaffe has always found in EFA's favour and the
parliamentary committee has not recommended an alternative.
Crucial elements in all this are the agreements in the 1980s establishing
the EFA programme. They were meant to give the four governments collectively
the opportunity to stop the programme at any of a series of stages if they
felt it was going out of control, particularly in financial terms. But they
were also designed to discourage a country from damaging the project by
withdrawing unilaterally in the middle of a stage, as Mr Ruhe would like to
do.
This is why Mr Ruhe has not said firmly that Germany is withdrawing and he
has argued for an alternative collaborative project to replace EFA. However,
it is almost impossible to see how a new aircraft could be cheaper since
Pounds 4bn or so has already been committed. While Mr Ruhe may argue
politically for a lighter, cheaper aircraft, few in the German air force or
industry agree with him. Thus he will find it hard to produce hard technical
arguments to reinforce his case. For instance, a lighter aircraft would not
need the two EJ200 engines developed for EFA while a single EJ200 would not
be adequate for other than a very light combat aircraft. A new, larger
engine would therefore be needed. A new airframe would require a different
fly-by-wire control system as well as further expensive tests. Moreover, the
controlled technological ambitions of EFA have helped its development costs
to stay within budget. In contrast, the latest US fighter development
programme, the F-22, incorporates expensive 'stealth' and supersonic cruise
technologies.
Of course, EFA is far from safe because both Italy and Spain have financial
problems and the UK chancellor is believed to have some reservations about
this project. In this situation, there is merit in the UK's approach of
continuing to talk to Germany and pressing industry to bring down further
the acquisition price and life cycle maintenance costs. Further savings
would be possible by cutting the number of planned assembly lines from four
to two.
As such considerations are brought home in the coming months, Mr Ruhe may
appreciate a chance to pretend he has negotiated a new aircraft.
Technically, given that the airframe, engine and fly-by-wire controls cannot
be easily changed, a lower specification for the avionics would be the
obvious way to symbolise that Germany was going to buy a less capable
aircraft than it had planned during the cold war. Mr Ruhe will also want a
new name for the Jager 90, as EFA is called in Germany. Something less
aggressive than Hunter 90 would be helpful.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Uncertainty in a stable world: Strains in the housing market
and the government's need for funds are afflicting UK building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's building societies emitted a collective sigh of relief when the
government unexpectedly cut the rate of interest on its newest National
Savings product, the First Option Bond, on Monday. A general increase in
mortgage rates, which looked all too likely after Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
raised its mortgage rate from 10 3/4 to 10.99 per cent late last week, has,
on the face of it, been averted.
Yet the rejoicing may be premature. In spite of this temporary
accommodation, the broader logic of the government's present fiscal and
monetary policies is pushing in an unhelpful direction for borrowers; and
the structure of the housing market is subject to unprecedented strain.
First, consider fiscal policy. As the chart implies, National Savings have
been taking a rapidly growing share of the personal sector's nest egg,
largely at the expense of the building societies. This reflects the
Treasury's efforts to broaden its funding options in response to the
dramatic deterioration in the public finances over the past three years.
From a public sector debt repayment equivalent to 3 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1988-89, the government has shifted to a borrowing
requirement that is widely predicted to run at more than 5 per cent of GDP
in the current year. On present policy UBS Phillips &amp; Drew predicts a public
sector borrowing requirement of 8-9 per cent of GDP by 1996, reflecting the
impact of recession on government spending and tax revenues.
No matter that policy will have to adjust to pre-empt this untenable set of
figures. In the absence of a remotely respectable economic recovery, and
even allowing for a tough round of public spending cuts in the autumn, it is
clear that the building societies and the Treasury will be on a collision
course in the markets for the foreseeable future unless the government is
prepared to raise taxes, which seems unlikely for the moment.
A confrontation could always be avoided as long as the government refrained
from raising short-term funds aggressively in the retail savings market.
Building society deposits are still just about competitive against
short-dated gilt-edged stock. But since National Savings have been promoted
more aggressively, savers have been presented with an opportunity to
increase their return by forsaking building society deposits for government
IOUs.
One of the longstanding certainties of the building society world was that
retail deposits were stable. Yet the experience with First Option confirms
that they become a great deal less stable if the government is offering an
attractive alternative. Just as US retail savers have exploited a positive
yield curve, in which bonds and equities offer a much higher income than
short-term bank deposits, by removing their money from the banking system,
British savers are demonstrating their sophistication, not for the first
time, by abandoning the building societies.
The stability of retail deposits increasingly hinges on price, which is
another way of saying that they are not that stable; and in today's
circumstances the building societies are obliged to dance to the Treasury's
interest rate tune. The move to reduce the interest rate on First Option
from 10.34 to 9.67 per cent on Monday will help curb the outflow from the
societies' coffers for now. But the longer-term problem remains, not least
because the initial interest rate on First Option was broadly in line with
market rates.
Nor will the current debate on overfunding the PSBR do anything to help the
building societies' plight. City economists, including Mr Tim Congdon of
Lombard Street Research and Mr Roger Bootle of Midland Montagu, are urging
the government to abandon the so-called full funding rule, whereby the PSBR,
together with maturing debt and any increase in the reserves, is fully
funded by sales of debt outside the banking and building society sectors.
The case for such a move is that it would expand broad money and stimulate
the economy by leading to lower long-term interest rates and higher equity
prices. At the same time it would help stabilise sterling and reduce
long-run funding costs, if the government really believes in its own
disinflationary policies, by shifting the debt burden from the long to the
short end of the gilts market.
The argument is compelling, which means trouble for the building societies
because short-term rates, which matter most to them, would rise relative to
long rates. For the moment politics have prevailed over economics. But a
departure from the full funding principle in due course would lead to more
upward pressure on mortgage rates in the absence of a monetary deus ex
machina. None is in prospect. The Bundesbank, which raised its discount rate
last week in response to continuing post-unification inflationary pressures
in the German economy, is reluctant to contemplate a significant decline in
German interest rates as long as the large fiscal deficit persists, which it
threatens to do into the mid-1990s.
All this gives rise to a more fundamental question. Do current mortgage
rates adequately discount the risk in a housing market that has become much
more volatile than in the past? A 10 3/4 per cent mortgage rate is around
one and a half percentage points higher than the risk-free redemption yield
on a medium-dated gilt-edged stock that matures in seven years - the life of
the average mortgage.
That looks a very slender margin in a business heavily biased towards a
single market where prices in some parts of the country have fallen by 25 to
30 per cent. It looks doubly slender, bearing in mind that it takes a fall
of no more than 5.6 per cent in the balance sheet value of the top 20
building societies' commercial assets to wipe out their reserves, known as
'tier one' capital.
The widespread view is nonetheless that building societies are well
capitalised on a risk-weighted basis, still profitable, and well capable of
meeting the ratios demanded by the regulators. An analysis of the building
societies' sensitivity to bad debts by Mr John Wriglesworth, of UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, suggests that even on a worst-case assumption of a 20 per cent fall
in house prices and a 200 per cent increase in bad debt provisions for 1992,
the top 20 societies would have no difficulty complying with their capital
adequacy requirements. But could the risk-weighting in the capital adequacy
regime, which puts a weight of 0.5 on residential mortgages, compared with
0.1 for short gilts and 1.0 for other types of lending, reflect an outdated
view of the housing market and of building society profitability?
Arguably not, given that much of the credit risk in housing finance has
leaked into the insurance sector via mortgage indemnity policies. Yet here
lies the next big hurdle for the housing market and the societies. Over the
past four years bad debt provisions of all the building societies, including
Abbey National which has converted to banking status, have risen from Pounds
25m to Pounds 1.2bn. Because insurance companies were meeting around
three-quarters of the societies' losses in the first three of those years,
the societies enjoyed substantial protection.
Yet Mr Simon Adamson of the bank rating agency, IBCA, has estimated that the
building societies' share of the losses jumped to 44 per cent in 1991. In
other words they were selling repossessed houses at well below the level of
their insurance cover. The further prices fall - and they are down by more
than 5 per cent so far this year - the more exposed the societies become.
But the insurance companies have no reason to cheer, since indemnity claims
in 1991 were running at nearly four times the level of insurance premiums.
Not surprisingly, the insurance companies have concluded that providing
cover for the top slice of a mortgage, typically 75 to 100 per cent of the
purchase price, is a mug's game - especially if the insurance companies
leave it to the building societies to assess the credit and sell the
repossessed homes. They are now demanding tougher, and more or less uniform,
terms from the building societies.
Instead of leaving the insurers with the top slice of the property value,
the new deal involves the two parties taking a fixed share of the loss. The
insurers are also asking for a range of exclusions to cover, inter alia,
fraud and, more worryingly for the societies, negligence. And they are
demanding access to building society records before meeting their claims.
Since most mortgage indemnity policies are renewed at the end of August,
this time bomb carries a short fuse.
For the building societies, the insurance companies' proposal would
materially increase the risks that they bear. Already one small society,
Lambeth, has said that it will be reducing the percentage of value that it
is prepared to lend to home buyers. The impact on an already groggy housing
market if others follow suit is potentially powerful, given that first-time
buyers could be forced to save more over a lengthier period for a larger
deposit on a home.
Coming just after the government's temporary stamp duty exemption runs out,
this will create despair in the estate agency fraternity. It will also worry
the government, because of the implied change in savings behaviour. The
sluggishness of consumer spending, and the related failure of the economic
recovery to materialise, owes much to the inexorable rise in the household
savings ratio. The last thing the government needs now is an outbreak of
prudence on the part of first-time buyers.
The Building Societies Association is doing its best to head off the threat,
by hiring consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow to examine alternatives to
the insurance companies' proposition. According to Mr Adrian Coles of the
association, the options they have been asked to examine include
self-insurance and captive insurance. But whatever Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggests,
it is hard to escape the conclusion that credit risk has increased and that
lending terms to first-time buyers will in the end have to reflect that
fact.
The all too obvious way out of this fiscal and financial box is the
inflationary route that Mr John Major, the prime minister, so firmly ruled
out in his anti-devaluation speech on Monday. Yet the simultaneous move to
relieve pressure on the building societies' deposit base carried an echo of
the old inflationary days. Once again, borrowers were being favoured at the
expense of savers. It looked suspiciously like a straw in the wind.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A German role in world peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLD war has ended, but the German navy is being asked to dip its toe
into the warm - perhaps hot - waters of the Adriatic. The German parliament
is being recalled from recess today to debate last week's decision by the
centre-right coalition to send a destroyer and three reconnaissance aircraft
to join allied warships monitoring the UN trade embargo of Serbia and
Montenegro. The opposition Social Democrats have claimed that the move may
infringe Germany's Basic Law. Some SPD leaders threaten to call in the
constitutional court to try to block the action - a move which could help by
resolving juridical uncertainties on the issue.
Beyond the Bonn bickering lie central questions about united Germany's role
in world affairs. Although putting up a solid contribution to Nato defence
during 40 years of division, Germany has been firmly inscribed on the list
of international non-combatants. Now that it has regained sovereignty, the
country is struggling to find a consensus on the conditions for using the
Bundeswehr for peace operations outside the Nato area. Today's debate marks
a significant step towards establishing that consensus. By declaring a
readiness to put its defence resources at the service of the international
community, whether in the context of the United Nations, Nato or the Western
European Union, Europe's strongest economic power has a duty to live up to
its new responsibilities.
During last year's war with Iraq, when Germany was heavily criticised for
initial hesitancy in supporting the UN-led coalition, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said it was unacceptable for Germany permanently to absent itself from
international efforts to secure peace. It is now time for Mr Kohl firmly to
register that commitment, even though it may add to his political
difficulties at home. Greater clarity on out-of-area Bundeswehr deployment
would also iron out inconsistencies in Germany's post-unification foreign
policies, which - above all over recognising Croatia last year - have
sometimes been driven more by moral crusading than practical considerations.
There is a need for Germany to frame its military role in the spirit of
partnership. Ultimately, however, it will be up to the Germans to decide
what sort of military power they want to be. If the international community
still does not want a German policeman on permanent patrol in the world's
trouble spots, then it may be a consolation that the German public, too,
does not like the idea.
Two-thirds of the German population, according to opinion polls, back the
use of German troops as UN peace-keepers. But there are deep misgivings,
expressed above all by the Social Democrats, about Mr Kohl's desire to
change the 1949 constitution to permit further-reaching Bundeswehr
participation, in actions backed, for instance, by the WEU. Since he needs a
two-thirds Bundestag majority for a constitutional change, Mr Kohl must
convince the SPD that his way is best.
Commenting on the impasse over the outside use of the Bundeswehr, Mr Klaus
Kinkel, Germany's new foreign minister, has recently termed his country an
'impotent dwarf'. An international framework is now available for the dwarf
to put on a little muscle. Germany should be en-couraged to take advantage
of the opportunity. And the rest of the world should welcome it.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Playland - South African Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GREIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATHOL Fugard's latest work commends the talking cure for political violence.
Topicality gives edge to Fugard's moral earnestness, and the earnestness
gives the piece momentum.
Playland is a strong, static dramatic image rather than a drama. It's an
image of the South African hell - a vessel overloaded with corpses. The
image of hell realised on stage by Fugard and his talented designer, Susan
Hilferty, is a travelling funfair on a hot New Year's Eve in the small Karoo
desert town of Cradock.
The stage is dominated by the curving, glaringly lit skeletons of big wheels
and roller-coasters; the barking loudspeaker's injunctions to have a good
time; acrid smoke from a superfluous brazier; and the inanities of Sixties
rock'n'roll. It is a setting of infernal banality in flaming oranges and
faded Noddyland primary colours.
Playland is a confrontation between two characters, one white and one black.
Martinus Zoeloe, a Xhosa nightwatchman, is played by John Kani, who has
worked with Fugard since the 1960s. A stocky, forceful actor, Sean Taylor,
plays the shell-shocked veteran of the Namibia war, Gideon le Roux.
The play begins with Martinus threatening offstage crooks with the fires of
hell and their derisive laughter. One of the debates between the two
characters is about the hereafter, with Le Roux denying all but the here and
now and Zoeloe all but the hereafter. Both positions, it emerges, have less
to do with faith than the need to evade guilt for past acts of violence.
Martinus killed a white seducer of his wife, Le Roux participated in border
massacres: both are haunted by the memories and both their lives are
paralysed by guilt and anger. Each presses the other to open up: much of the
play's action is the process of negotiation, back-off and attack which
eventually leads to the recognition that, in being haunted by ghosts, they
have become citizens of limbo, and thence to forgiveness.
The play has the dramatic deficiencies of allegory - particularly a
disregard for improbability. And its operating assumption is peculiarly
Fugardian - that stage characters will necessarily participate in joint
therapy because they are bound in a blood knot of violence, anger and guilt.
Yet, the play is resonant because the two performances give a degree of
realism to the allegory, with Kani's performance an ornate assembly of
sour-mouthed silences, hell-fire sermonising and sardonic laughter, and
Taylor's based on violent shifts between hyperactivity and tearfulness.
Playland is at the Market Theatre, Johannesburg

FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Buxton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARRIVAL in Buxton for this year's festival brought one unpleasant surprise.
The elegant neo-classical Crescent near the Opera House, for some years in a
dilapidated state, is now boarded up, its future apparently uncertain. A
petition has even been started to try to save the building - one of the
region's outstanding architectural landmarks.
There seems to be a tradition in these parts that anything worth
preservation has to wait until the 11th hour before action is taken. The
festival itself has been on the brink of financial collapse more often than
one cares to remember, so it is heartening to report this year that its
finances are in a relatively healthy position, thanks to a substantial grant
from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts.
One of Buxton's permanent assets is the classic Matcham theatre, which was
lovingly restored in the late 1970s. It is a friendly and intimate venue,
which is just the right place for the foraging into little-known operatic
territory that is the festival's aim. This year, the two operas were by
Handel and Rossini - ideal fare for this theatre, if not both as rare as
they might have been.
The greater novelty (and the better performed of the two) was Handel's
Agrippina. This is one of those early Handel Italian operas which is spiced
with a surprisingly sharp wit. The familiar figures of Roman history are
there, but their story is twisted into satire with some topical references.
It is a slippery style to master and Adrian Slack's production sometimes had
a grasp on its wry sense of humour, sometimes not.
It was at its best when the sharpest individual characterisations were
parading the stage. Susan Roberts was a particularly masterful Agrippina,
who exhibited the inner concentration, the way of uttering her wickedest
lines through clenched teeth, that makes this monster of a woman come to
life. Fiona Janes was a convincingly adolescent Nerone, Sally Harrison the
luscious blonde bimbette of a Poppea. There were two very reasonable
counter-tenors in Timothy Wilson as Ottone and Simon Clulow as Narciso.
The standard of singing was not, however, flawless, with several of the cast
coming unstuck on the coloratura and parting company with the orchestra. The
players were from the Manchester Camerata, directed with fine musicianship,
though not always enough dramatic momentum, by Roger Vignoles. Perhaps the
most consistent pleasure came from the designs of Dermot Hayes, whose
mini-Colosseum in flames was an amusing contribution from one participant
who clearly had his tongue firmly in his cheek.
The other production also looked good on a small budget, even if the
designer, Ruari Murchison, seemed set upon painting the whole stage red,
white and green in the Italian colours. Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri flies
the national flag pretty blatantly and the main aim of Jamie Hayes's
production was not to let us forget it.
As the patriotic Isabella, Jean Rigby was in every sense the standard-bearer
of the evening. The warm resonance of her voice and the quality of her
singing, though neither very Italianate in style, carried all before her.
The other singers admittedly offered little resistance. Justin Lavender
sounded out-of-sorts as Lindoro. Mark Richardson sang decently, but never
grew into the grotesque and comical Mustapha; Richard Suart's Taddeo worked
the comedy hard enough for the whole cast.
Still, there have been worse tributes to Rossini this bicentenary year and,
indeed, less appealing productions of this opera in the past. The conductor,
giving the performance much of the nimbleness of spirit it wanted elsewhere,
was Jane Glover. She takes over as Artistic Director at Buxton in 1993,
initially for a one-year period, and in her the festival will be looking for
new vigour and ambition.
The festival continues until 2 August (Box Office 0298) 72190

Alexander Dunn is to head a new direct motor insurance operation being
launched in the UK by the French Groupe des Assurances Nationales.
Dunn, a 39-year-old Scot who has spent 20 years with Eagle Star, helped
launch the company's direct sales arm in October 1988.
After three and half years at Eagle Star Direct, Dunn has become a firm fan
of direct sales methods, which uses a combination of mass media advertising,
computer-based underwriting systems and telephone sales to bypass the
broker, the industry's traditional middleman.
'From a business point of view it is the way the market is going. It is a
very immediate way of doing business. You can test the concept, see the
result and change strategy quickly if necessary,' he says.
GAN intends to invest Pounds 1m initially in software and hardware into the
operation, which is to be based in Portsmouth. Dunn is aiming for a 2.5 per
cent share of the UK motor market by 1997 and also envisages selling
household, personal accident and medical expenses cover by the direct route.

FT  22 JUL 92 / People: Williams seeks window of opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Williams, the 64-year-old founder of the recently floated Anglian
Group, is back in business and planning to challenge his old company for the
leadership of Britain's replacement window market.
Williams, who started Anglian from one small workshop in 1966, has been
appointed executive chairman of Aspen Windows, which has been formed by
executives made redundant by Anglian. The firm, which will shortly move out
of a chicken hut on Williams' Norwich estate, is a minnow compared with
Anglian - valued at Pounds 184m when it was floated on the stock market this
month.
However, for a seven-month-old company, it has made an impressive start. It
employs 250 people, has a dozen showrooms and in its first seven months has
generated Pounds 4m of turnover. This is small beer compared with Anglian's
annual turnover of close to Pounds 150m, but Williams has big ambitions.
Among his executive team are several Anglian veterans including Malcolm
Woodcock, Fred Searle and Denis Allen who either lost their jobs or retired.
'I believe we can put Aspen Windows in the top three window companies within
five years. Maybe even become market leader,' Williams says. However, he
stresses that he is not 'doing it for the money, but for the pure
enjoyment'. He made a sizeable fortune when he sold Anglian to BET in 1984,
and although he retired from Anglian in 1989 he says he misses the window
business.
Although some might question the wisdom of starting a new business in the
midst of a recession, Williams is confident. He says that people are
'virtually giving away' showrooms and he has no difficulty recruiting
professional staff. 'It was the case of the blind leading the blind in my
early days,' he says.
Anglian, whose stock market debut was marred by the general nervousness of
investors, seems unruffled by its new competitor. It says that it has
certain covenants with Aspen preventing its sales people competing for its
business until January 1993. It also notes that it is a business where there
have always been lots of small competitors.

FT  22 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Recoveries are not on trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIS, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAPIER v KERSHAW
Court of Appeal
(Lord Justice Dillon,
Lord Justice Staughton and
Lord Justice Nolan)
July 9 1992
STOP LOSS insurers with a right of subrogation against an assured must
normally claim at common law in debt or for monies had and received, and
have no equitable remedy directly against recoveries held for the assured by
his agent.  And where the loss is insured above a certain minimum and below
a certain limit, excess to be borne by the assured, recoveries should be
applied first in recouping any loss above the limit, then the layer insured,
and finally excess below that layer.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing part and allowing part of an
appeal by the defendant stop loss insurers from Mr Justice Saville's
decision as to the order of appropriation out of settlement monies recovered
by solicitors, Richards Butler, as agents for the plaintiff Lloyd's Names,
Lord Napier and others.
LORD JUSTICE Dillon said that 987 Lloyd's Names who belonged to the
Outhwaite Syndicate had formed an association to claim against RHM Outhwaite
Underwriting Agencies Limited and members' agents at Lloyd's to recover
losses attributable to allegedly negligent underwriting.
Under a settlement in March 1992, Pounds 116m was paid by the Outhwaite
defendants to Richards Butler on behalf of the names.
Of that total, Pounds 80m was attributable to past paid and notified cash
calls in respect of losses of the Outhwaite Syndicate. The balance was
irrelevant to the appeal.
The defendant stop loss insurers were joined as representatives of other
Lloyd's Syndicates which wrote stop loss insurance policies for 1982 for
individual names.
Those Names who had not effected stop loss policies with the insurers had
had their shares of the settlement monies released to them.
On the appeal the first issue was whether the stop loss insurers could
recover whatever they were entitled to recoup directly from the monies in
the hands of Richards Butler, on the ground that they were held on
constructive trust for the insurers to the extent of the amount they were
entitled to recoup from each name.
Richards Butler received the settlement monies as agents for the names in
the ordinary course of their practice as solicitors.
In Lee v Sankey LR 15 Eq 204,211 Bacon V-C said 'A mere agent of trustees is
answerable only to his principal . . . in respect of trust monies coming
into his hands.'
Accordingly, the stop loss insurers did not claim that Richards Butler were
constructive trustees.
Their claim was that the names were constructive trustees of the recovery
monies, and that the amounts due to the insurers were traceable in equity in
the monies held by Richards Butler.
It was common ground that in appropriate circumstances a remedy in equity by
way of constructive or resulting trust or a remedy at common law, might
arise out of different aspects of the same transaction. Equity and common
law were not mutually exclusive.
However, the doctrine of subrogation was a common law doctrine long before
the fusion of law and equity. Also the intricacies and doctrines connected
with trusts ought not to be introduced into commercial transactions, and an
agent in a commercial case ought not to be turned into a trustee with all
the troubles that attended that relation (see New Zealand and Australia Land
7 QBD 378, 382).
Even so, in appropriate circumstances a constructive trust might be held to
have arisen out of a common law relationship.
In Lister v Stubbs 45 ChD 1 it was held that the relationship between a
company and an employee who had corruptly received commission from a
customer, was that of debtor and creditor, not one of trust, with the result
that the company could not claim ownership of investments which the employee
had bought with the commission. The company's proper course was to recover a
money judgment.
No doubt in an appropriate case even in an insurance context, recoveries
which an insurer was entitled to claim by subrogation could have been held
on constructive trust for the insurer.
But it was not automatic that whenever the assured recovered monies in
circumstances giving underwriters a right to recoupment, the recoveries
would be held on a constructive trust for the underwriters insofar as they
were traceable in equity among the assured's assets.
Such a very broad approach would be inconsistent with the essentially common
law origins of subrogation in insurance law.
In the present case there was nothing in the circumstances to turn the stop
loss insurers' subrogation claim against the names from a common law claim
in debt or for monies had and received, into a claim under a trust.
Mr Justice Saville rightly held that a constructive trust was not made out.
The appeal was dismissed on the constructive trust point.
The second question arose out of the provision in each stop loss policy for
the insured to bear an excess. The insurers only insured losses above a
certain minimum and up to a certain maximum.
The Names claimed and the judge held that they were entitled to recoup the
excess out of recoveries before anything was payable to the insurers by way
of subrogation.
Under the insurances the underwriters were to indemnify the assured 'for the
amount by which the assured's . . . loss . . . exceeds the amount stated as
excess in the schedule'. It was provided that the underwriters' liability
should not exceed the amounts stated as 'limit' in the schedule.
The case was argued on hypothetical figures. An excess of Pounds 25,000 and
a limit of Pounds 125,000 were assumed, giving a layer of insurance of
Pounds 100,000. The underwriting loss was Pounds 160,000.
The top Pounds 35,000 (the difference between Pounds 160,000 and Pounds
125,000) might be uninsured, or might be covered by another layer of stop
loss insurance with a different insurer.
The case for the stop loss insurers was that if there was any recovery by
the Name after they had paid him the Pounds 100,000, the recovery should be
applied first in recouping the top Pounds 35,000 whether insured or not, and
second, in recouping the Pounds 100,000 to the stop loss insurer. Recoupment
of the Pounds 25,000 excess would only begin if the recovery exceeded Pounds
135,000.
The case for the Names, which the judge accepted, was that it was
fundamental to the law of subrogation that there could be no recoupment to
an insurer until the assured had recovered the whole of his uninsured loss.
Therefore, it was said if the top Pounds 35,000 was uninsured, any recovery
would go in recoupment to the name of the Pounds 35,000 and the Pounds
25,000 excess, and only then towards recoupment of Pounds 100,000 to the
stop loss insurers.
The Names' contentions were inconsistent with the agreement that there was
to be an excess which was to be borne by them. The application of recovery
monies as contended for by the Names would have the effect of turning the
stop loss insurers into insurers of the first Pounds 100,000 of the
underwriting loss without any excess.
The insurers' argument that recovery should be applied from the top down
leaving the excess the last to be recouped, was preferable.
Accordingly, the appeal was allowed on the excess question.
Their Lordships gave concurring judgments.
For the insurers: David
Donaldson QC and Michael
Swainston (Clyde &amp; Co)
For the Names: Anthony
Boswood QC and Stephen
Moriarty (Richards Butler)
In Depositors Protection Fund v Dalia, Financial Times July 16 1992, Lord
Irvine of Lairg QC was leading counsel for Mrs Dalia.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: EC packaging laws tied in red
tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission last week extended its influence into the murky
depths of the Euro-dustbin when it published its long-awaited directive on
the ticklish issue of how best to avoid packaging waste.
The EC put forward far-reaching proposals aimed at harmonising environmental
laws across the Continent and reducing the 50m tonnes of packaging waste
produced in the Community each year.
Its hierarchy of preferred solutions is: minimisation of the packaging used
in particular products, followed by recovery and recycling, with final
disposal in landfill sites remaining a last resort.
The directive sets the seemingly staggering target that within 10 years of
implementation 90 per cent of all packaging waste by weight should not reach
the waste stream and 60 per cent of each packaging material recycled.
It expects that within five years of implementation the member states will
have set up appropriate systems to collect packaging waste from the
consumer, enabling them to ensure that it is effectively re-used or
'recovered'.
The concept of recovery is a loose one - much to the packaging industry's
relief - allowing for the 'value' of any product to be recovered by the most
efficient means possible - a process known as valorisation. So, for example,
it will be considered equally valid either to recover the energy from a
product by burning it and utilising the heat or composting products for
agricultural use.
However, few sectors of the packaging industry in any European country come
near to the required rates of recycling. The targets, therefore, represent a
formidable challenge. At present, only 20 per cent of the waste produced in
the EC is recycled.
Nevertheless, many industry representatives have reacted favourably to the
ambitious proposals, believing they will help forestall discriminatory
national legislation and create a flexible framework enabling the best
environmental solutions to emerge in each of the member states.
Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the Industry Council for
Packaging and the Environment in the UK, says: 'We welcome anything that is
a step towards greater certainty.'
But some still have reservations. The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the
Environment, which represents many international companies involved in
producing multi-layered cartons, says it still has 'serious concerns' about
the unrealistic targets that have been set, which run the risk of creating
mountains of waste.
But there is a surprising degree of flexibility even on this score. The EC
accepts that its targets are 'aspirational'. A clause in the directive
suggests they may be modified if research shows that other processes of
recovering waste prove to have greater environmental advantages.
Jacques Fonteyne, managing director of the European Recovery and Recycling
Association (Erra) which represents 31 companies directly or indirectly
involved in the packaging industry, says: 'Everybody seems to forget that
there are still at least two more years before the directive will be
implemented.'
Although there are many battles still to be fought before the proposals are
enacted in national laws, there appears to be a growing consensus across
Europe about the priorities that the directive enshrines and the solutions
it prefers.
Last weekend, Klaus Topfer, Germany's environment minister, spoke about the
creation of a 'circulation economy' where the components of every
manufactured product are re-used at the end of their useful lives.
As environmental campaigners are fond of saying: 'We have to stop thinking
in terms of straight lines and start thinking in circles.'
The EC directive on the avoidance of packaging waste may be wobbly around
the edges but at least the outline of such a circle is beginning to take
shape.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Management: Armageddon view of European pricing -
Christopher Lorenz takes issue with a scaremongering study of company
profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pricing 'time bomb' is ticking under the profitability of many companies
in Europe. By depressing product and service prices across the European
Community to the lowest national level, it could threaten their very
existence if they do not act quickly.
That is the Armageddon view of European pricing expressed by two leading
German business academics, Professor Hermann Simon and Dr Eckhard Kucher.
They blame pressures to create common cross-border pricing which they say
are being exerted by parallel importers and strong retailers.
The only way out, they argue, is for companies smartly to raise prices in
their cheapest markets, or to quit those markets altogether. In an article
in the summer issue of the European Management Journal*, the two academics
say that each company must also establish a centrally-calculated 'European
price corridor' within which prices in each of its national markets must be
set.
There is, however, a much less nightmarish view of the situation. It has
been gaining ground among manufacturers since their panic a few years ago
over the approach of the European 'single market'. In a phrase, it is that
reports of the death of national price differentiation have been greatly
exaggerated.
This school of thought argues that the fear of standard European pricing
fails to take account of several important factors: that
Cross-border retailers are still few and far between, and that national
retailers show little interest in harmonising purchase prices;
The degree of parallel importing is still very limited;
The number of products in different European countries which are similar,
let alone identical, is also limited;
Identical products tend to be positioned very differently in different
countries;
Distribution and retail patterns, and therefore pricing pressures, vary
widely from market to market;
There is even a trend for different retailers within the same country to
demand varied packaging on identical products.
This view holds that the alarmist prophesies of European pricing consultants
are little more than scare-mongering tactics.
Yet Simon and Kucher have some strong scare stories, and they offer valuable
advice to those companies facing pressures to harmonise their selling prices
across Europe.
They tell, for example, of the 'horrific' situation confronted last year by
a leading Germanic manufacturer of consumer products, which sells through
large retailers, some of which have operations in several countries. Simon
and Kucher call the company Logo GmbH to preserve its identity.
Logo was told by its largest retailing customer to supply products in each
country at one European price - the lowest in Europe. This happened to be in
Portugal. Logo had no choice but to comply, and this slashed its prices by
an average of 20 per cent. The consequences for its profits were
'disastrous' - it incurred the first loss in its history.
Rather than starting hastily to align prices on to a low common European
level, companies should do everything they can quickly to raise levels in
low-price countries even if this hits market share, argue Simon and Kucher.
They propose a range of complex but objective techniques for assessing the
optimum price; such decisions are often taken too subjectively, they
complain. The techniques - including something called 'conjoint measurement'
 -also help analyse all the competitive and other trade-offs which must be
made to determine the ideal level and breadth of a 'European price
corridor'.
The academics have several particular points of advice:
Attack the problem dispassionately. Since most companies' turnover comes
mainly from large countries, nothing is more foolish than to undermine their
price levels through low prices in small countries. For instance, Logo would
have done far better to have abandoned the Portuguese market.
Price elasticity varies between countries more than many companies realise.
To ignore this in the quest for a uniform European price is to throw away
profit. Also, it may be better to tolerate a certain amount of parallel
imports.
Determination of a company's European price corridor is not only complex,
but also painful in organisational terms. Pricing decisions must be taken
centrally, even though this flies in the face of most companies' existing
decentralisation of pricing - and of profit responsibility.
'Because of these incompatibilities, European pricing is an area of
continuous conflict in many multinational companies.'

FT  22 JUL 92 / Jobs: What bosses' pay buys around the world - Survey shows
country-to-country differences in rewards for winning promotion up the ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHY all the fuss, then?' The question, hurled at the Jobs column during a
tour of contacts in the North-west of England, had two motives behind it.
One was genuine curiosity about a topic raised all too frequently in this
corner of the FT in recent weeks. It is the disappearance, perhaps for ever,
of large numbers of executive jobs and the consequent plight of thousands of
managers and higher rank specialists thrown out of work in the recession.
The other motive was the rude provincials' constant urge to mock Londoners
for assuming that whatever is happening around Britain's capital must also
be going on throughout the universe. For the Lancastrians swore they'd
scarcely been affected by the said phenomenon. Nor did they even try to hide
their schadenfreude in doing so.
All of which is a bit awkward for a hack who is not only almost one of their
fellow-countymen (having been born 200 yards over the Lancashire border into
Cheshire), but writes in an international paper. Can it be that most of you
out there have been equally bemused by my essays on the dire effects of
'delayering'?
I can hardly believe same is confined to south-east England. There is
evidence that it is being heavily felt in the United States, for example.
But I'd be glad of advice from readers elsewhere.
M
EANWHILE - to prove that the Jobs column has not become totally
London-parochial - to the table below which gives pay indicators for
non-delayered managers in 24 countries.
As in previous years, the figures come from the surveys made by Employment
Conditions Abroad, which keeps watch over pay and perks and so on around the
world on behalf of some 700 international groups subscribing to its
services. Anyone wanting more data thereon should contact Ian Luke of ECA at
15 Britten St, London SW3 3TY; tel 071-351 7151, fax 071-351 9396.
My extracts refer to four ranks of executives in each land. They range
upwards from a junior and a middle manager in a sizeable division of a
group, to the head of a function such as marketing and the chief of the
division itself. In each case the table gives two sets of figures. First
comes the typical gross salary, including any bonus that is regular as
distinct from varying with performance or the like. The second figure
translates the salary into buying power.
To calculate it, ECA starts by reducing the gross sum to net pay by
deducting the tax and like charges standard for a native of the country
who's married with two dependent children. The net is then turned into
purchasing power by adjusting for price variances shown by living-cost
comparisons. Unfortunately, because of problems in devising a consistent
international measure of housing costs, no account is taken of that
important outlay.
Although the salary surveys reflect the position at the start of this year,
the other currencies have been converted to sterling at the exchange rates
in force at the end of the first week of this month. Since no information
was forthcoming on the chief of the division in Japan, the countries are
ranked on the buying power of the head of function.
Inevitably, the figures are at best a loose approximation of the real state
of pay. They are nevertheless as sound as any others available, and shed new
light on differences between countries.
For instance, in giving pride of place to Switzerland, the ECA findings
clash with two separate surveys I reported in May and June, both showing the
Swiss had fallen behind the Spanish, French and Germans. That may well be
because the other two covered higher ranks, including chief executives, and
took account of variable bonuses besides salaries.
One rare feature of ECA's study is that it reflects country-to-country
variances in the extra buying power typically gained by winning promotion
through the four ranks listed. The greatest reward for same is in Hong Kong,
whose division chief is nearly 3 1/2 times as well off as the junior
manager. The least is in Norway, with a differential between the two of only
about 75 per cent.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Radical shake-up at TUC urged by 'super-unions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THOROUGH rationalisation of the Trades Union Congress, promised for years
but never delivered, has come a step closer.
The AEEU engineering and electrical union has called for a 'radical
reassessment' of the organisation in a motion tabled for this year's TUC
congress.
Leaders of the growing number of 'super-unions' complain that the TUC
duplicates services they provide. They believe the cost of the organisation
can no longer be justified while trade union membership is falling.
They also say that its role as the labour movement's alternative civil
service, and lobbyist of government, has become obsolete.
The AEEU says resources should be concentrated on four areas: health and
safety, education and training, European and international lobbying and
co-ordination of union submissions to government.
The TGWU general union, Britain's biggest, has also submitted a motion
calling for a refocusing of the TUC's role. Congress is likely to consider
amalgamating the two motions.
Previous moves to reform the TUC have been frustrated by the inability of
union leaders to agree over which of its functions should be dropped. But
the Conservative general election victory and the recession have lent
urgency to the debate. The TUC is already reducing costs, mainly through job
cuts.
Almost 40 jobs, out of 250, are being phased out but even after this
reduction staff numbers will still be at 1979 levels, when total trade union
membership was more than four million higher than it is today.
It is understood the TUC accepts the need for reform and does not view the
moves by the AEEU and the TGWU as unhelpful.
The AEEU emphasises its motion should not be interpreted as a obituary for
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary. The TGWU's motion was seen by some
as a direct attack on Mr Willis's leadership.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Block vote is poser for Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the new Labour leader, confronts his first party management
dilemma today as the national executive committee meets to decide whether to
cut the trade unions' conference block vote from 90 per cent to 70 per cent.
Under agreements reached before the election, the change was due to go ahead
in 1993 after final approval at this October's annual conference in
Blackpool. Some senior union leaders are now suggesting that the issue
should be shelved to allow proposals for comprehensive reforms to the
party's union links to be presented as a package next year.
Critics of that suggestion are countering that a postponement would allow
the unions to maintain their present voting strength in 1993 at the very
time when crucial ballots will be held on their future powers and influence.
The quandary represents the first significant management difficulty for Mr
Smith since being elected by an overwhelming 91 per cent vote last Saturday.
The NEC meeting will be the first he has attended.
If the reduction in the block vote is postponed, Mr Smith risks being
accused of slowing the process of reform in favour of the more conservative
unions. Yet if he supports the cut, he risks jeopardising the goodwill of
union leaders that he might need in the future.
Aware of the delicacy of the issue, the newly formed review committee into
the party's union links failed to make a recommendation on how the NEC
should proceed when it met for the first time on Monday.
The review committee, chaired by Mr John Evans MP, is scheduled to have
drawn up its proposals early in the new year, to allow a thorough debate
before the 1993 conference takes place.
An emergency economic programme to cut unemployment should be agreed at
today's cabinet meeting, Mr Gordon Brown, said yesterday, Alison Smith
writes.
Mr Brown, who is expected to become shadow chancellor after Labour's
frontbench elections tomorrow, called on the government to use the UK
presidency of the European Community to press for co-ordinated efforts to
achieve economic recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, last
night called for the setting up of two new national police units to fight
terrorism and serious crime.
Delivering the Police Foundation lecture in London, he said there was an
urgent need for such units, with a remit outside the jurisdiction of police
authorities.
The national anti-terrorist unit he proposed would provide a single police
and intelligence focal point for liaison with the RUC, police in the Irish
Republic and forces and intelligence services in Europe and North America.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Debt collectors to seek new legal role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEBT recovery companies are to seek approval to represent their clients in
legal cases which are usually handled by solicitors.
About 80 debt recovery companies met in Birmingham on Monday to launch the
iniative and to form an Institute of Licensed Debt Practioners as a
professional organisation supervising debt collection practices.
The organisation will ask Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, for
authority to launch a legal service so that clients can choose between the
traditional route through solicitors and employing a qualified debt recovery
company representative.
Debt recovery companies see similarities between their position and
conveyancers'. It is no longer necessary to employ a solicitor to handle the
legal details of a property purchase.
The Lord Chancellor's department said Lord Mackay would soon issue a
consultation paper on the way in which civil enforcement agents - bailiffs
and sheriffs - go about their business and whether any changes in the law
are necessary.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Sotheby's will sell Thurn und Taxis treasures: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S is to sell works of art from the collection of the Prince of Thurn
und Taxis - one of the finest private art collections in the world - and
hopes thereby to begin to restore its flagging fortunes.
Johannes, 11th Prince von Thurn and Taxis, died suddenly in December 1990,
leaving a nine-year-old heir, Prince Albert. Death duties have forced the
family to value its collection and to sell works of art, which are expensive
to maintain and offer no income, rather than the family's land and
industrial holdings.
The collection is mainly housed at Regensburg in Bavaria, and incorporates
art and furnishings from the 25 castles the family disposed of between 1920
and 1970. The Thurn und Taxis fortune is traced back to the 15th century,
when Franz von Taxis established the first postal service in the Holy Roman
Empire.
The first auction, to be held in Geneva on November 16 and 17, will include
jewels, silver, and works of art. It is expected to raise Pounds 8m,
although with the art market depressed, Sotheby's has set very modest
estimates. The actual total raised for works of exceptional provenance and
rarity may be much higher.
Among the most desirable lots are two rare 18th-century diamond and emerald
pendants bearing the insignia of the Order of the Golden Fleece, valued at
Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 100,000, and the pearl and diamond tiara
commissioned by Napoleon III on his marriage to the Empress Eugenie in 1853.
It is composed of precious stones and pearls from the French State Treasury
and carries a conservative estimate of Pounds 100,000.
A jewelled and hardstone snuff box created for Frederick the Great about
1760 is estimated at Pounds 800,000. Among the silver, the most expensive
item should be a silver gilt ewer and salver made in Augsburg around 1740 by
Johann Christoph Stenglin: it carries an estimate of up to Pounds 280,000.
Sotheby's expects to organise more sales from the collection over the next
few years: the extent of the family's tax demands have yet to be finalised.
There might also be a wish to raise money for Prince Albert's two sisters. A
sum of Pounds 40m has been estimated for the eventual realisation of the
dispersal, although the 500-room castle at Regensburg will remain full of
treasures.
At Sotheby's in London yesterday, an auction of English literature totalled
Pounds 589,655 but was 37 per cent unsold, confirming that the recession is
affecting sections of the art market traditionally dominated by serious
collectors and immune to setbacks.

FT  22 JUL 92 / State loan urged for Mersey barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in the Mersey barrage are to press the government to change its
decision not to back the Pounds 1bn plan for an electricity-generating dam
between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tides.
They believe the government has misunderstood the project's finances and say
there would ultimately be no cost to public funds, instead possibly a
profit. They blame ministerial changes since the general election and the
absorption of the Department of Energy into the Department of Trade and
Industry for the government decision.
If it went ahead, the barrage would raise about 30 per cent of its
construction costs in one group of loans, based on electricity revenues of
3p a unit.
Shareholders want the remaining Pounds 700m as another group of loans, but
underwritten by the non-fossil-fuel levy - the money added to electricity
bills to develop rene-wable sources of energy.
All or part of the Pounds 700m might come from the pool of money the levy
has already built up, or by charging an additional 4p a unit after
generating starts. In the latter case, such assured revenue would mean the
Pounds 700m could be borrowed commercially.
Whatever route were taken, the barrage company would repay the money to the
government. 'We are asking for a non-fossil-fuel levy loan, not a
non-fossil-fuel grant,' Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of Mersey Barrage,
said yesterday.
Repayment would be slowest if the 4p a unit route was followed, beginning
when the barrage was 20 years old. At that point, the barrage would be
starting to make large profits as a result of its owners' depreciating it
completely in the first 25 years of its 120-year life.
Mr James McCormack, a Tarmac executive who is also general manager of the
barrage company, said repayment could begin earlier if all or part of the
Pounds 700m came directly from the non-fossil-fuel levy fund, as that would
save on commercial loan charges.
A reasonable rate of return would also be paid to the government, probably
at about 5 per cent a year.
Another barrage company director, Sir Peter Morrison, a former employment
and energy minister, told shareholders the present public-sector spending
round was the toughest for 14 years and may have conditioned ministerial
thinking.
The barrage needs Pounds 14m to proceed to final design and resolve
objections from shipping interests about navigation. Any government
contribution to those costs would come from Treasury funds and may have been
why ministers balked, asking for the project to be shelved.
Sir Desmond said the company had until November before shareholders had to
decide whether to go further on their own. The time would be used to
persuade the government to reconsider.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Owner-managers' optimism faulted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES that are owner-managed expect to achieve an average 4.8 per cent
growth over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 900 businesses
conducted by Mori for accountants Ernst and Young.
Such confidence by owner-managers reveals a 'disturbing expectation gap,'
given economic forecasts of zero or negative growth over the same period,
Ernst and Young said.
The firm urged companies to be realistic: 'We suspect that the estimates are
based on hope rather than hard evidence. Forecasts that cannot be supported
will undermine confidence among companies' financiers.'
A total of 63 per cent of owner-managed businesses thought the economy would
improve over the next year and 66 per cent said the election result had
increased confidence. The companies surveyed all had annual sales of between
Pounds 5m and Pounds 100m - those with sales of more than Pounds 50m were
most likely to think the economy would improve.
In spite of forecasts for growth, businesses expected staffing levels to
remain constant, suggesting that productivity remains below desired levels,
according to Ernst and Young. 'If output does not increase sufficiently, or
possibly even if it stays constant, staffing levels could be reduced
further,' the survey found.
The majority of businesses (68 per cent) said their financial goals had
remained unchanged over the past six months and they had no plans to raise
additional finance. Ernst and Young questioned whether businesses would be
able to increase output from existing resources.
In general, the businesses surveyed found their banks helpful, although
banks in the Midlands were seen as less helpful than elsewhere.
Manufacturing companies also viewed their bankers as less helpful than
businesses in the retail, distribution and service sectors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S worst wave of terrorist bombings in 12 years is likely to ensure
widespread support for an 'armed strike' called for today by the Sendero
Luminoso guerrilla group, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. Messages painted on
shanty-town walls are warning inhabitants of Lima and key provincial cities
they risk death if they attempt to turn up for work.
In the past few days Sendero has intensified its campaign of terror in the
capital. On Monday night a car bomb wrecked Lima's Institute for Liberty and
Democracy, killing at least four passers-by and a security guard.
The institute, headed by Mr Hernando de Soto, a former presidential adviser,
had earlier published far-reaching proposals for reform of Peru's electoral
system in advance of elections called for November 22.
Last Thursday night a 600kg car-bomb devastated part of Miraflores, an
affluent suburb in Lima. Seventeen people died and more than 100 suffered
severe injuries. Hundreds of homes were evacuated, and 80 shops and a dozen
hotels were badly damaged.
The Miraflores attack was the first in which Sendero has targeted the
capital's civilian population, although police stations continue to be its
prime target.
Another seven bombings in different areas of Lima the same night highlighted
the guerrillas' capacity to act at will - even in a city under a state of
emergency and with a night-time vehicle curfew in force.
So far the military-backed government has made no response to demands by the
population for more effective anti-terrorist action.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Swiss entry threatens IMF balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE delicate balance in the International Monetary Fund between developing
countries and the industrialised world is being shaken by a dispute over
Switzerland's entry into the Washington-based organisation.
Switzerland has for decades refused to join the IMF or the World Bank
because of its strict policy of neutrality, but in May the Swiss government
won a national plebiscite in favour of IMF membership.
Developing countries complain, however, that Switzerland is now reneging on
a pledge made last year by Mr Otto Stich, its finance minister, not to claim
a seat on the IMF's board to the detriment of developing countries.
Diplomats in Washington say Switzerland's aggressive drive to obtain a seat
could displace from the board the representative of a group of mostly
French-speaking African nations.
Swiss Finance Ministry officials deny they are reneging on their pledge, but
say the IMF must deal with the inevitable shake-up resulting from the entry
of a country with its financial weight, as well as the republics of the
former Soviet Union.
IMF members with the largest quotas - the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan and
Saudi Arabia - hold permanent board seats in their own rights. Other
countries must form constituencies to elect the remaining 16 executive
directors, with votes apportioned according to each country's IMF quota.
If Switzerland forms a constituency it would have enough votes to squeeze
out a constituency currently composed of 24 African and Indian Ocean
countries, most of them Francophone. Switzerland's quota alone, about 2 per
cent of the IMF total, would be more than the 1.99 per cent mustered by the
Francophone countries.
This would upset the board's balance by adding, in the view of developing
countries, another voice for the economic policies espoused by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based
grouping of 24 industrialised nations, including Switzerland.
Swiss finance ministry officials confirm they have had contacts with other
countries, including Turkey, Poland and several former Soviet republics,
about forming a constituency. They are optimistic one will be set up by the
end of the month.
The officials acknowledge they promised not to eject a less developed
country from the board; indeed, they say it would be impossible as there is
a convention requiring African groups to control at least two IMF seats.
But they also made clear their belief that a country the size of Switzerland
should be represented. 'We have written to the rules committee saying we
want a seat, but as newcomers we do not feel we should propose solutions. It
is up to them,' an official said.
One proposed solution would be to add another seat to the executive board,
which is already due to grow to 23 with the addition of a Russian director.
While OECD countries generally feel Russia would side with other borrowing
nations, some developing countries believe it will attempt to behave like a
superpower.
But several leading countries - including the US, Japan and Canada - have
indicated they would oppose creation of yet another seat for Europe, which
already has three permanent and four elected executive directors.
Between them they have enough votes to block the creation of a new seat.

FT  22 JUL 92 / OECD jobless total heads for 10-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in the industrialised countries is expected to rise to 30m in
1992, its highest level since 1983, and will not start falling significantly
until well into 1993, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development said yesterday.
The rise in OECD unemployment from 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent since 1990 has
been less severe than following the second oil-price shock in 1979 - except
in Australia, Finland and Sweden - 'but still represents a disappointing
reversal following several years of falling unemployment', said the
organisation.
Unemployment is expected to remain at 9.4 per cent in the EC until 1993; in
the US it is expected to rise to 7.1 per cent this year before falling to
6.5 per cent next year. The OECD, in its annual Employment Outlook,
reiterated that OECD labour ministers should not be tempted to reverse
recent moves away from passive support for the unemployed to active measures
that improve the self-sufficiency of individuals and the functioning of
labour markets.
Wage growth slowed the most in North America, Scandinavia and Australia
where some of the fastest rises in unemployment have been occurring. Labour
productivity growth in the OECD held up in 1991 despite the fall in economic
activity. In the UK the rise in unit labour costs is expected to fall to 3.5
per cent this year and 2 per cent next year. However, the OECD finds little
evidence of greater wage flexibility as a result of the European Monetary
System.
The OECD highlights several peculiarities of the recession, including a
large rise in white-collar unemployment and, consequently, the narrowing of
regional unemployment differences (except in Canada and France). The OECD
also points out that a high proporeen in non-standard employment - mainly
part-time - which are less advantageous than permanent, full-time, jobs.
Other points highlighted in the report include:
Continuing high 'non-employment' rates, averaging almost 50 per cent for
women and 25 per cent for men over the 1980s. Reductions in unemployment
have often occurred at the cost of higher inactivity - or vice versa. Over
the 1980s relatively few countries lowered both labour force inactivity and
unemployment. Female labour force participation rates rose during the 1980s,
but in most countries less rapidly than in the previous decade.
A sharp decline in the labour force participation rate of the over 55s,
representing an increasing waste in labour potential. Twenty years ago, in
most OECD countries between 35 and 50 per cent of men over 55 were in the
labour force, now the figure is between 20 and 35 per cent. Japan remains
exceptionally high at 60 per cent and Italy at the other extreme on 11 per
cent. The OECD is critical of this development and says pension and social
security arrangements should be reviewed to give older people greater
flexibility.
After a long-term decline, self-employment has grown to one in eight of the
non-agricultural workforce, reflecting not only the development of
entrepreneurship but also structural changes in labour markets.
Commenting on the rise of unemployment in Central and eastern Europe to 4m
earlier this year, the OECD says a further wave of job-shedding is to be
expected.
This may weaken the social consensus for market-based reforms although
unemployment social insurance schemes now exist in all countries. The
implementation of active labour market policies has been limited by
budgetary restraints and should be further decentralised.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Politics fuels China's worries about financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JULY 4 last year, after 'friendly discussions' between British and
Chinese officials, a memorandum of understanding giving the go-ahead for
Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport and related projects was
initialled.
What exists now is a memorandum but no understanding. If the complaints
about the project levelled by Mr Chen Zou'er - Beijing's Number 2 official
on Hong Kong matters - represent China's true concerns then there is an
awful lot more talking to do before agreement is reached.
The two main components of Asia's biggest infrastructure project are the
airport itself and a new railway line. Kai Tek, the colony's current
international airport, will reach capacity limits in 1994 or 1995 and the
new airport, sited at Chek Lap Kok, north of Lantau island, will provide for
expansion through to 2040.
The railway will offer a high speed service from the airport to the urban
areas of Hong Kong and will help relieve congestion on the busiest part of
its existing network.
The need for the project is agreed by both sides but, bluster aside, China
appears to have serious reservations. These are not only about the total
financing bill, but also about the financial viability of the planned
railway and various financial incentives the Hong Kong government plans to
offer the key corporations building the project.
Certainly the cost of the airport has risen. In less than a year it rose
nearly 14 per cent in real terms to HKDollars 112.2bn from HKDollars 98.6bn
and threatens to reach HKDollars 175.3bn in current terms by the time it is
completed.
In addition, the government is prepared to stump up HKDollars 20.3bn in
'callable equity' - HKDollars 7.8bn for the Airport Authority and HKDollars
12.5bn for the MTRC in the event of project delay or poor economic
circumstances. But the Chinese regard it as a contingent liability on the
future government of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong officials say these concerns are either soluble or unfounded. The
airport will be self-financing by day one; the MTRC has already convinced
bankers to back the project. However, they say, every time they raise
specifics the Chinese fall back on generalities.
Nearly three weeks ago, China made an offer to the UK. It could go ahead and
award a HKDollars 8bn-HKDollars 10bn contract for the preparation of the
airport site, while keeping open talks on all other matters.
Last Thursday the UK made a counter offer. Approve the financing for the
airport and leave to later discussion China's concerns about the railway.
'Provided we can do a deal on the whole airport package the issue of
callable equity is something we can deal with. But we are not prepared to
put that offer on the table and have them come back with four or five other
claims,' said one senior official.
What lies behind the official's concern is that neither he, nor anyone in
Hong Kong familiar with the discussions, believes finance is the real
sticking point anyway. They think China is withholding its consent because
it is concerned that Mr Chris Patten, the colony's new governor, will
include the liberal Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats, the stand-bearers of
greater participatory democracy, in his cabinet. Democratic 'contamination'
from Hong Kong both before and after 1997 keeps Beijing's communist rulers
awake at night.
So far Mr Patten has kept his counsel; he has taken the propaganda war to
the Chinese, never failing to point out that the airport is in Hong Kong's
and southern China's interest.
However he is aware that he has things to do on the political front,
including the reshaping of his cabinet. The day he opens the next session of
the legislature - October 7 - may prove critical for the airport as well.

HOPES for an early agreement on financial arrangements for Hong Kong's
HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.6bn) airport and related projects collapsed
yesterday when China accused the Hong Kong government of 'intimidation' and
misleading the colony and the international community about the project.
Chen Zuo'er, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office of
the State Council, said Sir David Ford, the colony's chief secretary, and Mr
K Y Yeung, its treasury secretary, had 'wantonly' disclosed the content of
recent Sino-British talks on the airport's financing.
His intervention follows comments made this week by Jiang Zemin, secretary
general of the Chinese Communist Party, who reportedly accused Britain of
complicating talks about airport finance.
Addressing a seminar last Friday Sir David and Mr Yeung outlined China's
concerns about some details of the financial package. These included the
deferral of dividends by two public corporations responsible for the project
and measures to provide them with more finance in the event of difficulties.
Britain and China have been in discussions for the past three months about
the airport. Although they appear to be about finance, Hong Kong and British
officials believe that China - which is concerned about political
developments in the colony - is using the issue to exercise leverage over Mr
Chris Patten, the colony's new governor.
It now seems likely that, in the absence of a Chinese back down, Beijing
will withhold its approval for the finance until the autumn when Mr Patten
is due to open the local legislature and outline his plans for the
government.
If the project is delayed this long it is unlikely that Britain will be able
to complete the airport before June 1997, as agreed between the prime
ministers of Britain and China last September.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Spratly dispute over shadows Asean meeting
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S recent reaffirmation of its claim to the disputed Spratly islands in
the South China Sea overshadowed the start of a meeting of the Association
of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) in Manila yesterday. Ministers expressed
'grave concern' about the threat to regional security.
'We cannot any more postpone the urgent necessity to seriously seek a
solution,' President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines said in a speech to open
the meeting of Asean foreign ministers, 'lest the unsettled situation lead
to perilous developments'.
Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian minister, said his country viewed the
matter with 'grave concern'.
The ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - raised the Spratlys issue at a meeting
yesterday with Qian Qichen, their Chinese counterpart.
They also spoke of their worries about the progress of the United Nations
peace plan in Cambodia, where the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge faction is
refusing to disarm its guerrillas.
Most Asean ministers emphasised security concerns and gave second place to
economic co-operation.
The Spratlys, a scattered group of islets, atolls and coral reefs, have
become a particularly sensitive issue since May, when China granted an oil
exploration concession to Crestone Energy of the US in an area claimed by
Vietnam.
Six countries have laid claim to all or some of the Spratlys (China, Taiwan,
Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines), but China passed a law in
February reaffirming sovereignty over the islands of the South China Sea and
reserving the right to use military force.
In his meeting with Asean yesterday, Qian reiterated China's view that
territorial differences should be 'shelved' in favour of joint development
of the area, but he apparently did not explain how this fitted in with
China's recent actions.
According to Filipino officials, he suggested a security dialogue with Asean
to enhance trust and rejected accusations that China was seeking to fill a
power vacuum left by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the closure of US
bases in the Philippines.
'It is not necessary for any country to fill up this so-called vacuum,' Qian
said on Monday. He also told the Asean ministers that the dispute was being
exaggerated, and that it would be better not to discuss it in public to
avoid increasing tension. In 1988, China sank three Vietnamese naval vessels
and killed 72 Vietnamese in a battle over the Spratlys.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community and Brazil agreed yesterday to try again to resolve
differences over anti-subsidy duties imposed by Brazil on imports of EC milk
powder.
The EC had asked for conciliation by the subsidies committee of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which met yesterday, as a preliminary
step towards calling for an independent panel investigation. The committee
asked the two sides to continue consultations on a mutually acceptable
solution, but if these fail the EC can ask for a panel after 30 days.
The Community claims Brazil imposed the provisional 31-52 per cent
countervailing duties in April without observing procedures laid down under
Gatt's subsidies code and without establishing that the imports had in fact
injured Brazilian producers.
Brazil yesterday denied the claims, and said it would supply to Brussels
evidence on subsidies by the EC, the harm done to domestic industry and the
link between the two.
The row is yet another example of the trade friction generated by failure to
complete the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks, which includes a revised version
of the subsidies code. Brussels claims Brazil, and also Argentina, are
flouting existing rules because they are angered by the Uruguay Round
impasse over farm trade reform.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY
Membership of the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism since 1990 has
been uncontested in Italy and has been the country's sole consistent aspect
of economic policy. The new Amato government would be most reluctant to
consider realignment until assured of backing from the main political
parties for its new emergency budget and until after 1993 budget outlines
have been prepared.
FRANCE
Government would fiercely resist realignment which revalued D-Mark, having
fought over past decade to hold policy of monetary and budgetary rigour.
Inflation has stayed below German levels for past 13 months, and France
feels well on way to earning as much credibility as Germany in the debate on
Europe's monetary future. It has no interest in surrendering these gains,
least of all when there is no economic need.
GERMANY
Preoccupations, manifested by actions of Bundesbank, have a twin focus:
D-Mark's role as guarantor of German economic wellbeing, and currency's
anchor function in EMS. Argument runs that, if D-Mark unstable then so is
EMS. Bank says recent discount rate rise intended to stabilise monetary
growth while causing as little upset as possible. Officials imply what
others do is up to them, offering no judgment whether realignment necessary
or desirable.
PORTUGAL
Having only recently joined the exchange rate mechanism to promote its
programme for EC economic convergence, Portugal favours the status quo. It
sees no reason for realignment, emphasising that current tensions are not
due to the escudo. The currency entered the 6 per cent wide band of the ERM
in April and has remained at the top of the EMS grid since.
SPAIN
The government denies rumours that it is pressing for realignment and
insists interest rates will remain high to stall inflation. Spain's new
fiscal package will save Pta326bn (Pounds 1.781m) in tax increases and
budget cuts. Central bank intervention allows controlled peseta slide
against D-Mark closer to narrow band parity. Spain may take advantage of
realignment but does not want to precipitate it.
UNITED KINGDOM
Debate growing in Britain about membership of the ERM. There are fears that
membership, should Germany again tighten monetary policy, would force the UK
to raise base rates and risk pushing the country towards economic slump, or
otherwise see sterling come under pressure in the ERM.
Nevertheless, the government says it firmly committed to keep sterling at
central parity of DM2.95.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of jobs in one of east Germany's most blighted regions are hanging
on a company's claim to have developed an environmentally safe refrigerator.
DKK Scharfenstein, east Germany's sole producer of refrigerators, claims its
'eco-refrigerator' is a technological breakthrough because its compressor
operates with a propane-butane mix instead of the standard
chlorofluorocarbons, which damage the ozone layer.
However, the company has already been accused of adopting desperate measures
with its claimed breakthrough because it faces imminent demise. It lost
DM85m (Pounds 29.3m) last year on turnover of DM71m and the Treuhand
privatisation agency has appointed a liquidator.
Once flourishing sales of refrigerators in west Germany plummeted after
monetary union in 1990 and the collapse of the Soviet market for
compressors.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Treuhand spokesman, said the Treuhand was paying a
subsidy of DM50 for each of the 200,000 refrigerators DKK produces annually.
DKK would have to cut its 1,900 workforce down to 600 to become profitable,
he said.
The west German Electro-technical Federation (ZVEI) called the new
refrigerator a 'hoax', arguing that the propane-butane mixture was not only
inefficient but liable to explode, raising awkward questions of product
liability. It also claimed that the refrigerator used 40 per cent more
electricity than conventional models. DKK says the gap is only 20 per cent
and narrowing.
However, Mr Wolfgang Lohbeck, of the Greenpeace environmental organisation,
accused an 'unholy alliance' of the west German electro-technical and
chemical industries of rejecting an ecologically sound product in order to
protect profits.
The Treuhand, caught in the middle, said the liquidator had commissioned an
expert opinion on the new refrigerator which, if positive, could mean
hundreds of saved DKK jobs.

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN telecommunications network, Deutsche Telekom, is to become the
'people's share of the nineties' in a privatisation programme unveiled
yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister.
The government will also sell off its remaining 51 per cent stake in the
Lufthansa airline 'as soon as possible'.
Announcing plans to press on with the government's long term aim of
withdrawing completely from business and industry with the sale of 'a good
two dozen' state concerns, Mr Waigel warned, however, that privatising
Telekom would need a change in the constitution.
Private advisers had told him that 100 per cent privatisation of Telekom
could raise up to DM70bn (Pounds 24.1bn), but he offered no estimates of the
total the government hoped to earn from the sell-off.
It was unclear yesterday when substantial funds would start flowing in. As
the Economics Ministry pointed out, the current state of the stock markets
was 'not exactly ideal' for floating the loss-making Lufthansa.
Bonn also intends to hold on to a 25.1 per cent blocking minority stake in
the airline for as long as competing enterprises in other countries remain
under state control.
The last wave of privatisations, completed in 1987 and 1988, when Bonn sold
its remaining holdings in motor manufacturer Volkswagen and the Veba and
Viag conglomerates, yielded more than DM10bn for the federal coffers.
Mr Waigel's latest offering includes the 49 per cent federal stake in
Nebenbetriebe der Bundesautobahnen, which runs 670 motorway petrol stations
and restaurants.
The Berliner Industriebank, which specialises in loans for businesses in the
capital, will be sold before the end of next year. Other businesses on the
list include the operating company for the canal connecting the rivers
Rhine, Main and Danube, house builders, and a holding company involved in
property, waste disposal, warehousing and transport.
The minister's proposals, approved by the cabinet yesterday, follow last
week's announcement of partial privatisation of the federal railways in a
project due to start at the end of next year.
Mr Waigel also confirmed yesterday plans to sell off surplus land and
buildings currently owned by the western Bundesbahn.
The government currently holds direct or indirect stakes in more than 400
commercial concerns, including transport, travel agencies, hotels and the
Bonn press club.

FT  22 JUL 92 / Brittan presses Commission for backing on Nestle bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, will today argue that
dangerous loopholes could be created in EC competition policy unless the
Commission backs him and approves Nestle's bid for Perrier, the French
mineral water group.
Approval of the Swiss food group's FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.6bn) bid - and of
the strict conditions proposed by Sir Leon - would extend Brussels'
anti-trust role to allow the examination of situations in which two or more
players dominate a market.
Sir Leon believes a restrictive interpretation of the 1990 EC merger rules
would leave the Community market prey to such large-scale duopolies and
oligopolies. Neither the Commission nor member states would have the power
to restrict Community-scale mergers which created or strengthened such
situations.
Some of Sir Leon's colleagues, as well as competition lawyers and the
Commission's own legal service, are concerned because the merger rules do
not give Brussels explicit power over oligopolies.
Commission competition officials argue that such cases are not excluded, and
point out that the US, UK and France have all interpreted similar clauses in
their merger control legislation to cover oligopolies.
The Commission is set to impose strict conditions on the deal, aimed at
reducing the potential duopoly of the French market held by the enlarged
group and by BSN, the French food company.
Nestle/Perrier will have to sell eight mineral water brands to a third
buyer. The named brands for sale will include Saint Yorre, a sparkling
water, Thonon, a still mineral water, and the spring water Pierval. Volvic,
one of the largest brands, will be sold to BSN, as originally planned, but
neither that deal, nor completion of the merger with Perrier will be
authorised until the Commission has approved the sale of the other brands.
There will also be an explicit ban on Nestle re-acquiring the sold brands
within 10 years, an obligation to inform the Commission of further purchases
in the French bottled water market, and conditions aimed at preventing
closer business co-operation between Nestle and BSN.
The EC Commission is likely to approve nearly Dollars 1bn of state aid
planned for Iberia, the Spanish state airline, despite Sir Leon Brittan's
objections.
Last week, Mr Karel Van Miert, the transport commissioner responsible for
examining airline aid, recommended approval of a FFr1.25bn investment in Air
France by BNP, the state-owned bank.

A SHARP exchange between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations

EC's peace efforts.
The disagreement is likely to fuel the arguments of those, such as France,
who want the EC peace conference to be expanded into a wider international
forum under the umbrella of the UN.
Following the abortive ceasefire agreement reached by the three warring
factions in Bosnia under Lord Carrington's presidency in London last Friday,
Mr Boutros Ghali has criticised both the EC for failing to consult him and
the UN Security Council for endorsing the EC's ceasefire plan.
In a letter addressed to Security Council members on Monday, the UN
secretary-general also expressed 'serious misgivings' on the substance of
the plan, the most important element of which was its provision for placing
the heavy weapons of the combatants under UN supervision.
Mr Boutros-Ghali's main complaint was that the UN was given too little time
to implement the plan.
He said no UN representative had participated in the London talks and he was
not aware of the EC seeking any technical advice from the UN before the
agreement was concluded. Moreover, Mr Boutros-Ghali said he had told Lord
Carrington by telephone last Friday that the EC proposal on UN peacekeeping
duties was 'not realistic'.
'I now find myself in the invidious position of having to advise the Council
on the implementation of a mandate behind which the Council has already
thrown its political support,' Mr Boutros-Ghali said.
Though the Security Council endorsed the London agreement last Friday, the
plan drawn up by UN officials has not yet been approved by the
secretary-general.
The UN secretary-general's criticisms appear to have taken Lord Carrington
completely by surprise.
When he told Mr Boutros-Ghali of the London peace deal, the UN chief said he
was 'absolutely delighted', Lord Carrington said in a radio interview
yesterday.
Mr Boutros-Ghali's outburst clearly reflects the frustration he feels at the
inadequacy of the resources put at his disposal in Yugoslavia and his
irritation with the lack of understanding by EC and Security Council leaders
of the practical difficulties involved in putting their political decisions
into effect.
As far as UN officials are concerned, such difficulties could be avoided if
the whole peace negotiations were handled by the world organisation.
Lord Carrington yesterday said he was 'discouraged' after Yugoslav and
Serbian leaders rejected an international conference on Kosovo, the mostly
ethnic Albanian province in southern Serbia, writes Laura Silber in
Belgrade.
After talks in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, with Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Serbia, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of
Yugoslavia, Lord Carrington said he was 'increasingly worried over these
last few months about Kosovo'.
He went on: 'President Milosevic said he was very willing to negotiate with
the Kosovans, although he did not think there was much to negotiate about
because they have all their human rights under the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). But he was not prepared for a conference
in which the EC peacekeeping conference was involved on the grounds that it
was purely a Serbian matter which affected their sovereignty.'
However, Lord Carrington was encouraged that leaders from Krajina,
self-proclaimed Serb regions of Croatia which are now UN peacekeeping zones,
had agreed to negotiations on their status without making independence a
condition.

FRENCH dockers at two of the country's 29 ports, Marseille and St Malo, have
still to reach agreement with employers on implementing a new labour law,
the Marine Affairs ministry said yesterday, Reuter report from Paris.
Dockers from St Malo were due to meet officials later yesterday to discuss
stalling points on implementing the new law which makes dockers salaried
workers, a ministry official said.
But dockers at Marseille, France's largest port and at the front line of a
long and bitter campaign of strikes by the country's 8,211 dockers, were not
due to hold a similar meeting.
Talks between the CGT union representatives and employers in Marseille broke
down on Saturday in disagreement over the percentage of workers to be kept
on as casual workers.
Ports failing to agree a deal by last Wednesday were theoretically not
eligible for a Ffr2bn (Dollars 400m) package from government and employers.

FT  21 JUL 92 / French try to put the fizz back into champagne sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE troubled champagne industry is trying to beat the recession in a way
which seems guaranteed to please its Bacchanalian customers - by improving
the quality of its product.
Champagne sales rose rapidly in the self-indulgent climate of the 1980s, but
the industry has since suffered severely from the impact of the recession on
important export markets, notably the US and the UK.
The industry is now taking action by tightening the specifications for
champagne production. The quantity of grapes required to produce champagne
is being increased from 150 kg a hectolitre to 160 kg. At the same time the
amount of grapes harvested is being reduced to a maximum of 10,400 kg a
hectare from up to 12,000 kg in the previous year.
These new restrictions will, or so the champagne producers hope, address the
demand problem by limiting production. They also ought to improve the
quality of champagne going on to the market. The hitch appears to be price.
The industry hopes to be able to charge more when its new improved product
goes on sale in 1994. It will then face the challenge of convincing its
customers to pay more for their champagne in a weak marketplace.
In the first quarter of this year, the volume of champagne exports fell by
22 per cent against the first three months of 1991, when the market was
destabilised by the Gulf War, from 12.2m bottles to 9.516m bottles. The UK
market performed particularly poorly with sales of 1.8m bottles in the first
quarter, compared with 4.5m in the same period three years ago. Even the
French market is weak, with sales down 3 per cent in the first quarter of
1992.

FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Kohl 'the key' to farm deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY's Chancellor Helmut Kohl is the 'key' to brokering a farm trade
accord enabling a breakthrough in the long-delayed Uruguay Round of talks on
world trade liberalisation, according to Sir Christopher Prout, European
Parliament vice-president.
Noting the Uruguay round was now 'in crisis,' Sir Christopher told a
conference in London on free trade it was 'absolutely crucial' for the
west's recession-troubled economies to clinch a deal, and that Chancellor
Kohl was the only European leader able to press the French government to
make compromises on cuts in subsidised farm exports.
He conspicuously omitted Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President,
as a potential broker, presumably because of 'institutional deadlock in the
EC system itself' over farm reform. Also omitted was Mr John Major, prime
minister of UK, which is currently occupying the EC presidency. Mr Major
failed at the recent summit in Munich of the G7 industrial countries to
force a compromise.
'The key lies with Chancellor Kohl. He is the one man who can press
President Mitterrand to give the necessary number of metres to clinch the
deal. He has shown no inclination to press Mitterrand, but is going to have
to do so,' he said.
Sir Christopher was fiercely critical of the 'prehistoric' consensus
decision-making process on EC farm policy, which he blamed for blocking
reform. He called either for the introduction of majority voting on
agriculture, or for responsibility for farm policy to be transferred away
from Brussels and back to national governments.
He also warned that Uruguay Round aims to liberalise trade could be
frustrated by exchange rate manipulation, and said a supra-national currency
arrangement would be needed 'if a Gatt-type multilateral trade agreement is
to be sustained'.

FT  21 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAVE of negative sentiment washed over British Aerospace (BAe), sending
the shares tumbling to record the day's poorest Footsie stock performance in
percentage terms.
At the day's low, the shares were down 29 at 213p, with the downward
pressure having started ahead of the general decline in the market, when
dealers reported a line of stock on offer. One securities house was also
very active in the traded options market.
The falls were followed by the renewal of worries about provisions necessary
to meet problems at the regional aircraft division. Sentiment was
additionally weakened by talk of further difficulties in the cash position.
Later in the day bargain hunters helped the shares pick up to end a net 27
down at 215p. Trade was relatively light at 1.5m shares.
Mirror wanted
The return of Mirror Group Newspapers, which began trading on Friday after a
suspension of more than six months, continued to attract support. The shares
added 5 3/4 at 58 1/2 p and turnover, although well below Friday's level,
was still heavy at 6.5m.
There is speculation that a stakebuilder has been at work, picking up stock
from unsatisfied private investors who decided to get out as soon as
possible.
However, a number of securities houses also argue that the shares offer
intrinsic good value. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was telling clients
that without the attentions of a bidder the shares were worth up to 85p, but
'once bid fever really takes hold, estimates of what MGN is worth will start
with a net asset value of 109p and escalate'.
Support for Glaxo
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo stood out in a weak market as investors bought
the stock for its defensive qualities. The shares held steady when the
market was at its worst and rose in the afternoon to close 10 ahead at 688p.
Analysts said the stock had received support from an article in a trade
publication that featured its anti-migraine drug Imigran, which is awaiting
approval in the US. However, most of the rise came in the afternoon and
reflected a surge in the dollar against the pound. Some 26 per cent of
Glaxo's shares are held in the US in the form of American Depositary
Receipts.
Lasmo rallies
The recent steep slide in Lasmo, which has seen the shares down to their
lowest level since 1986, was arrested following news of a substantial
uprating in the group's share of Indonesian gas reserves. Lasmo was the
Footsie's best performing stock yesterday.
The shares fell more than 23 per cent last week as the market fretted over
analysts' cuts in net asset values, principally because of a falling dollar
and weakness in crude oil prices, but also on worries about forthcoming
interim figures. These are scheduled for release on July 29.
Oil analysts were heartened yesterday by the news from Indonesia which,
allied with asset swaps and any good fortune in drilling operations, could
enable Lasmo to maintain oil and gas reserves during 1992. The stock ended 6
higher at 131p on good turnover of 2.8m.
The market continued to indicate doubts about the forthcoming flotation of
Wellcome shares as the market price fell sharply. The stock, down 35 at one
stage, ended 25 off at 845p. Dealers said one broker had sold a small line
of shares and no-one was prepared to buy. Current price levels suggest that
Wellcome Trust may have to sell its shares into the market at around 800p.
Some observers hinted that it might be chary of selling below that level.
GEC, with its near twice-covered dividend and substantial cash mountain, was
another 'safety-first' stock and gained 4 to 216p.
Cable and Wireless, a big dollar earner, saw an early decline reversed and
closed a net 4 up at 537p ahead of today's annual meeting, of which edited
highlights will be screened by BBC Television at 5.30am on Wednesday.
The strong defensive qualities of utilities triggered support for Midland
Electricity, 6 firmer at 323p on 3.1m, and Southern Electricity, the same
amount up at 310p on 2.6m.
British Gas, 2 ahead at 245p, is also viewed as a tried and tested 'bolt
hole' when the rest of the market is seen as exceptionally vulnerable.
The scale of central bank support for the dollar was the signal for a good
rally in oil shares.
Shell was the major beneficiary, bouncing from a low for the session of 466p
to close 4 1/2 ahead at 475p.
BP, down to 196p early in the day, ended marginally firmer on balance at
200p on 8.8m traded, helped by late support from the US, where one of the
leading brokerages was said to have issued a buy note on the stock.
Tarmac was among many casualties in a depressed building
materials/contracting sector, sliding 5 1/2 to 73p; a block of 5m shares was
sold at 64p at 4.30pm, the official close of business.
A number of textile issues fell as SG Warburg Securities cut forecasts by
between 5 and 7.5 per cent, citing general weakness in the dollar, news that
Marks and Spencer will be putting pressure on suppliers and gloomy
distributive trades figures from the CBI.
Alexon, the fashion retailer, dipped 5 to 197p, although two directors
announced that they had bought blocks of 25,000 and 5,000 shares.
Hazlewood Foods lost 13 to 133p on heavy turnover of 12.3m. This included an
agency cross of 5.8m shares.
Northern Foods slipped 19 to 584p ahead of Friday's annual meeting, amid
fears of a bearish trading statement.
Drug retailers performed better than most, with Boots putting on 3 to 431p
and Lloyds Chemists losing only a penny at 228p.
The CBI distributive trades survey weighed on retailers in general,
particularly those involved with the DIY sector, Kingfisher receding 11 to
437p and WH Smith 'A' 9 to 389p.

FT  21 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in the derivatives market soared on the back of strong two-way
business in both stock index futures and traded options, as economic worries
led to a sharp retreat, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September futures contract on the FT-SE, having opened at 2,415, was
gently squeezed forward and had risen to 2,436 by around 10am. However, with
continuing worries about the economy and an indication from the Alliance &amp;
Leicester Building Society of a possible increase in mortgage rates, the
initially positive mood changed, causing the September contract to fall
sharply, which in turn pulled the underlying cash market lower.
At the day's worst, around 1pm, September, which had dropped to 2,367, was
trading at parity with the cash index.
The intervention in the money markets to support the dollar provided the
spur for a recovery in the contract in the afternoon. September finished at
2,416, down 22 from the previous session and around 5 points below its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18; volume reached a hefty
14,000 contracts.
Turnover in traded options was also high, totalling 50,180 lots by the
close. The FT-SE option was particularly active, having 26,313 contracts
transacted, while the Euro FT-SE option saw 4,677 lots dealt.

FT  21 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Savage losses reduced by the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market shared in the general setback across European
bourses yesterday. In early trading, the UK market suffered one of its
largest daily falls for nearly a year as worry over the domestic economy and
interest rates was fuelled by turmoil in global currency markets.
At the day's low, the FT-SE Index was nearly 65 points weaker, but a strong
rally was prompted by the heavy support action mounted for the dollar by the
US Federal Reserve and European central banks.
By the close, the Footsie had rallied to show a net loss of 28.2 at 2,403.7.
In the early afternoon, when the stock market was cowering beneath a fall in
sterling to a post-ERM entry low, threats of higher mortgage rates ahead,
and a gloomy survey of retail sales from the Confederation of British
Industry, the index had fallen to 2,367.1, its lowest level since December
last year, and traders described the market as 'in disarray'.
The early part of the session was a tale of undiluted misery, as London
reacted with dismay to the heavy falls on Wall Street and in Tokyo. Dealers
had returned from the weekend well aware that the outlook for UK interest
rates was at the mercy of the foreign exchange markets and, with sterling
falling against the D-Mark from the outset, share prices quickly crumbled.
Pressure on equities was increased by very heavy trading in stock index
futures, where the September contract on the Footsie fell to parity with the
underlying index when it touched its low point.
Fears that UK base rates could be forced higher in the wake of the
Bundesbank's decision to raise its discount rate were reflected in higher
rates in the London money markets. Confidence took a further blow when
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest of Britain's building societies,
warned that it might lift its mortgage rate.
The announcement of the UK June money supply data was largely overlooked in
the general excitement. London took a further tumble when Wall Street opened
some 42 Dow points down.
Heavy lines of blue chip stocks came on offer but a relatively low Seaq
volume bore out comments that it was very difficult to offload share blocks
of any significant size.
Marketmaking firms, which have long since learned to offer Seaq trade only
in low numbers, stuck rigidly to this policy yesterday. Attempts to deal 'in
greater size' were rebuffed and share quotations marked down for the next
would-be seller.
When the US Federal Reserve led the way in support of the dollar, London
bounced strongly at this apparent indication of co-ordinated action in
global foreign exchange markets. There was a rush of activity in UK
equities, but some traders warned that their first move had been to sell
into the rising market. Seaq volume was finally 456.3m shares, against
Friday's 487.2m, which was worth Pounds 903.9m in retail business.
London dealers were last night waiting apprehensively to see how Wall Street
would close, and whether UK stocks can extend their recovery this morning.

FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Foreign and US influences
depress Dow

Wall Street
HEAVY losses on foreign equity markets and disappointment with recent second
quarter corporate earnings left US share prices lower across the board
yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 28.64 down at 3,303.00, but well
above the low for the session when almost a 50-point fall was recorded. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.87 at 413.75, while the American SE composite
closed 2.03 lower at 384.52 and the Nasdaq composite 6.24 weaker at 564.28.
Turnover on the New York SE was light at 165.7m shares.
Analysts had expected equities to open weaker after last Friday's
disappointing earnings from IBM and the overnight losses in Japanese, UK and
continental European exchanges, and the New York markets duly obliged.
The early selling was heavy, reflecting concern about the global economy,
the weak nature of the US recovery and, to a lesser extent, the vulnerable
state of the dollar which prompted co-ordinated intervention by the world's
central banks yesterday.
Second quarter corporate results, many of which have come in below
expectations, also continued to depress market sentiment. Dealing in IBM was
delayed at the opening because of an order imbalance on the sell side. When
trading finally commenced, IBM fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 92 7/8 in
turnover of 2.9m shares. This followed a series of downgradings by analysts,
who quickly lowered their forecasts for full-year earnings in the wake of
Friday's second quarter figures.
Many stocks registered losses in spite of satisfactory quarterly profits.
Merck was one such case, dipping Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 after the
drug company, the biggest single component in the Dow average, announced a
second quarter profit of 57 cents a share, up from 48 cents a year ago and
in line with market estimates.
Among the stocks to buck the trend, BankAmerica advanced Dollars 2 7/8 to
Dollars 44 3/8 as Wall Street analysts applauded the banking group's second
quarter net income of Dollars 240m, achieved in spite of considerable costs
related to the recently completed merger with Security Pacific.
Transamerica was another to post a rare gain, adding Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
45 3/8 after the financial services group revealed plans to divest its
property and casualty operations. The company also made positive noises
about second quarter income.
Upjohn firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/4 on stating that a
government-appointed scientific advisory committee in the UK had recommended
that Upjohn's sleeping drug Halcion be allowed back into the UK market.
On the Nasdaq, First Federal Savings &amp; Loan jumped Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars
42 3/4 on news that the company would be bought by Society Corp for Dollars
45 a share in a deal worth Dollars 141m.
Canada
TORONTO stocks tended to follow other world markets lower, but the TSE 300
index closed only 10.4 off on balance at 3,452.6. Declines led advances by
297 to 212 after a moderate volume of 24.8m shares valued at CDollars
264.2m.
Toronto Sun Publishing, up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 16 1/2, reported a
second quarter profit of 14 cents a share, compared with year earlier
earnings of 5 cents.

THE DOLLAR rose nearly four pfennigs from its low against the D-Mark
yesterday after concerted central bank intervention stopped a probable
free-fall of the US currency, writes James Blitz.
For the first time in more than a year, the US Federal Reserve and most of
Europe's central banks acted in unison to buy dollars as the currency
dropped to DM1.4463, a hair's breadth from its historic low of DM1.4430.
The decision to intervene at around 3pm London time also supported sterling
and the Italian lira by weakening the D-Mark. The fall of the pound and the
lira had, until then, been raising ever wilder rumours about a possible
realignment of the European Monetary System.
Analysts in London said the operation, which must have involved the purchase
of hundreds of millions of dollars, was a success as far as the
dollar/D-Mark rate was concerned. The dollar ended at DM1.4815 after a
previous DM1.4610 close, as dealers heeded that the Fed had abandoned the
policy of 'benign neglect' of the currency.
Central bank intervention has been well respected by the market since the
1980s, and dealers are unlikely to go short of dollars again at around
DM1.4500. In New York the US unit further rallied to finish at DM1.4935.
Dealers still found reasons to be bearish. The fundamental factors that have
kept the D-Mark strong still exist. The fear that the Bundesbank will put up
its emergency Lombard rate to control its money supply problem hangs over
the market. The yawning differential between German and US interest rates
will continue to drive the temptation to buy D-Marks. And it is not in the
US authorities' long term interest to promote an expensive dollar, following
June's trade deficit that exceeded Dollars 7bn.
There are also doubts about the strength of sterling and the Italian lira.
Although the pound rallied to a high of DM2.8530 following the intervention,
it dropped back to close at DM2.8425, down  1/2 pfennig on the day. Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The
devaluation tag still hangs over the pound, and the Bank of England may have
to intervene again.'
The prognosis for the lira also remains gloomy. Before the concerted
intervention began, the Bank of Italy was heavily intervening in the market,
as its currency slipped to L762 to the D-Mark. It eventually closed at
L760.30.
Traders believe the policy of raising the discount rate, which the Italians
have done by 1.75 percentage points in the last fortnight, may fail to check
the currency's fall. By lifting rates, the Italians are increasing the cost
of financing their budget deficit.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rates end firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money markets firmed yesterday after a plummeting
dollar and pound were saved by massive central bank intervention on the
foreign exchanges.
In the morning, cash rates rose to new highs as sterling slid two pfennigs
and fears intensified that the Bundesbank would need to raise its money
market rates again before the summer is over. After the central banks
intervened, the pound improved on the foreign exchanges and the mood
lightened. But the market ended in a bearish mood.
Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates
are moving, was offered at 10 3/8 per cent, up from a previous close of 10
1/4 per cent.
Sterling dealers had been intensely bearish in the morning, and came close
to pricing a  1/2 percentage-point base rate rise into their operations. The
market is increasingly convinced that the next move in rates will be
upwards, a view boosted by weekend press speculation and the rise in
mortgage rates announced by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society
last week. By lunchtime, three-month money had firmed to 10 7/16 per cent
offered.
Trade in sterling futures was hectic. In the morning, the September short
sterling contract dropped 14 basis points to a low of 89.56, tracking
sterling's fall. That was the lowest point the contract has reached since
the day before the UK general election, when the market was fearful of a
Labour victory. Following the central bank intervention, it closed at Friday
night's 89.70 level.
In spite of the currency's difficulties, the Bank of England did not raise
the rates at which it buys bills in the sterling money market. After
forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m, the Bank purchased bills at the
established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent
for the repurchasing agreement (repo). However, the Bank did not deal in
Bands 3 and 4, in contrast to last Friday's operation.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 23m in repos for resale to the
market. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of Pounds 800m. In the
afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 51m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds
748m of Band 1 bank bills.

FT  21 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan widens its search for
new capital sources - The FRN market re-awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks are set to re-open a dormant sector of the international bond
market in their urgent search for new sources of capital.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance has relaxed regulations allowing banks to
issue perpetual subordinated floating rate notes. Sakura Bank is expected to
launch an Dollars 800m perpetual FRN issue in the next few weeks.
Perpetual FRNs were used extensively by capital-hungry banks in the early
1980s. Between 1984 and 1986 around Dollars 20bn perpetual FRNs were issued
by banks and companies.
The market was seen as highly liquid, offering many of the characteristics
of money-market investments but with a higher margin. In early 1987
liquidity dried up and the market has been largely dormant ever since.
Variations on the theme, such as step-up perpetual notes - where the margin
paid to the investor increases through the life of the bond - failed to
stimulate new issues.
Six of Japan's leading banks could already be below international capital
adequacy standards which come into force at the end of this financial year,
according to a report published yesterday by IBCA, the credit rating agency.
The weakness of the Tokyo stock market has eroded the capital strength of
all Japanese banks by reducing unrealised gains on securities holdings.
Under the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy, the banks can
count 45 per cent of unrealised gains as tier II or non-core capital.
With the Nikkei stock market average at 16,000, Bank of Tokyo, Sakura, Fuji,
Tokai and Hokkaido Takushoku may already be below the Basle standard - which
prescribes a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent. Yesterday the
Nikkei closed at 15,884.
Some banks are much more sensitive to falling equity prices than others. The
larger trust banks and the long-term credit banks have built up very large
hidden reserves and have not liquidated securities holdings to cover weak
operating profits or LDC debt provisions.
Others, such as Chuo Trust, Yasuda Trust and Bank of Tokyo have made more
extensive use of their hidden reserves and carry stocks at a much higher
book value in their accounts.
Although perpetual FRNs will be issued in the international market, most of
the paper is likely to be placed with Japanese institutional investors.
Japanese life insurance companies have already made subordinated loans to
the banks to boost their capital resources.
Bankers said yesterday the new bonds would be priced at a level where big
Japanese investors are prepared to buy new paper, rather than by reference
to the secondary market level of outstanding issues.
Barclays has around Dollars 2bn perpetual floating rate paper outstanding,
launched in the mid-1980s. Barclays paper trades at a margin of around 1 per
cent over the London interbank offered rate, a much higher return to
investors than when the paper was launched.
But even at attractive interest rates it remains uncertain whether investors
will buy sufficient quantities of perpetual paper to support the banks'
capital ratios.
'These (issues) will be expensive, and it appears doubtful that the limited
market for such paper could absorb the large scale issues the banks need to
make,' commented the IBCA report.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Europe suffers a crisis of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets were hit by a crisis of confidence
yesterday, suffering a sharp fall early in the day until intervention by
central banks in the foreign exchange markets relieved fears of higher
European interest rates.
The central banks of several European countries sold D-Marks and bought
dollars in the afternoon session, lifting the pressure on weaker currencies
within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Italian government bond market was worst hit by the initial bout of
selling, since the lira is seen by international investors as a prime
candidate for devaluation within the ERM. On the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, the September bond future plummeted from an
opening level of 93.61 to hit a low of 91.85.
On the cash market the May 2002 fixed-rate bond closed at 91.88, for a gross
yield of 13.97 per cent, having closed on Friday at 93.35. Shortly before
the central banks intervened the 10-year bond hit a low of 91.30 - a full
two points below Friday's close.
The persistent weakness of the Italian market in recent weeks has been
driven by concern over the long-term future of the lira within the ERM.
Yesterday's foreign exchange intervention pushed the D-Mark lower, relieving
pressure on the Italian currency.
Against the D-Mark, the Italian unit recovered from L762 to around L760 by
the close. This was enough to stimulate a rally, as investors moved to cover
short trading positions by buying stock.
The Italian market is unlikely to recover until the pressure on the lira is
removed. Analysts noted yesterday that the Italian authorities are
supporting the currency by maintaining very high money market interest
rates, potentially damaging the financial system. Yesterday one-month
interbank funds were trading at around 19 per cent, from a stable level of
around 12 1/2 per cent before the latest bout of volatility.
The pattern was repeated in other European markets. In Paris, the benchmark
10-year 8 1/2 per cent government bond closed on a yield of 9.03 per cent,
from 8.97 per cent on Friday. The yield spread over German government bunds
at this maturity remained at 88 basis points.
GERMAN government bond prices may have moved less violently than those of
most other European markets yesterday, but they still experienced what by
most measures was a highly volatile day. With volume on Liffe running at a
large 90,000 contracts, the bund futures contract, which had opened at
87.21, plunged to 86.75 before recovering after the intervention in the
exchange markets to 87.12.
The market now has its eyes fixed on June's growth in broad money, expected
to be announced this week.
THE UK government bond market first fell in line with sterling on the
foreign exchange market before rallying as the UK currency gained ground.
The benchmark long-dated gilt, the 9 per cent stock maturing 2011, closed at
100 15/16 for a yield of 8.89 per cent, having opened at 101 5/32 .
On Liffe, the September gilt futures closed at 98.15, up slightly from 98.13
at the opening and well above the low of 97.25 hit shortly before central
banks intervened against the D-Mark. Volume was an active 49,000 contracts.
Sterling fell below DM2.83 in early afternoon before central banks selling
the German currency allowed sterling to improve to DM2.8410 by late
afternoon in London.
The market was little moved by money supply figures for June which pointed
to a depressed state of domestic economic activity. Narrow money, M0, fell
0.8 per cent in the month, for a year-on-year rate of growth 1.3 per cent.
Analysts said short-dated gilts are unlikely to gain until investors believe
that the next move in UK interest rates will be down and money market
interest rates move lower. Yesterday interbank funds traded at 10 3/8 - 10
1/4 per cent from two months to one year, against a base lending rate of 10
per cent.
WEAKNESS in overseas and domestic equity markets modestly boosted US
Treasury prices yesterday morning.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/4 at 103
29/32 , yielding 7.657 per cent. The two-year note, however, was down  1/32
at 101 11/32 , yielding 4.254 per cent.
The sustained decline in worldwide stock markets sparked early buying of
government securities yesterday by retail and speculative players in
anticipation that investors would be lured from falling equities into
Treasuries.
Apart from the equity-related business, trading activity was quiet, with
participants mostly holding fire until after Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to
Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. The market
hopes that Mr Greenspan will provide some insight into the Fed's current
views on the economy and monetary policy.

<TEXT>
CUMMINS Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel
engines, yesterday consolidated its return to the black by unveiling
underlying second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 17.5m, or 93 cents a
share.
Earnings in the latest quarter were distorted by an extraordinary gain and
the cumulative effect of accounting changes which brought the company's net
income to Dollars 22.4m, or Dollars 1.22.
In the same period of 1991, Cummins suffered a net loss of Dollars 17.2m, or
Dollars 1.29.
Sales in the three months rose 8 per cent to Dollars 948.1m from Dollars
877.6m.
Sales were boosted by strong demand for both its heavy-duty and mid-range
engines. Cummins expects North American heavy duty truck engine sales of
about 120,000 units for the year, if the economy does not deteriorate.
Cummins controls about 38 per cent of that market.
For the first half of 1992, Cummins had net income of Dollars 31m, or
Dollars 1.70 on sales of Dollars 1.83bn. A year earlier, the company had
suffered a net deficit of 27 cents a share on sales of Dollars 1.69bn.

FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Strong advance by Blockbuster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental company which takes in the
former Cityvision stores in the UK, has reported after-tax profits of
Dollars 29.97m in the second quarter of 1992, on revenues of Dollars 264.6m.
The profits figure represents a 40 per cent increase from the Dollars 21.4m
seen in the same period last year on revenues of Dollars 210.1m, and lifts
net profits in the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 55.6m, from Dollars
37.3m.
Sales in the six months totalled Dollars 518.6m, against Dollars 386.9m.
The strong advance, however, partly reflects Blockbuster's expansion moves.
The company said yesterday same-store revenues from the outlets which are
owned by the group, rose by 3.5 per cent in the quarter, and by 6.2 per cent
in the first six months.
Blockbuster shares eased by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 yesterday.
Mr Wayne Huisenga, Blockbuster's chairman, said the company was pleased with
the figures 'considering the prevailing economic climate and the effect of
weaker product availability on the home video industry during the second
quarter of 1992, as compared to the similar period of 1991'.
Philips Electronics, the Dutch company, holds about 7 per cent of
Blockbuster's shares, having exercised an option to purchase an additional
5m shares on June 30, for an investment of Dollars 55m.
Blockbuster now encompasses 2,888 stores, of which 1,055 are
franchise-owned, and 1,833 are company-owned.

THIRD-QUARTER net earnings of Rockwell International, a leading US producer
of space systems and electronics products fell to Dollars 122m or 55 cents a
share, from Dollars 151.4m or 65 cents a year earlier, on revenues of
Dollars 2.7bn, against Dollars 2.98bn.
This left the group with a nine-month net loss of Dollars 1.17bn or Dollars
5.25 a share . This compared with a profit of Dollars 448m or Dollars 1.91.
Revenues were Dollars 8.02bn against Dollars 8.91bn. The latest nine-months,
however, include a Dollars 1.17bn or Dollars 6.78 a share charge on a change
in accounting for non-pension post-retirement benefits.
Mr DR Beall, chairman and chief executive, expects fourth-quarter earnings
to improve on those for the third quarter and believes 1992 full-year
earnings per share will be about 15 per cent below 1991 levels before the
effect of the accounting change.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based financial services group, plans to
pull out of the property-casualty insurance business. The company said
yesterday it had called in Morgan Stanley and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
two Wall Street investment banking firms, to advise on the disposal of its
non-life insurance division.
Transamerica added that it would consider either selling the operation,
'demerging' it through a free distribution of shares in the insurance
division to Transamerica shareholders, or floating the business on the stock
market.
The news sent Transamerica's shares sharply higher in a plunging stock
market; in late trading the shares were Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 45
3/8 . Transamerica's insurance group is based in Woodland Hills, California,
and ranks as the 27th largest property-casualty insurer in the US, in terms
of net written premiums.
It made after-tax profits of Dollars 63m in 1991, including investment gains
of Dollars 6m. Its revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, and assets stood at Dollars
4.6bn.
However, the subsidiary increased reserves in the second quarter, mainly to
back its workers' compensation and entertainment insurance operations.
Because of this, it is expected to make an operating loss of Dollars 40m in
the second quarter.
Transamerica said the move would allow it to concentrate on 'less cyclical,
higher-returning finance and life insurance activities'.
'We face demands for increased capital to support growth in many of our
businesses,' said Mr Frank Herringer, chief executive. 'In view of these
demands, we have elected to focus our resources on our life insurance and
finance businesses.'
Transamerica added that it did not expect to realise any significant gain or
loss on the disposal.
The remaining operations have assets of about Dollars 30bn, and made
after-tax profits of Dollars 71m in the first quarter.
The company said its continuing operations should also have a strong second
quarter, more than doubling the Dollars 43.6m reported in the same period of
1991.

strategic planning

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has parted company with its chairman
and chief executive amid mounting public criticism of his management style
and his role in Dofasco's ill-fated acquisition of Algoma Steel five years
ago.
Dofasco said yesterday that Mr Bill Wallace resigned as a result of
'differences over how to best implement the company's new strategic plan.'
A spokesman declined to elaborate, but insisted that the plan, which
includes an emphasis on flat-rolled products and the study of mini-mill
opportunities, will remain intact.
Mr Wallace had worked for Dofasco for 36 years, but took over as chairman
only two months ago. Tensions over his position were clear at the company's
most recent annual meeting where a group of dissident shareholders
challenged his nomination to the board of directors.
Ms Margaret Cornish-Kehoe, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, claimed
yesterday that Mr Wallace 'didn't have people skills and was very closely
associated with Algoma'.
Mr Wallace's departure appears to reflect intense soul-searching over the
future of Dofasco, considered one of North America's premier steel producers
until its costly purchase of Algoma in 1987.
Three years later. Dofasco wrote off its entire CDollars 713m (USDollars
594m) investment in the troubled Ontario-based company, which itself is
Canada's third biggest steel producer.
Mr Wallace spearheaded the Algoma acquisition, but has always insisted that,
in keeping with Dofasco's collegial management style, the decision to go
ahead was a joint one.
The financial burden of Algoma has been exacerbated by the recession.
Dofasco suffered a CDollars 25m loss last year and a further loss of
CDollars 17.8m in this year's first quarter.
Mr Wallace's place as chairman will be temporarily taken by Mr Jack Leitch.

growth

<TEXT>
MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, said sales growth from new
products contributed to its 18 per cent increase in second-quarter net
profits, to Dollars 653.4m.
The results, a continuation of the US company's first-quarter performance,
were struck on the back of a 12 per cent rise in sales for the second
quarter, to Dollars 2.38bn.
Merck's earnings per share were 57 cents, against 48 cents in the second
quarter of last year. Although the Merck results represented a continuing
improvement, Wall Street marked the company's share price Dollars  5/8
lower, to Dollars 49 3/8 .
Second-quarter results from American Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and
specialty chemicals group, were also encouraging. Net earnings rose 11.9 per
cent to Dollars 147.5m - on a per-share basis the improvement was 14.9 per
cent, to Dollars 1.62.
American Cyanamid's second-quarter sales were 4 per cent improved at Dollars
1.48bn. The company's share price was unchanged at Dollars 58 in late
trading.
Commenting on the Merck results, Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief
executive, said both domestic and international operations reported solid
unit volume gains.
Sales outside the US accounted for 46 per cent of first-half 1992 total
revenues of Dollars 4.6bn. Dr Vagelos said excluding foreign exchange
adjustments, second-quarter sales were 11 per cent higher.
Among the products helping to boost Merck's performance was the recently
introduced Proscar drug, designed to treat prostate enlargement. Vasotec,
which reduces high blood pressure and treats heart failure, also did well,
as did Vaseretic and Prinivil, two other blood pressure drugs.
The New Jersey-based American Cyanamid said increased crop protection
chemicals sales helped its agricultural division earnings.
Ethical drugs and medical devices led the improved performance in the
group's medical division. But higher promotional costs associated with the
introduction of the group's anti-smoking nicotine patch affected earnings.
Chemical division sales and operating earnings were down in the second
quarter because of lower military demand for chemical light products and
higher manufacturing costs for that line.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday unveiled slightly lower second-quarter net earnings of Dollars
488m, against Dollars 489.5m a year ago, after taking a special charge to
settle legal and federal regulatory actions.
The company, which recorded five per cent higher second-quarter revenues of
Dollars 2.88bn, took a Dollars 46m pre-tax charge as a result of its
agreement to settle an anti-trust lawsuit involving claims that the company
conspired to rig the prices of infant formula.
Mead Johnson, the Bristol-Myers infant formula division, also recently
agreed to a settlement of charges by the Federal Trade Commission that the
company, together with two other infant formula makers - Abbott Laboratories
and American Home Products - engaged in price rigging and other improper
trading practices.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers Squibb, said US sales were
unchanged while international sales were 14 per cent higher in the quarter,
with foreign exchange fluctuations helping sales by one per cent.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 94 cents.
On Wall Street, the company's share price was marked Dollars 1 higher to
Dollars 66.
Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled a 7 per cent
increase in second-quarter net earnings to Dollars 338.2m, or Dollars 1.16,
from Dollars 317.5m, or Dollars 1.08 a year earlier. Sales also rose 7 per
cent, to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.38bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
For the first six months of 1992, Lilly's net earnings advanced 11 per cent
to Dollars 780.8m, or Dollars 2.67 from Dollars 706.1m, or Dollars 2.43 in
the same period of last year. Sales were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.04bn
from Dollars 2.81bn.

RALSTON Purina, the St Louis-based consumer products company which recently
acquired the UK Ever Ready battery business from Hanson, has reported a
Dollars 68.4m third-quarter, after-tax profit.
This represents a small fall from the Dollars 70.7m seen in the same period
a year earlier, and was scored on sales of Dollars 1.86bn (Dollars 1.76bn).
The damage was done by an extraordinary item; earnings before tax and
extraordinary items were up from Dollars 116.8m to Dollars 124.4m.
For the first nine months, net profits were Dollars 285.2m, against Dollars
304.4m, on sales of Dollars 5.75bn, up from Dollars 5.54bn.
Ralston said its food businesses - both human and pet products - produced
lower operating profits in the quarter and in the nine-month period.
Pet food suffered from higher advertising and promotional costs and an
unfavourable sales mix; lower bread volumes hit Continental Baking, the
baking subsidiary due to be demerged; and cereals, despite improving in the
third quarter, still showed lower profits for the nine months.
However, other consumer products showed significant increases. Ever Ready
did well in its domestic market, although reduced European results dogged
the international division.

SOUTHWEST Airlines, the low-cost Dallas-based carrier which specialises in
flying heavily travelled commuter routes, yesterday showed up its larger
rivals when it reported a Dollars 23.5m profit after tax in the three months
to end-June, writes Nikki Tait.
Most of the US airline industry is expected to post losses for the second
quarter of 1992, which was beset by aggressive domestic 'fare wars'. But
Southwest's profit, scored on revenues of Dollars 416.8m, actually improves
on the Dollars 10.5m seen in the same period of 1991. The airline has now
made net first-half profits of Dollars 49.5m, against Dollars 2.35m in 1991.

<TEXT>
UNITED Technologies, the US technology group which is being restructured,
yesterday reported second-quarter net income nearly quadrupled from an
unusually depressed 1991.
The company announced net income of Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.18 a share,
compared with Dollars 44m, or 28 cents, in the same period of last year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 5.4bn. The figures were broadly
in line with market expectations.
In last year's second quarter, earnings were abnormally depressed by a
Dollars 148m pre-tax charge to restructure a contract at Norden, the group's
radar system manufacturer.
Mr Robert Daniell,the United Tec chairman, said the company was seeing
strength in three of its business segments - building systems, which
includes Carrier, the air conditioning company, and Otis, the elevator
group; flight systems, which includes Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer;
and automotive components.
It was also encouraged by the early results from its restructuring
programme, announced last January. So far it has cut the workforce by 4,650
jobs, or 65 per cent of the 1992 goal.
'We are meeting our schedule for restructuring and increased earnings,' Mr
Daniell said. 'We expect additional modest benefits from a slowly improving
economy and continuing gains from the restructuring programme as the year
progresses.'
The company's power segment, the Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine manufacturer,
reported an operating profit of Dollars 116m, down from Dollars 123m a year
ago. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 1.8bn. The company said there was a
higher contribution from spare parts for commercial engines, and pointed out
that the 1991 figure was boosted by some Dollars 100m in participation fees
for the PW4000 engine.
However, Mr Daniell described the overall condition of the commercial
airline industry as 'troubling and indicative of continuing financial
pressures on the major airlines'.
The flight systems business made Dollars 65m on sales of Dollars 968m,
compared with a loss of Dollars 72m on sales of Dollars 986m; building
systems made Dollars 164m on revenues of Dollars 2.4bn, up from Dollars 124m
on sales of Dollars 2.1bn, and automotive made Dollars 38m on revenues of
Dollars 633m, compared with Dollars 28m on sales of Dollars 541m.
For the six months United Tec made Dollars 275m, or Dollars 1.95 a share,
against Dollars 84m, or 53 cents, last year while revenues rose to Dollars
10.9bn from Dollars 10.2bn.

<TEXT>
UNION CARBIDE, the US chemicals company, yesterday reported a 46 per cent
rise in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 73m.
The company was at pains, however, to separate out its Dollars 37m of
second-quarter net earnings from continuing operations, compared with
Dollars 18m a year ago.
On June 30, Union Carbide completed the spin-off of Praxair, its former
industrial gases subsidiary. This business produced Dollars 34m of net
income in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 28m a year ago.
Overall earnings per share in the second quarter were 51 cents, up from 35
cents a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations were 28 cents against
13 cents.
Total net sales for the Connecticut-based chemicals company were little
changed at Dollars 1.26bn against Dollars 1.21bn.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the results reflected continuing efforts
to drive down fixed costs. He said polyethylene and ethylene glycol volumes
were better than last year, but added that margins continued to be tight in
these markets.
On Wall Street, the Union Carbide stock price closed Dollars  1/8 higher at
Dollars 13.

from Renown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RENOWN, Japan's biggest clothing maker, is injecting Pounds 8m (Dollars
15.28m) into Aquascutum, its upmarket British fashion retailer. The UK
business has been dragged into losses by the effect of recession on luxury
goods sales.
The move comes two years after Renown paid Pounds 74m to take over the
company. It is the latest case of a celebrated brand name requiring further
cash infusions by a new foreign owner. The sum, although modest, is being
paid at a time when the parent is itself in the red. Aquascutum's pre - tax
losses for the 1991 calendar year reached Pounds 13.47m on sales of just
Pounds 42.30m, and Renown expects the offshoot will stay in loss this year.
Of the extra funding, Pounds 4m was paid in May and the rest would be
provided next January, Renown said. The capital injection will help meet
Aquascutum's commitments in projects such as refurbishing its Regent Street
flagship store in London and opening an outlet in North America.
Renown, a producer of mid-market ready-to-wear apparel, is to begin selling
Aquascutum lines in Japan from next month, spending Y2bn (Dollars 16m) on a
specialist store for the brand. This had not been possible until the recent
unwinding of a licensing arrangement between Aquascutum and Mitsubishi Corp,
which had given the latter distribution rights for the country.
Aquascutum says its sales in Japan should reach Y10bn in Renown's accounting
year, which begins in February. However, such a performance would come in
the face of the country's own economic downturn, which has quelled the
enthusiasm of metropolitan Japanese for foreign designer labels.
Indeed, some retail sector analysts had thought the change might prompt
shoppers to trade down to the more affordable lines mass-produced by Renown.
However, any such trend remains unreflected in the parent company's
performance. Renown said its pre-tax loss for a seven-month interim period
which ends in 10 days would exceed the Y11bn it had previously forecast. It
blamed the setback on poor sales, particularly at the department stores it
supplies.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF America has blamed special charges related to its recent takeover of
Security Pacific for an 11.8 per cent decline in second-quarter net
earnings. The bank is now the second largest in the US, with Dollars 188.6bn
of assets.
The results - the first since the merger was completed on April 22 - were
hit by a net Dollars 181m of non-recurring items, including Dollars 395m of
merger-related restructuring write-offs and a Dollars 157m gain on an asset
sale.
Because of the charges, Bank of America's net profit in the quarter was
Dollars 240m, compared with Dollars 272m a year ago.
Earnings per share were 63 cents, compared with Dollars 1.16. The bank said
its earnings per share would have been Dollars 1.19 but for the one-time
charges, while its net income would have been Dollars 421m.
The bank stressed that the results were not comparable with results in the
same period of last year. However Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, said he
was pleased with the progress in integrating Bank of America and the former
Security Pacific.
Wall Street also seemed satisfied with the report: the bank's share price
was marked Dollars 2 7/8 higher to Dollars 44 3/8 .
Mr Rosenberg said efforts to achieve operating cost savings in connection
with the merger were going well. The bank was also focused on credit
quality, 'especially in light of the current difficult economic
environment', he said.
Bad debt provisions in the second quarter amounted to Dollars 240m against
Dollars 175m a year ago. For the first six months of 1992, these provisions
totalled Dollars 470m, compared with Dollars 320m in the first half of 1991.
Non-performing assets were Dollars 4.56bn at the end of last month,
reflecting the problems among combined assets of both banks; the same
measure for Bank of America alone was Dollars 3.08bn a year ago.
Net loan losses amounted to Dollars 194m, up from Dollars 169m a year ago.
The second-quarter 1992 losses consisted of Dollars 402m of write-offs and
Dollars 208m of recoveries. The write-offs were related mainly to credit
card and other consumer loans, and the recoveries mainly to the sale of
sovereign debt and recoveries on previous write-offs.
Net income for the first six months of 1992 was Dollars 543m, down from
Dollars 554m in the same part of last year.
At the end of last month, the new group had 88,000 employees, or some 4,700
fewer than the combined total level a year ago at Bank of America (54,100)
and at Security Pacific (38,600).
Net interest income after bad debt provisions was Dollars 1.44bn, compared
with Dollars 916m a year ago for Bank of America alone.
Non-interest income was Dollars 1bn, including a one-time gain of Dollars
157m related to the sale of Bank of America's payroll processing business.
The figure a year ago for the bank alone was Dollars 595m.
At the end of last month, Bank of America had Dollars 4.4bn of assets to be
disposed, composed primarily of former Security Pacific loans, investments
in subsidiaries and operations, foreclosed property and other assets deemed
non-strategic.

FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Honda weighs quitting Formula
One
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA Motor may withdraw from Formula One car racing at the end of this
year. A final decision is to be made in September.
The company insisted yesterday the decision would have more to do with
protecting the environment than with the harsh economic environment or the
trouncing McLaren-Honda cars are receiving at the hands of the Anglo-French
Williams-Renault team on the world's race tracks.
Speculation has been growing within racing circles that Honda was
considering withdrawing from Grand Prix.
However such a pull-out had been expected because Honda, after six
successive years of powering world championship-winning cars, wants to
transfer its motor racing resources to Indianapolis-style racing in North
America, where it is regarded as being in need of fresh marketing
initiatives.
The company's hint that it might quit racing all together comes as a
surprise, particularly given the deep motor sport culture suffused through
Honda by the company's founder, Mr Soichiro Honda, who died last year.
There has been little sign of the debate which Honda now indicates has been
waged internally for some time. At issue has been whether the costs of
participation outweigh the technological and public relations benefits.
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president, said yesterday that making cars
more environmentally-friendly was the most important challenge for
manufacturers.
If the company does quit, the some 100 engineers and other workers directly
preparing Grand Prix racing engines will devote their energies to making
engines cleaner and more fuel-efficient. The company would also be able to
reallocate the annual costs of Grand Prix involvement, indicated to be
around Y10bn (Dollars 80m).
While Honda insisted cost was not the most important consideration, the
outlays have become more of a burden with the slowing of the once-lucrative
domestic car market. The company reported a 1 per cent fall in consolidated
pre-tax profit last year, and a 21 per cent fall in parent profits.
Honda claims the present decision is similar to that made in 1968, when it
withdrew partly to devote more resources to making a cleaner engine to meet
tighter US emissions standard. However the company's return to F-1, a move
strongly supported by Mr Honda, had been a resounding success until the
present season. Despite the best efforts of world champion driver, Mr Ayrton
Senna, the McLaren-Honda team is well down the manufacturer rankings.
'This review has nothing to do with our performance in F-1 this year,' Honda
said. 'We have been racing for 10 years and the times have changed. The
environment has become the key issue.'
Some Honda executives are known to have been concerned that the image of F-1
racing in Europe appeared to be souring, while support for F-1 in Japan also
seemed to have peaked with the retirement last year of leading Japanese
driver, Mr Satoru Nakajima.
Executives of McLaren International, operator of the McLaren race team, were
unavailable for comment on Honda's potential withdrawal. If Honda were to
quit, McLaren would be under considerable pressure to find an alternative
power unit in time to recover its fortunes next year.
Ford said it would be prepared to supply its own Cosworth-built units if
enough capacity existed. Other possibilities include BMW, which may be
considering re-entering Grand Prix and which already has a link with
McLaren.

<TEXT>
RAND MINES has blamed large retrenchment packages at Harmony gold mine, and
a weak gold price, for a second-quarter R40.9m (Dollars 15.1m) loss at its
gold division. The division made R7.3m after-tax profit in the March
quarter.
Harmony, by far the largest producer in the group, paid out R35.5m in
benefits to 6,200 retrenched employees during the quarter, as the mine took
steps to try to ensure continued profitability.
Mr John Turner, chairman of the gold division, said other factors which had
hurt profits were lower production at Harmony and Blyvooruitzicht, the two
largest producers; an inability to lift the grade to compensate for higher
costs and a lower price; and rationalisation at Blyvooruitzicht, though the
costs will only be felt this quarter.
Total gold production in the group dropped 4 per cent to 11,243kg from
11,699kg, while average price received was 2 per cent lower at R32,172 per
kg. Total underground costs at the four mines rose to R37,721 per kg from
R33,517 per kg. This was due mainly to the high retrenchment costs at
Harmony.
Mr Turner said he expected Harmony to return to profitability in the
September quarter.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Getting back to basics to resume growth -
Henry Barrett looks to its core businesses to achieve a recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT A difference recession makes. Two years ago Henry Barrett Group, the
steel and industrial fasteners company, was still riding high, having grown
rapidly since flotation in 1987.
The Bradford-based group benefited from the last construction boom and
bought 13 companies in the late 1980s. Now it is incurring losses and is
heavily burdened by debt, in spite of having sold several of those
acquisitions.
Henry Barrett shares have fallen from their 1989 peak of 280p to 20p, and
the market value has dropped from a high of Pounds 110m to less than Pounds
9m.
The problems were precipitated by the collapse in demand for steel-framed
warehouses and out-of-town stores from retailers such as B&amp;Q, MFI and Texas
Homecare.
Henry Barrett's biggest mistakes, however, came from its attempts to
diversify away from the inevitably cyclical core business of steel
stockholding, and building steel-framed buildings.
In 1988 it bought Park Pallet, a company making carrying systems for
automated warehouses and factories, and the following year purchased OSS and
ASS, which make shelving storage and handling systems for big retailers.
Mr James Barrett, a director from the group's founding family, said: 'The
materials handling business suffered from a slowdown in the retail sector,
so proved to be in the same cycle as construction.'
These companies have now been sold, as have two more profitable acquisitions
 -BNL, which makes thermoplastic bearings, and Lurmark, which manufactures
spray nozzle tips, mainly for use in agriculture.
Mr Barrett said the underperformance of the materials handling businesses
was initially masked by the strength of the group's core activities.
However, even successful acquisitions, such as BNL and Lurmark, took up a
disproportionate amount of management time.
He concludes: 'We can make our business more resilient by staying within our
area of expertise, rather than running around to find something to be good
at.'
Not all is gloom at Bradford, however. One surprise has been the continuing
resilience of steel stockholding, which grew directly from the iron
merchant's business founded by the original Henry Barrett in 1866.
Despite the recession, the stockholding side has continued to trade
profitably and expand market share. It is one of the leading independent
steel stockholders in the UK. The group is big enough to negotiate keen
prices for steel, but its 10 existing depots serve local markets right down
to small workshops, and can make good margins.
Mr Barrett said: 'When we are in a position to grow, that is what we will
grow.' The group still has no depots in Wales, Scotland or south of the
Thames.
Henry Barrett's best short-term hopes for recovery lie in its construction
divi-sion, as the continuing attrition of competitors raises the prospects
of higher prices and a recovery in profit margins.
Westbury Tubular Structures, purchased in 1989, continues to trade
profitably and has just completed a Pounds 4m contract for the roof of the
new Waterloo Channel tunnel terminal in London. In May the workforce was
reduced by 36 to 80, but order intake since then has been good.
On the design and build side, the group is now trading at about break-even,
having closed its Leicester factory in November with the loss of 50 jobs.
The business now employs 205 people - 175 in Bradford and 30 on the sales
side.
Mr Barrett said: 'There's a market of about 250,000 tonnes a year of the
single-storey structures we make for industrial and retail use. We need
about 20,000 tonnes of that to keep going. Prices are currently at Pounds
650 a tonne, compared with up to Pounds 1,100 at the peak. We just need a
small recovery in prices to make profits.'
The widespread demise of competitors is finally allowing prices to move up,
but the group has also succeeded in raising productivity by 15 per cent a
year. Just-in-time manufacturing techniques have cut stocks from seven to
two weeks, with increased flexibility. The group completed erection of a
15,000 sq ft baggage handling facility at Heathrow within 23 days of
receiving the order.
The construction division's main headache lies with Don Reynolds Holdings,
which makes flat-panel cladding for use in steel-framed buildings and was
bought for Pounds 10.8m in 1989.
Demand for its product in the UK has collapsed, partly because fewer offices
and business parks are being built, and also because the fashion has
switched back towards more traditional materials, as championed by the
Prince of Wales.
DRL's best hope of profits lies overseas, through joint ventures in Japan,
the US and continental Europe. The loss-making UK operation is now sharing
its factory with Lindapter, a profitable business which sells a system for
joining steel without bolts or welding, and exports half its output.
Mr Donald Parvin, who became Henry Barrett's chairman in December, assumed
an executive role earlier this month. Mr James Barrett will no longer act as
group chief executive, but will concentrate on the stockholding division. Mr
Barrett's younger brother, Richard, is managing director of the construction
division.
A former chief executive of Matthew Clark, the mechanical and electrical
engineers, Mr Parvin said he believed a cut in working capital and greater
efficiency could yield better financial results - even in present trading
conditions.
Henry Barrett is expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3m on
turnover of Pounds 100m in the current year, and is likely to break even
next year.
Overshadowing the whole group's future are its borrowings of between Pounds
17m and Pounds 18m, which puts gearing at about 75 per cent. Mr James
Barrett conceded: 'Until we reduce that debt, our share price will
languish.'
Mr Parvin said Barclays, the group's bankers, had been very supportive. Its
financial advisers, NM Rothschild, were looking at possible steps to
strengthen the balance sheet, but had so far made no definite proposals.
The sale of surplus property could raise a few millions, but the chairman
said one way forward could be to form strategic alliances with one or more
overseas steelmakers - from the US, Europe or Japan.
Mr Parvin said Henry Barrett had always bought steel from overseas. In
exchange for a cash injection, such producers could gain from Henry
Barrett's knowledge of and access to the UK market.
James and Richard Barrett borrowed heavily to help buy out the 48 per cent
of the shares held by family members and bring the company to market. What
lessons have they learnt from its subsequent roller-coaster ride? James
said: 'We can't eliminate the cyclicality of design and build, because that
is how people expand. But in such a violently cyclical business, you really
need an ungeared balance sheet at the start of any downturn.'

FT  21 JUL 92 / Glaxo to focus on Aids drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, the UK pharmaceutical group, is pouring millions of pounds into a
priority development programme for its candidate Aids drug, 3TC.
The company's scientists hope the drug will emerge from clinical trials as
the first commercially successful alternative to Wellcome's AZT drug
Retrovir. First results of those trials are due this week at the
international Aids conference in Amsterdam. Although only 180 patients have
taken 3TC for a few months, studies show the drug reduces the impact of HIV,
the virus that causes Aids.
3TC prevents HIV replicating in the same way as AZT and two recently
approved similar drugs - DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and DDC from Roche.
However, 3TC avoids interaction with human cells which causes some toxic
side-effects in the other drugs.
In a statement in Amsterdam yesterday, Glaxo tried not to arouse premature
expectations among Aids patients. Glaxo said it was developing 3TC 'with the
highest priority' but it was 'too early to be sure of the ultimate role of
the compound in the treatment of HIV infection'.
Its shares closed in London up 10p at 688p while Wellcome was down 25p at
845p in a weak market. The Aids conference, also likely to bring positive
news for Wellcome's AZT Aids drug, comes as investors make their final
decisions on Wellcome's Pounds 2.65bn global share offer which closes on
Friday.
Glaxo is developing 3TC with BioChem Pharma, the Canadian company that
discovered it. Dr Gervais Dionne, research vice-president of BioChem Pharma,
said the plan was to move to large-scale clinical trials in 1993. If they
also give good results, Glaxo will apply for a marketing licence in 1994.
Glaxo is devoting 'very substantial resources' to 3TC, said Dr Grahaem
Brown, in charge of the development programme. 'Nothing is being allowed to
stand in its way.'
Glaxo is prepared for heavy demand for 3TC, if the drug receives marketing
approval. With HIV infection still increasing rapidly worldwide and few
other alternatives to AZT giving encouraging results, sales of 3TC could be
worth several hundred million dollars a year to Glaxo in the late 1990s.

MARINE Midland, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary, yesterday
reported a turnround to net earnings in the second quarter of Dollars 41m
(Pounds 21m) from losses of Dollars 37m for the same period of 1991.
The result takes half-year profits to Dollars 43.6m against first-half
losses in 1991 of Dollars 109.3m.
Mr John Bond, president and chief executive officer, said: 'We are
encouraged by the continuing improvements in credit quality and operating
margins.' The bank's earnings were improved by non-recurring loan recoveries
and sales of foreclosed property.
Marine Midland was acquired by Hongkong Bank during the 1980s. On two
occasions since, the bank was forced to make capital injections totalling
Dollars 500m into its US subsidiary to shore up its balance sheet.
Marine was one of New York's main money centre banks, but it was hit badly
by its exposure to less developed country (LDC) debt in the early 1980s and
by its exposure to the US property market in the last half of the 1980s.
It has now given up its aim of being a money centre bank and has
repositioned itself as a provider of retail banking services and finance to
small and medium-sized companies.
Signs of improvement in Marine Midland's performance - the result of cost
cutting and a contraction in its balance sheet - began to show through last
year when losses were pared to Dollars 23.8m in 1991 from Dollars 164.3m in
1990. In the first quarter of this year it made a profit of Dollars 2.6m.
The bank said that during the second quarter it achieved improvements in net
interest margins and further reductions in expenses.
Net interest income was Dollars 178.9m, compared with Dollars 168.3m in the
first quarter. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and
credit-related costs, were Dollars 173.8m against Dollars 179.7m in the
first quarter.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Wellcome price likely to be 800p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK

<TEXT>
A PRICE of at least 800p looks likely to be set for the sale of 330m shares
in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group, after Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank organising the sale, said last night it had received indicative bids
for more than 250m shares at prices between 800p and 850p.
The tender offer of shares, through which Wellcome Trust, the medical
charity, will reduce its stake from 73.5 per cent to 35 per cent, closes on
Friday.
Fleming said it would make no further announcement about the level of
demand. Wellcome's shares fell 25p to 845p yesterday, and an 800p strike
price would represent a 5 per cent discount. Bankers involved in the deal
said that some progress was made in the book-building process yesterday in
spite of the weakness of the UK stock market and Wellcome's shares.
Indicative bids for about three-quarters of the stock have been made. The
poor stock market background is putting pressure on the sale, but the level
of bids indicated should ensure that the offer is not cancelled. The trust
can reduce the number of shares it sells if it is not satisfied with the
price.
The falling market yesterday meant that some investors cancelled bids put in
earlier, but others made new ones. Bids are indicative until Friday. Many
investors are putting in prices of 800p knowing that they can be increased
later if demand seems to improve.
In the US, which is expected to account for about a quarter of the shares on
offer, institutional investors were yesterday advised to tender for Wellcome
shares at a price of 800p. The recommendation came from Mehta and Isaly, the
New York analysts. However Mr Sam Isaly said: 'This is not a strong
recommendation. This is a tolerance at 800p.' He said the plan to sell 80m
shares to US investors could be achieved, but was difficult to sell to some
institutions.
Some US institutional investors said they liked Wellcome as a company, but
would require a reasonable discount to the group's share price if they were
to participate. Several investors, who have seen the company's roadshow, say
they would be interested in Wellcome shares at prices between 750p and 800p.
The UK public offer closes today. By yesterday's close, bids for more than
Pounds 100m worth of stock had been made, less than the Pounds 180m set
aside for retail investors.

Yesterday's UK money supply figures were not quite as inauspicious as the
behaviour of the equity market might suggest. At Pounds 2.5bn in June, M4
sterling lending was running some Pounds 300m above its average over the
past six months. That helps offset some of the disappointment in the largest
monthly drop in M0 since 1981. Separate figures from the British Bankers'
Association also suggest a degree of buoyancy in clearing bank lending. If
not yet consistent with strong recovery, that hardly points to triple-dip
recession.
There is one caveat. Consumer borrowing remains exceptionally weak. Though
lending for house purchases has risen since March, new loans are lower than
a year ago. Increased activity in the leasing sector suggests manufacturers
may not entirely have given up hope. That will not last unless consumer
demand picks up.

FT  21 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The odds seem stacked against poor old Italy. Mr Giuliano Amato, the new
prime minister, talks bravely of curbing the budget deficit and privatising
sclerotic state industries. The reality is that there is no political
consensus behind reform. The Mafia seems to be doing its utmost to
destabilise the new government and the lira is trading close to its absolute
floor of L765 against the D-Mark, although the official discount rate has
been raised twice in the last month.
The exchange rate has come to symbolise Italy's ambition to be a part of
mainstream Europe. If Mr Amato cannot hold it, the danger looms of a return
to the dark days of the 1970s, characterised by impotent government,
repeated devaluation, inflation, capital flight and terrorist outrage.
Partly because the alternative is so grim, there is an outside chance that
Mr Amato may succeed. The rise in interest rates has opened up an 8
percentage point gap between short-term rates on the lira and the D-Mark.
That should be enough for the time being to make speculators think twice
about driving the lira below its floor. Maybe external pressure on the
currency, combined with the activities of the Mafia at home, will stiffen
popular resolve to accept change. Reform was never going to be anything but
messy - witness the outraged reaction to the government's wise decision last
Friday to wind up Efim, the loss-making state holding company.
Still, the task is a Herculean one. Each rise in interest rates pushes up
the cost of servicing the government's mammoth debt. To help sell its
treasury bills even at these higher rates, Mr Amato has already had to stoop
to the ruse of a special tax on bank deposits. That looks like the action of
a government running short of practical ideas. It hardly creates a
propitious climate for launching large scale privatisation issues in the
equity market.
If Mr Amato succeeds in staving off the lira's day of reckoning, Italian
equities will look cheap, especially after yesterday's 6 per cent fall. The
odds, however, are so long and the consequences of failure so dire that
international investors, who have been largely out of the market for the
past year, would do best to continue watching from the sidelines.

FT  21 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: More bears than traps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's action by central banks to support the dollar was good news for
those who had begun to fear that international co-operation on currencies
was a thing of the past. But it raises two basic questions: whether the
initiative can be expected to stick: and if so, how far it addresses
preoccupations which have driven down world markets in the past few days.
There are those who argue that US and German interest rates are respectively
as low and as high as they are going to get. That could yet prove correct.
But it is worth asking how far the present parities have answered the policy
objectives in each country. The weak dollar was supposed to loosen monetary
conditions in the US and stimulate exports. Judging by last week's trade
figures, at least, it is scarcely doing its job. Equally, the high D-Mark
was supposed to tighten conditions in Germany. Judging by the latest money
supply figures, it is not working too well either.
Granted, the dollar's plunge to all-time lows against the D-Mark has been an
important element in the recent weakness of European markets. In a parochial
UK context, it is worth noting that, as the chart shows, London has been
moving closely in line with Continental markets ever since its post-election
peak. For other ERM members besides the UK, the combination of high German
rates and a weak dollar has had profoundly worrying implications for
corporate earnings and dividends.
It would also be wrong to push the parallels with the row between the
Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve in 1987, which played an important
part in triggering Wall Street's historic collapse. Equity markets were then
screamingly high in relation to bonds, inflation was rampant and corporate
earnings were approaching their cyclical peak. In every respect, the
situation is now reversed.
But there are other forces afoot. Wall Street has been perceived as
overvalued for so long that one tends to forget that it is so in fact. Nor
is it quite clear how far the price allows for a Democrat in the White
House. Tokyo is back below 16,000 on the Nikkei, which poses a threat no
less real for being familiar. In Europe, the working assumption still is
that the Maastricht treaty will go ahead. But aside from the little matter
of the French referendum, it now looks not impossible that the unravelling
of Italy's finances will cause disarray in the ERM rather more immediately.
And from a UK viewpoint, it is not yet clear that a rise in interest rates
is off the cards. Besides the risk of an increase in the German Lombard
rate, the UK government's aggressive bidding for domestic savings may yet
force a general rise in the mortgage rate. It is also somewhat disquieting
that despite yesterday's sharp rise in the dollar against the D-Mark,
sterling ended the day lower against the D-Mark than it started.
In the end, one is left with the frustrating impression that world markets
are in the grip of large fundamental forces which as yet are imperfectly
identified. Since currencies are clearly part of it, it is much to be hoped
that yesterday's bear trap proves effective. But it will not do the job on
its own.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Rome urged to combat Mafia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government faced a chorus of demands yesterday to adopt
exceptional measures to combat the Mafia following Sunday's assassination of
a leading magistrate in Palermo, Sicily.
As a first response to the killing of Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading
anti-Mafia magistrate, with five of his bodyguards, the government said
1,100 extra police and 1,000 paramilitary carabinieri were on their way to
Sicily.
The army had already been used in the early hours to help remove 55 Mafia
bosses from Palermo prison to mainland high security jails. Others were
being transferred to isolation jails.
The authorities believe the order for Mr Borsellino's killing came from one
of the Mafia bosses in Palermo prison.
In a special session of parliament last night, deputies quizzed the
government on the adequacy of security measures for frontline magistrates
and urged more active intervention against the Mafia. Mr Borsellino was
known to be top of its hit list.
Yesterday in Palermo crowds gathered outside the Palace of Justice to vent
their anger over the killing, in scenes similar to those two months ago
after the Mafia murder of Mr Giovanni Falcone, who had been leading the
fight against organised crime.
'It's war,' said one of the slogans carried by a demonstrator.
Inside the palace, Mr Borsellino's colleagues in the judiciary threatened a
strike against the inability of the state to protect their members. Police
also voiced extreme concern over the eight bodyguards killed in the attacks
on Mr Borsellino and Mr Falcone.
Members of La Rete (the Network), the newly created anti-corruption party in
Sicily, claimed that their leader, Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former mayor of
Palermo, was at serious risk, along with at least three others.
Mr Pino Arlacchi, a leading criminologist, said in a television interview
that the state was being confronted by a clear Mafia policy of killing one
by one those with knowledge about it.
'The thing to be done now is a strong and immediate attack against these men
(the Mafia bosses), violent if necessary,' he said.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Kevin Maxwell ordered to pay Pounds 406m damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL has been ordered by the High Court to make interim payments
totalling Pounds 406.8m to the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, the company from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell
empire pension funds disappeared.
It is believed to be the largest damages award ever made against an
individual in the English courts.
The liquidators, Robson Rhodes, were given final judgment against Mr Maxwell
in an action in which they claimed Pounds 450m compensation or damages for
alleged breaches of his fiduciary duty as a director of BIM, which managed
pension funds for a number of Maxwell companies.
The full amount for which Mr Maxwell is liable has yet to be assessed. He
has said he is insolvent and wants to formulate proposals to put to his
creditors. However, the liquidators intend to force him into bankruptcy.
Because of his lack of resources, Mr Maxwell did not defend the case. Mr
Justice Mummery said that, on the liquidators' evidence, there was no
defence to their claims.
On Thursday the liquidators will ask the court for final judgment in an
identical action against Mr Maxwell's brother Ian.
After yesterday's ruling Mr Maxwell said in a statement that he had not
played an active part in the proceedings brought by the liquidators since
declaring himself insolvent on July 8.
On that day a High Court order, which expires tomorrow, was made preventing
his creditors bringing proceedings against him while he formulates proposals
to put to them. In spite of the order, the liquidators were given leave by
the court on July 10 to seek summary judgment against Mr Maxwell.
His statement continued: 'Had I had the resources, I would have strenuously
denied all allegations of breach of duty.' He said it remained his desire to
assist in the realisation of his assets for the benefit of all his
creditors.
Mrs Margaret Cole, of Stephenson Harwood, the liquidators' solicitors, said:
'It is our intention to seek Mr Maxwell's bankruptcy. We believe a trustee
in bankruptcy is the best person to investigate his assets and recover or
secure them for the benefit of all the creditors, of whom we are by far the
largest.'
At the end of a two-hour private hearing, Mr Justice Mummery gave his
decision in open court because of 'the widespread public interest in this
litigation'.
He said that the liquidators' 44-page claim related almost entirely to
alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Mr Maxwell while a director of BIM.
The judge ordered an account to be taken of what was due from Mr Maxwell to
BIM and payment by Mr Maxwell of the sum found to be due.
Separate orders were made in respect of breaches of duty in 'procuring,
effecting and consenting to' specific transactions, coupled with orders for
interim payments.
The judge continued an order freezing Mr Maxwell's assets up to a maximum of
Pounds 450m.
Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Committee,
said: 'Presumably this will bankrupt Mr Maxwell, and whether pensioners will
actually get more than it has cost them to obtain this court decision is
highly speculative.'
He said fees to professional advisers were depleting pension assets by
roughly Pounds 1m a month and urged the government to take over the cost of
pursuing assets through the courts.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Setback for Pounds 1bn Mersey Barrage scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROJECT to build the Mersey Barrage, a Pounds 1bn electricity-generating
dam between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tidal power,
has failed to win government backing.
Whitehall is understood to have last week told Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman
of the Mersey Barrage Company, that it would provide no further cash. The
barrage would not qualify for public funds to subsidise the cost of its
electricity.
Shareholders will meet in Liverpool today to decide whether to try to keep
the 10-year-old project alive with an injection of Pounds 14m. About Pounds
7m has been spent so far by the public and private sectors.
Supporters of the project say that Whitehall's decision raises questions
about the government's commitment to environmentally friendly power
generation.
The government is likely to have been swayed by the project's high energy
costs and by shippers who use the three Mersey ports of Liverpool, Garston
and Manchester Ship Canal. They fear the project would threaten navigation
of the estuary.
A feasibility study is being carried out on the project. Although studies
are incomplete their general findings are already known.
Environmentalists have mixed feelings. They favour renewable sources of
energy but are worried about the environmental impact of such big schemes.
The decision whether to subsidise the barrage went to Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary. The government wants to shelve the scheme for
later consideration, but supporters say this would kill off the project
because its design teams - numbering up to 40 people - could not be easily
reassembled.
Shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Allied Steel &amp; Wire, Barclays Bank,
BICC, Blue Circle, Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal
Insurance, Shell, Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are
represented by Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and
Liverpool University.
The crucial issue for funding the barrage is the price that could be charged
for the electricity generated. This needed to be about 7p per unit, of which
4p would be offset by the non-fossil fuel levy. A price of 3p per unit would
only allow about 40 per cent of building costs to be raised from the private
sector.
The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for
three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have been a substantial
contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb, the electricity supplier, to
take 20 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources.
David Lascelles writes: The Department of Trade would not comment on the
state of the project last night. Last year it authorised 122 renewable
energy projects with a total capacity of 472MW.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Bundesbank policy is right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JURGEN PFISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your comments on the latest move by the Bundesbank, you argue that
the narrowing of the difference between the discount and Lombard rate to 1
percentage point may produce an increase of the latter fairly soon because
of the unusually small gap between the two ('Stay in the ERM vice', July
17). In fact, from 1948 to 1958 - with two short interruptions - the
difference was always 1 percentage point; from 1969 to 1984 the evidence is
mixed and only from 1985 onwards has the difference always been more than 1
percentage point. But the Bundesbank has indicated several times that it
prefers not to have a wide difference between its key interest rates.
Nevertheless, the question raised seems to be very valid. If money supply
growth were still around 8 per cent this autumn and the world economy were
showing clear signs of a recovery by then, the possibility of an increase in
the Lombard rate cannot be excluded. Whether Europe likes it or not, the
Bundesbank policy is exactly that required by the Maastricht treaty, with
price trends in the EC still a far cry from stability.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Cllr PETER HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your recent article relating to the report on urban trends and
inner-city decline made very interesting reading ('Decay eats away at inner
cities', July 14).
It is the case that Tower Hamlets ranks third from the top (or is it
bottom?) of the most deprived areas in Britain. However, to give the
impression that Tower Hamlets is an inner-city wasteland with no hope for
the future could not be further from the truth.
My borough is an area of immense potential, a mix of old and new. City
fringe developments in Bethnal Green and proposals involving the local
community in the City Challenge area of Spitalfields offer real
opportunities to tackle inner-city decay in an area most in need.
Docklands developments have many critics, but nobody can deny that a great
deal has happened in the area. Tower Hamlets Council has strongly voiced its
views on the over-development and design of many of the schemes. The council
takes the view that the mistakes of their past would be compounded now if
Docklands failed. Many, like the civil servants, view Tower Hamlets and the
East End as a backwater, devoid of community, law and modern technology. We
believe these views stem from ignorance and misinformation. My fear is your
readers, after reading your article, may also take this view.
I am not trying to pretend Tower Hamlets does not have more than its fair
share of problems. However, this is an area of enormous potential. It is
better than it was, still greatly improving and will be the place to be in
the future.

Is the writing now officially on the wall for the profession of broker's
analyst? The Society of Investment Analysts, after 37 years, has changed its
name to the Institute of Investment Management and Research - a clear sign
that it thinks its future lies with investment managers on the 'buy' side of
the investment world, rather than with the brokers on the 'sell' side.
The shift of emphasis has been under consideration for a decade, says the
institute's current president Chris Davis, himself an analyst at BZW.
Although the 2,000-strong membership is split equally, a look at student
enrolments finally made up the new institute's mind. Seven of every 10 of
them are employed by investment managers, while only 30 per cent work for
brokers.

Not many companies see fit to publish a corporate history after just 15
years in business. Even so The Argyll Story, which is all about Britain's
third biggest grocery chain, the Safeway supermarket group, is unnecessarily
slim.
The unknown author could have made much more of the available material.
After all, the most famous thing most people remember Argyll for is its
ambitious Pounds 1.9bn bid for Distillers, a company more than three times
its size. This earns only one paragraph with a vague reference to 'the
intervention of Guinness' and Argyll's subsequent decision to withdraw from
the drinks business.
No mention, for example, of the resignation of James Gulliver, Argyll's
chairman, said by some never to have recovered from his failure to win
Distillers. It's tomes like this that give business biographies a bad name.

It's all rather tasteless. The anti-whaling nations are still trying to
digest Norway's unpalatable decision to resume commercial whaling next year,
yet Norwegian newspapers are teasing their readers' taste-buds with a battle
to find the most delicious way to serve dead whale.
Since the International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on
whale-hunting in 1986, whale meat has rarely been found on the menus of
Norway's finest restaurants. However, since Norway decided to get back into
the whale-hunting business, the country's whale-eaters have resurfaced,
spawning a shoal of their favourite whale recipes, often accompanied by
full-colour newspaper pictures.
Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily, has assured its readers that there will
be enough meat to go round from the 120 whales allowed under the new quota,
and suggests as dish-of-the day whale marinated in wine with finely-chopped
leeks.
Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, who had been considered
a champion of the environment since she chaired the UN World Commission on
Environment, has yet to send in her favourite whale recipe to the local
newspaper.

must be hoping that he is luckier than John Tugwell, chief executive of

Both have only been doing the job for just over a year yet already seem to
be getting spectacular results. NatWest Bancorp bounced back from a loss of
Dollars 276m to a net profit of Dollars 66.1m in the first half, while
Marine Midland is also back in the black. Bad debts are falling and the
embarrassed parents are once again boasting of how well their US offspring
are doing.
But there the similarity ends. Despite the fact that NatWest Bancorp
probably posed a bigger challenge than Marine Midland, Tugwell knows that
however hard he tries he is unlikely ever to get a shot at the top job at
NatWest. That post was filled when young Derek Wanless leapfrogged
everybody.
However, Hongkong Bank's 61-year-old boss Willy Purves has promised to
appoint a new group chief executive soon. Marine Midland may be less
important than Malaysia, but it's the sort of high-profile job that catches
the eye of investors who don't know how to judge the depth of the Hongkong
Bank's management.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Mixed blessings for the three Ps: Patients have benefited
from the Citizen's Charter, but parents and passengers have not
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major certainly did not intend to undersell his Citizen's Charter
when he launched it in a white paper a year ago tomorrow. 'The Citizen's
Charter is the most comprehensive programme ever to raise quality, increase
choice, secure better value and extend accountability. It will ensure that
quality of service to the public and the new pride it will give to those who
work in the public services will be a central theme of government policy for
the 1990s.'
The prospectus bulged with more than 80 proposals for improving the UK's
public services, ranging from the privatisation of British Rail to a special
'chartermark' for public services which met the highest standards of
customer satisfaction. Users of public services were promised information
about the quality of service they were entitled to expect and power to
insist that performance targets were met.
The white paper was followed by the launch of a series of charters covering
different user groups. These range from the traveller's charter for people
passing through customs at ports and airports to the customer charter for
claimants using the social security benefits agency. The 20th charter, from
London Underground, was launched yesterday, with the usual combination of
performance targets and compensation for non-fulfilment.
Overseeing this process is a special Cabinet Office unit and a panel of
advisers chaired by Sir James Blyth of Boots. They know that central to the
success of the charter will be its progress in improving the lot of the
'three Ps': patients, passengers and parents.
The greatest impact has been made with the patient's charter, which promises
that no patient will have to wait more than two years for hospital treatment
once on a waiting list. More than 50,000 patients had been waiting for more
than two years in March 1991, a backlog which was virtually eliminated by
April 1992 when the charter was implemented.
Hitting that target required significant input of cash, with excess capacity
in private hospitals bought in to clear the more intractable waiting lists.
There were accusations at the time that this had been achieved by increasing
the lists of people waiting less than one year. However, Mr Brian Edwards,
general manager at Trent regional health authority who was seconded to the
department of health to lead the team setting up the charter, says that
achieving the target was long overdue.
'It had a marginal impact on people waiting less than a year,' he says, 'but
a great impact on some real people - including many children - who had been
waiting a very long time and whose needs were just as great.'
Mr Edwards notes other achievements, including quicker treatment of
emergency cases and reduced waiting times for out-patient appointments.
'Before, a few people were concerned about these aims,' he says. 'Now
everybody is focusing on them.'
British Rail's passenger's charter not only makes promises about
performance, it also offers compensation if targets are not met. For
commuters with season tickets, there will be rebates if trains fail to hit
reliability and punctuality targets over 12 months (the first rebates will
be payable in January 1993 after the scheme has been running for a full
year).
Ordinary passengers can also claim compensation in the form of vouchers
against the cost of future journeys if they are delayed by more than an
hour. This formalises the previous discretionary and unadvertised
arrangements under which more than Pounds 6m a year was paid out to
passengers who bothered to complain about delays. However, there have been
complaints that the scheme is too restrictive.
'Vouchers and petty discounts, to be used only in certain circumstances and
given grudgingly under a complex system of exemptions and conditions, go
nowhere near far enough,' according to Mr John Beishon, director of the
Consumers' Association. 'Neither is there any mention of consequential loss.
If a train is cancelled and you have to pay out for the cost of a taxi home,
BR shouldn't quibble about paying the cost.'
Offering the least by way of performance targets is the parent's charter.
Instead, this promises more information about schools and pupils' individual
performance, with more frequent inspection by independent inspectors. League
tables of schools' performance will be published from next year, including
data on truancy and success in getting pupils into higher or further
education. Here the emphasis is much more on providing parents with
information on which they can base choices of school, and to encourage
teachers to improve their performance.
Outside its three core areas, there have been problems in implementing some
of the white paper proposals. The Lord Chancellor's department has so far
failed to produce its justice charter to make the courts more user-friendly,
for example. And the deregulation of London Buses has been postponed at
least until 1994. Also stalled is the network of local lay adjudicators who
would take up complaints against public services and hand out small amounts
of compensation informally.
There is also a distinct impression that the charter is losing some of its
cachet. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, might have taken
the opportunity of last week's announcement about privatising the Royal
Mail's parcel delivery service to mention it as an example of meeting
charter objectives on competition and improved services. But he chose not
to.
Nor did Mr John MacGregor when he published the white paper on the
privatisation of British Rail, although this was one of the firm proposals
in the charter white paper. If almost every government policy last year was
hung on the peg of the Citizen's Charter, it is now reserved for the
politically duller announcements such as market testing in the civil
service.
However, Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the charter,
asserts that it remains at the top of the government's priorities. Seminars
will be held every six months to keep ministers up to the mark on
implementing the charter. And Mr Waldegrave has promised a white paper on
progress in the autumn.
The prime minister has also given Mr Waldegrave a powerful weapon in the
right to veto colleagues' bids for extra funds for their departments to
improve customer service and implement charter promises. This implies that
his endorsement would bolster any such bid, something of a coup given the
jealousy with which the Treasury guards the spending round (though it
remains to be seen what this right is worth).
Nobody can now say that the charter was an election gimmick, but it has yet
to make a real impression outside a few limited areas. One year on, the
Citizen's Charter looks more likely to be a permanent feature, but its
political credibility still depends on the commitment of Mr John Major, its
'onlie true begetter'.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The price is wrong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VIEWED FROM across the Atlantic, the US resembles a vast summer sale, where
prices of many internationally traded products are currently two-thirds of
those ruling in Europe. However, European visitors to the US should contain
their elation. The question they should be asking is why the prices they pay
at home are so high.
US price levels are not some short-lived freak occurrence. Only a small part
of the difference with, say, Britain is due to the recent weakness of the
dollar. Even with the pound at Dollars 1.50, the pre-tax price of many items
in the US would look like a bargain to a British tourist. In reality, a wide
range of goods has long been cheaper in the US than in Europe. Computer
buyers, for instance, have for many years paid the same number of pounds in
Britain as US buyers paid in dollars - almost irrespective of the prevailing
exchange rate. Though this anomaly has recently narrowed, it remains
perplexingly large.
One explanation is that some manufacturers have segmented world markets in
ways which enable them to charge higher prices in Europe than in the US.
Such practices have certainly been encouraged by the European Community,
which has sought to protect uncompetitive indigenous industries such as
electronics by bringing anti-dumping cases against a wide range of Japanese
exports. Since exporters frequently settle such cases by agreeing to raise
prices, they receive windfall profits which they can use to subsidise
cut-price competition elsewhere.
Wide discrepancies
Yet there are also wide transatlantic price discrepancies for many
manufactured products in which trade is not distorted by anti-dumping
actions, high tariffs or quotas. The puzzle is why these differentials are
not undermined by competition from cheaper 'grey' imports. Within the EC,
such cross-border arbitrage is explicitly blessed by Brussels, on the
grounds that that it speeds economic integration. However, the impact in
Europe of 'grey' imports from the US is still marginal.
Part of the reason lies in differences in technical specifications for
products such as cars and consumer electronics. Some stem from genuine
variations in national standards, but others are artificial barriers erected
by manufacturers. For instance, Japanese-made Nintendo video game machines
sold in Europe are programmed not to accept the software which Nintendo
sells in the US for half the price in Europe. Another obstacle is that many
manufacturers restrict the validity of extended guarantees to the country
where goods were purchased.
However, these limitations do not apply to products for which there is a
world standard and which require no after-sales service. Compact discs are a
classic example. A year's US output of CDs could be flown in a few jumbo jet
freighters from New York to London in seven hours. Yet European CDs are
still dearer than in the US.
Entry barriers
The reasons - in this and other cases - may have to do with the structure of
European retailing, where barriers to entry are generally higher than in the
US. Above all in Britain, where much of the trade is handled by relatively
few national chains. UK planning rules also favour incumbent operators by
severely limiting the amount of land available for retailing. As a result,
it tends to command premium prices, which have to be recouped through high
margins.
Furthermore, relations between retailers and manufacturers are far more
opaque in Europe than in the US. For instance, detailed trade prices of new
cars are freely available in the US. In Britain, it took a Monopolies and
Mergers Investigation to ferret them out.
While reliable information remains so sparse, it is hard to be sure of the
exact reasons for international price differentials. Their persistence in
supposedly global markets calls for searching investigation by EC and
national competition authorities. European consumers are entitled to clear
answers - not least because their readiness to spend their way out of
recession will be much reduced if they are compelled to pay through the
nose.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Figures in a landscape - German drawings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO wrote the young German artist Philip Otto Runge at the dawn of the 19th
century. Where this widely-shared conviction of freedom and new beginnings
was to take German art is the theme of Neo-Classical and Romantic: German
Drawings of the 18th and 19th Centuries at the Fitzwilliam Museum in
Cambridge.
These drawings, which come from a German private collection, have in the
past two years also been shown in Hanover and Lubeck under the title
Goethezeit und Romantik. It will be a good marker of how far this country's
re-education into pre-20th-Century German culture will have gone when
Goethezeit is no longer felt to need a gloss. The beautifully-printed,
hardback catalogue is good value at Pounds 18.
This is an exhibition which takes a lot of looking, packed as it is with
beautiful drawings and watercolours from the period 1760 to 1860. Among the
famous names are Angelica Kaufmann, Josef Anton Koch, Runge himself (a sheet
of lively sketches for the portrait of the artist's parents in Hamburg),
Caspar David Friedrich, Overbeck, Moritz von Schwind, Goethe's great friend
Tischbein, and Goethe himself.
Landscape predominates, satisfyingly, because, in the eyes of Runge and his
circle, it offered modern artists the chance to excel both antiquity and the
artists of the high Renaissance.
In Koch's sepia drawing (a very popular medium at this period) of the
Schmadribach Waterfall in Switzerland, he includes a modern-dress Judgment
of Paris in the foreground, with peasant goddesses in straw hat and
mob-caps. However, the point of this exercise was anything but whimsical.
Koch, born in the Tyrol, knew his mountains and the interesting claim is
made for him as 'the first artist to capture in his painting the powerful
emotions evoked by mountains.' Painstakingly exact and yet dramatic,
monumental drawings like these were intended to thrill viewers' souls with
the philosophic spectacle of creation in all its rugged grandeur.
The exhibition is on the whole quiet-toned; most of the watercolours are
very restrained in their palettes. However, for virtuoso brilliance it is
hard to beat Thomas Ender's mountain view. His technique of combining little
strokes of paint with areas of paper left blank, creates a dazzling
impression of trees, mud, rock, and sunshine and shadow striking on the
snowy summit.
Imaginary vistas of heroic landscapes alternate with the sort of tranquil
studies of the Italian countryside around Rome in which accomplished
draughtsmen continued to pay homage to Claude. The figures who wend through
these landscapes are often pilgrims, such was the keen interest even
northern Protestants now took in the spectacle of Catholicism.
Either that, or they are medieval knights, hunters, hermits, or the kind of
Romantic wanderer made so familiar by Schubert.
A storm-wracked landscape by Johann Christian Rheinhart is the backdrop to
Macbeth's meeting with the witches. Like Koch's comical Teutonic god sitting
on a waterfall, it is a useful reminder of the intensely literary
preoccupations which still underlay people's approach to landscape in art.
To make this point sink in all the better and to tie in the English to the
German experience, make sure not to miss the Tate Gallery's enthralling
exhibition Turner and Byron (until 20 September: sponsored by TSB).
In the final room, which is largely given over to the revivalist movement of
the Nazarene Brotherhood, figures become as important as landscape. The
Nazarenes' admiration (political as well as aesthetic) for the art of
Altdorfer and the Rhineland school shows itself clearly in Moritz von
Schwind's drawing of a hermit wading along a stream through the depths of a
forest which is, with its grappling tree roots and ivy, extraordinarily
alive.
Von Schwind and his Nazarene friends also looked to legends of the heroic
middle ages, as in his large drawing showing a crusader returning home with
a baptised Saracen princess who was to become his bigamous second wife.
But for all the attractive discoveries to make - a study of medlars by
Horny, Richter's Rest on the Flight into Egypt, the fairy-tale idylls by
Schnorr von Carlsfeld - it is the German Romantic artist almost everyone has
heard of who still steals the show.
There are four landscape sketches by Caspar David Friedrich, two of them not
seen before. They take us from the artist's youth through the period of fame
and relative fortune, into his sad old age.
A sepia landscape near Teplitz, painted in recollection, is one of the last
efforts by a man whose strength had ebbed almost to nothing. And yet it is a
miracle of subtlety and pathos, something to hold a viewer spellbound and
humbled.
Neo-Classical and Romantic at the Fitzwilliam, Cambridge, ends on 13
September: closed on Mondays. Certain permanent galleries may be closed in
the morning: ring (0223) 332900.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: The Challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE quest for new life in the musical continues. The Mercury Workshop,
formed in April, is a group of songwriters committed to furnishing new work
for the musical stage, over two dozen of them. Their patron is Stephen
Sondheim, with whom many of them have studied.
This collective's first project, The Challenge, was given on Sunday night at
the Shaw Theatre, where it was handsomely performed and rapturously
received.
As The Challenge proceeded, I became reluctantly grateful for its
professionalism, for the fact that it relied little on scenic effects, and
for its intention to keep entertaining its audience by intelligent means.
The oddest feature of The Challenge is its subject. It tells the tale of
Daedalus, the arch-craftsman of mythological Crete, who:
constructed an artificial cow in whose framework Queen Pasiphae could
copulate with her husband Minos's prize bull;
planned the famous labyrinth which would hide the resulting progeny, the
monstrous Minotaur;
devised wings so he and his son Icarus could escape from Minos, but lost
Icarus, who flew too near the sun.
Needless to say, lyricists had a field-day with the dirty thoughts suggested
by Pasiphae and the bull. My loudest laugh came after Daedalus had used the
word 'lovable' to Pasiphae. Kit Hesketh-Harvey had her song: 'Love a bull?
Funny you should say that. . .'
Boy-girl romance has to wait till Theseus and Ariadne in Act Two, but then
receives a pretty flood of pop ardour with Eric Woolfson's 'If I ever see
that face again.' When they meet a second time they start to reprise this
tune but - felicitous touch - the chorus shut them up.
The Challenge doesn't relieve my gloom about the state of the musical,
because, like the rest of them, it just isn't musical enough. Still, in
every way it already surpasses dozens of musicals professionally presented
in recent years on either side of the Atlantic.

REPEATS, repeats, repeats: the television companies have seemingly packed it
in and gone away for the summer, leaving a batch of old comedy series to
fill the screens.
Still there are always takers for Dad's Army (BBC 1 at 8pm), and Colin's
Sandwich, featuring Mel Smith (BBC 2 at 8.30) deserves a second chance to
make an impact.
Pick of the night is Town Hall (BBC 2 at 9.45). The series was fortunate in
catching Lewisham Council when its councillors and senior managers had to
cope with a major cash crisis, but even so this is the finest insight yet
into how political decisions that actual effect our lives are cobbled
together.
It should not matter that this is a dud night for television - there is
always the radio. The Prom on Radio 3 at 7.30 features a new work by Simon
Holt for solo viola and orchestra as well as Holst's 'Planets Suite', plus
some Benjamin Britten.
Is there life after Fleet Street? (Radio 4 at 8.30), has Stephen Pile
investigating the 'Street of Shame' now the press has moved to more sober
premises elsewhere.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Gerry Mulligan Tentet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL-STAR gatherings often disappoint. The idea of several 'greats' all
swinging together in big bands is hard to resist and sells tickets. But the
promised synergy rarely materialises, as was the case on this last
star-studded night of the JVC Capital Radio Jazz Parade which featured The
Gerry Mulligan Tentet and the New York Jazz Giants.
Mulligan and his tentet are celebrating the legacy of the late Miles Davis
and The birth of the cool sessions in particular. 'The Cool' was born in
1948 in the hot basement room of a New York Chinese laundry where arranger
Gil Evans lived. He and Miles Davis were looking for a new sound which had
echoes of the Claude Thornhill orchestra for which Evans then arranged and
Mulligan played.
Most of the ingredients for a successful rebirth were in place at the
Festival Hall and Mulligan's big band is an inflated version of the Miles
Davis Capitol Band which recorded in 1949/50. The tentet retains the French
horn and tuba (Bill Barber was an original member) and adds a tenor. Lee
Konitz sits in his old place and, in Miles' stead, for the season's live
performances at least, there are the warm tones of Art Farmer. The old tunes
 -'Boplicity', 'Moon Dreams' and 'Jeru' - are interspersed with favourite
Mulligan and Farmer originals like 'The Flying Scotsman' and 'Blueport'.
Poor sound balance which washed out the subtle orchestral colours achieved
by Evans' arrangements and indifferent, sometimes sluggish playing from
Konitz conspired to disappoint, however.
The pleasure of hearing Mulligan's weaving and agile baritone is
undiminished, especially set against his old sparring partner Art Farmer's
flugelhorn. But the beauty of the short, sighing original arrangements for
the ten pieces needs a separation in sound which was lacking on Saturday
night and it took all of Mulligan's baritone torque to pull the ensemble
along.
Money might have been better spent on the recently released CD (The Rebirth
of Cool, GRP Records GRD-9679) which covers the old ground in studio
conditions.
The New York Jazz Giants, on first, suffered a similar problem with their
combination of standards and originals. Jon Faddis (trumpet), Bobby Watson
(alto sax), Lew Tabackin (tenor sax) and Mulgrew Miller (piano), with a
lively rhythm section, promised more than they could deliver in the face of
mushy sound quality.

<TEXT>
Martin Coyne (above left) is taking over as chief executive at JCB
Excavators, the Staffordshire group which is one of the UK's largest
privately-owned businesses.
His accession is part of a reshuffle at the top of JCB, consequent upon the
retirement, after 30 years in the company, of Gilbert Johnston the
long-serving current chief executive.
Johnston becomes deputy chairman.
JCB, which places a premium on continuity, tends to fill its top jobs
internally so the appointment of Coyne does not presage a sudden shake-up.
Although Coyne is not interested in change for the sake of change, he notes
that 'this is very much a changing world; anyone not comfortable with change
is going to be in difficulties.'
Indeed, his road through JCB and his reputation in the company are
associated with new ventures. Now he is sponsoring internal innovation with
the introduction to JCB of its version of total quality management. Earlier
he had taken JCB into the mini-excavator market and forged a joint venture
with Sumitomo, the Japanese group.
Recently Japan has been playing a big part in his life. His son, a
biotechnology graduate, is teaching English in Japan. His daughter is
training to be an engineer.
Coyne, 52, is a graduate of Ford; he joined JCB in 1975, the same year that
Johnston became chief executive.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Technology: The 'right' price to pay for a PC - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharpest indictment of the computer industry's failure to persuade the
broader business community of the value of its products, in Europe if not in
the US, is the widely held conviction that there is suppressed demand for
PCs which will only be released when prices fall to the 'right' level.
It is more than a conviction; there is plenty of evidence from Amstrad's
success with its word processors that people are prepared to experiment with
an unfamiliar technology if the price is low enough.
Ordinary market economics dictate that price has a marked influence on
demand. The volume of people taking intercontinental flights or package
holidays abroad increases as air ticket prices fall; the number of car
owners rises as prices fall within the reach of the average pocket.
But the idea that the market for personal computers will explode when the
price falls to, say, Pounds 500, puts the most powerful business machines
ever invented in the same category as expensive electronic consumer products
like hi-fi sound systems or high-definition television.
Large organisations purchasing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of personal
computers a year are not part of this pattern, although lower PC prices do
increase their flexibility - they can buy rather than rent, drive different
kinds of bargains with their suppliers and spread information technology
more widely through their organisations.
But for smaller businesses, the price/demand syndrome suggests that PCs are
a 'nice-to-have' rather than 'have-to-have' option, unlike, say, a delivery
truck or, perhaps, a portable telephone. No one questions the need a
business has for a delivery truck. But the business benefits of PCs are by
no means so obvious.
It is common knowledge that many large organisations are dissatisfied with
their investment in information technology, including personal computers, so
perhaps it is not surprising that some of this disaffection should have
trickled down to smaller companies.
But large companies are not dissatisfied with their use of computers for
bread-and-butter purposes - word processing, accountancy and payroll. They
are chiefly disappointed by their lack of success in so-called
competitive-edge applications where technology should have given them an
advantage over their rivals.
There is no reason why a smaller organisation should not come up with a
competitive-edge application, but common sense dictates that their primary
aim in computerisation should be to drive some cost out of the business.
Clearly, many have not valued this opportunity at, say, Pounds 3,500, the
cost of a state-of-the-art system a couple of years ago. How many will value
it at today's price of Pounds 1,000 or less?
There are other interpretations. Some argue that low prices make it easier
for customers to buy more computers or more sophisticated computers, and
there is much in that. Yet in Europe suspicions linger that PCs are an
adornment rather than critical to a business.
It is hard to blame hardware manufacturers. Aircraft manufacturers have no
influence on the direction in which their products will fly any more than
hi-fi manufacturers can dictate their customers' choice of compact discs.
It is interesting, however, that IBM is ploughing some Dollars 60m into a
European media campaign designed to spread awareness of personal computing.
Software is another matter. Vast strides have been taken to make packaged
software simpler to use and more attractive, but there is much further to
go.
Business computing has been an act of faith for too long, and better
software - 'softer' software as the jargon would have it - must play a big
part in proving the benefits of the technology.
Until the advantages of computing to the small business are obvious and
unequivocal it is hard to see what basis there can be for agreement on the
'right' price for a personal computer.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Technology: Anit-sense therapy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI-SENSE therapy uses a short synthetic strand of nucleotides, the
chemical building blocks of genes, to stop the production of disease-related
proteins. Every gene has two complementary nucleotide strands, which
together form the famous double helix of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The
nucleotides in one strand are said to have a 'sense' sequence and the other
has an 'anti-sense' sequence. The drawing above shows that a synthetic
anti-sense strand (1), known as an oligonucleotide, can be used in two
alternative ways.
It binds to the 'sense' strand of the gene's double-stranded DNA and
produces a triple-stranded structure which switches off the gene (2).
It binds to the single-stranded RNA (ribonucleicacid) which the gene
generates as a first step to producing protein (3). This blocks protein
synthesis without permanently inactivating the gene (4). Although a whole
gene may have several thousand nucleotide units, anti-sense drugs are much
smaller molecules with 15 to 25 units. This is long enough to make them
completely specific; each will recognise a specific sequence in the target
gene, without binding to any of the 100,000 other human genes.
Pure oligonucleotides are not suitable for pharmaceutical development
because enzymes would break them down before they reached their targets.
Therefore anti-sense drugs are chemical derivatives, such as
methylphosphonates, which are more stable than natural molecules and better
able to enter cells.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Technology: Fresh water in the gene pool / Exploring the
role which genetic drugs will play in curing diseases at their source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An entirely new generation of drugs that acts directly on human genes is
likely to transform the pharmaceutical industry over the next two decades.
Genetic drug sales could be worth tens of billions of dollars a year within
20 years.
Almost every drug today acts on proteins, the chemicals that do the work in
all living creatures from viruses to people.
But the rapid expansion of genetic knowledge has made it possible to target
drugs at the original cause of trouble, the genes that tell cells exactly
which proteins to make. Already scientists know the sequence and function of
thousands of genes in humans and other animals, plants and micro-organisms,
and they expect within 15 years to have discovered all of the estimated
100,000 genes which provide the blueprint for every human being.
Genetic drugs can be aimed either at defective genes in the patient's own
cells or at infectious organisms such as viruses. They promise cures for
diseases that are hard to treat with existing medicines. And their
'exquisite specificity', to use a favourite phrase of biotechnologists, will
avoid the side-effects of today's protein-based drugs.
There are two broad categories of genetic drug, both just beginning clinical
trials:
Gene therapy involves inserting new genes into cells to produce therapeutic
proteins in the body.
Anti-sense therapy or code blocking is the opposite process - switching off
genes so that they stop making harmful proteins.
A common view in the biotechnology industry last year was that anti-sense
had more commercial potential than gene therapy, at least for the medium
term, because it is in principle a simpler process.
A specific gene can be switched off by a molecule small enough to be made by
orthodox chemical synthesis. Gene therapy, on the other hand, requires a
whole new gene - thousands of times larger than an anti-sense drug - which
has to be made by biotechnology. There also appeared to be immense problems
in delivering new genes to the cells where they are needed and getting them
to work there.
Over the last few months anti- sense research has continued to make
progress. Isis Pharmaceuticals of California has started clinical trials of
an anti-sense drug to treat human papilloma virus (which causes genital
warts and cervical cancer), and several other US companies specialising in
anti-sense technology - including Genta, Gilead, Hybridon and TargeTech -
are developing drugs aimed at a wide variety of diseases. Their targets
include: viral infections such as hepatitis B, Aids and herpes; leukaemia
and other cancers; and inflammatory disorders.
But gene therapy is moving forward even faster, on both the scientific and
the commercial fronts, and the view emerging in the pharmaceutical industry
is that it will eventually be more important than anti-sense technology.
Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) carried out the
first human gene therapy trial in September 1990 on a four-year-old girl,
who had to be kept apart from other children because one defective gene in
her immune system meant that she had no natural protection against
infection. Every month since then she has received a transfusion of about a
billion of her own blood cells to which copies of the correct gene had been
added (the treatment has to be repeated because the genetically engineered
cells gradually die). Her immune defences are now strong enough for her to
attend school normally.
That success had led to a flood of proposals for gene therapy experiments in
the US, where the clinical development of genetic medicine is well ahead of
Europe and Japan. The American regulators have already approved about 20
clinical trials and, as with anti-sense, start-up companies are rushing to
exploit the technology.
Therapy Inc (GTI), based in Maryland near NIH and enjoying a close
relationship with the pioneering gene therapy researchers there. Others
include Somatix Therapy, Viagene, Targeted Genetics, Trans-karyotic
Therapies and Vical.
The range of treatments proposed for gene therapy is even wider than for
anti-sense. They fall into two main categories:
Replacing faulty or missing human genes. Candidates for treatment in the
near future include inherited single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis
and haemophilia. Eventually it may be possible to treat combinations of
genetic faults - with heart disease and degenerative brain disease the most
valuable targets.
Giving the patient's own cells the ability to produce a therapeutic protein
that is not normally present in the body. This has potential for treating
many forms of cancer.
Even after the rapid progress of the last few years, however, researchers
still have to overcome several technical problems if gene therapy and
anti-sense are to become mass market treatments. Most important of all is to
develop better ways of enabling the genetic therapeutics to reach the cells
where they are needed.
The first generation of anti-sense drugs is not designed to reach difficult
sites inside the body. Genta is applying them to bone marrow cells removed
temporarily from the body (to switch off a cancer-causing gene in
leukaemia), and Isis is targeting viral genes in herpes or papilloma
infections on or near the skin.
All the early gene therapy trials use genetically engineered viruses to
insert new genes into the patient's cells. Although the virus is disabled to
prevent it causing any harm, researchers cannot rule out the slight risk
that it might stimulate a latent infection or even trigger cancer.
But new delivery systems are in prospect for both categories of genetic
treatment. Anti-sense drugs are being linked to other chemicals which make
them permeate cells more effectively, and non-viral vectors are being
developed for gene therapy.
Until recently the established pharmaceutical giants had left gene-based
medicine to academic scientists and biotechnology start-ups. They are now
scrambling to catch up, by starting research in-house and forming alliances
with the specialist biotech companies.
Isis, for example, has partnerships with Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, Eisai of
Japan and Rhone-Poulenc of France. Gilead, its competitor, has a
collaborative research agreement with Glaxo of the UK. GTI is working with
Sandoz of Switzerland - which has shown more interest in gene therapy than
any other large pharmaceutical company.
Researchers talk of total sales of genetic drugs running into tens of
billion of dollars within 20 years, though such estimates are highly
speculative. Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co, Californian investment analysts, say
the US gene therapy market for just three cancers (renal, ovarian and
melanoma) is potentially worth Dollars 1.2bn a year - based on a cost of
Dollars 15,000 per patient. That seems expensive but it may be an acceptable
price for a treatment which saves not only the patient's life but also tens
of thousands of dollars in hospital fees.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Jubilee extension 'under threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may use the collapse of Canary Wharf as an excuse for
cancelling the Jubilee Line Tube extension, according to an administrator to
the insolvent office project in London's Docklands, Vanessa Houlder writes.
Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, who is an administrator to
the project, said yesterday: 'It does seem illogical that if you're talking
about a Pounds 1.7bn extension cost and you compare that with O&amp;Y's
contribution that that would be the reason for cancelling the whole project
. . . It seems that the collapse of Canary Wharf is being used as an
excuse.'
Olympia &amp; York, Canary Wharf's developers, had agreed to contribute Pounds
170m towards the extension.
No agreement was signed to help to fund the extension before the project
went into administration, the administrators emphasised.
Mr Adamson also indicated that the government was interested in taking
between 700,000 and 900,000 sq ft of office space in Canary Wharf for the
relocation of civil servants.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Woolwich wins its six-year tax battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government received a rebuke from the Law Lords yesterday as Woolwich
Building Society won the final round in its six-year battle to reclaim
overpaid tax with interest.
Lord Goff of Chieveley described Woolwich's battle to get the Inland Revenue
to repay tax exacted without lawful authority as courageous. 'This case is
of importance not only to the Woolwich but also to the future of law,' he
said.
His words will encourage five other societies whose attempts to reclaim
millions of pounds of overpayments of composite-rate tax have been blocked
by retroactive legislation.
Woolwich's difficulties date back to 1986, when the government introduced
composite-rate tax for building society accounts. Societies with financial
year-ends in the middle of the tax year ended up paying some tax under the
old and some under the new system.
The Lords' ruling establishes that Woolwich was repaid Pounds 91m as of
right and not at the discretion of the Inland Revenue.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Shetlanders worry about keeping their prosperity afloat:
James Buxton is warned that the thriving economy of a remote group of
islands 'could fall on its face very quickly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Fraser identifies a problem, most unusual in Britain today, that
confronts the Shetland Islands. He describes it as 'our very low rate of
unemployment'.
Unemployment in Shetland has been static at roughly 4 per cent for several
years. In effect, the islands have virtually full employment. For Mr Fraser,
who runs Shetland Enterprise, the local development agency, that means 'it
can be difficult to convince people that in a few years' time their jobs
could be gone'.
If the 22,000 Shetlanders, who inhabit the northernmost point of the UK, do
not sound particularly worried, that is understandable. Each day almost 1m
barrels of oil pass through the Sullom Voe oil terminal from the Brent and
Ninian fields in the North Sea.
Shetland benefits from the 520 jobs at the British Petroleum terminal and
from hundreds of other oil-related jobs as well as through disturbance
payments and harbour dues from tankers. Islanders also benefit from rent and
rates paid to Shetland Islands Council, which enable it to spend heavily on
welfare projects and on helping local businesses through grants.
Shetland exudes quiet prosperity, but its population has not sunk into the
idleness of a rentier oil state in spite of the modest cushion of
accumulated funds in the council's Charitable Trust, which amounts to about
Pounds 135m, and the reserve fund for commercial projects of more than
Pounds 30m.
Shetland still makes much of its living from fish. Almost a third of the
region's 10,000-strong labour force works in the fish industry, including
fishermen, fish processors and salmon farmers.
'We are more dependent on fish than any other part of the EC,' says Mr John
Goodlad, secretary of the Shetland Fishermen's Association. 'Without
fishing, the future of this community is doubtful.'
That Shetland is a hive of activity unrelated to oil is obvious to any
visitor: the splendid harbour at Lerwick, the capital, is alive with
powerful-looking fishing boats, ferries and the odd Russian cruise ship.
Elsewhere crofts, making a living from the unpromising grazing, dot the
landscape.
Some of the islands' historic speciality of making knitwear continues and at
least one company, Judane, exports garments to Japan that are produced on
computer-controlled knitting machines.
Yet, according to Mr Fraser, 'Shetland is a vigorous economy that could fall
on its face very quickly.' The Sullom Voe terminal is in decline. Opened in
1981 and laid out to enable expansion to deal with throughput of 3m b/d, it
reached its all-time one-day peak of 1.5m b/d in 1985. Parts of it have
already been dismantled, while one of the four tanker loading berths has
been mothballed.
Mr Rod Walker, British Petroleum's terminal manager, says that Shell and
Chevron, operators of the fields feeding the terminal, are committed to
using it until 2000, but warns that throughput may by then have fallen to
300,000 b/d - the level at which it becomes uneconomic.
If throughput of gas declined seriously, Sullom Voe would not be able to run
its power station from gas and would have to import electricity. It might
have to stop separating the gas from oil, which is part of its raison
d'etre.
'We've got to find more oil out there, and compete for the oil that is found
with other methods of transporting it,' says Mr Walker. The Clair field,
about 50 miles west of Shetland, is now being explored and might use Sullom
Voe, but it may not be until 2000 that development begins, and that may be
too late for Sullom Voe.
At the council, Mr Malcolm Green, the chief executive, says the local
authority expects the 'final days of the terminal' - and thus of the
council's oil income - will come between 2005 and 2010. Aware that money
will become tighter, the council is reorganising itself and replacing grants
for businesses with a system of loans.
The fishing industry also presents an uncertain picture. In the white-fish
industry, fishermen are frustrated at regulations requiring 135 days of
tie-up a year to conserve stocks.
The near-surface fishery - fishing for herring and mackerel - once depended
largely on selling its catch to 50 or more factory ships from the former
eastern bloc, the so-called Klondykers which came every summer to process
herring in Lerwick harbour.
Fewer Klondykers are expected this year, and Mr Goodlad believes that in two
or three years this type of factory ship will have become uneconomic in the
market economies of eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the remaining Klondykers
depress the market for the Shetland fish-processing plants, as they now sell
their output on the open market instead of disposing of it behind the Iron
Curtain.
The salmon farmers are cutting production because the market has been
depressed by Norwegian overproduction, although Mr James Moncrieff of the
Shetland Salmon Farmers Association believes prices will improve in the next
few months as excess supply ends.
Mr Goodlad is optimistic. 'The Shetland fish industry is at the leading edge
of technology,' he says, and points to the gleaming new North Atlantic
Fisheries College at Scalloway. It is a striking example of how Shetland
invests its oil money: it cost Pounds 6m, most of it from the council, and
has the latest equipment to teach nautical studies, marine engineering,
aquaculture and fish processing.
It is part of Shetland's preparations for the future. 'Our businesses have
to be very efficient to compete with anyone given the high cost of transport
to the mainland,' says Mr Jack Burgess, the council's development director.
'The council does help them, but there's no rush of companies coming to take
advantage of what we offer here.'
'The Shetlanders are very adaptable people,' says Mr Fraser of Shetland
Enterprise. 'But we're saying to them: You should start thinking about what
you're going to do when the oil runs out.'

FT  21 JUL 92 / Lords set limit on right to silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENDANTS in fraud cases can no longer automatically use their right to
silence to avoid answering questions in civil proceedings, the House of
Lords ruled yesterday.
The judgment is likely to make it considerably easier for liquidators to
track down and recover missing funds in future fraud cases.
Giving judgment in the case of AT&amp;T Istel v Mr Arthur Tully, five law lords
ruled by 4 - 1 that a Court of Appeal decision restoring Mr Tully's right to
silence should be overturned.
Mr Tully had originally successfully challenged a High Court ruling that he
should provide details of transactions and assets to victims of his alleged
fraud.
Lord Templeman yesterday described the use of the right to silence in civil
proceedings as 'an archaic and unjustifiable survival from the past'.
'It is difficult to see any reason why in civil proceedings the privilege
against self-incrimination should be exerciseable so as to enable a litigant
to refuse relevant and even vital documents which are in his possession or
power and which speak for themselves.
'The Court of Appeal reached their decision with regret because they clearly
saw Mr Tully is seeking to exploit the privilege against self-incrimination
in order to frustrate the plaintiff's claims.'
The Crown Prosecution Service had stated that it would not seek to use any
information given by Mr Tully to other parties in civil proceedings.
'There is no reason why the privilege should be blatantly exploited to
deprive the plaintiffs of their civil rights and remedies if the privilege
is not necessary to protect Mr Tully,' Lord Templeman continued.
Although not directly applicable to the work of commons committees, the
ruling may ease the task of the Commons' social security committee in its
future investigations into the disappearance of the Maxwell pension funds.
The committee is likely to interview some of those who held key roles in the
Maxwell organisation, including Mr Michael Stoney, the former finance
director of Mirror Group Newspapers, and Mr Robert Bunn, the former finance
director of the Maxwell private companies.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Boycott threat to finance watchdog: Life companies demand
uniform stance by new SRO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE insurance companies are threatening to boycott a proposed
self-regulatory body for retail financial services unless all other
organisations that sell the products, such as banks and building societies,
are also forced to join.
The life companies argue that unless there is uniform regulation of the sale
of all retail financial products - such as life insurance, unit trusts and
personal pensions bought by individuals - some distributors will have
advantages over others and consumers will suffer.
The proposed regulator, the Private Investment Authority, is unlikely to
succeed unless the leading life insurers agree to join it and support it
financially. If regulators cannot find a suitable structure to regulate
retail financial services, the government may have to review aspects of the
Financial Services Act.
Under the act, all financial service providers must belong to a
self-regulatory organisation, but have the right to choose which one. They
also have the option of being directly regulated by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
While life insurance companies belong to Lautro, the self-regulatory body
for the insurance and unit trust industries, the independent advisory arms
of building societies are regulated by SIB. The financial services arms of
banks are typically members of Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund
management industry.
The membership rules and fees of all three vary.
The new authority was proposed by Sir Kenneth Clucas, a former senior civil
servant who was commissioned by SIB to review the regulatory structure for
retail financial services.
Fimbra, the regulator for independent financial intermediaries, is not
considered financially viable because its members, often small or one-person
businesses, lack the resources to make substantial contributions. In
1991-92, life companies will have to pay Pounds 14m towards the Investors
Compensation Scheme which should have been paid by Fimbra members.
Hence Sir Kenneth proposed merging Fimbra with Lautro to form the Private
Investment Authority. He also suggested that the large financial
intermediaries, about a third of Imro's members, should join the proposed
authority.
The insurance companies say they want SIB to encourage banks and building
societies to join the new authority by refusing to regulate any firm
directly unless it has been refused membership of another self-regulatory
body. They are also urging an increase in SIB membership fees.
Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of Prudential Financial Services,
said: 'We support the formation of the PIA but we regard it as absolutely
essential that it covers all the financial services covered by the Financial
Services Act.'
Privately the SIB is reluctant to coerce companies to join any particular
self-regulatory body because they have the right of choice and because a
regulator with a reluctant membership is unlikely to work well.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Ruling sought from EC courtover delisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Court of Justice is to be asked to rule on whether European
Community law gives shareholders, as distinct from a company, a right to be
heard when the Stock Exchange is considering delisting a company's shares.
A High Court judge yesterday referred the issue to the Luxembourg court in
the context of a challenge by shareholders in Titaghur, a Scottish-based
jute company, to the delisting of its shares in December 1990.
The Stock Exchange said last night that it had been advised that there need
be no reference to the European court and it would be seeking to establish
this in the Court of Appeal.
The shareholders - Else (1982); Mr Leonard Brealey, brother of Titaghur
chairman Mr Reginald Brealey; and Mr Gerard Thomas, a Scottish solicitor -
had sought a judicial review to quash the delisting decision, made by the
committee on quotations of the International Stock Exchange.
A ruling in Luxembourg in favour of the shareholders would nullify the
committee's decision and require it to reconsider the delisting.
Titaghur's shares were suspended in June 1988. Mr Reginald Brealey was
charged with insider dealing, but the Crown Prosecution Service offered no
evidence at his trial.
Mr Justice Popplewell said yesterday the first issue was whether the
shareholders had the legal standing to seek judicial review. He was
satisfied they did not - unless they had had the right to be heard by the
committee.
That depended on the interpretation of the European Commission's 1979
admissions directive co-ordinating the conditions for the admission of
securities to official Stock Exchange listing in EC states.
The shareholders argued that Article 15 of the directive made clear that, as
investors, shareholders had a right to be heard.
The Stock Exchange, whose practice when considering suspension or delisting
is to hear only the officers of the company, disputed that.
A European Court ruling was needed to enable the English court to decide the
issue, the judge said.
Rejecting the shareholders' other arguments, the judge said there had been
the required 'special circumstances' justifying the delisting decision, made
on the ground of the inadequacy of Titaghur's accounts.
He rejected 38 allegations of irrationality against the committee. saying it
was 'simply not possible' to say its decision had been unreasonable.
He said he had no doubt the decision had not been disproportionate to the
damage it had been designed to prevent. The shareholders, who say if the
delisting decision were to be set aside they would be entitled to damages,
may appeal.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Waldegrave outlines Charter's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Citizen's Charter amounts to a reinvention of the role of government, Mr
William Waldegrave, minister for public service, said yesterday.
Mr Waldegrave, speaking to the Institute of Directors, re-asserted the
government's commitment to privatising services still performed by the
public sector. He also highlighted the need to devise mechanisms to bring a
substitute for competition into public services where privatisation was not
possible. 'We have had to restore the principle that the government's job is
to govern, not to administer; to steer, not to row,' he said.
Where services did still have to be provided by the state, management
improvements in Whitehall should include delegating financial responsibility
and establishing clear purchaser-provider relationships.
Mr Waldegrave rejected the claim from some MPs that the establishment of
Next Steps agencies, in which parts of the Civil Service were turned into
executive bodies, diluted public accountability. Such moves improved
existing accountability, he argued, by providing a counterweight to the
centralisation of power in 'a pull downwards and outwards - to the local
provider, the user and the local community'.
However, the initiative was attacked last night by Lord Scarman, the former
law lord. He said the charter would be ineffective without legal rights -
including freedom of information and rights of redress in the courts.
Although charters could be valuable in improving public services such as
transport, health, water and gas, without the protection of a written
constitution they would not be enough to ensure higher standards.
Lord Scarman also called for a convention to draw up such a constitution,
and announced that Charter 88, the pressure group for constitutional reform,
would establish a 'citizen's inquiry'.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Midland ends fees for supplying cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK said yesterday that it had halted an initiative by local
managers to charge for supplying small businesses with cash across the
counter.
The move followed a letter from the bank's Sheffield area office to hundreds
of Midland's business customers in the Yorkshire area, including publicans
and shopkeepers, telling them that they would have to pay for all cash
supplied across the counter.
Small businesses in Dewsbury and Barnsley were indignant that they would be
charged Pounds 1.50 per Pounds 100 of cash exchanged, with a minimum of
Pounds 2 per transaction. Customers without a Midland account would be
charged more.
Payment would have been deducted from the customer's account the following
day or taken in cash at the time the money was handed over.
Midland said yesterday: 'It was a local area initiative. We don't want to be
too specific about who took the decision, because it might cause
embarrassment, but it was stopped by head office as soon as they heard about
it.'

FT  21 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors win vote on deal

<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have
been given a final chance to vote on the once-and-for-all compensation plan
worked out by the bank's liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority
shareholders.
The result will delay the Abu Dhabi package, but the bank's liquidators, led
by Mr Brian Smouha of Touche Ross, were unable to say last night whether the
delay threatened the survival of the compensation plan. If the package is
not threatened, the liquidators will almost certainly be forced to
renegotiate it.
A Luxembourg judge yesterday told the liquidators that she would not deliver
a final judgment on the compensation package until the unsecured creditors
had been allowed to express a firm 'yes' or 'no' to it.
The judge, Mrs Maryse Welter, ordered liquidators to complete their
consultation with the creditors by October 1. A further hearing will be held
in Luxembourg on October 7 to discuss the results of any poll.
The judge offered no immediate explanation of her decision, which was
consistent with the suggestions of the Grand Duchy's state prosecutor in his
summing-up this month.
Earlier this year Touche Ross and Abu Dhabi said that, for the compensation
deal to take effect, it needed the support of creditors by the end of
November. With the Luxembourg ruling not due until early October, it seemed
inevitable yesterday that that deadline would not be met.
The compensation plan requires formal approval from the court in Luxembourg,
where BCCI had its brass-plate headquarters. The package, which would
involve a payment to creditors of between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.7bn,
has already been approved by courts in Britain and the Cayman Islands.
On Friday a group of creditors failed in their appeal against the British
court decision.
The judge's ruling will keep alive the hopes of many small creditors who are
dissatisfied with the deal struck by the liquidators.
Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on BCCI,
said: 'It's a brilliant decision and the first court decision which will
please creditors and former depositors in Britain.'

FT  21 JUL 92 / Groggy pound hauled back from the brink: Peter Marsh says
talk of sterling devaluation will not end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG battalions of the world's central banks yesterday helped pull the
pound back from the brink. Even so, the worries over sterling may not yet be
over.
After scares about a possible sterling devaluation, the pound was looking
groggy before concerted intervention on foreign exchange markets succeeded
in lifting the currency.
It closed last night in London against the D-Mark at DM2.8425, nearly 1 1/2
pfennigs up on the day's low of DM2.8282. That level, reached about
lunchtime, represented the pound's lowest value against the German currency
since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990.
The thrust of yesterday's operation - involving leading north American and
European central banks, including the Bank of England - was to sell D-Marks
for dollars.
The action was designed primarily to prevent the US currency from sliding to
its all-time low against the D-Mark. The German currency has gained strength
in recent weeks, particularly after last Thursday's tightening in interest
rates by the Bundesbank.
Allowing the D-Mark to continue its appreciation against the dollar, a move
exacerbated by recent interest rate cuts in the US and concern about the
faltering US economy, was in few countries' interests.
In the past week, the rampant German currency has led to serious strains in
the ERM. It has caused Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands to increase their
borrowing rates.
The strong D-Mark also threatened rises in interest rates in other European
nations, Britain included  just when they want to make borrowing cheaper to
stimulate their flagging economies. Meanwhile, the weak dollar has also
provoked concern on Wall Street.
Hence yesterday's move by the central banks - led by the US Federal Reserve
and the Bundesbank, and the first concerted intervention on such a scale
since last July - came as little surprise.
The immediate effect was to lift the dollar from DM1.447 before the action
to a close last night in Europe of DM1.4815. As pressure on all other ERM
currencies eased as a result of the weaker D-Mark, the pound firmed.
Doubts remain that sterling is out of the woods. The last time it suffered
similar fragility was in January, just after an earlier round of
interest-rate tightening by the Bundesbank to reduce German inflation
stimulated by unification.
Then, the pound fought its way out of the doldrums. It was helped by strong
statements from government ministers that devaluation was not on the agenda.
That convinced the markets that - at the levels seen in January, of about
DM2.83 or roughly 5 pfennigs above the pound's ERM floor of DM2.78 - the
pound looked cheap and was a good buy.
Six months on, the outlook has worsened. First, the UK recession has lasted
longer than expected. That has increased pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, to bring down base rates from 10 per cent - almost impossible
given the pound's position as the weakest ERM currency.
Second, the prospects for an imminent reduction in German borrowing rates
look far from propitious. Indeed, many commentators expect the Bundesbank to
follow up last week's 0.75 per cent increase in the discount rate - which
mainly affects domestic bank borrowing - with a rise later this year in its
more internationally important Lombard rate, now at 9.75 per cent.
Third, while German short-term rates have moved up, US rates have come down,
increasing the attractiveness to the international investor of the D-Mark
and exacerbating ERM strains.
Finally, there have been increasing doubts - barely evident in January  -
about whether the Maastricht agreement on European economic and monetary
union will unravel. Many investors see Emu and the ERM as linked. If
Maastricht comes finally unstuck, perhaps after a large number of 'no' votes
in the French referendum in September, then the faith of investors in the
ERM as a vehicle for pegging Europe's currencies may be weakened.
Those points explain why talk of a sterling devaluation - perhaps in the
context of an ERM-wide realignment that increases the value of the D-Mark
against the other currencies - is being taken much more seriously in the
markets than in January. It may be a long, hot summer for sterling.

STAFF working part-time, with flexible hours or in job shares perform better

University's Institute of Manpower Studies.
The research into 'family-friendly' policies found that staff working
non-standard hours were considered by their employers to be 'more efficient,
enthusiastic and committed' than full-timers.
The report concludes that 'family-friendly' working could more aptly be
called 'employer-friendly'.
High-street banks, building societies and other large employers including

FT  21 JUL 92 / Money supply figures indicate weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEEBLE June growth figures for money supply yesterday added to evidence that
underlying demand is still weak.
The figures from the Bank of England showed that narrow money, or M0, which
comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation, fell 0.8 per cent last
month, which is the sharpest monthly drop since late 1981.
The fall brought the year-on-year rate of growth of M0 - a good indication
of underlying consumer demand - to 1.3 per cent on a seasonally adjusted
basis, compared with 2.5 per cent in May. Broad money - M4 - rose 0.1 per
cent on the month, leaving the year-on-year rate unchanged at 5.2 per cent.
Figures for lending by banks and building societies were slightly more
encouraging. They showed that lending to the private and corporate sectors -
M4 lending - continued to grow, but only sluggishly.
Lending increased by Pounds 2.5bn last month on a seasonally adjusted basis
compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 2.3bn growth and actual average
growth of Pounds 2.2bn over the previous six months.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Neither broad
money nor credit indicate that the economy is moving downwards again . . .
rather the monetary indicators suggest economic stagnation, and that only a
very slow recovery in growth is in prospect during the rest of this year.'
The Bank's figures were backed up by the British Bankers' Association, the
trade body for Britain's nine biggest banking groups. The association's
figures showed that lending by its members to the private sector grew by
Pounds 1.3bn last month.
Although that was lower than the rises in April and May - Pounds 2.6bn and
Pounds 2.2bn respectively - it was the third consecutive monthly rise.
Lord Inchyra, secretary-general of the association, said: 'If one looks at
longer-term trends there does seem to be some recovery in bank lending from
the low point in March. It is, however, very patchy.'
The association's figures also showed that lending for house purchases
continued to grow modestly but that the consumer credit market remained
inert. Lending for mortgages rose by Pounds 837m last month, compared with
Pounds 596m in March, while lending to consumers rose by Pounds 189m
compared with Pounds 374m in June last year.
Consumer confidence continued to fall during the first two weeks of this
month, according to a survey by Gallup, the market research company.
A total of 31 per cent of the respondents said that they thought the general
economic situation in the country would worsen against 30 per cent who
thought it would improve.
The minus 1 per cent balance of pessimists was the lowest since February
this year, when it was minus 4 per cent. The latest figure compares with
plus 13 per cent only last month.
The survey showed that 70 per cent of respondents expect unemployment to
increase over the next 12 months against only 12 per cent who expect it to
come down.
Those who expect that their household's financial situation will improve
over the next 12 months - 23 per cent - are equally matched by those who
expect it to worsen.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Advisers split over ban on Halcion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPLIT has emerged within UK health authorities over whether to continue a
ban on Halcion, the world's best-selling sleeping treatment.
The ban, imposed last October, precipitated a worldwide health scare about
the drug and a 50 per cent slide in Halcion sales by Upjohn, its leading
manufacturer.
The Medicines Control Agency, the licensing body that acts on behalf of UK
health ministers, proposes to ignore advice by the Medicines Commission, the
UK's senior medicines review body.
The commission has advised that Halcion, also known as triazolam, should be
re-licensed. Doctors should be allowed to prescribe patients doses of
0.125mg and 0.25mg, although only in tablets of 0.125mg, it recommended.
However, health ministers and the agency propose to continue the ban on both
0.125mg and 0.25mg doses. The Department of Health said it believed it was
only the second time the agency had ignored the advice of the commission.
Upjohn said it would appeal.
The agency is bidding to become one of the EC's leading licensing
authorities. New licensing procedures proposed by the European Commission
will allow licensing authorities to compete against each other.
Dr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chief executive, said: 'We're encouraged by the
opinion of the Medicines Commission regarding the 0.125mg tablet. We will
take all the steps we need to in order to get this product restored to
patients and physicians in the UK.'
The decision to ban Halcion in the Uk was based on three sets of data. At
the time, the authorities were concerned about:
A US safety trial in which the UK authorities believed 14 out of 30 subjects
on triazolam had psychiatric side-effects compared with three out of 20 on
placebo.
Pre-marketing trials of more than 14 days that appeared to show that 18.9
per cent of patients on doses of 0.5mg triazolam withdrew compared with 5.4
per cent on placebo.
Spontaneous adverse reactions reported by doctors in the US and UK.
Upjohn says the trials data have been misinterpreted. It also says the
frequency of adverse reaction reporting has a direct relationship to media
attention.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   INCREASING numbers of Lloyd's Names
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market -
are becoming bankrupt, the Bankruptcy Association said yesterday.
Mr John McQueen, chief executive of the organisation which provides advice
to bankrupts, said at least 30 Names had become members of his association.
Names were approaching the association 'in a state of absolute shock,' Mr
McQueen said. 'They can't believe what has happened to them.'
Lloyd's stated last month that it had never driven Names into bankruptcy.
Instead it offers 'hardship' arrangements - in which Names restructure their
debts and agree to accept a modest income and home - to those unable to meet
their commitments.
However, many Names say that the terms of 'hardship' are excessively
onerous. Only 39 Names have so far accep-ted the 'hardship' arrange-ments,
Lloyd's announced last month.
As many as 5,000 of the society's 30,000 Names, underwriting in the
loss-making 1988, 1989 and 1990 years, have borne the brunt of the market's
losses.
Legal action by Lloyd's seeking to recover money owed to it by Names has
escalated sharply over the past three months.
Writs have been issued against 159 Names to recoup Pounds 16.5m earmarked by
Lloyd's from its central fund to meet claims that the Names are either
unwilling or are unable to pay.
Since the end of April, 119 writs have been issued, while debts owed by
Names to the society have climbed by Pounds 12m.
Most of the debts relate to losses incurred during 1988 and in previous
years. These actions are expected to increase once the Pounds 2.06bn of
losses run up during the 1989 underwriting year feeds through the market.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Mortgage rate rise too great a price for bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of the government's First Option Bond has embarrassed the
Treasury, so the Department of National Savings last night took the unusual
step of seeking to make the bond less attractive by cutting the rates
offered on it.
National Savings has been under pressure from the government to compete
against financial-services companies. But at the same time building
societies have been complaining that heavy sales of the new bond could lead
to a rise in mortgage rates. Given the weakness of the housing market and
fears that a recovery is some way off, a mortgage-rate rise - however small
 -is anathema to the government.
On the other hand, substantial sales of the bond would have helped fund its
public sector borrowing requirement - forecast to rise to around Pounds 35bn
this year - but a mortgage-rate increase was too high a price.
The cut in the bond rate, at a time when market interest rates are firm, is
almost without precedent. The only comparison was in the summer of 1984,
when the 28th National Savings issue was withdrawn after just five weeks,
having taken more than Pounds 1bn.
Sales of the latest bond have not been quite as strong as that. It has taken
Pounds 112m in the nine days since its launch on July 7. But that is still
significant for a new product.
The bond can be cashed in without any interest penalties after only a year
and it therefore competes directly with many building-society products. The
10.34 per cent gross rate it paid at launch was significantly more than has
been available at many societies.
The bond has thus apparently been siphoning deposits from building
societies, which could ill afford the outflow. According to figures to be
published by the Building Societies Association on Wednesday, Pounds 315m
flowed out of societies' deposit accounts in June, before the bond was
launched.
In order to retain their savers, societies have been forced to push up
savings rates - which has also put pressure on them to increase mortgage
rates, to prevent an erosion of profits.
On Friday, the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the sixth-biggest
society, raised its home-loans rate from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent.
Other societies, notably the Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-biggest,
warned they would probably follow suit.
But the societies were not only complaining in public. They were also
lobbying behind the scenes. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, said
last night that he met two Treasury ministers - he declined to say which two
 -on Friday to explain why his society had found it necessary to raise its
interest rates.
He added: 'They were understanding and sympathetic. I explained that our
move was entirely investment-related and they fully understood where we were
coming from.'
Today he will decide whether to reduce his mortgage rate to where it was.
Other societies said last night that the reduction in the First Option Bond
rate, to 9.67 per cent, had reduced the pressure on them for increases in
their mortgage ratea - although they stressed that they would nonetheless
need to wait to see whether the outflow of deposits is stemmed before making
a definitive decision.
If societies are pleased with the First Opiton bond rate cut, some investors
may not be. National Savings has been conducting a high-profile advertising
campaign to attract investors.
Anyone who sent in a National Savings coupon from a weekend newspaper will
get the higher rate of interest only if the coupon arrives before noon.
But if their form arrives too late, they will not be forced to invest at the
lower rate. National Savings said it would send these investors a new
prospectus, giving them the option of investing somewhere else altogether -
perhaps in a building society.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Court in the video act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British court system took a step into the technological age yesterday
with the launch of a video designed for jurors.
Topics covered include eligibility for jury service, what happens in court,
and a juror's legal responsibilities including turning up on time and not
discussing the case except with other jurors.
The video - a still from which is shown - was commissioned by the Lord
Chancellor's Department and will be shown to everyone called up for jury
service in England and Wales. It will partly replace the traditional
explanatory talk from the court staff, although they will still be available
to answer questions. Televisions and videos have been installed to show the
video at 45 crown courts.
Jurors are warned that they may spend some time waiting during legal
arguments, and that it is not always possible to predict the length of
trials. Mr John Taylor, parliamentary secretary to the department, said the
new televisions should be available for jurors to watch when not on a case
while the video suggests they should bring along books, crosswords or
knitting.
The video had been tried out at a number of courts around the country and
met with positive reaction, Mr Taylor said. Staff from Wood Green crown
court, north London, where the video was filmed, play all the roles, except
those of the judge, barristers and witness, who are played by actors.

FT  21 JUL 92 / London's extra funding outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the local-government minister, yesterday spelt out the
scale of funds allocated to London by central government, with figures
showing that inner London authorities receive nearly Pounds 900 more for
each adult than country regions.
In outer London, the amount from grants and business rates was about Pounds
300 extra.
The figures - presented to a conference on Europe organised by
local-authority associations - will be used by ministers to defend the
government's plans to introduce a property-based tax in April next year.
London Tories are concerned that the council tax will sharply reduce the
proportion of total government grants to the south-east.
In the current year, the government allocated local authorities more than
Pounds 700 for every adult outside London and other big cities compared with
Pounds 1,000 in outer London and Pounds 1,600 in inner London.
Under the property-based local tax, councils in London and the south-east
will be expected to raise more than if poll tax had continued, because of
the large number of relatively expensive homes in the area. The amount
authorities are expected to raise from poll tax reflects broadly the number
of adults in their areas.
Although final figures are not available, one recent estimate put the shift
in grants away from London at about Pounds 300m.
Mr Redwood's figures also highlighted the difficulties the government may
face in the south-east, outside London. Shires in the north, the north-west
and the Yorkshire and Humberside region all receive at least Pounds 100 a
head more than the southern shires, which are likely to see a fall in their
proportion of government-allocated money.
When the council tax legislation went through parliament, some Tory MPs
expressed fears that the south-east would lose out through the change.

The changes also mean greater costs for the CAA and less for the European

FT  21 JUL 92 / The pulling power of Mexico: President Carlos Salinas
visited the FT yesterday and gave a wide-ranging interview to Stephen Fidler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first visit to Europe as head of state by President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari was a decisive moment in Mexican history. Discovering western Europe
bound up in momentous events to the east, he worried that, in a world where
there was increasing demand for scarce capital, Mexico would be shut out.
A few months later, in early 1990, Mr Salinas announced a 180-degree turn in
policy, declaring he would seek a free trade agreement with the US and
Canada. In doing so, he tied Mexico's economic future ever more inextricably
with that of its northern neighbour.
Back in Europe now, more than two years later, Mr Salinas still worries
about the scarcity of capital and the prospect that resources will be sucked
into eastern and central Europe.
'The awareness of massive migration will mean that you (western Europeans)
will channel more resources to central and eastern Europe, even though they
don't seem to be very profitable,' he said in an interview in London
yesterday.
But these days he worries less. The prospects of a North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) mean, he says, his country has attracted in three years
the amount of foreign investment it was expecting in six. Some 60 per cent
of foreign direct investment is coming from the US, but a substantial amount
is coming from Europe, especially Germany and Britain.
The Mexican finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe, notes that gross capital
inflows last year to Mexico were Dollars 22bn, compared with the promised -
but certainly not disbursed - Dollars 24bn of official help for the Soviet
Union. As an illustration that foreign interest is continuing, Mexico's
securities commission, on which Mr Aspe sits, will consider next week
applications for 18 strategic alliances, including cross-shareholdings, of
Mexican and foreign companies.
The president remains resolutely upbeat about Nafta, despite the protracted
nature of the negotiations. It is, he says, coming along well. His meeting
nine days ago with President George Bush in California confirmed the
commitment of the US administration to the accord. The chief trade
negotiators of Mexico, Canada and the US are to meet on Saturday to attempt
to start the final phase of negotiations.
Mr Salinas says work is still needed in a number of sectors, including the
automobile industry, textiles, agriculture, and energy.
What will result, he says, is a pact compatible with the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) that will offer incentives to other countries in
the region to pursue similar accords. Mexico, he insists, is not turning its
back on Latin America by seeking Nafta.
By the time Nafta is implemented, it will merely reinforce what are already
strengthening economic relations with the US.
Mr Salinas's economic priority remains the conquest of inflation. Mr Aspe
confirmed yesterday an inflation forecast of 10 per cent for this year,
sufficient to avoid a big loss of competitiveness for Mexican industry. (He
expects Mexican productivity to increase 5 per cent this year - four
percentage points greater than the US. A 3 per cent crawling devaluation of
the peso will account for much of the rest of the differential with the US
inflation rate of 3 per cent.)
The economy, Mr Aspe said, continues to grow at double the rate of
population increase, as it has in the last three years, which suggests
continued faith in the forecast of 3-4 per cent growth this year.
President Salinas remains sanguine about Mexico's growing current account
deficit - forecast at Dollars 15bn or 5 per cent of GDP this year. He is
dismissive, too, of the jitters in the country's financial markets over the
last four weeks, caused in part by worries about the apparent hostility to
Nafta expressed by Mr Ross Perot, until last week a prospective US
presidential candidate. The worries, says Mr Salinas, were unfounded even
before Mr Perot withdrew from the campaign. The latter, he says, had assured
the Mexican president privately that he was not opposed to Nafta, although
he could not say so in public.
As to the current account deficit, Mr Aspe reiterated that it is a healthy
sign for a developing economy, not a danger signal. It was, he said, a
result of private sector activity and not caused by the government, which
was running a budget surplus, before substantial privatisation receipts, of
1 per cent of gross domestic product this year.
Privatisations were allowing the government to retire some domestic debt
(now at the relatively low level of 13 per cent of GDP) and, with the money
saved on servicing that debt, it has been able to expand spending on social
programmes - essential to the success of its economic programme - by 70 per
cent in three years.
Exports expanded at 16.8 per cent in the first five months of the year, five
times faster than the economy as a whole, while imports have been growing at
22 per cent. However, consumer goods imports have been expanding less
rapidly - by about 12 per cent, said Mr Aspe - while intermediate goods
imports have risen by 45 per cent.
The one area where Mr Salinas is often accused of not being radical enough
is in reforming Mexico's political system, which his Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) has dominated for 65 years. The president insists
he is committed to further political reform, both of the PRI and of other
parties, but there are clear limits.
But is the PRI really prepared to contemplate alternation of power?
Gubernatorial elections in the states of Chihuahua and Michoacan this month
showed, says Mr Salinas, that the possibility of alternating governments
already exists at a regional level after the victory of the right-wing
National Action Party (PAN) in Chihuahua.
On allegations that the PRI hugely outspent its opponents in Michoacan, Mr
Salinas says a change is required to place legal limits on election
spending: 'We will have to go towards reform in terms of putting ceilings on
high spending and make election financing more transparent.'
The Mexican president says his main task is to make sure the broad process
of reform 'takes root in Mexican society and is part of the social consensus
we have been building.'
He knows this will take time, which is perhaps why he remains evasive on
fundamental questions of political reform, such as possible change to the
secretive system by which a president chooses his successor. 'It's too early
to talk about that,' he says, aware that his six-year term will run until
late-1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVE Newt Gingrich, the mop-headed right-wing Republican from
Georgia, has long been the scourge of the Democrats in Congress, castigating
their politics, their perks and their personal probity.
But the Democrats are now relishing a sweeter revenge than they could have
dreamed of: Mr Gingrich today faces a tough primary election against a
fellow-Republican who has turned all his taunts against him, branding him as
just another Congressional fat cat.
Mr Gingrich's gadfly tongue so irritated the Democrats who dominate Georgian
politics that they seized the opportunity presented by the 10-yearly
redrawing of Congressional district boundaries to squeeze him out of his
home constituency in the suburbs south of Atlanta, which he held by fewer
than 1,000 votes in 1990.
His Republican primary opponent, former state Assemblyman Herman Clark, has
run a venomous campaign, with an echo of Mr Gingrich's own jibes at
Congress. He has attacked Mr Gingrich for voting for a Congressional pay
rise, and for alleged writing of unfunded cheques on the House bank and
abusing Congress members' free mailing privileges.
He even forced the Congressman to give up his chauffeur-driven limousine.
Mr Gingrich's foes are chuckling to see him running a classic incumbent's
campaign, flourishing at the voters his ability to bring money to the
district from the federal pork barrel.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEERING crowds and buoyant polls are carrying Governor Bill Clinton's
campaign to new highs after the Democratic convention last week sealed his
nomination as the party's presidential candidate.
Convention euphoria lifted him in the opinion polls, as expected, and the
withdrawal of Mr Ross Perot appears to have further widened his lead over
President George Bush.
Accompanied by Senator Al Gore, his vice-presidential running-mate, he drew
8,000 supporters yesterday to a rally at Columbus, Ohio, the latest stop in
his 1,000-mile bus tour of eight states in the US heartland.
A Gallup poll, published yesterday by CNN and USA Today, showed Mr Clinton
as the choice of 56 per cent of those questioned, compared with 34 per cent
for Mr Bush.
It also showed Mr Clinton ahead by 20 percentage points in the south and
mid-west, and by 36 points in the north-east. In the west, he led by 13
points.
Clinton campaign officials recognise this advantage will fade. The question
is - how much of it will last, and for how long? Political analysts such as
Mr Charles Cook warn that the euphoria could lead the campaign into wasting
resources on states which might appear winnable now but in which it will
have no real chance in November, as happened to Mr Michael Dukakis in
Florida in 1988.
Texas will offer the hardest choice for the Democrats, Mr Cook warns, as
many believe Mr Perot's withdrawal places the state firmly within the
Republican president's grasp.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Spain takes the lead in headless commonwealth: Madrid's
Ibero-American summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A former colonial power as desperate as Spain is to find a place for
itself in the community of nations it helped to form, the second
Ibero-American summit could not have had a more appropriate launch: the
biggest single foreign investment it has been able to attract in a decade
has come from Mexico.
Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) announced two weeks ago that it was to spend
Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 650m) buying the pride of the Spanish cement
business, Valenciana, and yesterday agreed to pay a further Dollars 600m for
the second-biggest Spanish producer, Sanson.
Montezuma's revenge? Not exactly but, in reaching out to its former
colonies, democratic Spain has found them to be much harder going than the
conquistadors did. Latin Americans are often richer, smarter and prouder
than Spaniards like to regard them as being.
At the summit, which is to start in Madrid on Thursday, Spain will be
sitting down with equals, just as it was at pains to do last year in Mexico
with the leaders of 23 Latin American countries and Portugal.
But that Guadalajara summit was a test simply of Ibero-American will to sit
around a table together. The one in Madrid will try to do something.
For Spain, concrete achievement is crucial. Even after more than a decade of
democracy, Spain has just over 3 per cent of its trade with its former
American colonies and cannot even claim to have been hurt much by the Latin
American debt crises - Spanish banks cut and ran from South America long
before the region's debts did them much damage.
However, Madrid, for reasons of pride more than anything, has been trying in
the past few years to compete for Latin American favour. It has opened
credit lines worth nearly Dollars 10bn to Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela.
Spanish state-controlled industries have been ordered to buy into privatised
airlines, telephone and electrical utilities. Madrid has been trying to tout
itself as Latin America's bridge into the European Community.
So far, all with mixed results. Many credit lines have not been used. In
Argentina, Iberia, Spain's state-owned airline is accused of mis-managing
Aerolneas Argentinas, which it bought last year, and EC aid to the region,
not included in the Community's APC (Africa-Pacific-Caribbean) agreement, is
little more than a trickle.
As Mexico's free trade agreement with the US and Canada develops, some
Spanish businessmen believe they have more to gain by investing there than
by selling Spain as an economic starter-motor.
Still, the summits would probably not be happening were they not being so
pursued by Madrid. It is just that 'we have to be the engine but we don't
want to be the whole train,' according to Mr Innocencio Arias, the Spanish
deputy foreign minister, in a recent interview.
The politics are complicated - anything that smacks of Spanish imperialism
would ruin what is an effort to create a headless commonwealth.
The summit targets are, thus, modest and even imprecise. The creation of a
daily educative television channel, using Spain's Hispasat satellite once it
is launched, a post-graduate exchange programme, an environmental fund and
one for indigenous peoples head the list. Funding has not been decided and
Spain might be landed with the lion's share, simply to keep up momentum.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, whose personal prestige in Latin
America has grown out of all proportion to his ability to deliver EC aid or
to soften US attitudes to some Latin American leaders, would probably be
prepared to pay dearly to keep the Ibero-American idea alive.
He has at least been able to sell democracy in Latin America by pointing to
Spain's economic growth in the three years after it joined the EC in 1986.
But the suspension of the constitution in Peru and the attempted coup in
Venezuela this year badly bruised Madrid's fond hopes that this summit would
also be a celebration of democracy finally taking root in Latin America.
President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela will not be in Madrid and the
summit might be stolen by President Fidel Castro of Cuba, whose elections
are somewhat different. This will be his first visit to Spain and its
province of Galicia, where his father was born.
Spain is sentimental about its emigrants to Latin America and Mr Castro
would be treated as a celebrity in most of the country. He is not, though,
quite the model Ibero-American whom Madrid has been trying to nurture.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Malaysia dam dispute opens floodgates of hostility: Claims
for compensation and revenue have held up a multi-million-dollar
hydro-electric project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL and economic battle over a multi-million-dollar dam project is
being fought in Malaysia's jungle. The adversaries are the federal
government, led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the combative prime minister, and
the local government controlled by the strongly Moslem Parti Islam
sa-Malaysia (PAS) in the eastern state of Kelantan.
Balfour Beatty, the British engineering company, is in the crossfire. It has
been awarded a substantial slice of the contractual work on the MDollars
1.5bn (Dollars 600m) Pergau hydro-electric dam project, backed by loans and
guarantees from UK and foreign banks, the Export Credits Guarantee
Department, and the Overseas Development Agency.
The fight centres on Kelantan's insistence that it is entitled to
substantial compensation and revenues associated with the dam project, which
will use water from the state's Pergau river. The compensation payment
sought by the state, one of Malaysia's poorest, is reported to be MDollars
90m, and more than MDollars 300m is wanted for water rights over the next 50
years from Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially privatised electricity
utility.
Negotiations had been going on for several months but were broken off last
week when the Kelantan authorities blocked several roads leading to the dam
work site. All work stopped and more than 2,000 labourers were laid off.
The federal government said Kelantan's financial claims were unreasonable
and could set a precedent for a number of big development projects in other
states. But then, after talks between the Kelantan authorities and Tenaga
Nasional, an agreement was worked out and the barricades were taken down.
The federal government was not satisfied, however.
'Until we get assurances from the Kelantan government that there will be no
more disruption at Pergau, there will be no resumption of work,' said Dr
Mahathir. He refused to rule out the possibility of the project being moved
elsewhere.
In mid-1989 the Pergau dam contract was awarded to a consortium of Balfour
Beatty Cementation and the local Kerjaya Binaan group. At the time
opposition politicians and environmentalists questioned both the size of the
project and its environmental impact.
Tenaga Nasional says the 600MW dam is a vital component in its plan to
double Malaysia's generating capacity over the next decade and provide for
the needs of an economy growing by more than 8 per cent a year.
But the main battle has been between Kelantan and the federal government.
The PAS gained control of Kelantan from Dr Mahathir's United Malays National
Organisation in elections in late 1990. Although more than half Malaysia's
18.5m population is Moslem and Islam is the official religion, the country
is not an Islamic state. Freedom of religion is guaranteed under the federal
constitution.
Kelantan is mainly Moslem and earlier this year the authorities there
announced plans to implement hukum hudud, the traditional Islamic penal code
which can mean the stoning of adulterers and amputation of the hands of
thieves.
While implementation of such a measure would need a constitutional amendment
and would be unlikely to win the necessary two-thirds majority approval in
the federal parliament, the government has accused PAS of stirring racial
tensions and of frightening away foreign investors.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister for international trade and industry,
says that while other states in Malaysia are attracting millions of dollars
of investment from abroad, investment in Kelantan is drying up. 'The
foreigners are worried about the proposed laws. They are no longer
interested in investing in Kelantan since it was taken over by PAS,' she
says.
Meanwhile the Kelantan state authorities accuse Dr Mahathir's government of
withholding federal funds from the state and intentionally discouraging
investment as punishment for voting in to power an opposition party.
Arguing for compensation for the Pergau dam project is one way Kelantan can
fight the federal authorities. Mr Nik Aziz Nik Mat, the state's chief
minister, says the federal government's unwillingness to pay compensation is
the equivalent of someone repeatedly going to a coffee shop, but refusing to
pay.
'It is not a question of barricading the roads, but it is our land that is
involved and we have the right to it,' he says.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations initiative to break the political deadlock in South
Africa gets under way today with the arrival of the organisation's special
envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance.
The combination of Mr Vance's visit, and the prospect that business and
unions could reach agreement on a 'social contract', have raised hopes for
an end to the impasse which followed the June 15 massacre of 42 residents of
Boipatong township.
However, the stand-off between the African National Congress and the
government deepened yesterday when about 220 people were arrested as the ANC
stepped up its campaign of sit-ins at police and government offices.
Mr Vance, 75, a former US secretary of state, is due to meet President F W
de Klerk tomorrow at the start of a 10-day fact-finding visit which will
include meetings with political, religious, business and labour leaders.
His visit coincides with efforts to forge what would be an historic alliance
between business and labour, based on a charter setting out agreed
socio-economic objectives and calling for a democratic constitution. The two
sides are close to agreement on a charter, part of a deal which would avert
the general strike called for August 3 by the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (Cosatu).
Some observers believe such a charter could provide the impetus for what has
been called an economic forum, in which government joins business and labour
in formulating economic policy. After initial resistance to the idea, mooted
last year, the government has indicated cautious support.

THE United Nations Security Council last night decided to hold further
consultations on a proposed Iraqi compromise over the team of UN weapons
inspectors that has been keeping an increasingly tense vigil outside a
Baghdad ministry, from which it has been barred, writes Mark Nicholson,
Middle East Correspondent.
The council had been expected to fire a further warning at Iraq that it is
in material breach of the Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687, amid deepening
concern over a growing list of Iraqi snubs to the UN.
The council had before it an Iraqi proposal to have 'neutral' inspectors
enter the agriculture ministry building, to which UN inspectors have been
denied access since July 5. The UN team suspects that the building contains
documents central to Iraq's missile programme - an allegation denied with
increasing belligerence by Iraqi authorities.
Thousands of demonstrators, chanting 'Saddam is staying forever', marched
past the UN inspectors outside the building yesterday, in the biggest
protest yet against the team.
The council met last night to consider the report of Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman
of the special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, after his
weekend trip to Baghdad. It was also considering the news that a
booby-trapped car exploded yesterday outside UN offices in northern Iraq,
wounding two guards.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Cairo summit aims to warm up peace process: The Israeli
prime minister will find Egypt receptive to his wish for a fresh start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, arrives in Cairo today
for his summit with President Mubarak, his aim will be to establish a new
partnership in the search for Middle East peace.
Mr Rabin has made no secret of his desire to enlist Egypt's help in
revitalising the process - based on the Camp David accords of 1978 - which
provided a framework for peace between Egypt and Israel and a formula for a
settlement of the Palestinian problem in the occupied territories.
The new Israeli leader sees reviving the tripartite relationship between
Washington, Israel and Cairo as a way to advance the Middle East
negotiations launched in Madrid last October.
'Rabin feels there is room for a greater involvement of the US and Egypt in
helping to move things on,' said Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman. 'Our
relationship with Egypt has been almost frozen and that was an obstacle to
the peace process: that is why it is so important to meet President Mubarak
and warm things up again.'
Since his election last month, Mr Rabin has referred repeatedly to Camp
David as the blueprint for a settlement, in contrast to Mr Yitzhak Shamir,
his predecessor, who was always unwilling to follow the path mapped out by
the accords.
Under the terms agreed at the presidential holiday retreat near Washington,
Israel would hand over day-to-day administration in the West Bank and Gaza
to a 'freely-elected self-governing authority' for the Palestinians. Israeli
forces would substantially withdraw from main Arab population centres.
The Palestinian authority would serve as an interim confidence-building
arrangement for five years during which negotiations would take place to
determine the 'final status' of the territories.
Mr Rabin will find the Egyptians extremely receptive to his desire for a new
partnership. Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel, has
been uneasy about its peripheral role in the Madrid process which is based
on bilateral negotiations between Israel and its other Arab neighbours.
While neither President Mubarak nor Mr Rabin wishes to replace the structure
of talks set up at Madrid, the Israelis see benefits in an enhanced Egyptian
role. They hope that Egypt can facilitate difficult negotiations with the
Palestinians and Syria, the latter being the most prickly of the parties to
the talks.
Egypt strongly welcomed Mr Rabin's election victory last month as an
opportunity to put aside the awkwardness that characterised relations with
Israel under Mr Shamir's Likud party. Mr Mubarak had always refused to meet
Mr Shamir as a protest against the former prime minister's unwillingness to
compromise. Both Israel and Egypt also have their eyes firmly fixed on
Washington in this new phase: Mr Rabin wants to win an early reward from a
Bush administration eager to secure a foreign policy success before the
November presidential election.
The Israelis are hoping that when Mr Rabin and Mr Bush meet next month, the
president will approve the release of US loan guarantees to aid mass
immigration from the former Soviet Union. Israel's request for guarantees
worth Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) was frozen because of Mr Shamir's refusal
to halt Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Mr Rabin is also
anxious to move quickly on the peace issue to retain the political
initiative over his right-wing opponents who are in disarray following their
election defeat.
Winning the loan guarantees would be persuasive evidence to Israelis that
the shift of policy under Mr Rabin, including the reining-in of settlement
activity, had paid an early dividend.
For its part, Egypt, which is heavily dependant on American aid of more than
Dollars 2bn annually, wants to continue to demonstrate its usefulness as a
moderate force in the troublesome Middle East at a time when concerns abound
about continuing instability.
However, Cairo will have to ensure that closeness to the new Israeli
administration will not arouse suspicion among its Arab brothers who
ostracised Egypt after it signed its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
Syria has already expressed strong misgivings over Mr Rabin's emphasis on
giving priority to talks with the Palestinians. This has fuelled traditional
concerns in Damascus that Israel will seek to delay negotiations over the
Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967 at the same time as the West Bank
and Gaza. The Syrians have summoned Arab foreign ministers, including Mr Amr
Moussa of Egypt and the Palestinians, to Damascus this weekend to try to
ensure Arab solidarity before the first round of peace talks, expected to be
held in Rome in September. The Palestinians, who feel vulnerable to pressure
from Arab regimes such as Egypt, are also anxious that Mr Rabin be obliged
to adhere to international demands for a complete cessation of settlements.
While the Egyptians will roll out the red carpet for Mr Rabin, they are
certain to remind him that even though his initial gestures have created a
more positive climate, success will require more substantial Israeli
compromises.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Havel departs in blaze of failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LANY, CZECHOSLOVAKIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Vaclav Havel yesterday ended the last of his 935 days at the head
of Czechoslovakia admitting that the 74-year-old federation was condemned to
imminent demise.
Speaking at Lany Castle, the one-time residence of Tomas Masaryk, first
president of the Czechoslovak federation, Mr Havel said he was leaving
office having failed to prevent the break-up of his country.
'The fact that we did not succeed in building a democratic federation based
on the equal rights of its two members and rooted in our democratic
tradition has been a major failure for all of us.'
Perhaps surprisingly, he said: 'I don't feel either sad, or disappointed or
pushed aside'.
Mr Havel, who spoke to the nation 99 times from Lany in his regular Sunday
radio broadcasts, did not even hold out the hope of a referendum offering a
choice between a united state and two independent republics.
'It is too late for this sort of a referendum. Only the ratification of the
current political developments would now be possible,' he said.
The federation has been heading toward break-up since nationalist parties
won the upper hand in the smaller Slovak republic last month. According to a
post-electoral agreement between Czech and Slovak leaders, the parliaments
of each republic have until September 30 to decide on the modalities of a
constitutional divorce.
Mr Havel announced his resignation last Friday as Slovak parliamentarians
overwhelmingly approved a declaration of sovereignty for the Slovak
republic. Slovak deputies in the federal parliament had earlier this month
blocked Mr Havel's re-election as federal president but he could have stayed
in office until October 5 as long as no other candidate was elected.
Mr Havel's political career may be far from over, as he is the most likely
candidate for the post of Czech president. Both the Czech and Slovak
parliaments are currently drafting republican constitutions endowed with
their own presidents.
In London, Prime Minister John Major paid warm tribute to Mr Havel, praising
the 'wisdom and integrity' of the man who presided over his country's
transition from communism.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Political patronage remains Sicilian Mafia's trump card:
Robert Graham in Rome explains why Italy's post-war battle against organised
crime has failed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE killing of Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate, on
Sunday, highlights two fundamental failings in the state's post-war campaign
against organised crime in Sicily and southern Italy - lack of co-ordination
and the inability to clean up the links between politicians and the Mafia.
Italy deploys over 250,000 carabinieri, police and financial police
throughout the country with a high proportion in the south, and overall the
country has the highest per capita ratio in uniform in the EC.
But the different forces are beset by rivalries and lack central
co-ordination of information and investigation. These jealousies and
rivalries have delayed the introduction of a new central co-ordinating
force, modelled on the American FBI, agreed last October.
There have been delays also in the introduction of a 'super-magistrate',
with special assistants in 26 regional offices, to co-ordinate the judicial
side of anti-Mafia investigation at a national level.
Magistrates have been locked in a heated controversy with the interior
ministry for six months over fears that such a move would place too much
power in the hands of politicians over the control of appointments. This
controversy held back the appointment of Mr Giovanni Falcone - the
anti-Mafia magistrate murdered in May - to the job for which the unfortunate
Mr Borsellino then became next in line.
Legislation has to pass through so many hurdles causing enormous delays in
implementation. A set of laws designed to bolster measures to fight
racketeering and extortion, one of the most pervasive aspects of organised
crime, only became operative in June, nearly nine months after being
approved by the cabinet.
It is also a question of making laws work. Since 1982 no fewer than 113 laws
and decrees have been issued to combat organised crime. But laws designed to
counter money laundering have been enmeshed in disputes between the Treasury
and the Interior Ministry; while the use of super-grass testimony -
pioneered by Mr Falcone, and the most successful means of convicting the
bosses, has yet to be properly defined and adequate protection given to
those wishing to turn evidence.
The judiciary itself is divided. While the vast majority are honest and
dedicated, organised crime has the resources to suborn and intimidate.
Recently a prominent clerk of the court in Rome processing all the sensitive
Mafia files was discovered to have been in the Mafia's pay, deliberately
ensuring key papers were lost or arrived late so that known criminals were
released from bail.
More disturbing is the capacity to intimidate demonstrated by the Falcone
and Borsellino killings, and a string of earlier murders. After the Falcone
assassination in May it was discovered that the court of Caltanissetta, due
to investigate his death, lacked the requisite magistrates because too few
wished to serve in such an exposed place. Volunteers had to be hastily
drafted in.
But the Sicilian Mafia's trump card continues to be the complicity it enjoys
with important elements of society, notably the politicians.
The issue of corrupt municipal administration is a national problem, but its
infiltration by organised crime is a phenomenon of southern Italy which
accounts for the majority of the 26 councils forcibly dissolved for abuse of
office by the interior ministry in the past nine months.
The Christian Democrats and Socialists bear a major part of the blame. They
have sustained their dominating presence through patronage of public works
contracts and sizeable development projects. It is no accident that 75 per
cent of all contracts in Sicily are awarded by private tender. This element
of patronage also explains in good measure the manner in which these two
parties retained their vote in the April general elections in the south but
lost on average 15 points of their vote in the north.
A major figure in this shadowy world was Mr Salvatore Lima, the Christian
Democrat Euro-deputy and the most powerful politician in Sicily, who was
murdered for as yet unspecified motives at the beginning of the general
election campaign in March. The party has observed total silence on his
killing.

FT  21 JUL 92 / EC seeks to expel Serbs from UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community decided yesterday to push for the expulsion of the
rump Yugoslavia from the United Nations and all other world bodies after
renewed fighting forced the suspension of relief flights to Sarajevo.
EC foreign ministers also appealed to the warring parties in Bosnia to
comply at once with the July 17 ceasefire negotiated by Lord Carrington,
whose EC peace conference, they suggested, should be broadened to involve
the UN and neighbouring countries.
But, as the fighting worsened again in Bosnia, EC ministers were clearly
unable to bring much new pressure to bear on Serbia as the chief malefactor
in the Balkan civil war.
'The news from Sarajevo, and the rest of Bosnia, is bad,' said Mr Douglas
Hurd, foreign secretary of the UK which holds the EC presidency. 'However,
we cannot allow disappointment to deter us, or to make us give up,' he
added.
The joint Serb-Montenegrin state could not be allowed to sit as 'Yugoslavia'
in the UN or other world bodies, Mr Hurd said. In a statement, EC ministers
said they would make 'early arrangements' to exert pressure in the UN to
shut Serbia out. The EC's legal view has long been that Serbia and
Montenegro should be denied the status of sole successor to the old
Yugoslavia.
But Mr Hurd said yesterday it was the first time this view had been formally
endorsed by ministers. Some ministers, notably Mr Klaus Kinkel of Germany,
would have preferred a more forthright statement that Serbia should be
expelled from the UN. By contrast, Mr Hurd said that Serb-Montenegrin
federation would be free to join the UN like any other new entity, though he
made clear this would be unlikely under present circumstances.
EC ministers pledged themselves ready to cut through Community red tape to
speed the delivery of Ecu120m (Pounds 85m) worth of promised humanitarian
aid. They also promised, in the light of the July 29 UN conference on
refugees, to 'consider urgently an equitable solution to the problems caused
by the potential inflow of refugees into neighbouring countries'.
But they failed to endorse specifically a request by Mr Kinkel, who said his
country had already taken in 100,000 refugees from Yugoslavia, to establish
a quota system to share the refugee in-take among all EC states.
Canadian General Lewis Mackenzie, the commander of UN forces in Sarajevo,
said yesterday that aid flights would only be resumed when the airport was
made safe. The UN had hoped to bring in 22 flights, carrying food and
medical supplies to the 380,000 people trapped in Sarajevo.
At least five people were reported killed and 14 wounded in a grenade attack
on the city centre yesterday. There was also heavy fighting in the eastern
Bosnian town of Gorazde.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Falling share markets ignore DM intervention: Bundesbank and
Fed lead selling - Government acts to head off home loans rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTED intervention by the world's leading central banks to restrain the
soaring D-Mark and pave the way for lower interest rates failed yesterday to
prevent share prices in Europe suffering their largest fall for 11 months.
In their biggest co-ordinated action since July last year, the central
banks, led by the German Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve, bought
dollars for D-Marks. Their action was both an effort to reduce strains in
the European exchange rate mechanism, caused by the German currency's recent
strong rise, and to halt the slide in the dollar.
While the intervention led to a sharp fall in the value of the D-Mark
against the dollar, it failed to convince stock market investors that
pressures within the ERM would be eased, opening the way for lower European
interest rates.
The intervention, in three separate waves yesterday afternoon in Europe and
New York, halted the rapid slide in the dollar which had been approaching
its record low of DM1.443 set in February 1991.
The Eurotrack index, which monitors the main European bourses, was 3 per
cent down at 1,064.04, the biggest one-day fall since August 1991 on the day
of the Moscow coup. Stock markets in London, New York and Tokyo all saw
large declines.
Yesterday's central bank intervention came against the background of
widespread gloom about the global economy, triggered by last week's increase
in the German discount rate.
That in turn has sparked fears that the Bundesbank may lift its key Lombard
interest rate, an event that would make it practically impossible for
European borrowing costs to come down without a broad ERM alignment to
revalue the D-Mark upwards.
The sombre mood was shared by investors worldwide:
In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed down 28.2 at
2,403.7, after coming back from a 65-point loss before the central bank
intervention. Investors had earlier been unsettled about news of continuing
fragility in the UK economy, shown up by weak money supply figures.
In Italy, the stock market fell by nearly 6 per cent, partly due to
political worries sparked by the weekend killing of an anti-Mafia judge. The
Italian lira came under renewed pressure, falling close to its ERM floor
against the D-Mark, amid continued fears about the impact of higher European
interest rates.
The DAX index at the Frankfurt bourse ended 52.99 lower at 1,649.67. Both
Paris and Amsterdam saw declines of nearly 2 per cent.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from an early
47-point loss to end down 28.64 at 3,303.00.
In Tokyo, before the start of European trading, the Nikkei stock index had
suffered a 4 per cent fall to close at 15,884.48. However, in the first
half-hour of trading today it had recovered by more than 150 points.
Yesterday's intervention by the central banks also involved the Bank of
England and the central banks of France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Denmark.
In late New York trading last night, the dollar was quoted at DM1.4940, up
almost five pfennigs from its low of DM1.447 in London, where it ended the
day at DM1.4815.
But the weaker D-Mark failed to prevent sterling remaining in the doldrums.
In New York last night it was down slightly on the day at DM2.8469, after
dipping at one point in early European trading to DM2.8282, its lowest level
against the D-Mark since Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism in
October 1990.
New York traders said that the intervention worked well because markets had
not expected it.
Mr Joe Taylor, analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: 'The market was
caught wrong-footed. Until the Fed acted, the fall (in the dollar) had been
orderly.'
However, markets believed that the dollar might drop still lower, as
analysts argued that the fundamental factors driving the dollar down were
still in play.
These include the large differential between German and US short-term
interest rates, and fears about the scale of the US economic recovery.

FT  21 JUL 92 / PM backs Mellor's media review role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was yesterday at the forefront of a
vigorous effort to rally behind the embattled national heritage secretary,
Mr David Mellor, in the wake of widespread press reports on the minister's
relationship with an out of work actress.
As MPs of all parties sought to underline Mr Mellor's right to personal
privacy, there remained considerable doubt at Westminster over whether he
would be able to continue as the minister charged with overseeing a new
review into intrusive media behaviour.
Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, was among many who publicly
condemned the reports of Mr Mellor's relationship as an 'unjustified
invasion of privacy'.
But he added: 'The prime minister would now be wise to shift responsibility
for this subject to William Waldegrave's (public services) ministry where it
belongs, thus removing any possible conflict of interest.'
Earlier, however, Downing Street officials insisted that Mr Major was
determined that Mr Mellor remain in his post with his portfolio of
responsibilities unchanged.
The prime minister wanted it made public that he regarded a minister's
private life as having 'nothing to do' with how he conducted his
departmental duties, they said. The officials firmly ruled out any
suggestions that handling of the new report, now being compiled by Sir David
Calcutt QC, into the workings of the Press Complaints Commission, might now
be passed to another minister.
Mr Major made a point of demonstrating his backing for Mr Mellor - a
personal friend - by making an unscheduled appearance at a celebration in
Whitehall's Banqueting Hall to mark the opening of the new national heritage
department.
It was also revealed that he had telephoned Mrs Judith Mellor, the
minister's wife, at the weekend to express his support.
The Press Complaints Commission yesterday announced it would hold a special
meeting tomorrow to look into media coverage of the Mellor case.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Major stands firm on economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister yesterday labelled advocates of a sterling devaluation in
the European exchange rate mechanism 'pessimists and defeatists' in his most
forthright defence yet of the government's economic policy.
'There will be no return to the competitive devaluations of the 1960s and
1970s. We did terrible damage to British industry in the process,' Mr John
Major said.
His steady-as-she-goes message immediately ran into a co-ordinated barrage
of criticism as senior Labour figures led by Mr John Smith, the new leader,
charged the prime minister with 'drift and complacency'.
Demanding that Britain, as European Community president, should be taking
the lead in co-ordinating Europe-wide interest rate reductions, Mr Smith
questioned whether the prime minister understood how 'desperately serious'
the situation had become.
As world currency and stock markets again registered their deep unease at
the economic outlook, comments by both party leaders coincided with further
grim news on the UK economy.
Money supply figures from the Bank of England showed that narrow money -
which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation and is a barometer of
underlying demand pressures - fell by 0.8 per cent in June, the first
monthly drop since August.
The weak state of consumer demand was further underlined by the latest
consumer confidence survey from Gallup, the market research company, which
showed that confidence in the first two weeks of this month fell to levels
below those recorded before the general election.
Mr John Townend, Conservative backbench finance committee chairman,
confirmed that there was considerable disquiet at the economic outlook. But
he insisted it was 'vitally important' that there was a tough stance on
public expenditure.
At a National Free Enterprise awards ceremony in London, Mr Major said his
government was not prepared to use devaluation or a withdrawal from the ERM
to bail out inefficiency or poor control of costs and wages. 'In future we
will have to adjust our costs to our exchange rate rather than the other way
round.'
Acknowledging that businesses were undergoing 'difficult times', he said
this made it all the more important to keep bearing down on inflation and
maintain a consistent economic strategy. This strategy applied equally to
the public sector.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL is optimistic it will receive Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan
guarantees which have been blocked by Washington for more than a year in
protest at continued Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories.
Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, said yesterday he expected
that 'the sums will be at our disposal' by the end of this year or the
beginning of next. Diplomatic and economic processes were 'carrying us into
a new period, with a changed set of priorities', he said.
A US official travelling with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state,
said: 'We are hopeful we are going to be able to resolve this but we have
not finalised it.'
Last night Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Shochat
formally resubmitted the request for loan guarantees to Mr Baker. The
request was made in February 1991 by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former prime
minister. The Labour government believes its willingness to curb settlements
will persuade Washington to grant the guarantees. These were intended to aid
absorption of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union.
Israeli and Palestinian leaders said progress had been made towards
revitalising Middle East peace negotiations - due to resume in Rome in
September - in a day of talks in Jerusalem with Mr Baker.
Mr Rabin travels to Cairo today to meet President Hosni Mubarak for the
first Israeli-Egyptian summit since 1986. The meeting will rejuvenate the
peace process after Mr Rabin's victory last month over Mr Shamir's hardline
Likud government.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Treasury cuts savings bond rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, IVO DAWNAY, DAVID BARCHARD and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT acted last night to head off a widespread rise in the cost of
home loans by cutting the interest rate offered on its highly successful new
National Savings product, the First Option Bond.
The move follows an aggressive campaign by building societies, which have
been complaining that the bond has been syphoning off their deposits.
The gross interest rate paid on the bond has been reduced from 10.34 per
cent to 9.67 per cent in a move described by a National Savings official as
'highly unusual'.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester - the
society which raised its rates in response to the bond - said: 'It is good
news and we are delighted. We need to get into the office tomorrow to look
at the effect of the reduction . . . before we make a cut in our mortgage
rate,' he said.
At Leeds Permanent, Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, said he was
impressed with the government's speed of movement. 'It looks as though they
are committed to seeing a lower interest rate', he said.
The Woolwich welcomed the Treasury move, saying it made a mortgage rate
increase 'most unlikely'.
Mr Longhurst also disclosed that he met Treasury ministers on Friday to
explain why his society, the sixth biggest, had increased its mortgage rate
that day. 'They were understanding and sympathetic.'
Building societies had said that to retain their deposits they were being
forced they were being forced to raise savings rates, which put them under
pressure to lift mortgage rates as well.
The threat of a widespread mortgage rate rise, which would lead to further
delays in recovery of the housing market and the economy, has contributed to
sharp falls in share prices.
National Savings said that sales of the bond in the first two weeks had been
higher than expected. The First (or fixed interest rate savings tax-paid)
bond, which carried a net interest rate of 7.75 per cent, attracted Pounds
112m during the nine days since becoming available on July 7, a large amount
for a new savings product.
Only once before, in 1984, has National Savings taken steps to reduce sales
of one of its products. In that case, it withdrew a new issue after just
five weeks.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: 'It is now
clear that the new bond will remain attractive and meet the government's
needs (to help finance its borrowing requirement) with a lower interest
rate.'
The rate on the First Option Bond will be reduced from noon today. Those who
have sent an application by post will only benefit if the form arrives
before then. National Savings ran a big publicity campaign at the weekend to
sell the bond.

FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Global fall masks the structural damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall of just 0.8 per cent in the FT-Actuaries World Index last week
disguises the depressing effect of events last Thursday and Friday.
Europe was extremely nervous about Thursday's Bundesbank meeting in
Frankfurt; the 0.75 percentage-point rise in the German discount rate was
just a quarter-point higher than expected, but this hit the dollar, and bund
futures.
What with that, more scandals in Milan, and the sickening damage done to
construction share prices in Spain by the deteriorating local economy, a 2.4
per cent fall in Europe on the week seemed almost a gentle reaction.
In the US, which actually rose by a fine fraction over the week, the effects
of Mr Ross Perot's withdrawal from the presidential race on Thursday -
arguably bullish, since markets thought that it would help President Bush -
were forgotten on Friday when equities were hurt by disappointing earnings
from IBM, an unexpectedly large monthly trade deficit and talk of triple-dip
recession.
Japan really lost its way on Friday, too, when rumours of an investigation
by the new securities commission into loss compensation and share price
manipulation left the Nikkei average down 2.6 per cent on the day, a
foretaste of what happened yesterday.
America and the Asia Pacific region had their brighter sides. In Mexico, a
7.4 per cent advance followed a poor June quarter, as Telmex was authorised
to buy back Dollars 300m worth of its shares, local election results were
favourable and Mr Perot's retreat boosted already strong hopes for the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Hong Kong investors and speculators did their best to stretch the best
performance in the world this year. New Zealand, up only 1.1 per cent since
1992 began, went into the black last week with a 1.7 per cent gain on recent
falls in domestic interest rates.

FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses endure worst losses
since August 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE aftermath of last week's German discount rate rise, poor performances
in New York and Tokyo combined with a further weakening in the dollar early
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
Bourses had their worst day since last August 19 and the attempted coup
against the former Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. Then, senior
markets showed declines between 5.2 per cent in the Netherlands, and 9.4 per
cent in Germany.
MILAN dropped to its lowest level since November, 1985, as domestic
institutional investors dumped shares after Sunday's brutal killing of a
leading anti-Mafia judge, the second such murder in as many months. Dealers
said the tragedy had dealt a serious blow to Italy's credibility.
'Today's selling was a vote of no-confidence in the country's politicians
and did not reflect the fundamentals of the corporate sector,' one broker
said. Fiat preference shares dropped L255 or 8.8 per cent to L2,628, while
the ordinary shares fell L330 or 6.7 per cent to L4,575. Olivetti fell L240
or 8.3 per cent to L2,660. Trading in several shares was suspended after
they fell by their daily limit. Among them was Stet, the state-controlled
telecoms company, which was suspended after falling L154 or 9.6 per cent to
L1,445.
The Comit index lost 25.11 to 412.67, its lowest close since November 15,
1985, when it closed at 409.23. Turnover swelled to at least L200bn from
Friday's L117bn. Dealers were also worried by the lira's weakness against
the D-Mark and a statement from the Bank of Italy that it was prepared to
increase interest rates further to protect the currency.
PARIS bounced back from the day's lows in the middle of the afternoon, as
concerted intervention by central banks prompted a rally in the dollar which
in turn lifted the bond market. Equities followed suit, as dealers scrambled
to cover their short positions, and the CAC 40 index closed down 33.88 or
1.9 per cent at 1,767.90, up from the day's low of 1,735.02. Turnover was
moderately active at FFr2.73bn.
Alcatel was the day's most active share, losing FFr7 to FFr618 while Suez
bucked the trend to close up FFr6 or 2.4 per cent at FFr261. Hachette was a
prominent loser, shedding FFr5.90 or 5.5 per cent to FFr101.10.
FRANKFURT saw more losses in its dollar, and interest-rate sensitive sectors
as the DAX index fell 52.99 to 1,649.67. Turnover was unchanged at DM6.9bn.
Dealers said that selling continued after hours, when the September DAX
futures contract showed an 80-point slide at 1,648.50, but that subsequent
support for the dollar probably left share prices slightly above their
official close by the end of the afternoon.
Prices of all 30 DAX stocks declined. Underperformers included
Metallgesellschaft, down DM20.50, or 5.4 per cent to DM361.50, and Preussag,
down DM18, or 4.6 per cent to DM372. Allianz dropped DM82, or 3.8 per cent,
to DM2,068.
ZURICH closed above its day's lows, although the dollar intervention took
place after the close. The SMI index fell 49.0 to 1,756.6 after an earlier
low of 1,731.9.
The weak dollar put pressure on industrials, and on chemicals in particular.
Dealers said that the market ignored Sandoz's 14 per cent rise in first half
sales, and its forecast of higher 1992 profits; the shares dropped SFr80 to
SFr2,780.
AMSTERDAM staged a partial technical recovery in the final minutes of
trading with the CBS Tendency index closing 2.4 lower at 116.6. It had
earlier touched 115 in thin trading as it followed other markets lower.
Fokker had a turbulent day as the market awaited news on talks being held
between Dasa and the Dutch government regarding the purchase of a majority
stake by the German group. At one stage Fokker lost 11 per cent before
recovering to close down Fl 1.70 or 5.5 per cent at Fl 29.00. KLM weakened
50 cents to Fl 32.50 on rumours, denied by the airline, that it was
considering a rights issue.
Philips picked up some of Friday's loses following its weekend announcement
that it plans to reduce its property portfolio. Its shares closed 40 cents
lower at Fl 25.20. Elsevier went against the trend, rising 40 cents to Fl
105.30.
MADRID weakened in good volume with the general index closing down 5.67 at
217.87. The banking and construction sectors were badly affected with FCC in
particular coming under pressure. Its shares closed down Pta1,050 or 13.5
per cent at Pta6,700.

FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average drops 4
per cent to close below 16,000

SHARE PRICES fell across the board following Friday's drop on Wall Street,
and the Nikkei average lost 4 per cent, tumbling below 16,000 for the first
time since June 30, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 663.59 down at 15,884.48 on futures-linked arbitrage
unwinding and small-lot selling. The index opened at the day's high of
16,489.86 and fell to the session's low of 15,854.38 in the afternoon.
Volume remained thin but increased to 200m shares from Friday's 188m.
Declines overwhelmed rises by 951 to 36, with 82 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks slid 40.96 to 1,230.14, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index weakened 10.44 to 949.86.
Activity in the cash markets was led by a drop in the futures market. Last
Friday's fall in the Nikkei 225 futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
discouraged futures traders, and the Osaka Nikkei futures index fell by its
daily limit of 600 points to 15,930.
Traders hope the Nikkei's six-year low of 15,741.27, recorded on June 29,
will act as a technical support level. 'It is hard pinpointing a bottom for
the index if it falls below that,' said an analyst at Daiwa Securities. He
added that domestic and foreign pension funds, looking to invest for the
longer term, were buying in small lots, but short-term funds were reluctant
to do so.
A total of 120 issues fell to new lows for the year, including leading
high-technology shares. High-technology blue chips were sold following last
Friday's drop in IBM shares on Wall Street, dragged down by disappointing
second quarter results. Fujitsu retreated Y37 to Y583, NEC Y25 to Y786 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial Y100 to Y1,200.
Sanyo Electric shed Y15 to Y402 after announcing an 82.5 per cent plunge in
consolidated half-year pre-tax profits to May.
Nippon Housing Loan declined Y20 to a year's low of Y235 on reports of
alleged tax evasion in connection with stock transfers.
In Osaka, the OSE average plummeted 725.14 to 18,368.25, moving below 19,000
for the first time since July 1. Volume rose to 9.2m shares from 7.9m.
Roundup
TOKYO'S FALL unnerved most of the Pacific Rim, but Manila managed a small
gain.
HONG KONG lost 100 points in the first 15 minutes and fell further as the
session progressed. The Hang Seng index ended 141.57, or 2.3 per cent, down
at 5,986.49 in turnover of HKDollars 2.85bn, against HKDollars 2.77bn.
Analysts said the lead in the opinion polls of Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic candidate for the US presidency, also sapped sentiment, as some
investors fear that a victory for Mr Clinton would harm Sino-US relations.
HSBC Holdings receded HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 52.50, Cheung Kong lost 40
cents to HKDollars 25.10 and Sun Hung Kai Properties shed HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 32.50.
NEW ZEALAND tumbled 2.7 per cent following the sharp falls in European and
US markets on Friday. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 42.45 to 1,555.00.
Leading stocks were sharply lower, and Fletcher Challenge, down 17 cents at
NZDollars 3.25, Lion Nathan, off 15 cents at NZDollars 4.44, and Telecom, 6
cents cheaper at NZDollars 2.25, were particularly hard hit.
TAIWAN dropped 2.4 per cent as nervous investors dumped shares in the last
hour. The index fell 100.96 to 4,147.59, its lowest close since last
October. Turnover was a moderate TDollars 22.88bn, after Saturday's TDollars
16.4bn.
Brokers said sentiment was extremely poor, amid fears of pressure from high
outstanding margin loans, and news that big players were dumping shares. All
sectors fell, with 35 issues closing the day's limit down.
AUSTRALIA declined sharply following weaker overseas markets. The All
Ordinaries index finished at the day's worst of 1,604.9, down 24.6, or 1.5
per cent. Turnover expanded to ADollars 205m (ADollars 192m).
Banks sagged under renewed doubts about the economic recovery. Westpac
slipped 8 cents to a seven-year low of ADollars 3.17, NAB 11 cents to
ADollars 7.79 and Commonwealth 9 cents to ADollars 7.09.
MANILA edged ahead as selling pressure eased and investors bought in
anticipation of good third quarter results. The composite index put on 3.52
to 1,453.00 in combined turnover of 158.2m pesos, after 215.7m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR eased as most investors stayed on the sidelines. The composite
index dipped 2.57 to 602.76 and falls outpaced rises by 139 to 105.
Far East Asset advanced MDollars 1.22 to MDollars 4.06 on rumours that the
Hong Leong group will take over management of the company. Telekom Malaysia
lost 10 cents to MDollars 13.90.
SINGAPORE closed at its lowest level since April, with the Straits Times
Industrial index 5.39 down at 1,445.75 in volume of 31m shares.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian farmers switch from jute
in search for profit
</HEADLINE>

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS IN India and Bangladesh are no longer finding the raw jute prices
remunerative. As a result, they may progressively switch to paddy
cultivation, according to the Dhaka based International Jute Organisation.
Already Thai farmers are moving out of production of kenaf, a jute-like
fibre, as cassava, the competing crop is giving a 'significantly' better
return, says the organisation. The area under kenaf in Thailand fell to a
27-year low of 312,800 acres in 1991-92.
Meanwhile the IJO fears that jute output in India and Bangladesh, the two
largest producers, will suffer a setback in the current year because of
inadequate rainfall.
Last year, world production declined to 3.5m tonnes from 3.64m tonnes in
1990-91. While the Indian crop remained unchanged at 1.62m tonnes, that of
Bangladesh declined to 948,600 tonnes from 954,000 tonnes. China produced a
lower crop of 650,000 tonnes, compared with 726,000 tonnes in 1990-91.
The Thai kenaf production fell by 15,000 tonnes to 166,000 tonnes but Nepal
reported a 3,000-tonne increase in production to 19,000 tonnes.
In spite of the anticipated setback in the jute crop in Bangladesh, supplies
are expected to be sufficient to meet the domestic requirement of 3.3m bales
(180 kg each) and allow export of anything up to 2m bales. This is because
the country opened the current jute season this month with stocks of 1.46m
bales. Bangladesh is the largest exporter of jute and jute goods in the
world.
India, which opened the 1992-93 season with huge stocks of about 3m bales,
compared with 1.6m bales a year earlier, will also sail through comfortably.
But the Indian mills that are producing fine jute yarn and cloth for the
world market will have to import high grade fibre.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farmers offered aid
package
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday unveiled the first details of a four-year
aid package for farmers hit by the agreement to reform the European
Community's agriculture policy.
The main points are a reduction in tax on farming land, worth FFr930m
(Pounds 96m) next year, and debt relief worth FFr1.2bn from 1993 to 1995,
said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. Of this, the farmers will get
FFr400m of debt relief next year. However, Mr Beregovoy, refused to give the
total cost of the plan, beyond saying that it was 'high'. It also includes a
range of tax breaks, including tax incentives for producers of alternative
fuels.
Mr Luc Guyau, president of the FNSEA, one of the two main farming unions,
gave the package a guarded welcome. The government had listened to the
farmers' basic problems 'even if we did not get everything we wanted', he
said.
The government bought forward the package by 10 days to defuse the anger of
farmers, many of whom have disrupted road traffic and trains over the past
six weeks in protest against the steep prices reductions agreed by EC member
states in May. Mr Beregovoy called the plan 'an effort of national
solidarity. . . designed to give confidence to the farmers'.
However, it was unknown whether the deal would accepted by extreme splinter
groups, like the Co-ordination Rurale, which mainly represents poorer
smallholdings in south-west France. It organised the recent protests and
wants to scrap the European reforms entirely and raise prices.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): A powerful
alternative to set-aside - Growing crops for energy may be preferable to
leaving fields fallow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN IT really be sensible in this over-populated continent of Europe to pay
farmers not to produce crops? Will taxpayers tolerate such payments in the
long term? And if they will not and farm input costs continue to rise, what
will happen to the already questionable viability of farming and the rural
areas that rely on the industry for survival? More to the point, are there
any alternatives?
Well, yes there are. Let us accept for the sake of argument that surpluses
of some farm commodities have reached unsustainable levels in the European
Community; that it is inevitable a proportion of the land be taken out of
food production - in short, that land set-aside to limit the production of
cereals for food consumption is necessary.
But having accepted that situation, it surely does not make long-term sense
to pay farmers substantial sums by way of compensation for loss of income
from land taken out of production in order to enable them to survive in
business, yet demand no end product. Moreover, the result of set-aside is
quite likely to be less acceptable to taxpayers than the thought of
financing large intervention stores full of grain, which at least is
available if needed.
Set-aside will only produce weeds. And it will not contribute much to
desirable conservation. Indeed by virtually insisting that set-aside takes
place on different fields each year, the European Commission has lost much
of the opportunity there might have been to develop long-term habitats for
fauna or favourable conditions for flora.
Certainly set-aside will do little to improve the landscape. It could be
claimed in fact that most of its effects will be antagonistic to the desires
of taxpayers who have shown themselves willing to pay part of their taxes
towards conserving a better environment. Moreover, the considerable sums of
public money that will be devoted to set-aside could even conflict with the
much more modest government and EC aid for the enhancement of nature.
What is needed, surely, is some means of bringing together the legitimate
objective of reducing production with the equally desirable aim of improving
the environment in its widest sense. In other words a system of land
management which allows full cropping and full management yet produces end
products which are both desirable and environment friendly.
The organic movement has for years evangelised that the right way forward
was to convert to their chemical-free methods of production, which they
rightly claim would cut the quantities produced. A recent study of organic
farming by the University of Cambridge has revealed, however, that in spite
of the premium prices organic product can command, it generally fails to
provide those who grow it with a viable living. And the study was conducted
before reform of the EC's common agricultural policy. Now that organic
farmers, too, must set aside 15 per cent of their cereal land their their
chances of reasonable profits would seem to be even slimmer.
In any case organic food is never going to be more than a niche market.
But we all use energy. Furthermore much of that currently used is derived
from non-renewable resources such as oil, gas and coal; all well known to
produce 'greenhouse' gases and all helping to blow holes in the ozone layer.
The answer to all these problems could be biomass. That, at least, is the
view of many Germans, including agricultural engineering company, Claas.
Last week I went to Westphalia to attend a demonstration of various kinds of
biomass and to listen to a series of experts telling how the material could
be used to produce energy. It was well timed; only a few days before the
agriculture ministers of the EC, in their CAP reform package, had
specifically permitted non-food crops to be grown on set-aside land.
Most promising of the biomass alternatives is probably willow coppice. Grown
from cuttings, the trees increase in timber volume at a phenomenal rate to
reach, within three years, heights of 12 to 15 feet and a ground level
diameter of three to four inches. Claas has developed a machine to harvest
the crop and chop it into dice-sized pieces ready to be fed mechanically
into a furnace. There the material can either be used to produce heat for
industrial or domestic purposes or to generate electricity.
Another crop that can be used for similar purposes is elephant grass. It,
too, has the ability to produce enormous amounts of combustible material
over a relatively short growing period and could, it is claimed, be grown
and harvested mechanically in northern Europe.
In pursuit of rather different industrial uses, Claas also showed how flax
(from which linen is traditionally made) could be used as a fibre base,
mixed with a vegetable-derived plastic and made into very effective moulded
vehicle interiors. What is more, the products are biodegradable so that, in
theory anyway, when your car is worn out you can compost the door panels and
fascia and spread the result on your garden as organic fertiliser.
Claas was also advocating the expansion of the use of biofuel or rape methyl
ester, derived from the oil seed rape crop, which is already well advanced
in a number of European countries lacking their own oil reserves.
At this point in the discussion the oil lobby begins to get agitated. In
spite of the possibilities for such biological technology to extend the life
of their non-renewable products and be more environment-friendly, there are
fears it may affect short-term profitability. Claas has apparently
anticipated such a reaction by persuading other prominent German
industrialists, including some in the oil business, to become involved in
the developments and to advocate them as enthusiastically themselves.
For the greatest danger, despite the pioneering work Claas has done, is that
farmers may be persuaded to produce such crops (and instinctive antagonism
to set-aside has already made them very interested) only to find there is no
market. The secret, as Claas has recognised, is to try to make biomass a
demand-led industry.
Such an achievement, however, would require government and/or EC assistance
to bridge the admitted price gap between biomass as an energy source and
oil. But would it not be better to divert some of the cash currently
destined as payments for set-aside and devote it instead to developing and
subsidising biomass-using industries across the EC?
The cost need be little more than already allocated to finance set-aside.
The prizes would be a well managed countryside that would be more acceptable
to taxpayers; an improved environment both on farms and in the atmosphere,
which may help delay global warming; and a community of farmers who, by
growing crops instead of weeds, would regain their self respect.
The UK minister of agriculture, Mr John Gummer, has already said that he
does not like set-aside and only accepted it because he believed there was
no alternative. Biomass may be that alternative and enable him to turn an
unfortunate necessity into a valuable opportunity.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil demand threatens to
exceed production by 1993
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S OIL industry faces critical problems in supply and distribution -
while the opening of new fields has slowed down to the extent that future
production in 1993 or 1994 now threatens to run below the domestic needs of
the former Soviet Union.
At the same time, the determination of the government to keep prices to the
consumers low through subsidies has stimulated hoarding by the producers in
the expectation of rises, and extensive shortages, especially to motorists.
Oil workers, many of whom have not received pay for a month or more, still
threaten strikes.
Total Russian production - which is 92 per cent of former Soviet output -
was at 202m tonnes down just over 13 per cent in the first six months of
this year compared to the same period in 1991, according to the news agency
Interfax.
Mr Lev Churilov, chairman of Rosneftegaz - which groups most of the large
oil enterprises in Russia - said in a recent speech to the board of his
corporation that drilling of new wells had fallen sharply, with 10.2m metres
drilled instead of a planned 13m metres in the first half of 1992.
He said that if the trend were not turned round, average daily oil
production would fall by 10,000 tonnes a day. At the same time, only two new
fields out of 19 planned for 1992 have so far come on stream - both were
planned for 1991.
Extraction yields have also continued to worsen, with the number of
non-producing wells increasing in the first five months of this year by
3,761 to a total of 27,252 - 18.7 per cent of the total number of Russian
wells. In the main oil producing region of Tyumen, 27.6 per cent of the
wells are idle.
The oil sector, like the rest of Russian industry, is deep in debt - with
most of the large producing combines reporting debts of over Rbs300m, and
the corporations which control the pipelines reporting debts of over
Rbs3.5bn.
Western companies have the capital and technology which the Russian
corporations lack - but agreements are few, the uncertainties on the part of
the Western companies are many and there is heavy resistance among the
Russian managers to sharing output with foreigners.
Mr David Roche, head of Morgan Stanley International, says that 'the
involvement of Western companies is growing rapidly, but their participation
is unlikely to affect total production for some time to come'.

<TEXT>
KENNECOTT, THE North American subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, is the latest in
a growing list of leading mining companies to join a stampede for diamonds
in the remote Northwest Territories and Canada's prairie provinces.
Kennecott, whose activities in Canada consist mainly of joint ventures with
junior exploration companies, has teamed up with Aber Resources in the area
centred on Lac de Gras, about 350 km (220 miles) north-east of Yellowknife,
the territories' capital. In exchange for investing CDollars 10m (Pounds
4.3m) over the next five years, Kennecott has obtained a right to a 60pc
interest in the project.
The Canadian mining industry has been buzzing with rumours about a rich
diamond deposit since last November when Dia Met Minerals, another junior
company, announced that it had found some small stones under Lac de Gras.
BHP-Utah Mines, a subsidiary of BHP of Australia, has rights to a 51 per
cent interest in the Dia Met property.
Share prices of Dia Met, Aber and other companies involved in the hunt have
rocketed on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. Dia Met said in May
that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds,
of which about a quarter appear to be of gem quality.
Mr Ed McLeod, mining recorder for the Department of Energy and Mines in
Yellowknife, said yesterday that sales of claim tags for the Lac de Gras
area increased sharply in May and June. A total of 4,243 claims covering
9.6m acres, or 15,000 square miles, were staked by July 15. Another 3,900
sets of tags, each entitling the holder to one claim, have been sold.
Mr John Stephenson, president of Kennecott Canada, said evaluation work was
still in a 'very early' stage. He said that RTZ might issue more details of
its work at Lac de Gras within the next few days.
Monopros, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of De Beers, is understood to
have expanded its presence in Canada in recent months as a result of the
activity in the Northwest Territories. An official of the company, which is
based in Toronto, said that it had just started a sampling programme - the
first stage of on-the-ground investigation - in the Lac de Gras area.
Exploration has also accelerated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Besides
Monopros, the most active prospectors in Saskatchewan are Uranerz of Germany
and Cameco, the large Canadian uranium producer. The focus of their
attention is an area close to Prince Albert, in the centre of the province.

LEAD prices climbed to 12-month peaks at the London Metal Exchange yesterday
and, despite running into profit-taking and currency related selling, the
cash quotation closed Pounds 13.50 higher at Pounds 338 a tonne. Dealers
noted that short-covering had earlier been prompted by the development of a
small cash premium around the end of September, the time of a labour
contract expiry at Cominco's Trail smelter. This was making sellers nervous,
they added. Three months COPPER resumed its interrupted rise, gaining Pounds
17.25 to close at Pounds 1,355.75 a tonne, but that was still a few pounds
below last week's 18-month high. The start of the Polish copper miners'
strike (see story above) appeared to make little impact on market sentiment.
TIN prices continued to backtrack and the cash position closed another
Dollars 107.50 down at Dollars 6,710 a tonne. Sentiment may have been
affected by reports from the Kuala Lumpur market that the Chinese had
recently sold 5,000 tonnes of the metal, taking advantage of the surge that
peaked nearly two weeks ago. London COCOA futures lost further ground in
thin volume, the September price falling Pounds 16 to Pounds 560 a tonne.

WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday
as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's
pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions
representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage
increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages
by 20 per cent. Further increases could only come if the government eased
prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage
demands by other groups.
Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a
clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered
stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that
cash strapped managements can ill afford.
In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal
mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the
government moved to control the budget deficit. The industry is experiencing
a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some
12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.
This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led
to the present bout of unrest. Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in
the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last
year. Meanwhile KGHM produced 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the same
period or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.

<TEXT>
THE Tokyo stock market's first official securities watchdog began work
yesterday, amid doubts that it would succeed in restoring investor
confidence in the market.
Mr Toshihiro Mizuhara, chairman of Japan's version of the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, said the body's mission was to create a market that can
deserve the trust of investors.
But market participants remain sceptical of the commission's effectiveness
because of its closeness to the finance ministry - which appoints its
members - and its small staff. The commission has around 200 members
compared with the 2,900 at the SEC.
Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, chief researcher at Japan Securities Research Institute,
said the new commission lacked resources and independence, and would have to
rely on the ministry for its operations.
The ministry yesterday said it would reduce the number of official notices
and oral guidance of its securities bureau to make its administration more
transparent.
The move follows criticism that the ministry's securities administration,
based on unclear oral guidance, had been one of the causes behind last
year's securities scandals.

MERGERS and acquisitions business in Germany slowed sharply in the first
half of 1992, but purchases of companies in the former east Germany
prevented an even steeper slide, according to latest figures from M &amp; A
International, a consultancy based near Frankfurt.
The total number of deals involving German companies fell by 9 per cent from
953 in the same period of last year to 843.
This compared with around 700 each in the first six months of 1989 and 1990.
Because of slow economic growth among Germany's main trading partners, the
total transactions in Germany by foreign companies fell by 14 per cent to
212, while deals by German companies abroad fell by 16 per cent to 98.
The US, with 35 deals, remained the largest buyer of German companies. This
was followed by Switzerland (with 43 deals), France (32), and the UK (28).

100m offering

<TEXT>
TURBULENT conditions in most European government bond markets kept potential
Eurobond issuers on the sidelines yesterday, with underwriting firms
anticipating only a few new offerings this week.
The only issue of the day came from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
which launched a ADollars 100m eight-year issue targeted at retail
investors. The 8 3/4 per cent bonds were priced at 101 and traded down to
less 1.85 bid by late afternoon, comfortably inside full fees of 2 per cent.
The Australian, Canadian and US dollar sectors are most likely to see new
issues this week if European markets remain volatile. However, interest
rates and currency swaps opportunities are poor.
One potential area for new issues is in the Ecu bond market, where interest
rate swap spreads moved sharply yesterday, allowing potential issuers to
achieve cheaper floating-rate funding.
Today, the Bank of England will auction Ecu500m three-year Treasury notes,
part of an established programme. Dealers said the move in swaps spreads
indicated that investors were selling the market short ahead of the auction.
However, while attractive swaps spreads may draw potential borrowers, short
selling also depressed secondary market prices yesterday. The 8 1/2 per cent
French government Ecu bond closed almost a point down on the day at 94.55,
for a yield of 9.37 per cent. At the start of last week the yield was 8.95
per cent. Against this background, underwriters are likely to remain
cautious about bringing new issues.
Last week's issues by Gefco and the Australian state of Victoria suggested
that the appetite for sterling bonds remains buoyant.

Renault will still hold 33 per cent of COFAL, cutting its share in the
subsidiary to 24 per cent. The remaining shares are held by the public.
Renault would not disclose a sale price or indicate how the buyers were
financing their acquisition.
However, Renault is listed on the Buenos Aires stock exchange where it has a

Renault's retreat is taking place against a background of increasing

strategic planning

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has parted company with its chairman
and chief executive amid mounting public criticism of his management style
and his role in Dofasco's ill-fated acquisition of Algoma Steel five years
ago.
Dofasco said yesterday that Mr Bill Wallace resigned as a result of
'differences over how to best implement the company's new strategic plan.'
A spokesman declined to elaborate, but insisted that the plan, which
includes an emphasis on flat-rolled products and the study of mini-mill
opportunities, will remain intact.
Mr Wallace had worked for Dofasco for 36 years, but took over as chairman
only two months ago. Tensions over his position were clear at the company's
most recent annual meeting where a group of dissident shareholders
challenged his nomination to the board of directors.
Ms Margaret Cornish-Kehoe, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, claimed
yesterday that Mr Wallace 'didn't have people skills and was very closely
associated with Algoma'.
Mr Wallace's departure appears to reflect intense soul-searching over the
future of Dofasco, which was considered one of North America's premier steel
producers until its costly purchase of Algoma in 1987.
Three years later. Dofasco wrote off its entire CDollars 713m (USDollars
594m) investment in the troubled Ontario-based company, which itself is
Canada's third biggest steel producer.
Mr Wallace spearheaded the Algoma acquisition, but has always insisted that,
in keeping with Dofasco's collegial management style, the decision to go
ahead was a joint one.
The financial burden of Algoma has been exacerbated by the recession.
Dofasco suffered a CDollars 25m loss last year and a further loss of
CDollars 17.8m in the first three months of this year.
Mr Wallace's place as chairman will be temporarily taken by Mr Jack Leitch,
a long-time Dofasco director. His executive duties will be handed over to a
newly created committee comprising five senior managers.
Ms Cornish-Kehoe predicted that Mr Wallace's departure will improve
investors' perception of Dofasco. The company's share price dipped by 25
cents to CDollars 15.50 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange
yesterday in line with the more widespread fall in the stock market.

CUMMINS Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel
engines, yesterday consolidated its return to the black by unveiling
underlying second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 17.5m, or 93 cents a
share.
Earnings in the latest quarter were distorted by an extraordinary gain and
the cumulative effect of accounting changes which brought the company's net
income to Dollars 22.4m, or Dollars 1.22. In the same period of 1991,
Cummins suffered a net loss of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.29.
Sales in the three months rose 8 per cent to Dollars 948.1m from Dollars
877.6m.
During the latest quarter, Cummins completed the sale of 2.3m shares of
common stock with proceeds of Dollars 126.5m, most of which will be used to
retire debt.
Cummins said its gross margins improved in the second quarter thanks to
increased volumes. The company said its results were also helped by
cost-cutting and lower product coverage costs.
Sales in the latest quarter were boosted by strong demand for both its
heavy-duty and mid-range engines. Cummins expects North American heavy duty
truck engine sales of about 120,000 units for the year, provided the economy
does not deteriorate. Cummins controls about 38 per cent of that market.
Looking to the third quarter, it said results would be influenced by volumes
for which the outlook was uncertain, given the continued concern about the
strength of the economic recovery.
For the first half of 1992, Cummins had net income of Dollars 31m, or
Dollars 1.70 on sales of Dollars 1.83bn. A year earlier, the company
suffered a net deficit of 27 cents a share on sales of Dollars 1.69bn.
There was little reaction on Wall Street to the figures, and shares in
Cummins added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 66 1/2 in light mid-morning trading.

ARGENTINA will this week partly renationalise Aerolineas Argentinas, the
flag carrier it privatised in November 1990, following weeks of intense
negotiations with Spain's Iberia, the largest shareholder in the company.
Officials said the government and Iberia had agreed a formula that would end
a series of disputes over management and payment for the company.
The government is expected to increase its stake in Aerolineas to 32 per
cent from 5 per cent, by taking back shares held by the company's
undercapitalised local investors.
The government blames the Argentine investors for providing neither capital
or management in Aerolineas, suggesting that Iberia used them as figureheads
in its Dollars 1.87bn cash and debt-for-equity acquisition of the company.

SAMSUNG Electronics of South Korea plans to establish a 50/50 joint venture
factory in Tianjin, China to produce video cassette recorder (VCR) machines
and components.
Samsung's joint venture with Tianjin Telecommunications and Broadcasting is
the single largest corporate investment by a South Korean company in China.
The two companies will invest Dollars 60m in the joint venture, Tianjin
Samsung Electronics, which is expected to produce 600,000 VCRs by 1997 with
an annual turnover of Dollars 200m.
The South Korean government recently decided to build an industrial park in
Tianjin for small Korean companies involved in such labour-intensive
industries as textiles and electronics. China is attractive as a source of
cheap labour.
The Samsung move is the first big investment to be concluded since China
signed an investment guarantee agreement with South Korea in early May.
South Korean investment in China has been insignificant until this year when
it suddenly became the most popular area of foreign investment by Korean
companies.
Korean investment in China amounted to Dollars 84.9m during the first half
of 1992, a fivefold increase against a year ago.
Korean investment is likely to increase rapidly once the two countries
establish diplomatic relations, possibly this year or next.

POLAND'S Export Development Bank (BRE) yesterday reported the first tranche
of its public share offer was oversubscribed. An unnamed Austrian bank has
bid to buy 2 per cent of the equity, and declared an interest in acquiring a
further 20 to 25 per cent.
The first tranche of 450,000 shares, or 22.5 per cent of the bank's equity,
was for large investors. The shares were priced at 155,000 zloty each,
valuing BRE at about Dollars 23m. The shares will be allocated by August 3.
Meanwhile, the second tranche of 300,000 shares for small investors went on
offer yesterday. BRE's employees have been sold a further 200,000 shares at
half price.
In all, 47.5 per cent of BRE's equity is being offered, with the rest held
by several state-owned banks, the Foreign Trade Ministry, and around 440
state and private companies.
The bank reported net profits of 56bn zloty (Dollars 4.2m) for 1991. Mr
Krzysztof Szwarc, BRE's managing director, said net profits for the first
half of this year would come out at about 79bn zloty.
The sale is Poland's first bank privatisation. The BRE is being advised by
N. M. Rothschild and audited by Moore Stephens.

RIYAD Bank, the second biggest Saudi bank in terms of assets, posted SR361m
(Dollars 96.3m) net profits in the first half of 1991, up 45.7 per cent on
the same period the previous year, Reuter reports from Manama.
The bank, mainly owned by Saudi shareholders, said it set aside no funds for
provisions in the first six months of 1992, against SR46m in the same period
a year ago.
Net profit for the first half of 1990 was SR247.71m.
Total assets climbed to SR48.94bn in the first half of this year, from
SR42.84bn a year earlier.
Deposits rose to SR26.05bn from SR24.74bn.
Operating income fell to SR1.69bn from SR1.74bn.
The bank offered 8m shares worth SR3.8bn to the Saudi public in January in
the biggest flotation in the kingdom's history.
The share offering, which boosted paid-in capital tenfold to SR2bn, was more
than three times oversubscribed.

asset levels

<TEXT>
TOTAL assets of Bahrain's offshore banking units rose 10.3 per cent to
Dollars 56.80bn in the first quarter of this year, according to the Bahrain
Monetary Agency's quarterly bulletin.
The total is also an 18 per cent improvement on the record low of Dollars
48bn to which asset levels sank during the Gulf war, which temporarily
rocked confidence in banking in the region.
The BMA bulletin put the number of offshore banks operating on the island at
46, a considerable fall from the 75 operating from Bahrain during the
mid-1970s, when it was the centre of the region's petro-dollar recycling
boom.
However, the growing sophistication of banks in neighbouring Saudi Arabia,
and the general fall in local lending opportunities has slimmed the number
of offshore banking units on the island.
Two locally-incorporated offshore banking units, Kuwait Asia Bank and the
Bahrain Arab International Bank (BAIB), have decided to begin liquidating
their assets - the BAIB in readiness to close.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RENOWN, Japan's biggest clothing maker, is injecting Pounds 8m (Dollars
15.28m) into Aquascutum, its upmarket British fashion retailer. The UK
business has been dragged into losses by the effect of recession on luxury
goods sales.
The move comes two years after Renown paid Pounds 74m to take over the
company. It is the latest case of a celebrated brand name requiring further
cash infusions by a new foreign owner. The sum, although modest, is being
paid at a time when the parent is itself in the red. Aquascutum's pre - tax
losses for the 1991 calendar year reached Pounds 13.47m on sales of just
Pounds 42.30m, and Renown expects the offshoot will stay in loss this year.
Of the extra funding, Pounds 4m was paid in May and the rest would be
provided next January, Renown said. The capital injection will help meet
Aquascutum's commitments in projects such as refurbishing its Regent Street
flagship store in London and opening an outlet in North America.
Renown, a producer of mid-market ready-to-wear apparel, is to begin selling
Aquascutum lines in Japan from next month, spending Y2bn (Dollars 16m) on a
specialist store for the brand. This had not been possible until the recent
unwinding of a licensing arrangement between Aquascutum and Mitsubishi Corp,
which had given the latter distribution rights for the country.
Aquascutum says its sales in Japan should reach Y10bn in Renown's accounting
year, which begins in February. However, such a performance would come in
the face of the country's own economic downturn, which has quelled the
enthusiasm of metropolitan Japanese for foreign designer labels.
Indeed, some retail sector analysts had thought the change might prompt
shoppers to trade down to the more affordable lines mass-produced by Renown.
However, any such trend remains unreflected in the parent company's
performance. Renown said its pre-tax loss for a seven-month interim period
which ends in 10 days would exceed the Y11bn it had previously forecast. It
blamed the setback on poor sales, particularly at department stores.
For the full 13 months to next January, during which Renown is changing its
year-end, it now expects to remain in the red at the pre-tax stage, having
earlier projected a modest Y1bn profit.
In calendar 1991 - which brought large-scale inventory writedowns - pre-tax
losses were Y8.2bn, but net profits emerged at Y12.6bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RAND MINES has blamed large retrenchment packages at Harmony gold mine, and
a weak gold price, for a second-quarter R40.9m (Dollars 15.1m) loss at its
gold division. The division made R7.3m after-tax profit in the March
quarter.
Harmony, by far the largest producer in the group, paid out R35.5m in
benefits to 6,200 retrenched employees during the quarter, as the mine took
steps to try to ensure continued profitability.
Mr John Turner, chairman of the gold division, said other factors which had
hurt profits were lower production at Harmony and Blyvooruitzicht, the two
largest producers; an inability to lift the grade to compensate for higher
costs and a lower price; and rationalisation at Blyvooruitzicht, though the
costs will only be felt this quarter.
Total gold production in the group dropped 4 per cent to 11,243kg from
11,699kg, while average price received was 2 per cent lower at R32,172 per
kg. Total underground costs at the four mines rose to R37,721 per kg from
R33,517 per kg. This was due mainly to the high retrenchment costs at
Harmony.
Mr Turner said he expected Harmony to return to profitability in the
September quarter. However, as the large June loss eliminated retained
income, surplus asset disposals would have to continue in order to bolster
cash resources. Retrenchment costs and a fall in gold production, to 5,737kg
from 6,012kg, were partly blamed for a R47m working loss, compared with R2m
profit the previous quarter.
Of the other three mines, ERPM made a working profit of R4.3m, down from
R7.1m the previous quarter, while Durban Deep turned in R968,000, compared
with R1.7m.
ERPM's huge debt burden, however, meant the mine had to pay R12.7m interest
during the quarter, leaving it with an after-tax loss of R6.07m.
Blyvooruitzicht made a R1.9m working loss, compared with R2.8m profit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German elec-trical and electronics concern, yesterday reported
an 8 per cent rise in net profits to DM1.3bn (Dollars 890m) for the nine
months to end-June. The company said it had been cutting jobs in some
sectors as a result of weak orders and restructuring needs.
Its workforce actually rose by 13,000 to 415,000 in the September-June
period, but this was due to the effect of acquisitions. Excluding these, the
labour force had dropped by 7,000 people, the company said.
The group's worst performing sectors are semiconductors, electronic
components, private telecommunications systems and computers. Its Siemens
Nixdorf subsidiary was formed by joining its own computer interests with
those of loss-making Nixdorf Computer.
The nine-month results are in line with Siemens' expectations for the full
year. At the interim press conference in Dresden earlier this month, Mr
Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director, said earnings for the full financial
year to September 30 would total around DM1.9bn, an 8 per cent improvement.
Turnover was also expected to rise by 8 per cent to around DM80bn.
In the first nine months, turnover rose at an 8 per cent rate to reach
DM55bn, with domestic business 14 per cent higher and foreign turnover up by
only 3 per cent.
The order inflow was 3 per cent higher at DM63bn; domestic orders were up by
11 per cent and those from abroad down by 4 per cent.
Siemens has realised significant benefits from the rebuilding of the east
German economy, with a big jump in orders for its transport,
telecommunications and automation activities. Power generation, car
electronics and medical technology operations have also been performing
well.
For the full year, the order inflow is expected to total around DM86bn, a
rise of 4 per cent.
Lufthansa, the German state-controlled airline, does not expect a
significant improvement in profits this year after posting a group net loss
of DM426m in 1991, Reuter reports.
Juergen Weber, chairman, said the company would cut 1,700 jobs this year
from the 50,826 employed at the end of 1991. He said Lufthansa would also
like to cut 3,000 further jobs in 1993.

BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the big Bavarian bank, has acquired Schoeller &amp; Co.
Bank, one of Austria's oldest private banks, for an undisclosed amount.
Vereinsbank has bought 90 per cent of Schoeller's shares from Raiffeisen
Zentralbank (RZB), the clearing house of Austria's co-operative banks, and
has made an offer to the Schoeller family to purchase the 7 per cent holding
still owned by the descendants of the founder.
The acquisition makes Munich-based Vereinsbank the first foreign bank with a
branch network in Austria. Schoeller, one of the best-known names in
Austrian banking, operates 12 branches. It specialises in private banking
for high net-worth individuals, securities trading and corporate finance.
Schoeller has recently suffered financial setbacks because of falling stock
prices and bad foreign loans and was forced to halve its 1992 dividend to 5
per cent.
At the end of 1991 it had assets of Sch21bn (Dollars 2.03bn).
RZB has also seen its profits fall sharply in recent years because of the
rise in short-term rates, which boosted its refinancing costs.
The Schoeller sale is seen by analysts as a first step toward a retrenchment
by RZB.

SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is selling its
industrial and organic chemicals operations to Witco, a US chemicals
company, for DM660m (Dollars 410m).
The Berlin-based group said the disposal, which is to take effect in the
autumn, marked the first important step towards concentrating on its core
businesses of drugs and agricultural chemicals.
The sale was a blow to the VIAG group of Germany, which had bid to acquire
the two units.
William R. Toller, Witco chairman, said the acquisition would double the
group's international business. Witco had sales last year of DM2.6bn. The
group, which has European subsidiaries in the UK, France and the
Netherlands, is an important producer of plastic additives and
oleo-chemicals, in addition to oil products and construction materials.
Schering was also considering bids from a number of companies for its
electro-plating activities, which last year had sales of DM329m. It expects
to announce a deal shortly.
Schering's industrial chemicals turnover last year was DM454m, with total
group sales at DM6.3bn. However, industrial chemicals sales fell 1 per cent
compared with advances of 15 per cent for pharmaceuticals and 8 per cent for
agricultural chemicals. Turnover in organic chemicals was DM440m, up 8 per
cent.
Apart from smaller organic chemicals subsidiaries in the UK, Spain and the
US, most of Schering's industrial and organic chemicals output is
concentrated in Germany.
The Treuhand privatisation agency said Samsung, the South Korean
conglomerate, had not yet acquired Werk fur Fernsehelektronik (WF) in east
Berlin for Dollars 20m. It said no contract had been signed, although
negotiations had reached a final stage.

capital and sell property

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group whose share price has fallen by nearly
a third over the past four weeks, is planning to reduce working capital and
the size of its property portfolio by 'several billions of guilders' in a
multi-year effort to cut borrowings.
The company said that more efficient management of group assets would 'have
a positive impact on profits, interest cover, utilisation of tax losses and
the debt/equity ratio'.
According to an article in the company's in-house magazine, the decision was
taken at a recent meeting between senior managers and the group management
committee headed by Mr Jan Timmer, president. It described the move as a new
phase in Mr Timmer's two-year campaign to turn round the fortunes of the
Netherlands' premier industrial company.
The lowering of working capital is to be achieved over the 'next few years'
by reducing the amount of money invested in inventories and receivables,
which last year totalled about Fl 25bn (Dollars 15bn).
Philips also said that the 45,000 jobs cuts of the past two years had led to
opportunities for reviewing its property and building portfolio. However,
the sale of property would probably take longer than the reduction of
working capital because of the malaise in the property market.
Philips noted that each 1 per cent cut in inventories and receivables would
generate Fl 250m in cash and reduce annual interest payments by Fl 25m. The
company had liabilities of Fl 16.9bn in 1991.
Philips' share price has plunged to around Fl 26 from Fl 38 on June 17, when
the company warned that the depressed state of the global consumer
electronics market would cause a substantial decline in second-quarter
results. The downturn was accelerated last week following the news that a
top executive in consumer electronics, Mr Gaston Bastiaens, was leaving to
join Apple Computer.

BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya, the big Spanish bank, yesterday reported reduced net
profits for the first half of 1992, but said that ordinary banking business
had shown solid improvement, Reuter reports from Madrid.
The bank said the drop was partly due to the sale of some affiliates. Group
operating profit rose 5.1 per cent to Pta46.9bn (Dollars 501.8m) thanks to a
20 per cent rise in fee income and a rise of only 3 per cent in operating
costs.
However, net profits were 13 per cent lower at Pta42.5bn reflecting a 1.9
per cent drop in net interest income and a decline of more than 50 per cent
in extraordinary income to Pta9.4bn.
The bank said the rise in operating costs was well below the industry
average and reflected a rationalisation policy begun several years ago. The
growth of non-performing loans had slowed over the past 18 months with
virtually no increase in the first half of 1992, it said.
The improved operating profits had enabled it to raise the first-quarter
dividend to Pta38 a share from Pta36.
Net interest income had been affected by the sale of Banco de Credito y
Ahorro and Banco de Extremadura in the first half of 1991, it added.
Group assets rose to Pta9,300bn at end-June, while loans came to Pta4,200bn.

NORSK Data, the Norwegian mini-computer group, yesterday reported a return
to profits for the first half of 1992 and announced the surprise resignation
of its chief executive.
The company said that Mr Erik Engebretsen, who is both president and chief
executive, was resigning to take up a management post in September with
Color Line, the Norwegian ferry operator.
For the six months to end-June, Norsk Data posted a profit of NKr4m (Dollars
696,000) before tax and after extraordinary items, against a NKr257m loss in
the corresponding period of 1991.
Operating revenue fell 33 per cent to NKr640m but the company said that
turnover adjusted for divestments was in line with that of last year's
six-month period. Detailed half-year figures are expected to be published in
late August.
During the last three years, Mr Engebretsen has conducted a significant
down-sizing operation, including restructuring the group's subsidiaries, a
wide range of divestments and staff reductions.
The board sought yesterday to play down Mr Engebretsen's resignation. Mr
Terje Mikalsen, board chairman, said the board was very satisfied with his
management during the turbulent restructuring process. Mr Tor Alfheim, who
is to replace Mr Engebretsen, was closely involved with the restructuring as
vice-president.
Mr Engebretsen will remain a non-executive member of Norsk Data's board. He
said that he had completed his job to restructure the company and that it
was gratifying for him to leave Norsk Data in profit.
Norsk Data, once considered a Scandinavian wonder stock, has seen its Oslo
share price plunge from a high of NKr300 in 1985 to its current level of
around NKr2.50. The group equity-to-debt ratio is currently 3 per cent.

SANDOZ, the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, has reported a 14 per
cent rise in revenues to SFr7.9bn (Dollars 6.07bn) and 'positive growth' in
core earnings in the first half.
The growth in revenue was again flattered by the weakness of the Swiss
franc. In local currency terms, growth was only 8 per cent.
The pharmaceutical division, accounting for 45 per cent of sales, saw a 16
per cent rise in revenues to SFr3.5bn, thanks to a strong performance in the
US. Sales of chemicals, mainly dyes, rose 10 per cent to SFr1.3bn.
Although distributors had high stocks at the beginning of the season,
agricultural chemical sales were up a 'satisfactory' 6 per cent to SFr803m.
Half of the 28 per cent surge in sales of nutritional products to SFr937m
was attributed to internal growth and half to acquisitions last year.

   MADRID, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CEMENTOS Mexicanos (Cemex), the world's fourth-largest cement producer, is
to buy Spain's second-largest cement group, Sanson, for Dollars 600m. The
deal comes just two weeks after Cemex agreed to the Dollars 1.25bn purchase
of Valenciana de Cementos, the biggest cement producer in Spain.
With combined sales of 8.1m tonnes, Sanson and Valenciana together would be
one of the six largest producers in Europe. Spain is Europe's third most
important cement market. The two deals give the Mexican buyer about 28 per
cent of the Spanish market and dominance along the Levante, in Catalonia,
Madrid and the Canary Islands.
Sanson is the cement-making arm of the Banesto banking group's industrial
offshoot. Banesto has been selling assets vigorously over the past year, and
last month it signed an option to sell its 62 per cent interest in Sanson to
Apax, an affiliate of a Geneva-based holding company, Unifund. At the same
time, Banesto mounted a public takeover for the 30 per cent of Sanson that
trades in the Spanish markets.
Cemex yesterday acquired the Apax option and will buy from Banesto those
minority shares that accept the Banesto bid. Cemex shares fell 4 per cent in
Mexico after the announcement of the deal.
Cemex is paying for Sanson through a Dollars 600m bridging loan provided by
JP Morgan. This would be refinanced through a Dollars 200m payment from
Cemex; a Dollars 90m private placement of shares in Sanson and/or Valenciana
to Apax; the sale of around Dollars 100m in Sanson's non-cement assets,
mainly in the property sector; and the issuance of long-term debt and equity
in Spanish and international markets. Apax could eventually hold around 15
per cent of Sanson.
The Sanson purchase is similar to the agreement to buy Valenciana in that
the Mexican group also intends financing that purchase through the sale of
around Dollars 200m of Valen-ciana's non-cement assets.
Cemex believes that Valenciana and Sanson are ripe for radical restructuring
to reduce costs, even though the Spanish market is currently weakening.
Cemex is itself one of the lowest-cost producers among the world's leading
cement makers.
Nevertheless, the market for Spanish cement is being hurt by imports. Cement
consumption in Spain is expected to fall about 2 per cent next year as the
economy continues to cool.

Turnover of this manufacturing group dropped 8 per cent, from Pounds 36.7m
to Pounds 33.8m. Margins were maintained, however, for a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 1.74m, against Pounds 1.9m.
Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said there were improvements in the UK, but a
reduction in Australia was compounded by a high level of business failures.
Earnings per share slipped to 18.08p (19.15p). The dividend, however, is
held at 4.5p at a cost of Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 276,000) after waivers.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Managed retail arm clips Gibbs Mew
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an improved performance from its brewing and wholesaling activities,
annual profits at Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based group, showed a 6 per cent
decline.
The pre-tax line at this USM-traded brewer of Bishop's Tipple strong beer
amounted to Pounds 633,000 (Pounds 673,000) for the 12 months to March 28.
The downturn reflected an 'extremely difficult trading environment' in the
managed retailing arm, according to Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman.
The brewing side achieved trading profits of Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 1.64m) on
sales of Pounds 17m (Pounds 15.2m). Managed houses profit, however, fell to
just Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 160,000) on sales of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.7m).
The contribution to profits from property disposals from the tied estate
fell sharply - from Pounds 724,000 to Pounds 188,000 - reflecting the
depressed property market. Nevertheless, the 75 per cent owned Bridger
Properties offshoot reduced its pre-tax loss to Pounds 289,000 (Pounds
417,000).
After a reduced tax charge, earnings per share edged ahead to 11.89p
(10.97p). A recommended final dividend of 3.75p maintains the total at
6.75p.

Allied-Lyons, the brewery and food group, is buying Picard through Lyons,
its food manufacturing arm. The price was not disclosed but was said to be
not material in relation to Allied-Lyons' net assets.
Picard, based in France, is a family-owned company which manufactures
long-life toast and biscotte products. It has a leading share of the French
market where it sells under the Auga brand. Nearly 20 per cent of production

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STONEHILL HOLDINGS, the furniture maker and property investment group, made
substantial inroads into its losses in the year to March 31.
From turnover of Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 1.6m) operating profits were Pounds
1.23m (Pounds 577,000). After slightly reduced interest charges the pre-tax
loss was cut from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 387,000.
Mr James Buchanan, chairman, said despite the environment the group had
substantially increased the income from the Stonehill business park and
improved its facilities. 'We anticipate that an improving trend will be
maintained'.
Losses per share were 2.24p (5.76p) after allowing for unpaid preference
dividends where arrears amount to Pounds 168,000.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Dividends the only light in property gloom
 -As share prices hit a new low Christopher Price considers a depressed
market sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A sector used to depressing developments, the news that property shares
had hit a new low relative to the FT-A All Share index was greeted with a
benign shrug by most industry observers.
'The sector's still got some downside left,' said Mr John Atkins, property
analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'It's a question of confidence
and we see little good news coming out to bring buyers back into the sector
in the short-term.'
Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest agreed: 'Every time in the last four
years that it's looked like the sector's hit the bottom and it's the right
time to buy, it's actually been better to sell.'
Property shares have mirrored the dramatic decline in property prices during
the last four years, underpinned by a welter of statistics which have
charted the sector's spiral decline.
Since their peak of November 1988, property shares have underperformed the
market by 64 per cent - including a slide of 25 per cent this year alone.
Companies have been hit by declining net asset values and falling rents,
particularly in the commercial market, where an oversupplied market has been
made worse as offices have been vacated by recession-hit companies.
According to the index prepared by Richard Ellis, the surveyors, rental
values fell 16 per cent in the year to end-June 1992, including a drop of
nearly 3 per cent during the last month, the biggest single monthly fall
since 1978, when the index began.
Recent gloom on receding hopes of a cut in interest rates has been deepened
by the continuing effects of the recession. They have prompted growing fears
that dividends could be at risk, particularly in companies with heavy
exposure to the wilting office market.
With asset values crumbling investors have become wary about using a
company's own valuation of its assets as a judge of the company's worth.
They have focused on the dividend yield, which, when a company has a high
proportion of long-term office contracts, such as MEPC and Slough Estates,
has been largely guaranteed.
But even that aspect is being undermined by the length of the present slump.
Rental income is looking less secure as a growing number of tenants go out
of business. With dividend yield now suspect, investor confidence has again
been shaken and share prices further undermined.
Mr Stanley said the problem could recede, providing recovery came within the
next 12 months.
'While dividend worries are largely behind the current weakness in some
stocks, we think that most companies will hold theirs. And if we do start to
get some recovery at the start of next year then investors' confidence in
asset valuation will gradually increase and so will the confidence
underpinning the share prices.'
However, he warned that dividends would then be more likely to be cut as
maintained payments would no longer be needed to retain confidence.
Institutions looking at property companies for security and outperformance
of the market are having to search very hard.
Both County NatWest and UBS forecast that the sector will again underperform
the market this year.
However, they add that selected stocks have declined to such a level that
they may prove irresistible to investors.
For these reasons County likes Land Securities. UBS, which is advising
'underweight' clients to start rebuilding their property portfolios, is
backing MEPC and Slough Estates. Both tip British Land.
In spite of such recommendations, even bargain hunters are still staying
away. 'Business has never been so quiet,' said one trader. 'There are too
many people with burnt fingers to trust this sector again in a hurry.'
The lack of buyer interest has prompted one big broking firm to bid down
existing quoted prices during the past two weeks in an attempt to find a
level at which buyers will come out.
However, such is the fragile state of the sector that the move inspired a
fresh bout of dividend concern and a further plunge in prices.
'It's a very dangerous game to play given the nervous state of the market.'
said Mr Atkins. 'But of course it would be different if we could say values
will recover over the next year, but we can't.
'What we do know is that before then, several more companies will go into
liquidation and others will report worsening losses.'

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi agrees Pounds 5m payment to settle
US class legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI and Saatchi, the international advertising services group, said
yesterday it had agreed to pay more than Pounds 5m to settle a class legal
action brought against it in the US district court of Los Angeles in
February 1990.
The legal suit was lodged against directors of Saatchi at the time who
remain company directors today - Mr Charles Saatchi, Mr Maurice Saatchi and
Mr Jeremy Sinclair - by an American shareholder, Ms Margaret Yingling, after
the company's share price fell from about 200p at the beginning of 1990 to
less than 100p within two months.
The plaintiff claimed that the directors failed to disclose negative
information about the company. As a result the price of its shares were
artificially inflated and members of the class suffered a financial loss
when the share price fell.
Saatchi said its agreement to settle the dispute - by paying Pounds 4.9m
with interest backdated to May 7 1992, calculated at an annual 8 per cent -
implied no admission of wrongdoing.
A Saatchi official said the cost of defending such actions in the US could
be up to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.54m) annually and it could have taken three
years for the case to go through the courts. The decision to settle was
cheaper in the long run.
At least 60 such class actions have been brought in the US in the past five
years, with settlements as high as Dollars 300m.
James Capel estimates Saatchi's pre-tax profits for 1992 at Pounds 18m,
against reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 58.4m for the 12 months ended
December 31 1991.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Transfer Technology shows 63%
advance to Pounds 3.46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSFER Technology Group, the successor company to Central &amp; Sheerwood, in
which the late Mr Robert Maxwell was the largest shareholder, lifted profits
for the first half of 1992 by 63 per cent to Pounds 3.46m.
The rise, however, was deceptive as the group's shape changed radically
between the 1991 first half and the latest reporting period.
In May 1991 a restructuring, which angered shareholders, saw the group buy
two Maxwell companies, engineer its reverse into Mr Geoffrey Robinson's
Transfer Technology and cease its property activities.
Mr Robinson, the Labour MP for Coventry NW, took over the chair from Mr
Maxwell. Five months later the Maxwell shareholding was sold.
The enlarged group, now a mini-conglomerate of specialist engineering
companies, achieved its pre-tax outcome on turnover of Pounds 48.9m, some 64
per cent ahead of that of the former, smaller group.
Last May the group launched a Pounds 23.9m rights issue to fund three
acquisitions. Holders of the new shares are entitled to the maintained
interim dividend of 6.25p, but the new shares have not been used in the
calculation of the earnings figure of 22.1p (19.5p) per share.
However, Mr Robinson, expecting 'further improvement in our performance'
during the current year, said that 'the dividend for 1992 will be an
increase over that for 1991.' The 1991 final was 6.75p, bringing the total
for that year to 13p.
The group is protected from the domestic recession to the extent that over
75 per cent of its business is outside the UK. The rights issue eliminated
all gearing and the group now has Pounds 5m on deposit.

<TEXT>
Shares in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group, yesterday rose
from last week's low after the company said its share of reserves in
Indonesia had increased, writes Neil Buckley.
The shares gained 6p to 131p on news that Lasmo's share of reserves in the
Sanga Sanga production-sharing contract in Kalimantan had been increased by
34.1m barrels of oil equivalent from 420.6m at the end of last year.
Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief operating officer, said the increase confirmed
the considerable potential of the interest, acquired in the Pounds 1.1bn
takeover of Ultramar last year.
Indonesia accounted for more than 40 per cent of Lasmo's total reserves at
the end of last year.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Caledonia buy-back swamped and tenders to
be scaled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALEDONIA Investments has been swamped with tenders of stock following its
offer to buy up to 10 per cent of its share capital - 9.2m shares - at a
price of 355p.
Shareholders offered 35.3m shares to be bought back, worth Pounds 125.2m at
the tender price, compared to the Pounds 32.7m Caledonia was prepared to
buy.
Caledonia said tenders would be scaled down according to the number of
shares held by any investor. Those who offered more than 18.4 per cent of
their holdings would be scaled down to that level, while those who tendered
less than 18.4 per cent would have their shares accepted in full.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said that as the buy-back counted as a
distribution of income, non-tax paying funds, such as pension funds, which
tendered stock could reclaim tax adding about 100p a share to the value of
the offer.
The Cayzer family had tendered some stock to ensure that its holding in the
company would not rise by more than the permitted 2 per cent. The family
stake will be about 47.7 per cent following the tender.
The offer was announced on June 25, when the FT-SE 100 index stood at
2,557.3, compared to yesterday's close of 2,403.7. Caledonia's shares were
unchanged yesterday at 349p.
Caledonia is an investment holding company with stakes in a range of
businesses including 27.3 per cent of Exco, the money broking firm, which it
acquired in June, and 45 per cent of Bristow Helicpoter Group, bought last
November. Even after the buy-back the group will have about Pounds 150m of
cash available for investment.
The buy-back scheme still has to be approved by shareholders at the annual
meeting on August 5. If that meeting gives the go-ahead the company plans to
send out cheques the following day.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowie counters Henlys' defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trader bidding Pounds 26.3m for rival Henlys Group, said
the target's management was 'bankrupt of ideas' and had 'insufficient
resources to recover by itself'.
It would shortly be writing to Henlys' shareholders responding to points
made in the defence document published last Friday.
Cowie countered Henlys' claim that it had a new management team saying that
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, had been managing director of the group
since February 1990. Before that he had been chief executive of the original
Henlys, which merged with Plaxton in 1989, since 1985. It was the former
Plaxton bus and coach manufacturing side which had pushed Henlys into
losses.
Henlys forecast an interim loss of Pounds 900,000 in its defence document,
after an exceptional charge estimated at Pounds 950,000, and a maintained
dividend. Cowie said this demonstrated Henlys' financial weakness and
questioned 'the validity of a strategy which is unable to deliver profits'.
Cowie's shares closed at 139p, down 1p, making its 1-for-2 offer worth 69
1/2 p per share. Henlys closed at 70p, down 1p.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: CRT ends year with Pounds 6.16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRT GROUP, which as its name suggests is involved in consultancy,
recruitment and training, lifted pre-tax profits by almost 13 per cent from
a pro forma Pounds 5.47m to Pounds 6.16m in the 12 months to April 30.
The year, in which turnover rose some 12 per cent to Pounds 43.5m (Pounds
38.7m), was the group's first in its current form. Having reversed into R
Smallshaw (Knitwear), a textile manufacturing shell, it had spent Pounds 29m
to date on acquisitions, Pounds 18m of which was raised in two rights
issues.
Mr Barrie Clark, finance director, said that all the main acquisitions 'had
worked' and that the results were the proof.
Earnings per share increased to 8.26p (7.22p) and a final dividend of 1.825p
is recommended, making a total of 2.4p (2p), a rise of 20 per cent.
With only two small acquisitions in the year - Doctus Consulting Europe and
First Associates for a combined Pounds 200,000 - all growth was organic.
During the year, the group was given a new structure, new operating and
financial procedures and deferred considerations for past acquisitions were
unwound so the companies could fit in the new structure.
The main engine for the growth was the training division which contributed
90 per cent of the operating total from 47 per cent of total revenue.
Consulting accounted for 10 per cent of profits from 13 per cent of revenue
and recruitment only broke even on 40 per cent. The importance of training
to profits skews the results to the second half, said Mr Karl Chapman, chief
executive.
He said that recession-induced weak demand lay behind the performances of
consultancy and recruitment, adding that currently there was no sign of
recovery in these areas and that he did not expect any within the next two
years.
Expenditure in the current year will be Pounds 5.45m. Mr Chapman wanted to
raise the cost of competing with CRT and so was keen to gain BS5750 and
Investors in People standards. Some Pounds 250,000 will go on internal
assessors and Pounds 100,000 on multi-media technology.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Distribution boosts Menzies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from distribution services and the absence of
exceptional costs helped John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retail and
wholesale group, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 25.4m in
the year to May 2.
Mr John Menzies, chairman, said: 'We now expect a return to our previous
pattern of increased profits.'
Turnover in distribution grew to Pounds 705.5m (Pounds 662.7m) for trading
profits of Pounds 18.5m, a rise of Pounds 4m. Retailing turnover advanced by
Pounds 16m to Pounds 376.3m, though profits fell 29 per cent to Pounds 11m
(Pounds 15.5m).
Last time there were exceptional costs of Pounds 4m relating to poor stock
management and understatement of liabilities to suppliers in the Hammicks
book wholesaling business. Since then the Hammicks retail chain of bookshops
has been sold.
Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director, said that Menzies could not
maintain the level of investment necessary to develop the chain. The Pounds
6.8m proceeds were similar to the net assets and costs of sale.
The retailing downturn occurred in spite of the 10.5 per cent increase in
sales at Early Learning Centres, the toy retailer, in the UK. Mr Noel-Paton
described ELC in the UK as 'the retailer of the moment'.
This makes the situation in the US all the more perplexing. When asked why
ELC Inc has not worked, Mr Noel-Paton replied: 'I don't know the answer to
that question. I'm sure we're doing any number of things wrong.'
The group has taken an extraordinary charge of Pounds 7m, 'a terminal,
definitive provision', against trading losses and the maximum expected loss
on disposal. Negotiations for the sale continue.
A final dividend of 6.4p is proposed for a total of 10p (9.4p) and is
payable from earnings of 28.1p (23.6p) per share.
COMMENT
Opinions about John Menzies may be shifting. Its results were well above
expectations, it has healthy cash flow, and the divisional breakdowns -
urged for years - have materialised, showing both a good performance in
distribution and a poorer one in retailing. However, when ELC's success in
the UK will boost the retailing side remains an unanswered question. Another
is why have the benefits from restructuring, Epos, central distribution, and
upgraded IT facilities, not shown through yet in the John Menzies retailing
side? However, while it is rather stuck in a confectionery/tobacco/newsagent
format, that WH Smith, its main rival, has moved on from, the bias towards
wholesale is not a bad thing in the current climate. Assuming pre-tax
profits of Pounds 28m for the current year, the group is on a prospective
p/e of 12.6, a deserved discount. The shares have moved from a sell to an
uninspiring hold.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AH Ball Group, the USM-quoted civil engineer, yesterday announced it had
conditionally agreed to acquire KD, a manufacturer of process control
systems for the water industry.
The consideration of Pounds 2.87m is to be satisfied by the allotment of
2.15m ordinary shares and the issue of a loan note for Pounds 25,000. To
cover the costs of the acquisition the company also plans to raise a further
Pounds 470,000 by the issue of 385,241 new shares.
KD made profits of Pounds 427,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.8m in the year to
end-April. Net assets at that time were Pounds 175,000.
Ball also announced it was to apply to move from the USM to the official

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Electron reaps restructuring benefits with
rise to Pounds 1.42m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING at Electron House, begun two years ago, is working through in
results with the electronic components, computer systems and services
distributor benefiting from reduced costs and lower working capital.
A proposed sale of the wholesale computing business operations of Bytech
Computers for some Pounds 5m will effectively reduce borrowings by Pounds
9m, and cut the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds from 110 per cent to 25
per cent.
The business was being acquired by its senior management team led by 3i, the
investment capital group.
Sales within the group will be almost halved but it will be able to
concentrate resources on higher margin business.
Pre-tax profit rose 47 per cent to Pounds 1.42m in the year to May 31,
against Pounds 968,000. Turnover slipped to Pounds 125.4m (Pounds 126.9m),
to which the operations being sold contributed Pounds 61m.
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said the Australian and New Zealand businesses
recovered to produce a 'more acceptable' performance. The UK component
companies, excluding the car aerial business from which the group withdrew
last year, increased sales and profits marginally.
Computer companies generally produced a good result although CEM lost sales
through the temporary moratorium on government spending in Northern Ireland.
Earnings were 2.62p (1.65p); the sale and subsequent reorganisation should
have little effect on earnings, Mr Leigh said. The final dividend is 1.35p
for a 2.35p (2.25p) total.
As to prospects, he told shareholders that business continued to improve
slowly through increased market share and productivity rather than the
market showing any signs of uplift.

FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: WPP holders urged to support restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Bullmore, a non-executive director of WPP, the international
marketing services group, yesterday called on shareholders to vote in favour
of a proposed capital restructuring which has already gained the backing of
the group's syndicate of 28 banks.
WPP, which has bank debts of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m), yesterday held its
annual meeting, chaired by Mr Bullmore in the absence, due to illness, of Mr
David Ogilvy, chairman.
He reminded shareholders that current estimates of first-half pre-tax
profits were Pounds 14.2m, 'an improvement on the comparable figures for
1991'.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Foreign concern over Italy's health: Worldwide worry when a
state holding company defaults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of one of the G7 group of leading industrialised countries
defaulting on its foreign debts is the sort of thing that makes bankers lie
awake at night.
It was not surprising, then, that a frisson of fear rippled through the
international banking community over the weekend as it was confirmed that
one of Italy's big state holding companies does not intend to repay its
debts on time.
Efim, which has debts of L8,500bn (Pounds 3.87bn), is the sick man among the
country's state-run industrial combines. Many of its subsidiaries, which
number more than 100, are tied up in defence, aluminium and other industries
which are going through a tough period.
Yesterday's publication of an official decree confirmed the group's fate. It
is to be wound up by an administrator and its assets sold off. In the
meantime, the group - regarded by foreign bankers as virtually an arm of the
Italian treasury - will not service or repay any of its debts. That
unilateral moratorium could last two years.
If, as expected, the money raised from disposals does not cover Efim's big
debts, then the administrator will issue the group's creditors with up to
L4,000bn of government-backed bonds.
The Italian authorities have tried to put a positive gloss on the demise of
one of its top tier of industrial holding companies. Successive
administrations had failed to deal with the gathering problems at Efim; at
least now the problems are being tackled.
Foreign bankers have not seen things the same way. There are believed to be
17 separate syndicates of banks involved, put together at different times to
lend about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.03bn) to Efim and its subsidiaries.
Manufacturers Hanover (now merged with Chemical Bank) and Mitsubishi Trust
play a leading role in a number of these, though most international banks
turn up in one or more.
Part of what has set the bankers' nerves on edge was the manner in which
they learnt of Efim's fate. Neither the company nor the treasury warned
banks of their plans in advance, or made any effort to create the illusion
that they were consulting with their creditors. If this is how the
government handles the break-up of one of its largest industrial groups,
what chance is there for a smooth reorganisation of the country's state
sector?
Reduced to following events in newspapers or on newswires as news first
broke at the end of last week, one banker gave vent to his anger: 'Efim is
virtually an arm of the treasury. They frankly have to get this one right
otherwise Italy will be no better than an Argentina or a Brazil.'
The cloud of uncertainty continued to engulf bankers yesterday. 'Everyone is
trying to find out what the hell's going on. We're ringing other banks to
ask them, but when they pick up the phone, they ask us the same question,'
said one.
Other creditors worked hard to defuse what was in danger of becoming an
angry face-off between the Italian treasury and foreign bankers.
However, no banker likes to be told, without consultation, that debts are
not going to be paid on time. The manner in which Efim's demise was handled
is likely to live on in bankers' memories for some time.
Two immediate questions now trouble Efim's creditors. If the group's assets
do not cover its liabilities, how great will the shortfall be? And will the
Italian treasury's compensation arrangements make good the loss?
SG Warburg, the UK investment bank which acts as agent on a number of loans
to Efim and its subsidiaries, has been asked to value the group's assets,
along with Mediobanca, the private Italian bank.
The Italian government's pronouncements suggest that all creditors will be
repaid in full. But important questions have yet to be tackled. How will the
treasury set the interest rate on the bonds? Will the interests of all the
many different syndicates of bank creditors be taken into account, or will
some come off worse than others? Squaring the interests of all bank
creditors will not be easy.
The waves from the Efim affair are likely to be felt more widely. For a
start, Italian borrowers will find it virtually impossible to borrow from
foreign banks until the dust has settled. That much was clear yesterday as
bankers moved to freeze their exposure limits to Italy at current levels
until they can gauge the extent of the Efim problem.
Many foreign banks have only recently begun to lend again to Italy following
a row last year over the collapse of Federconsorzi, an agricultural group.
Although banks argued that the group had operated with an implicit state
guarantee, they were eventually forced to accept back only three quarters of
their claims.
Lenders to Italy's other main state holding companies are also now pawing
through the documentation behind their loans to see whether their rights are
affected. Such documents usually contain cross-default clauses, giving
lenders the right to call in their loans if the borrower defaults on any of
its other commitments.
The position is complicated by the insertion in yesterday's decree of a
clause apparently requiring bankers to renounce any claims against Efim
which arose before yesterday. 'We are getting legal advice on what it all
means,' the head of one syndicate of banks said.
The wrangle between Italy and its foreign bankers has come at an unfortunate
moment. Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, is already looking into
whether it should downgrade Italy from its current AA1 status. It already
fails to match up to the AAA standing of the other G7 countries, and any
further relegation would have a serious impact in the eyes of the
international financial community. With the debacle surrounding Efim, such a
move may just have come one step closer.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Sakura Bank to issue new bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAKURA Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, is preparing to issue
Dollars 800m (Pounds 418m) perpetual subordinated bonds in the international
market to shore up its depleted capital base.
The move is likely to herald a wave of similar issues by other Japanese
banks following a decision by the Ministry of Finance to sanction new types
of capital-raising bonds. The sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market has
undermined the capital-to-assets ratios of Japanese banks. Most of the
Japanese banks' Tier II, or non-equity, capital consists of unrealised gains
on stock holdings.
At the end of the past financial year in March, Sakura had a capital ratio
of 7.92 per cent. It was alone among the 11 commercial or 'city' banks
failing to meet the 8 per cent limit set by the Basle accord on
international bank capital adequacy.
However, the Nikkei stock market average has fallen by a further 18 per cent
since the end of March, eroding Tier II capital at other leading banks.
The banks have tried to alleviate the problem by suppressing asset growth
and by seeking subordinated loans from domestic life assurers. However, if
the stock market slump continues, banks will have to restrain further loan
growth. In addition, some of the banks are close to their limits of
subordinated loans - 50 per cent of Tier I capital.
Sakura said it would boost its capital ratio by 0.3 per cent by issuing
perpetual subordinated bonds. However, bankers point out that issuance of
bonds is a last resort. 'The ministry has been cautious in allowing Japanese
banks to issue such bonds due to the higher interest rates on the bonds,'
said a Japanese banker.
The perpetual floating-rate note market was popular in the early 1980s but
fell in 1986. Bankers point out that such events added to the reluctance of
the Ministry of Finance in permitting Japanese banks to reopen the market.
However, the decision by the ministry comes when Japanese institutional
investors have begun to review their investment strategies. Many face large
losses on portfolios due to the falls in stock prices, and are becoming
increasingly reluctant to commit funds to new investments.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Pounds 1bn Mersey barrage receives setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROJECT to build the Mersey Barrage, a Pounds 1bn electricity-generating
dam between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tidal power,
has failed to win government backing.
Whitehall is understood to have last week told Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman
of the Mersey Barrage Company, that it would provide no further cash. The
barrage would not qualify for public funds to subsidise the cost of its
electricity.
Shareholders will meet in Liverpool today to decide whether to try to keep
the 10-year-old project alive with an injection of Pounds 14m. About Pounds
7m has been spent so far by the public and private sector.
Supporters of the project say Whitehall's decision raises questions about
the government's commitment to environmentally friendly power generation.
The government is likely to have been swayed by the project's high energy
costs and by shippers who use the three Mersey ports of Liverpool, Garston
and Manchester Ship Canal. They fear the project would threaten navigation
of the estuary.
A feasibility study is being carried out on the project. Although studies
are incomplete their general findings are already known.
Environmentalists have mixed feelings. They favour renewable sources of
energy but are worried about the environmental impact of such big schemes.
The decision whether to subsidise the barrage went to Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary. The government wants to shelve the scheme for
later consideration, but supporters say this would kill the project off
because its design teams - numbering up to 40 people - could not be easily
reassembled.
Shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Allied Steel &amp; Wire, Barclays Bank,
BICC, Blue Circle, Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal
Insurance, Shell, Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are
represented by Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and
Liverpool University.
The crucial issue for funding the barrage is the price that could be charged
for the electricity generated. This needed to be about 7p per unit, of which
4p would be offset by the non-fossil fuel levy. A price of 3p per unit would
only allow about 40 per cent of building costs to be raised from the private
sector.
The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for
three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have been a substantial
contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb, the electricity supplier, to
take 20 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources.
David Lascelles writes: The Department of Trade would not comment on the
state of the project last night. Last year it authorised 122 renewable
energy projects with a total capacity of 472MW. These ranged from landfill
gas plants producing electricity at 5.7p a megawatt to windmills producing
power for 11p.
The Mersey Barrage is by far the largest renewable energy scheme close to
going ahead. If it were approved, it would take the government past its
target of 1,000MW of new capacity by the year 2000.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Rome is pressed to hit hard at Mafia after Sicily bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government faced a chorus of demands yesterday to adopt
exceptional measures to combat the Mafia following Sunday's assassination in
Palermo, Sicily, of a leading magistrate.
As a first response to the killing of Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading
anti-Mafia magistrate, with five of his bodyguards, the governmnent said
1,100 extra police and 1,000 paramilitary carabinieri were on their way to
Sicily.
The army had already been used in the early hours to help remove 55 Mafia
bosses from Palermo prison to high security jails on the mainland. Others
were being transfered to isolation jails.
The authorities believe the order for Mr Borsellino's killing came from one
of the Mafia bosses currently in Palermo prison.
In a special session of parliament last night, deputies quizzed the
government on the adequacy of security measures for frontline magistrates
and called for a policy of more active intervention against the Mafia. Mr
Borsellino was known to be top of its hit list.
Yesterday in Palermo crowds gathered outside the Palace of Justice to
express anger over the killing, in scenes similar to those two months ago
after the Mafia murder of Mr Giovanni Falcone, who had been leading the
fight against organised crime.
'It's war,' said one of the slogans carried by a demonstrator.
Inside the palace, Mr Borsellino's colleagues in the judiciary threatened a
strike against the inability of the state to protect their members.
Police also voiced extreme concern over the eight bodyguards killed in the
attacks on Mr Borsellino and Mr Falcone.
Members of the La Rete (the Network), the newly created anti-corruption
party in Sicily claimed their leader, Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former mayor of
Palermo, was now at serious risk, along with at least three others.
Mr Pino Arlacchi, a leading criminologist, said in a television interview
that the state was being confronted by a clear Mafia policy of killing one
by one those with knowledge about it.
The names and organisation of the Mafia were known to the authorities, he
added. 'The thing to be done now is a strong and immediate attack against
these men (the Mafia bosses), violent if necessary.'
Police and firemen were yesterday still clearing the devastation caused by
the car bomb which damaged many high-rise apartments and a school in a
modern suburb of Palermo, as well as injuring 18 people.
Mr Borsellino's family and those of his five bodyguards, one of whom was a
woman, said they would hold a private funeral.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Lord Jay backs Kinnock call for revaluation of
D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LORD JAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to support strongly Mr Neil Kinnock's letter (July 16) urging a
British lead for an agreed revaluation of the D-Mark against other ERM
currencies. A move to a competitive level for sterling is inevitable if this
country is to survive, and a postponement for one, two or more years (as
after 1925) will merely prolong the misery of 10 per cent unemployment for
that long. Since both Italy and France equally suffer from 10 per cent
unemployment - now the standard for EMS countries with over-valued
currencies - an agreed adjustment of the D-Mark to its true level is much
the best solution.
It is pure nonsense to say that a fall in the sterling rate would require
even higher interest rates. The freeing of the exchange rate in 1931 enabled
the War Loan conversion from 5 per cent to 3.5 per cent and drop in the Bank
Rate to 2 per cent in June 1932: and this fall in interest rates generated a
building boom and steady real growth throughout the 1930s.
The fall in interest rates was helped by the realisation that a competitive
exchange rate would correct the balance of payments deficit; which is still
true and is being ignored by the opponents of realignment.
It is also untrue that realignment would provoke a damaging rise in price
levels. The move of sterling to a competitive level in 1949 was followed by
a rise of the RPI over the year of less than 2 per cent, and in the longer
term, as Sir Alec Cairncross has shown (in 'Sterling in Decline'), a redress
in the whole imbalance between the sterling and economic worlds, which was a
major cause of the comparative stability enjoyed in the 1950s.
Similarly, the plunge in sterling in early 1985 was not followed by any
uprush in prices.
The arguments being advanced against early revaluation simply ignore the
practical experience. So why prolong the agony for no good purpose?

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins appears to be over-enthusiastic about the benefits of
private enterprise in the early years of the railways ('Politicians send the
trains down yet another track', July 15). While the achievements of this
sector in its first 50 or so years are indeed impressive and laudable, the
means by which they were made are open to criticism. There is too much
evidence in this period of rail company managers displaying little
competitive edge and of a huge misuse of funds in over optimistic investment
and aggressive, imperfect competition for us to look forward to a future of
private railways with anything more than the faintest glimmer of hope.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Transport - conflicts and little hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID STARKIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'No revolution in British Rail' (July 15), concludes
that the rail white paper, by separating track infrastructure from trains,
provides an opportunity to level the playing field between road and rail. To
complete the process you advocate higher fuel taxes and tolls on motorways.
It is perhaps not widely appreciated that legislation which enables the
playing field to be levelled reached the statute book last year. This
initiative - The New Roads and Street Works Act - allows for
privately-financed tolled roads. It has had very little impact. In several
instances untolled public schemes have been chosen instead of the tolled
schemes suggested by the private sector. A concession has been granted for
one privately financed road only and even this is not certain to proceed.
The government needs to revive this flagging policy. To do this, it needs to
level another playing field by placing the department of transport's road
planners, some of whom strongly oppose toll roads, at arm's length from
those advising ministers. At the present time there is a clear conflict of
interest, especially when rival private and public schemes are seeking
approval.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Expenditure priorities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY, the British cabinet will meet to discuss its strategy for the
public spending round. It does so in inauspicious circumstances: the
government has lost its previously sound fiscal position; it has little
chance of balancing its budget in the medium term; and it will be unable to
combine its current spending plans with continued membership of the ERM and
lower taxes. In consequence, the Treasury will assail whatever looks the
least bit vulnerable, while its charter-waving opponents in the spending
ministries will put up an equally spirited defence.
The short- to medium-term worries are not imaginary. As recently as 1988-89,
the public sector's debt repayment was 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
When disinflation started to bite, however, that debt repayment turned into
a borrowing requirement likely to exceed 5 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 and
1993-94. The main reason for the slide into the red is that between 1990-91,
when the PSBR was zero, and next year the government planned to increase
public spending by 11.6 per cent in real terms. But over the same period
real gross domestic product is, barring a sudden recovery, likely to fall.
Public spending cannot grow faster than real GDP for long without parallel
increases in taxes. With the election talk of recovery revealed as
hyperbole, the government's thoughts naturally turn towards a tough spending
round. But the round should be more than just tough, it should demonstrate a
sense of priorities. Otherwise, the main outcome is likely to be the usual
wasteful cuts in public investment.
Individual responsibility
In the first year of a new parliament, a government that also starts with a
net ratio of public sector debt to GDP of only about 30 per cent need not
panic. The scale of the actual and prospective increases in the PSBR
underlines the case for a rethink of public spending. How else, after all,
can cuts be made in a rational manner? But it is not the only reason for
such a reconsideration. The question a government committed to individual
responsibility and low taxation should ask is what it should be doing in the
first place.
The questioning should start from what it does now. Total government
expenditure amounted to 42 per cent of GDP last year (excluding
privatisation proceeds). Some 29 per cent of this was for social security,
15 per cent for health and personal social services, 13 per cent for
education, 9 1/2 per cent for defence, 5 per cent for law and order and 4
per cent for transport.
These six areas accounted for three quarters of total spending. Since debt
interest added another 7 per cent, all other governmental activity amounted
to less than a fifth of the total.
Charter standards
Is it necessary for the government to provide retirement pensions to all,
independent of their individual wealth? Should state education be available
free at the point of use to every parent, independent of their means? What
about health? Is it possible to meet citizen-charter standards for these and
other services without greater funding and, if so, should more of that
funding not come from the users?
How much of the road building programme can be funded through toll roads or
financed directly through user charges? Given the inability of the Treasury
to distinguish sensibly between capital and current spending, can other
areas of capital spending be privatised or charged to users, if necessary
through earmarked taxation?
These questions are uncomfortable to ask. But any sensible programme for
long term control of public spending has to start from them. This does not
mean that there is no alternative, especially for a hard-pressed government.
It consists of cutting anything that has no huge lobby behind it,
particularly capital spending. It consists of pretending that government can
do all it now promises to do - provide first rate education and health
services, for example - without raising extra revenue. It consists, in
effect, of spreading a grey blanket of underfunding and mediocrity over the
services that are most important to the public.
Aneurin Bevan called priorities the language of socialism. It is not. It is
the language of good government. Time will soon tell whether Mr Major's
government has the nerve to try to speak it.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Chill winds on campaign trail: The fading US recovery has
serious political implications for the president and his challenger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, delivers his biannual
Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony today in a uniquely charged
atmosphere.
As President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas square up for
what seems likely to be one of the most closely fought presidential races in
years, America's slowest economic recovery on record is again showing signs
of faltering. After a flurry of awful economic figures, there is talk of a
'triple dip' recession. The dollar is under renewed pressure in financial
markets following Germany's decision to tighten monetary policy again. The
Fed, meanwhile, has badly undershot its modest targets for monetary growth.
Mr Greenspan thus faces a potential mauling from Democrats on Capitol Hill,
many of whom believe US interest rates are too high, in spite of being at
their lowest level for a generation.
Mr Greenspan will unveil economic forecasts and monetary targets for 1993
and do his courteous best to justify the Fed's recent handling of monetary
policy. Having been markedly too optimistic on previous occasions (a year
ago he spoke of 'compelling signs' of recovery shortly before the economy
sagged into a second dip), he will be under pressure from congressmen not to
overstate the economy's strength a second time. He will also be acutely
aware of the need to preserve the Fed's reputation for political neutrality.
He cannot afford to provide ammunition for either the Republican or
Democratic campaigns.
The question on everybody's lips is whether the recovery will falter before
November. The past 10 days could hardly have been more worrying. The
employment figures for June - a loss of 117,000 non-farm jobs and a surge in
the unemployment rate to 7.8 per cent - sent shock waves through financial
markets. These were recession numbers pure and simple. Last week's figures
added to the gloom. The trade deficit widened in May for the third month
running, mainly because of weak exports. Disappointing retail sales in June
indicated a stalling of personal consumption in the second quarter.
Industrial production fell last month, with declines in every important
sector. Housing starts, meanwhile, dropped by more than 3 per cent. The
University of Michigan index of consumer confidence sank in early July, as
did car sales relative to late June.
This consistent picture of fading vitality in the real economy was matched
by unexpected weakness of money and credit. To Mr Greenspan's embarrassment,
M2, the Fed's favoured measure of broad money, has contracted in nominal
terms in the past three months, bringing it below his target of annual
growth of 2.5-6.5 per cent. Previously rapid growth of M1, a narrow measure
of money preferred by monetarists, has also levelled off. Some of the
monetary weakness undoubtedly reflects a shifting of liquidity into bond
funds and other instruments offering a higher return than bank deposits.
Even so, few analysts are confident that money is growing fast enough to
support a robust economic recovery. The historical link between M2 and
growth of the real economy is too close for comfort.
The good news for the Bush administration is that few economists yet predict
a return to outright recession. With personal consumption spending flat,
hardly anybody expects the growth rate of 2.7 per cent at an annual rate in
the first quarter to be sustained. Many forecasters have shaved their growth
forecasts to 1.5-2 per cent in the second and third quarters; some are more
pessimistic still. In Europe 2 per cent may not sound too bad. But in the
US, where growth rates of 5-6 per cent are regarded as normal in the
aftermath of recessions, it is little short of disastrous. With the labour
force still expanding, 2 per cent is regarded as the minimum politically
acceptable rate of growth, and even this may not be enough to prevent
unemployment edging higher.
Some economists are confident that employment figures for July, due early in
August, will give Mr Bush a lift ahead of the Republican convention in
Houston. They say the June data were distorted by the timing of that month's
survey, and predict a sharp rebound this month. But even if the unemployment
rate falls slightly, the pervasive feeling of economic malaise is likely to
persist.
Mr Bush's problem is that his economic record is noticeably worse than that
of any of his post-second world war predecessors. In the first three years
of his presidency, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of
only 1.1 per cent. That is significantly slower than under Eisenhower in the
late 1950s or Ford and Carter in the 1970s (see chart). Yet in all three
instances, the incumbent party lost control of the White House. Even if,
against the odds, growth rebounds in the next few months, voters will lack
that warm feeling of economic security that is the single best predictor of
electoral success.
How can Mr Bush defend his lacklustre record? The White House has already
attempted to shift blame on to Mr Greenspan, arguing that excessively tight
monetary policy helped push the economy into recession in 1990. But such
criticisms are hard to sustain. In an effort to restore growth, the Fed has
cut the discount rate (at which the Fed lends to banks) from 7.5 per cent to
3 per cent, a level lower than anybody imagined possible in the late 1980s.
While not ruling out further monetary easing if the economy stumbles, Mr
Greenspan is likely to argue that the Fed has fired most of its ammunition.
With the dollar already looking wobbly, he may try to focus attention, once
again, on the excessive budget deficit, arguing that this has stifled
recovery by preventing the requisite decline in long bond yields.
The depressing reality is that the Bush administration has lost control of
both sides of the federal budget. Conservative critics are dismayed not only
that Mr Bush broke his 1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes but that he
has also acquiesced in the fastest growth of domestic federal spending since
the Camelot presidency of John F Kennedy in the early 1960s. Real domestic
spending has grown at an annual rate of more than 8 per cent, yet the cash
has mainly been dissipated in higher transfer payments (often to the rich
elderly as opposed to the genuinely needy) rather than channelled into the
productive investments demanded by Mr Clinton.
Financial markets, like voters, are now trying to assess the economic
implications of a possible Democratic victory in November. Mr Bush was
unlucky to reach the Oval Office just as the long economic upswing of the
1980s was drawing to a natural close. After frantic consumption and
borrowing during the Reagan years, no president could have avoided the need
for a prolonged period of adjustment as debts were paid down. In this sense
Mr Bush is a victim of circumstances.
It seems probable, however, that fortune will smile on America's next
president. Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, says 1993 and 1994
will be 'banner years' for the US economy. This is perhaps an exaggeration
because there is still a risk that the economy will remain mired in
semi-recession next year, but growth at an annual rate close to 3 per cent
ought to be achievable. The new president, after all, will inherit moderate
inflation - the underlying rate could be as low as 3 per cent - and a
manufacturing sector that is extremely competitive in world markets.
In the past decade, US industry's relative competitiveness has been
transformed by three mutually reinforcing developments: a sharp decline in
the dollar, very slow growth of US wages and significant improvements in
productivity. Mr Larry Veit, a senior economist at the investment bank Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York, calculates that US unit labour costs are 4
per cent lower than in 1982. In dollar terms Japanese, German and British
unit labour costs have risen by 93 per cent, 74 per cent and 28 per cent
respectively. The US is thus poised to recapture market share overseas as
the world economy recovers in the mid-1990s.
If steady growth does indeed resume next year, the incoming president will
benefit from a natural cyclical decline in the budget deficit. The Fed,
meanwhile, would probably tighten monetary policy, resulting in a modest
rise in short-term interest rates and some firming of the dollar. If Mr Bush
is re-elected, that is the end of the story. He would probably try to curb
federal spending and push for minor tax cuts, such as a lower top rate of
capital gains tax. But with Democrats still controlling Congress, few
measures would be passed. The fiscal gridlock of the late 1980s would
continue.
For financial markets, a Clinton presidency is a far riskier prospect. The
core of Mr Clinton's economic programme is a planned Dollars 200bn increase
in public investment over the next four years, split evenly between
infrastructure and education and training. The case for such investment is
powerful; the doubts centre on the way it would be financed. With a
projected budget deficit of Dollars 350bn for this year, the only
responsible way to finance such investment is through higher taxes. Yet Mr
Clinton has pledged not to raise taxes on the majority of middle-income
Americans.
His hope of raising nearly Dollars 100bn from the top 2 per cent of earners
may prove unrealistic. The practicality - let alone desirability - of
raising large additional sums from foreign companies operating in the US is
also doubtful. The already rapidly declining defence budget, meanwhile, may
fail to yield the Dollars 50bn in extra savings pencilled in by the Clinton
team. There are many potential alternative sources of revenue: higher energy
and excise taxes, for example, or even a value-added tax along European
lines. But these would all hit the middle classes harder than the
well-to-do, and thus seemingly violate Mr Clinton's campaign pledges.
The right investments in education, skill training and infrastructure could
sharply improve America's long-run economic competitiveness. This is the
promise of a Clinton presidency. The troubling question, however, is whether
Mr Clinton, co-operating with a Democratic Congress, would resist the
temptation to pay for this investment with another surge in federal
borrowing. Unless the Democrats can allay this fear, financial markets are
likely to view the possibility of a Clinton victory in November with some
trepidation.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Fat chance of privacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister was right to refuse Mr David Mellor's offer of
resignation on Saturday night. There was no evident reason why the secretary
for national heritage (or minister of fun, as he is indelibly labelled)
should go. A Sunday newspaper published an account of a private relationship
ascribed to Mr Mellor, but that tells us more about the tabloid press than
about the political abilities of the minister.
Mr Mellor did make one mistake. He issued a statement. He would have done
better to maintain silence. The statement said that he and his wife wanted
to sort out difficulties in their marriage, especially for the sake of their
two young children. 'This I hope we can do in private.' Fat chance.
Yesterday's papers confirmed that the British popular press will do anything
to entertain us. In this it succeeds. At breakfast I found myself savouring
every word the picture papers wrote about our minister of fun. What they
purvey may be correct, but their justification is humbug.
Many of their practitioners are expense-account fiddlers, drunks,
fornicators, cheats, and liars. All of us are some of these. But they steal
the privacy of others. They justify their trade by invoking the pious
phrases 'freedom of the press' and 'the public interest'. They have little
idea of the true meaning of the former and no interest in the latter. What
they are really after is the unfettered right to puff themselves up, to
swear and swagger and break wind. The fact that they do it amusingly - that
they cause most of us to laugh and shake our heads - serves only to
underline the truth about their position in society. They have become the
music hall performers, the burlesque queens, of the 1990s.
That is why self-regulation is a joke. It has not worked, cannot work, and
will not work. Nearly a fortnight ago Mr Mellor asked Sir David Calcutt to
review the effectiveness of the voluntary Press Complaints Commission, set
up in January 1991. It was his way of putting off a decision neither he nor
the government wants to make, which is to place the commission on a
statutory footing. Let such a decision be put off forever. It would be the
beginning of official regulation of the press.
This, like all censorship, should be resisted. On matters of importance  -
the inner workings of every ministry, to take but one example - the British
government is still far too secretive. Mr Major says he will conduct a more
open administration. That sounds fine, but it does not mean very much. The
prime minister's real purpose is to dodge the pressure for a pro-per freedom
of information act. Such pressure should be maintained. We should demand
more information in Britain - and a legal right to extract it, painfully,
molar by molar, from a reluctant civil service.
Meanwhile people do need protection from the excesses of any publication. If
there is to be no statutory complaints commission, what then? I favour a law
enabling individuals to sue for invasion of their personal privacy. It
should be so framed as to prevent the misuse of injunctions in advance of
publication, or the imposition of excessive fines, as happens in libel
cases. But publishers, whether of books, periodicals, or broadcasts, would
have to pay reasonable damages unless they could convince a jury that a
particular invasion of personal privacy was in the public interest. The news
that the secretary for health, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, and her husband had
had their first child before they were married clearly passes the public
interest test. The difficulties facing teenage single parents are the
concern of the department of health, and therefore its political head.
Mr Mellor's case is more complicated. The editor of The People, Mr Bill
Hagerty, would presumably base his defence on his statement, widely reported
yesterday, that the heritage secretary 'said he was unable to write speeches
because he was so tired'. Any jury in its right mind would laugh this out of
court. Counsel might do better to draw attention to the many Conservative
speeches and pamphlets on family values. In this way it might be possible to
build up a public interest defence. Much would depend upon the details of Mr
Mellor's behaviour and the content of his speeches over the years. We can
only guess what evidence might be produced and what a jury would say. But in
most instances powerful people such as ministers would lose. The privacy law
would be primarily aimed at the protection of 'ordinary' people.
What politicians need is a climate of opinion that responds to news about
their private lives with a definitive Gallic shrug. Disraeli, Asquith and
Lloyd George might have been hounded from office by a popular press in a
climate like today's; the then Mr Cecil Parkinson was, for a while. But
opinion may be changing. Mr Paddy Ashdown's popularity increased after his
news broke. If Mr Mellor can stand the increasing heat - a big if - he
should stay in the kitchen.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Don Quixote - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERTO Gerhard was born in Catalonia in 1896 and died in Cambridge in 1970,
having reached Britain as a Spanish Civil War exile more than three decades
earlier. These facts - and, even more important, Gerhard's marvellously
fertile, open-spirited inventiveness as a composer - were the salient ones
in the background to the revival of his 1950 ballet Don Quixote in Sunday's
Albert Hall Promenade concert by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.
This was an important revival - it was billed as the first British concert
performance of the complete score (as distinct from the various suites and
sets of dances extracted from it, which are often done).
In common with the Sheridan opera The Duenna, it was composed during the
first years of Gerhard's exile; and like that opera (which was belatedly
unveiled to the world in Madrid earlier this year), Don Quixote is an
exuberant and imaginative reworking of Gerhard's Iberian musical inheritance
in up-to-date 20th century terms.
The scenario of the ballet was drawn from Cervantes by Gerhard himself;
apparently it was the quirkiness of his narrative plotting, pacing and
shaping that accounted for the work's failure to take root in the ballet
repertory after the Royal Opera House premiere in 1950 (with choreography by
De Valois, decor by Burra, and Helpmann and Fonteyn in the leading roles).
In concert the dramatic pressures of the score's narrative recede in
importance behind the significance of its purely musical qualities; and in
total, these were shown by Simon Rattle and his orchestra to be abundantly
rich.
Falla's great Spanish ballets are in the background. But so is Berg - as a
Schoenberg pupil in the 1920s Gerhard's eyes and ears had long been widened
to the value and importance of all the main European musical trend. In
parallel with the opera, the special distinction of Don Quixote lies in its
attempt - heartfelt, energetic, generous and also keenly focused - to
reconcile Gerhard's artistic past, present and future.
His success, which seems to me even greater than in The Duenna, makes one
grieve all over again at the craven provincialism of the wartime and
post-wartime British musical world in its failure to embrace this born
theatre-man and draw on his gifts.
It is in the psychological depiction of Don Quixote that the modernist
Gerhard shows his greatest percipience, developing what the programme-note
writer David Drew calls a 'serial skeleton' to depict the 'world of (his)
crazed imagination'.
The sinuous blending of outer and inner worlds in a musico-dramatic context
is what lends the music its special fascination - that, and the sheer sound
of the music, which, with its piquant concertante role for the piano and its
constant dry rattle of Spanish rhythmic patterning, proves wonderfully
alluring. I should have liked to encounter it in a less reverberant, more
theatre-like acoustical ambience than that provided by the Albert Hall (as a
result of which certain transitional passages seemed to me slightly
over-extended).
But for Rattle's eloquent, warm-spirited and utterly convinced conducting of
the music, and for the lustrous playing of the CBSO, there can be only the
highest praise. In the second part of this splendid Prom, the CBSO chorus
filled the higher platform tiers and Thomas Trotter the organ loft for one
of those uniquely uplifting Rattle accounts of the Janacek Glagolitic Mass
that sends everyone out of the hall a happier and better person for having
heard it.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Almeida Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE concerts of contemporary music fitted around the three productions of
the first incarnation of Almeida Opera, at the Almeida Theatre, London N1,
have given useful breadth and variety to the season. The idea of relating
these programmes to the operas has been generally successful, and only
occasionally strained. As a template for future seasons it seems eminently
flexible.
The evening devoted to 'Musica Transalpina', tracing the Italianate
influence into northern Europe as a corollary to the production of Stephen
Oliver's Mario and the Magician, brought one important revival - a
performance by Music Projects under Richard Bernas of The Deluge, Alexander
Goehr's 1959 setting of da Vinci. It is a toughly argued, sinewy piece, with
intense vocal writing for the soprano and mezzo soloists. But 30 years on it
seems curiously fixed in its time, holding its passionate lyricism under
tight control.
The remainder of the Music Projects programme was mixed - a beautifully
idiomatic account of Schoenberg's Serenade (still though a work that never
fails to outstay its welcome), and a poised, neat version of Donatoni's
exquisite Arpege. There was a dutiful premiere of some new Michael Finnissy:
Various Nations was commissioned by Almeida Opera, yet turned out to be a
curiously perfunctory piece. A narrator (Eleanor Bron here) delivers
readings from a Victorian children's geography book, full of hilarious
colonial condescension, while the ensemble runs through a sequence of
suitably ethnic pastiches. One waits to be surprised, but the expected
musical twist or sting never happens, and the piece fizzles out tamely and
without consequence.
Sunday's closing concerts were given by the Bergen-based ensemble BIT 20.
The early-evening programme promised two British premieres, of Kaija
Saariaho's gravely beautiful Lichtbogen and Arne Nordheim's emptily
rhetorical Tre Voci. But neither was new to this country; Almeida Opera's
programme book seems to have inherited its predecessor's piratical claims to
first performances.

Allied-Lyons, the international food and drinks group, is continuing to mend

Barings, has been appointed a non-executive director.
Michael Jackaman, who took over the chairmanship of Allied-Lyons following
the Pounds 147m currency trading loss last year, says that Rivett-Carnac's
extensive international background in merchant banking and investment will
bring a valuable extra dimension to board deliberations.
Rivett-Carnac is the second non-executive to be appointed to the board since
Jackaman took the helm last year. John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, was
appointed in October and other new non-executive faces are expected.
Jackaman says that he would like the number of executive and non-executive
directors to be roughly equal. New directors will be appointed for three
years, with the option of renewing their term for another three years.
Jackaman first met Rivett-Carnac when Barings was one of the advisers on the
group's Hiram Walker acquisition. However, he stresses that Barings is not
retained as Allied-Lyons' permanent financial adviser. Given that
Rivett-Carnac is close to retirement, Jackaman says he thinks there is no
conflict of interest in having the chairman of one of the City's bigger fund
managers on his board.

Tony Brigden, 50, currently director of parts and service operations, has
been given the tough task of trying to reverse Ford's slumping sales
fortunes in the UK.
Brigden's is one of several new appointments Ford of Britain announced in
its restructuring of senior sales management yesterday. Once the
unchallenged market leader with a share of 30 per cent, Ford's share is now
in the low 20s and it is becoming hard-pressed to stay ahead of
second-placed Vauxhall.
Brigden is to take over from Colin Breathwick, currently fleet sales
director, who takes up the new appointment of director, retail strategy, on
August 1. Reporting directly to chairman and managing director Ian
McAllister, Breathwick, 49, will be responsible for analysing Ford's
existing approaches to the marketplace.
Brigden is to be succeeded in parts and service by Phil Cazaly, 45,
currently director of sales and service operations at Ford of Europe, based
in Germany.
Ford believes a 'cultural change' is taking place in customer attitudes
towards the car; during the 1990s car ownership will become less important

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECJ has upheld UK state pension rules which discriminate in favour of
women. Under UK legislation, men must contribute to the state scheme for 44
years for a full pension, whereas women need only contribute for 39 years;
men have to contribute to the scheme if they are employed between the ages
of 60 and 64, whereas women do not.
The ECJ held that such discrimination was lawful as EC law permitted
exceptions to the general rule of non-discrimination in this area, but only
insofar as such exceptions were necessary in order to achieve the objectives
of EC social security legislation and only on a temporary basis. The Court
also stated that an enforced change of the national rules now would lead to
financial disequilibrium of the UK pension scheme.
Case 9/91: The Queen v secretary of state for social security ex parte the
Equal Opportunities Commission, ECJ FC, July 7 1992.
National waste provisions overturned
In a case which provoked environmental concern, Belgium was found to have
breached EC obligations by a regional Wallonian degree banning waste from
other member states.
EC legislation sets out procedures for the transhipment of hazardous waste;
the Wallonian decree went beyond these rules and was thus unlawful. However,
the ban did not breach general EC waste provisions, where states still have
residual competence. Belgium is thus in the anomalous position of being able
to ban imports of non-toxic waste, but not of toxic waste.
The Court also found that the Rome Treaty provisions on free movement of
goods applied in principle to waste. Arguments that the national provisions
were discriminatory against non-Belgian waste and thus unlawful were
rejected, the Court citing Basle Convention obligations on self-sufficiency
and proximity in waste elimination to justify the difference in treatment.
C-2/90: Commission v Belgium, ECJ FC, July 9 1992.
UK immigration law unlawful
UK immigration rules were ruled unlawful by the ECJ as conflicting with EC
provisions on free movement.
Mr Singh, an Indian national married to a British citizen, worked with his
wife in Germany for two years before returning to England. On the basis of
pending divorce proceedings between them, the UK authorities refused Mr
Singh indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He stayed beyond the time
allowed and a deportation order was made against him. He appealed, arguing
that he had a Community right to stay in the UK as the spouse of a Community
national.
Under Rome Treaty provisions, Community nationals are entitled to reside and
work anywhere within the EC. As these rights would be restricted if
obstacles to the entry and residence of their existing spouses/children were
raised by domestic provisions, the Court held the UK provisions unlawful.
C-370/90: The Queen v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh, ex
parte home secretary, ECJ FC, July 7 1992.
Spanish immigration law unlawful
Spanish rules on dual nationality, whereby nationality is based on the last
habitual residence, were held to be unlawful by the ECJ insofar as they
conflicted with EC rules on establishment and the provision of services.
Mr Micheletti, a dual national of Argentina and Italy, studied at university
in Argentina and then came to Spain to work. He was refused a residence
permit on the grounds that he was an Argentine and had last been resident in
Argentina. On a reference for a preliminary ruling, the ECJ held that
although member states were allowed to set their own rules on nationality,
these rules had to respect EC law. Thus, where an individual had Community
rights because he was a Community national, these rights could not be
restricted by domestic provisions.
C-369/90: Mario Vincente Micheletti and others v Delagacion del Govierno en
Cantabria, ECJ FC, July 7 1992.
Belgian social security law upheld
The restriction of state disability allowances to Belgian nationals was
upheld by the ECJ on the grounds that it did not infringe relevant EC rules.
While living in Belgium, the Iranian wife of an Italian national tried to
claim a disability allowance from the Belgian state on the basis that as the
spouse of an EC national, she was entitled to benefits available in the
member state where she resided. The Court did not accept this argument,
stating that her rights to EC social security allowances were restricted to
those she could receive as a member of the family of an EC national. As the
spouse was seeking the allowance in her own right and not by virtue of being
the spouse of a Community national, the relevant EC rules were not
applicable.
C-243: Belgium v Noushin Taghavi, ECJ 1CH, July 8 1992.
Other cases
Italy was held in breach of its Rome Treaty obligations, having failed to
implement two directives relating to threadworm and brucellosis in due time.
C-270/91: Commission v Italy, ECJ FC, July 8 1992.
Milk quotas can lawfully be denied to farmers who have let out their land
prior to demanding their quota, as it is the tenant and not the original
farmer who has the use of the land and therefore the right to the quota.
C-236/90: Reinhard Maier v Freistaat Bayern, ECJ 3CH, July 9 1992.
A minimum level of value added tax levied on second-hand cars sold in
Belgium was found to be contrary to EC VAT provisions in that it would lead
to VAT being charged twice on the same good.
C-131/91: BV 'K' Line Air Service Europe v NV Eularts &amp; Belgium, ECJ 6CH,
July 9 1992.
A German worker who worked in the UK, paid national insurance contributions
and received unemployment benefit there, was entitled, on her return to
Germany, to unemployment benefit in Germany. The Court emphasised, however,
that such benefits could not be cumulated.

begins a series which offers advice on some unusual openings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Anyone can become a private detective. There is no need for a licence, nor
for membership of a professional body, although a little knowledge of the
law will help. About half the private detectives in Britain are former
policemen who have either retired or left the Force early, but you do not
have to be an ex-policeman to become a competent private investigator.
The right person should be observant, persistent, have a good memory, and
possess the stamina to work unsociable hours.
They must be inconspicuous when following a subject and have a basic
knowledge of psychology to fathom a motive or persuade an interviewee to
part with secret information.
The profession of the private detective does not have an official status and
is not recognised by the police, so private investigators are not subject to
supervision and they do not have to abide by a code of practice.
There are a number of detective agencies advertised in the Yellow Pages
which may take on trainee private eyes.
After a two-year training period with an agency, the trainee can apply to
become a member of the ABI (Association of British Investigators) by taking
the ABI examination.
The other main association is the IPI (Institute of Professional
Investigators) which is based in Preston.
Both the ABI and the IPI offer thorough training and may give the
prospective detective a stamp of credibility.
Gumshoeing can be a very lucrative business when the private investigator is
employed by a large company, perhaps looking into fraudulent goings-on among
its employees, or maybe delving into a suspected case of industrial
espionage.
The fee will depend on the size of the corporation; it is not unusual for a
fairly large company to pay a reputable PI with a good track record between
Pounds 800 and Pounds 2,000 a week.
Even more can be earned by the PI who specialises in a particular area of
the commercial sector, such as accounting procedure or computer operations.
Other private detectives who serve the general public - perhaps tracking
down a debtor, tracing a long-lost sweetheart, or ferreting out evidence for
a legal case - may end up less well off.
The fees quoted by these private investigators vary considerably. Some
demand a preliminary payment of about Pounds 150 and have an hourly rate of
around Pounds 20, plus travelling expenses of 30p a mile.
Others are prepared to work on a case for around Pounds 35 a day without a
retainer or without additional charges for transport costs and expenses.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The western approach to
gentle persuasion / A look at a scheme for young east European entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a room at the top of a grand period residence in Queen Anne's Gate,
London, five eastern European young entrepreneurs are considering the
following proposition: 'Selling is a persuasive process where one individual
motivates another individual to buy'.
Aniko Mirtse, aged 22, product manager of a small company in Debrecen,
Hungary, checks her dictionary against the flip-chart. The words
'persuasive' and 'motivates' are causing her some problems, but it is
difficult to tell whether her difficulties are principally linguistic or
ideological.
For Mirtse and her fellow entrepreneurs, the seminar on selling is part of a
British-based project to provide first-hand experience of a western European
market economy. Participants spend a month or two seconded to a small
business in Britain, combining practical experience with training sessions
and social events.
For the sponsoring small businesses the programme may provide, in return, an
entree to eastern European markets at a cost of nothing but their time.
The scheme is organised by a small charity called Enterprise Europe, which
was set up in 1990 by a group of people in their twenties. Pippa Markus,
former press officer for the Institute of Directors and a founding member of
the charity, is now its full-time director.
'A group of us watched the Berlin Wall coming down and felt we wanted to
play some role in the vast changes that were happening. We particularly
wanted to do something practical for people like us, of our age, who were
interested in work and getting on. Some of us also had eastern European
backgrounds,' she says.
The need for technological know-how in eastern Europe is not as acute as the
need for training in, for example, marketing, financial planning,
presentation and customer relations, according to Markus.
Money to fund the scheme is raised from charitable trusts and large
companies, some of which have also paid the full costs of placements.
For small businesses, all the expenses are met by the charity, and
on-the-job training is supplemented by seminars organised by Enterprise
Europe.
Stephen Cowan, director of a sales training group called Focus and a member
of the charity's ruling council, is the volunteer trainer at the Queen
Anne's Gate session.
Trainees are principally from Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia although,
as the programme establishes itself, the intention is to extend the scheme
to Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic Republics. About 100 applications a week
from prospective trainees land on the London office desk - 14 have passed
through the programme since the second part of last year and further
expansion has been limited by lack of suitable small business placements.
Enterprise Europe prefers trainees to be under 35 and in full-time
employment in their own country, commonly at a pre- or lower management
level - 'the next generation of business leaders in eastern Europe,' says
Markus.
For example, of the present batch battling with 'persuasion' and
'motivation' in the selling seminar, is Marcin Slupski, from Poznan, Poland.
He is 28, and the managing director of a small private company called Inkey,
which sells security systems.
It is Slupski's first visit to the UK and he has spent a month with TDSi, a
company in Dorset which develops access controls. He has been examining ways
the two companies can co-operate, as well as studying TDSi's products and
management.
Richard Benda, from Brno, Czechoslovakia, is 27 and a manager with a trade
fairs and exhibitions company. He has been teamed up by Enterprise Europe
with a mobile exhibition company in Northampton called Business Link. This
placement is an example of the mutual benefits possible under the scheme:
Benda's stay is leading directly to a Czech venture for the company, says
Business Link managing director Anthony Lunch.
'We've increasingly been taking exhibitions abroad and we've had an eye on
eastern European opportunities, but what we needed was a friendly pair of
hands on the other side. Richard Benda has lived very much up to
expectations. We're taking a mobile exhibition to Czechoslovakia in
October,' says Lunch.
Benda has covered the range of Business Link's work from going out and about
selling, to using data bases back at the office. He has networked
ferociously during his month's stay, meeting local authority officials,
Chamber of Commerce chiefs, and dining at the House of Commons with the
local MP. And, reports Lunch, Benda has had a taste of operating in a more
informal, questioning and less bureaucratic environment.
While travel, accommodation costs and other expenses are met by Enterprise
Europe, sponsoring small businesses have to pledge to set aside time
conscientiously for training and supervision.
The time involved should not be underestimated. Says Lunch: 'In a small
company there's no-one to delegate to. It can be difficult to keep the
person busy all the time.'
Meanwhile, back at Queen Anne's Gate it is Benda's turn to puzzle over the
flip-chart; this time the problem is very definitely ideological rather than
linguistic. In front of the trainees is a triangular diagram depicting
Maslow's 'hierarchy of needs'.
Maslow's theory, roughly, is that there are five levels of human need for
satisfaction, starting with basic physiological needs, for example for food
and shelter, and finishing with the need for self-fulfilment, which can
never be completely satisfied. In between the base of the triangle and its
apex are security, social and ego needs. The triangle forms the basis of
marketing and professional selling, explains Stephen Cowan.
Benda earnestly questions Cowan in the coffee break about the morality of
Maslow's theory. Physiological, security and social needs, he has been
taught, should be taken care of by the state, while ego and self-fulfilment
needs are anti-social and should be denied.
However, to Cowan's delight, Benda and his fellow young entrepreneurs are,
by the end of the day, filled with enthusiasm and are practising western
selling techniques on each other. They appear to be fully equipped to
exploit any ego needs that might be burgeoning among customers in their own
countries.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Lords rule on right of silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENDANTS in fraud cases can no longer automatically use their right to
silence to avoid answering questions in civil proceedings, the House of
Lords ruled yesterday.
The judgment is likely to make it considerably easier for liquidators and
other investigators to track down and recover missing funds in future fraud
cases.
Giving judgment in the case of AT&amp;T Istel v Mr Arthur Tully, five law lords
ruled by four to one that a Court of Appeal decision restoring Mr Tully's
right to silence should be overturned.
Mr Tully had originally successfully challenged a High Court ruling that he
should provide details of transactions and assets to victims of his alleged
fraud.
Lord Templeman yesterday described the use of the right to silence in civil
proceedings as 'an archaic and unjustifiable survival from the past'.
He said: 'It is difficult to see any reason why in civil proceedings the
privilege against self-incrimination should be exerciseable so as to enable
a litigant to refuse relevant and even vital documents which are in his
possession or power and which speak for themselves.
'The Court of Appeal reached their decision with regret because they clearly
saw Mr Tully is seeking to exploit the privilege against self-incrimination
in order to frustrate the plaintiff's claims.'
The Crown Prosecution Service had stated that it would not seek to use any
information given by Mr Tully to other parties in civil proceedings.
'There is no reason why the privilege should be blatantly exploited to
deprive the plaintiffs of their civil rights and remedies if the privilege
is not necessary to protect Mr Tully,' Lord Templeman continued.
A recent use of the right to silence to prevent self-incrimination was the
refusal by Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell to give evidence to the House
of Commons social security committee investigating the Maxwell affair.
Although not directly applicable to the work of commons committees, the
ruling may ease the task of the social security committee in its future
investigations into the disappearance of the Maxwell pension funds.
The committee is likely to interview some of those who held key roles in the
Maxwell organisation, including Mr Michael Stoney, the former finance
director of Mirror Group Newspapers, who earlier refused to answer the
committee's questions, and Mr Robert Bunn, the former finance director of
the Maxwell private companies.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Platform of rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground passengers delayed on journeys by more than 20 minutes
will be able to apply for refund vouchers under the organisation's customer
charter, Richard Tomkins writes.
To be eligible they will need either to have waited on a platform for 20
minutes longer than advertised or to have been delayed more than 20 minutes
on a train. Vouchers will be given only when London Underground considers
itself to blame. Some common causes of delays - such as suicide attempts,
security alerts and vandalism - will not count.
Passengers will need to complete A4-size claim forms and submit them with
their used tickets - which are normally swallowed up by automatic barriers
when leaving station platforms. London Underground said if passengers
intended claiming they should approach staff to allow them out with their
tickets.
London Underground said it envisaged having claims from possibly 1,000
passengers a day - roughly equivalent to the capacity of one Tube train -
but not all of them would necessarily be valid.
The scheme, which comes into force on August 1, is expected to cost between
Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m a year. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, London Underground's
managing director, said: 'The aim is not to pay out money. It is to improve
services so that we do not need to.'

FT  21 JUL 92 / Canary Wharf 'excuse' on Tube plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government may use the collapse of Canary Wharf as an excuse for
cancelling the Jubilee Line Tube extension, according to an administrator to
the insolvent office project in London Docklands.
Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday: 'It does
seem illogical that if you're talking about a Pounds 1.7bn extension cost
and you compare that with O&amp;Y's contribution that that would be the reason
for cancelling the whole project . . . It seems that the collapse of Canary
Wharf is being used as an excuse.'
Olympia &amp; York, Canary Wharf's developers, had agreed a contribution of
Pounds 170m toward the Jubilee Line extension, which the government believes
will enhance the value of the development.
The only immediate way in which Canary Wharf can make a significant
contribution to the project is by letting a building to the government and
putting the proceeds of any subsequent sale of the building towards the
extension, the administrators say.
However, the value of a single building would fall well short of Canary
Wharf's commitment to the Jubilee Line.
The administrators are also hoping that other beneficiaries of the Jubilee
Line, including businesses and the five neighbouring London boroughs, will
make a contribution.
No agreement was signed to help to fund the Jubilee Line extension before
the project went into administration, the administrators emphasised. They
would reconsider making any contribution to the Jubilee Line if the
government decided not to relocate 2,000 civil servants - probably from the
Departments of Environment and Transport - to Canary Wharf.
The government, which is considering two rival developments in the Docklands
for a possible relocation, has not said when it would decide.
Mr Adamson said he was 'carefully optimistic' about the project's prospects.
Serious interest had been expressed by half a dozen potential purchasers and
four had already signed confidentiality agreements.
He said it was possible that a bid would be made by a consortium of three
parties that combined property expertise, finance and the ability to exploit
the project's tax breaks, which might total Pounds 400m in enterprise zone
allowances, Pounds 400m of corporation tax losses and VAT savings on future
construction work.
The administrators are due to present proposals, which may be in a very
general form, to the project's creditors at the end of August. The
administration period is then likely to be extended.
The administrators said it was vital to avoid the liquidation of the
project, which would further damage confidence. 'Liquidation would have a
terrible effect on the rest of the Docklands and so many interested parties
that we don't think it is a probable scenario,' Mr Adamson said.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Regional airlines warn of fare rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FARES within the UK and to the rest of Europe may rise if new charges
proposed by the Civil Aviation Authority are brought in, the European
Regional Airlines association warned yesterday.
The CAA is proposing to increase landing and take-off charges to help pay
for better air traffic control equipment. Airlines overflying the UK,
largely from the US, would therefore pay a lower proportion of the CAA's
total income.
Mr Mike Ambrose, director-general of the association, said: 'Airlines using
smaller aircraft providing essential regional services would be worst
affected. They would seek to recover these additional costs through fare
increases.'
The changes also mean greater costs for the CAA and less for the European
air traffic control organisation.
The CAA said the reorganisation of charges was a proposal and it was seeking
responses from airlines. Any changes should be finalised by the end of the
year and in operation from April.
The changes in air traffic control should allow 30 per cent more aircraft to
use the same airspace.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF working part-time, with flexible hours or in job shares perform better
than their full-time counterparts, according to a study commissioned by a
group of the UK's largest employers.
The research into 'family-friendly' policies found that staff working
non-standard hours were considered by their employers to be 'more efficient,
enthusiastic and committed' than full-timers.
The report concludes that 'family-friendly' working could more aptly be
called 'employer-friendly'. Employers invariably took the initiative when it
came to introducing policies such as job-sharing and term-time working.
Dependence on overtime was cut and absenteeism reduced.
High-street banks, building societies and other large employers including
IBM, Shell and the Post Office paid for the research by Sussex University's
Institute of Manpower Studies.
In spite of advantages to companies, detailed case studies of nine
organisations across the private and public sectors found some managerial
resistance to non-standard working. Managers feared that they would need to
spend more time on supervision.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Gingrich faces trouble in Georgian primary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVE Newt Gingrich, the mop-headed right-wing Republican from
Georgia, has long been the scourge of the Democrats in Congress, castigating
their politics, their perks and their personal probity.
But the Democrats are now relishing a sweeter revenge than they could have
dreamed of: Mr Gingrich today faces a tough primary election against a
fellow-Republican who has turned all his taunts against him, branding him as
just another Congressional fat cat.
Mr Gingrich's gadfly tongue so irritated the Democrats who dominate Georgian
politics that they seized the opportunity presented by the 10-yearly
redrawing of Congressional district boundaries to squeeze him out of his
home constituency in the suburbs south of Atlanta, which he held by fewer
than 1,000 votes in 1990.
By way of irony, if the Democrats had been less determined to hurt Mr
Gingrich, who as the minority whip is the second-ranked Republican in the
House of Representatives, they might have stood a better chance of beating
him in the general election in November.
Instead, Mr Gingrich was forced to move to a much more Republican district
in Atlanta's opulent northern suburbs. Although he has been stung by his
Republican primary opponent, former state Assemblyman Herman Clark, he seems
likely to face a much easier battle against a Democrat in November.
Mr Clark's venomous campaign has won national press attention and local
kudos, with its echo of Mr Gingrich's own jibes at Congress.
He has attacked Mr Gingrich for voting for a Congressional pay rise, and for
allegedly writing unfunded cheques on the House bank and abusing Congress
members' free mailing privileges.
He even forced the Congressman to give up his chauffeur-driven limousine.
Mr Gingrich's foes are chuckling to see him running a classic incumbent's
campaign, vaunting his ability to bring money from the federal pork barrel
to the district.

ARGENTINE union chiefs have won a victory over the government by wresting
back control of the equivalent of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn in funds for
union-managed health schemes.
In exchange, the Peronist-controlled CGT union confederation pledged to
shelve plans for a general strike this month. Both sides signed an accord
committing them to greater social justice and higher benefits for the
country's 3.5m pensioners.
Officials denied concessions were made to the unions that would threaten
economic stability. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said wage talks
were constrained by a marketplace thrown open to international competition,
preventing companies granting inflationary wage increases. He had wanted to
allow employees to opt out of union health services and buy private health
insurance.

<TEXT>
EMITEC, a joint venture between GKN and Siemens, is gaining access to the
Japanese catalytic converter market by buying industrial property rights
held by Behr, the Stuttgart-based industrial and engineering group.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, gives Emitec title to several hundred
patents held by Behr for the manufacture of the substrates used in vehicle
catalytic converter systems.
Substrates are the porous core on which are coated precious metals which
make up the catalytic agent.
With catalytic converters rapidly being standardised on the world's annual
production of around 40m cars, substrates are potentially big business for
successful manufacturers.
Following the Behr acquisition, Emitec has granted a licence for the
manufacture of substrates to USUI (Mishima), the largest independent
supplier of metallic substrates to the Japanese industry.
Its customer base includes all the leading Japanese car makers.
In Europe Emitec, headquartered near Cologne, expects its metallic substrate
sales to rise from 600,000 in 1991 to more than 1m this year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT, the French car maker, has signed an agreement to start assembly in
Egypt - the fruit of 11 years of tortuous negotiations.
The group has set up a 51 per cent-owned joint venture with its Egyptian
distributor, CDC Waguih Abaza, and with the local subsidiaries of two French
banks to make up to 10,000 cars a year for an initial investment of FFr10m
(Pounds 1.04m) at an existing Jeep plant near Cairo.
Peugeot is the latest car group to show interest in Egypt since the
improvement in the country's creditworthiness after last year's accord by
the IMF and World Bank to forgive half its official debt.
This is also the latest step in Peugeot's campaign to expand production in
developing markets, after a similar accord in Poland in the spring, and the
start-up of production of medium-sized 405 saloons in Argentina in May.
The Egyptian venture will also make 405s, with production due to start later
next year, at an initial annual output of 1,500 cars, with full production
in four years.
The plant, owned by Arab American Vehicles, a joint venture between Chrysler
and a consortium of Arab investors, currently makes Jeeps for the Egyptian
army.
Peugeot plans to include 20 per cent of locally-made components in the first
year, building up to 30 per cent in year two. To help build up local
content, Peugeot is encouraging French component makers such as Valeo to
strike co-operation accords with Egyptian suppliers.
Peugeot's competitors include General Motors, which makes commercial
vehicles in Egypt and recently signed an accord to make medium-sized cars.
Citroen is negotiating for a local assembly accord, as are Suzuki of Japan
and Hyundai of South Korea.
Egypt has recently given the go-ahead for other car-making joint ventures.
General Motors Egypt, which already builds light trucks, is to produce
passenger cars beginning next year. Egypt Suzuki will assemble mini-vans and
trucks. A group of Egyptian businessmen plans to build Russian Aleko
passenger cars.

FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Costa Rica 'dry canal' may rival Panama -
Plans are under way for a port-rail link across central America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE financial groups have been courting the Costa Rican government with
offers to build a trading thoroughfare across central America to rival the
Panama Canal. If one is accepted, construction could begin early next year
on two ports and a railway linking the country's Caribbean and Pacific
coasts.
At a meeting on July 10 in the Casa Presidencial, Mr Rolando Lacle, minister
of the presidency, laid down the ground rules for what would be the largest
private sector investment in central America.
Three foreign groups and one from Costa Rica headed by a former president,
Mr Mario Echandi, have so far made proposals for a trans-isthmian link, said
Mr Lacle.
The government would ask for tenders once the legislative assembly had
passed a law allowing the executive to grant concessions to private
companies for infrastructural projects, he added. The bill is expected to
pass next month.
The construction and operation of the ports and railway would be regulated
by a law on free zones, which would grant companies 10 years' grace on
income tax and tax-free imports of capital and intermediate goods. A
detailed environmental impact study would also be required.
Although it is insisted that the route would complement rather than compete
with the Panama canal, the Panamanian authorities have already expressed
concern that the canal would lose traffic. Recently several international
shipping companies protested against a proposed 9.9 per cent rise in toll
charges. A short land bridge would be an increasingly attractive
alternative.
The most talked-about offer is a Dollars 1.2bn proposal by a US consortium,
the Costa Rica Trans Development Corporation, which would lay a 315km
railway along flat, sparsely populated, mostly agricultural land close to
Costa Rica's northern border with Nicaragua.
The proposal is to dredge a deep-water port on the northern Caribbean coast
at Parismina which would be linked by a two-track electric railway to a port
and natural harbour at Cuajiniquil on the Pacific. 'See it as one port
linked by a railway,' said Mr Juan Manuel Rodriguez vice-president of the
consortium.
The dry canal would take at least two and a half years to complete, and a
further two years before investors began to get a return, according to Mr
Rodriguez.
'This is not a restaurant we are opening. This is business for people with
patience and money,' he said.
The new route would be aimed at some of the container cargo shifted by rail
across the US or through the Panama Canal. Four years from now, there could
be a railway moving 750 double-stacked 40-feet containers a day in little
over three hours, according to Mr Rodriguez.
He said the group had the backing of leading shipping and construction
companies. The Boston-based Roy Group which specialises in shipping and
investment was putting together a Dollars 450m long-term equity package with
shipping companies from the Far East, the US and Europe.
The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the latter a big
lender in Costa Rica, have also provided advice to the group but their
assistance would not subordinate the role of private capital, Mr Rodriguez
added. 'Theirs will be a symbolic presence but we welcome it.'
Financing of Dollars 152m for the first year of the plan, to cover an
environmental impact study and initial construction costs, had 'already been
secured'.
The proposed route skirts the Santa Rosa National Park which contains some
of central America's rarest flora and fauna. But according to the natural
resources minister, Mr Hernan Bravo, whose ministry must approve the route,
substantial environmental damage can be avoided. 'The route will be defined
in keeping with environmental parameters,' he said.
The idea of a trans-isthmian link has been well received by the ailing
state-run railway company Incofer which stands to be rejuvenated by the
deal. Incofer subsists on 800m colons (Dollars 60m) from the central
government.
The Trans Development Corporation has suggested the Costa Rican government
and Incofer be granted a share in the consortium.

<TEXT>
A joint venture between Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey, the UK construction
groups, has been awarded a Pounds 20m contract to carry out the first phase
of restoring Kuwait's war damaged naval base, writes Andrew Taylor.
The total cost of repairing the base has been estimated at Pounds 200m.
British companies are thought to be in a strong position to win the vast

Denmark yesterday lost its bid to stop the EC Council of Ministers giving
Bonn permission to pay some DM6bn (Pounds 2.1m) in restructuring aid to six
shipyards in the former eastern Germany, writes David Buchan.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's foreign minister, was outvoted by his
fellow EC foreign ministers when he claimed that this aid could damage the

A consortium led by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, has
signed an agreement with Hopewell Energy of Hong Kong to extend the Shajiao
C coal-fired power station in China by a third 660 MW unit, writes Andrew
Baxter.
Terms were not disclosed but the deal brings the total order value for
Shajiao C to more than Pounds 800m. GEC Alsthom, which has overall
responsibility for the station design, engineering, construction and
commissioning, said the deal further demonstrated its position as the
leading exporter of power plants to China.
The Anglo-French group will supply the turbine generator islands, coal
handling and ash and disposal systems. The Shajiao site is on the Pearl
river near Guangzhou in Guangdong Province.

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S largest textiles and apparel companies have called for a 'test
case' investigation into alleged Pakistani abuses in a swingeing attack on
misuse of export subsidies among five leading third world textiles
exporters.
Europe's Largest Textile and Apparel Companies (Eltac), an umbrella grouping
for the European industry, is also asking for a joint committee on subsidies
to be set up with the European Commission.
Eltac complains that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the
European Commission - the two main watchdogs for abuse of subsidies - are
'largely ineffective'.
In a study of government support for textile exporters in Pakistan, India,
Indonesia, China and Turkey, Eltac says Pakistan is 'clearly the worst
offender'. It endorses the view of the Asian Development Bank that the
Pakistan government's policy of providing cut-price raw cotton to textile
manufacturers 'has reached such proportions as to be branded an economic
nonsense'.

THE Indian Supreme Court will decide today whether the Uttar Pradesh state
government has violated a court order by beginning construction of a Hindu
temple on the disputed site at Ayodhya, northern India.
The Supreme Court had ordered the state government to explain the nature of
a concrete platform being built on the disputed site in defiance of the
Allahabad High Court, which issued an order banning all construction. The
Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) claims in an affidavit to be
submitted to the Supreme Court that the platform is not a permanent
structure, and will only be used as a 'public amenity' for pilgrims visiting
the shrine.
Angry opposition members yesterday accused the government of Mr Narasimha
Rao, the prime minister, of pandering to the 'communal designs' of the BJP.
Mr Vishwanath Pratap Singh, former prime minister and leader of the Janata
Dal, said the BJP was wilfully violating the constitution and the rule of
law, 'while a crippled centre looked on'.
The temple issue has exacerbated communal tensions between Hindus and
Moslems and sparked incidents in other states. The Press Trust of India said
four people were killed in the southern state of Kerala and two in the
western state of Maharashtra.
In Ayodhya, hundreds of Hindu supporters of the BJP poured into the temple
complex yesterday to participate symbolically in the temple building.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Jakarta investment to fall: Domestic capital approvals may
be down 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL investment in Indonesia is set to drop sharply for 1992 following
last year's government decision to tighten money supply and in the wake of a
downturn in Asian economies, a government official has warned.
Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, chairman of the government's Investment
Co-ordinating Board, said domestic capital investment approvals for the
first six months of the year reached about Rupiah13,500bn (Pounds 3.5bn). He
estimates approvals for the year will total Rupiah28,500bn, or 30 per cent
below 1991.
Foreign investment approvals are also likely to decrease from Dollars 8.8bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) last year to Dollars 8bn, although this could be even lower
if the government fails to authorise several large projects. The government
is under pressure to restrict capital intensive projects to reduce its
current account deficit, expected to reach Dollars 4.8bn this year.
Indonesia enjoyed an investment boom between 1990-1991 when domestic
approvals totalled Rupiah101,000bn and foreign approvals reached Dollars
17.5bn. Although many approved projects do not proceed, a surge in actual
investment has been behind a doubling of non-oil and gas exports since 1986
to Dollars 17.5bn last year.
Mr Sastrowardoyo said the economic downturn in countries such as Japan, Hong
Kong and South Korea, which have been among the leading investors in
Indonesia, had significantly contributed to the fall in foreign approvals.
He blamed the fall in domestic investment on the government's decision last
year to tighten money supply. This has resulted in bank lending rates of
about 26 per cent and a sharp reduction in credit growth. 'We hope the
reduction in investment will be only temporary, because the government has
started to ease its tight monetary policy,' Mr Sastrowardoyo said.
International donors signalled their confidence in the economy last week and
pledged Dollars 4.94bn in aid for the current financial year ending next
March, up from Dollars 4.75bn last year.
Japan remained the leading donor, pledging Dollars 1.32bn in aid and a
further Dollars 500m through its export-import bank for project loans in
sectors such as electric power and telecommunications.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Algerian PM turns to technocrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Belaid Abdessalam, the new Algerian prime minister, has appointed a small
team of technocrats to help him restore the authority of the state, after
nearly four years of political and economic turmoil.
He has filled two of the most sensitive portfolios - justice and education -
with men the late President Mohamed Boudiaf, assassinated three weeks ago,
would have wished to see at the posts.
Professor Ahmed Djebbar, the new minister of education, returned to Algeria
six months ago with the former president after several years of exile in
France. Mr Abdelhamid Mahi-Bahi, the justice minister, was state prosecutor
in the western town of Oran.
Mr Abdessalam retained seven ministers from the outgoing government. They
include Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the respected foreign minister, who two years
ago brokered a measure of peace in Lebanon; Mr Abdenour Keramane, the
minister for industry; Mr Farouk Tebbal, minister of housing; and General
Khaled Nezzar who, as minister of defence and member of the five-man
collegiate presidency, appears to be a key player in Algeria.
Mr Hacen Mefti, a senior manager of the state oil and gas monopoly
Sonatrach, replaces Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine as minister of energy. The
latter piloted a more liberal oil and gas exploration bill through a hostile
national assembly last December and recently presided over the signing of
exploration agreements with Atlantic Richfield, Mobil Oil, Phillips
Petroleum and British Petroleum. Mr Laoussine had asked to step down.
Mr Mohamed Hardi, a civilian, takes over the Interior Ministry where he will
be seconded by Colonel Mohamed Tolba. This marks the exit, from the
government at least, of General Laarbi Belkheir, a close associate of former
President Chadli Bendjedid.
Mr Hardi has worked closely with Mr Reda Malek, who was co-opted into the
collegiate presidency after the death of Mr Boudiaf and the appointment of
Mr Ali Kafi as acting head of state. The five men have publicly ruled out
running for the post of president in any future election.
Mr Messaoud Ait-Chaalal, who becomes a special adviser to Mr Abdessalam, is
a former Algerian ambassador.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Russia's oil wealth comes from a black hole: Leyla Boulton
describes the human and environmental degradation she found in the country's
richest energy region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIVERS are poisoned, the streets have no pavements and some workers
spend sub-zero winters living in caravans. This human misery is not that of
some Third World country - it is at the heart of Russia's richest oil
producing region.
Nizhnevartovsk, a town of 280,000 people which sprang up with an oil boom 20
years ago, epitomises the paradox of the industry which is Russia's main
source of hard currency: 'What workers produce here goes to maintain the
whole country, and yet we live in such conditions because not enough of the
wealth is spent on improving the lives of local people,' says Mr Ivan
Gulyants, deputy head of the administration of the 118,000 sq km
Nizhnevartovsk district.
The Tyumen region, to which Nizhnevartovsk belongs, produces 60 per cent of
Russia's oil. But after two decades of abuse from a system whose top
priority was meeting centrally-planned output targets, the local environment
is in a catastrophic state.
And despite that sacrifice, oil production has fallen steadily in recent
years - because of a shortage of equipment, investment and a demoralised
workforce.
Workers who went there from all around the Soviet Union to 'produce oil for
the Motherland' have issued the latest of a series of strike threats which
could bring the country to its knees. Angered by a nationwide shortage of
banknotes which means their salaries have not been paid in full since April,
they are also united with management in seeking payment for the oil they
supply, as well as higher oil prices. So far the oilmen have never had to
act on threats which they know would inflict further devastating losses on
their own industry - but the fear is that their patience may not last.
While peeling apartment blocks with broken windows exhibit old slogans such
as 'Builders, Let's Complete Oil Installations Early', thousands more
workers live in makeshift caravans with their families - enduring
temperatures of minus 40 degrees Centigrade in winter and mosquito-ridden
summers.
A manager at one oilfield, Mr Vyacheslav Naidanov, says there is one oil
spill a day on his territory because of ageing oil-pipes. If he had all the
right equipment, he says, he could produce up to 5,000 tonnes a day instead
of the 3,000 he achieves now.
Of the 319 wells under his direction, 100 are idle for lack of basic parts
and machinery. The territory is also littered with thick, stagnant black
pools, some more than a decade old - dug by workers to dump oil and other
rubbish as they opened up new wells. A walk along a small stretch of Mr
Naidanov's Section Number 3 also reveals oil spills from accidents - caused
mostly by bursting pipes - about every 20 metres.
Local authorities, backed by a new republican law imposing stiff penalties,
say they are now determined to do whatever it takes to make enterprises
clean up their act - even if it means closing them.
Mr Albert Radkin, from the regional environment protection committee, says
the air and water pollution is already resulting in an increase in illnesses
and in deformed and premature births. It is unlikely however, that much will
improve in the near future.
Although the oil industry should in theory come out on top from market
reforms whose aim is to switch the economy to principles of demand and
supply, its problems are compounded by the fact that while other prices have
been freed, energy remains subject to price controls.
After fierce political rows over what to do with the domestically-fixed oil
price for fear that freeing it would impose untold hardship on the rest of
the economy, the authorities now plan to approximate the state-controlled
domestic price to world levels over the next two years. A tonne of oil now
costs between Rbs1,800-Rbs2,200 - up from the ridiculous level of Rbs350
(the price of three bottles of vodka).
But even the new price is not enough to cover the costs of the biggest state
enterprise in the district, Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, which, with 50,000
employees, owes Rbs9bn to the bank. Even if it was paid the Rbs6bn owed to
it by refineries, it would remain a net debtor. The debt crisis affecting
most of Russia's state-owned enterprises is the result of managers' ability
to continue trading with each other without paying for goods, rather than
restructure in response to the government's restrictive financial policies.
The solutions promoted by the government - re-organising enterprises so they
function on market principles, and attracting foreign investment - are not
going to work miracles overnight, even though foreign capital is already
trickling in and leaner structures have already begun to emerge.
One such new company is Chernogorneft, which broke away from
Nizhnevartovskneftegaz two years ago and now leases its facilities from the
government. It has already organised three joint ventures with foreign
partners (this enables it to export more oil for hard currency) and has
tried to motivate its 2,500 workers by giving them a stake in the
enterprises. It too is in debt - but unlike Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, it would
be a net creditor if other enterprises paid up.
'We worked for so many years out of enthusiasm to develop the present
system,' said Ms Liubov Belova, head of Chernogorneft's ecology department.
Now we are only just waking up to where this has led to.'

<TEXT>
THE sun-loving French will not be allowed to escape weighty political
matters of the day during their normally sacred August break.
The ruling pro-European Socialist party and the extreme right-wing
anti-European Front National (FN) have decided to take the battle over
European union to the beaches over the coming month.
The FN's youth section has hired two caravans to tour the Mediterranean
coast and the southern Atlantic beaches in the first half of August. Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the FN's leader will launch the crusade on August 1 at
Menton, an unattractive resort near Monte Carlo.
Sunbathers will have no chance to turn over and go back to sleep once their
ears have been bent by Mr Le Pen's rhetoric. The same beaches will be
invaded in the second half of August by the Socialist party youth section's
pro-European caravan campaign.
Neither will holidaymakers be safe inland. The Socialist party has asked
local politicians to sally forth with speeches, pro-Maastricht posters,
badges and T-shirts.
The FN and the Socialists have a lot to fight for. The French public is
still pro-European, but the balance in favour is shifting, from nearly 70
per cent in the spring to around 60 per cent at the start of this month.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S industrial output grew in June for the third month in succession
and export revenues continued to rise, fuelling hopes that the country's
three-year-old recession could be reversed by the end of the year.
The brighter economic outlook augurs well for Poland's forthcoming talks
with the International Monetary Fund on an agreement reopening access to
credits worth Dollars 1.6bn. These were suspended last autumn when the
country overshot its budget deficit and foreign reserves targets.
Agreement with the IMF is essential if Poland is to win a further 20 per
cent reduction in debts owed to western governments; these have already been
reduced by 30 per cent.
Industrial output in the first half was still 3 per cent down on the same
period in 1991, according to GUS, the Central Statistical Office. However,
the rate of decline is slowing markedly: output in the first quarter had
fallen by 6.3 per cent.
The budget deficit had reached 25,700bn zlotys (Pounds 993m) by the end of
June, still within the year-end ceiling of 65,500 zlotys or 5 per cent of
GDP.
Mid-year export revenues totalled Dollars 6.9bn, a rise of 12.5 per cent on
the first half of 1991. Imports shrank 8 per cent to Dollars 5.9bn, leaving
a Dollars 946m trade surplus compared to a Dollars 332m deficit in 1991.
Inflation is also slowing, with prices rising 1.6 per cent in June from May.

BRITAIN is to invite eastern European leaders to two EC meetings in October
to highlight the emphasis which the UK is seeking to place during its
presidency of the Community on enlargement eastwards.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday got EC colleagues to
agree to meet foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia at
their regular Luxembourg session on October 5.
He also floated the idea of a October 28 summit in London between the
eastern European states' prime ministers, Mr John Major, UK prime minister,
and Mr Jacques Delors president of the European Commission. France said the
summit should include all EC government heads, rather than just Mr Major.
France, with Italy's support, also urged that the meetings be extended to
include leaders from Romania and Bulgaria, which are following central
Europe's example in negotiating so-called 'Europe agreements' for eventual
free trade over 10 years.
UK officials said the Balkan leaders' attendance depended on the pace of
their negotiations with Brussels.
EC foreign ministers also formally approved negotiating guidelines for a
trade and co-operation agreement with Slovenia.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Inkatha calls for defiance of ANC over 'mass action'
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inkatha Freedom party (IFP) yesterday called on its members to defy an
African National Congress (ANC) call for 'mass action' against the
government of President F W de Klerk. In a move likely to reinforce the
already bitter rivalry between the two parties, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's
mainly Zulu backed movement said its supporters should 'exercise the right
to work' and urged employers 'not to close their businesses during any mass
action campaign'.
A resolution passed at the IFP annual conference this weekend said the party
was 'appalled that the ANC and its allies are planning protest action which
includes marches, strikes and stay-aways which will cripple the economy at
the time we most need to build it up to provide the wealth the first
government after apartheid will need to make democracy work.'
Among other measures, the ANC and trade union allies have called for a
general strike to begin on August 3, marking the start of a week of
disruption.
Employers' representatives and union officials are close to agreement on a
compromise in which business and unions make a joint appeal for an end to
the political stalemate. Normal economic activity would be suspended on
August 3 but business would continue as usual. Many businessmen, however,
are uneasy about forming an alliance with unions to put pressure on the
government to concede to the ANC demand for a majority rule constitution.
The prospect of damaging relations with Inkatha will add to their unease,
for Chief Buthelezi's opposition to economic sanctions and advocacy of a
market economy has always been appreciated by the business community.
Inkatha also called on the ANC to disband its guerrilla force, Umkhonto we
Sizwe, and said it would do all it could to ensure that the force was
disbanded by the September 14 anniversary of the signing of the national
peace accord. It did not elaborate.

One of Romania's leading political parties has nominated Michael of
Hohenzollern, the former king, as its candidate for president in elections
due on September 27, Virginia Marsh writes from Bucharest.
Mr Radu Campeanu, leader of the National Liberal party (NLP), said the party
was nominating the former king because he was the only person capable of
beating President Ion Iliescu, who is standing for a second term.
A delegation would this week visit Switzerland, where ex-King Michael, 70,
has lived for more than 30 years, to ask him formally to be the NLP
candidate.

King Hussein of Jordan has defused a serious rift with the US over
sanctions-busting by tightening customs checks along his kingdom's border
with Iraq, officials and diplomats said, Reuter reports from Amman.
The clampdown, some say, may even encourage Washington to resume military
aid frozen because of Jordanian sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis.
Jordan has been Baghdad's main supply line since the UN Security Council
slapped on a trade blockade after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
