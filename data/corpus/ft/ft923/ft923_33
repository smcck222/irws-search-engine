FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (5): The bankers
keep their euphoria under control - Patrick Harverson gauges the mood on
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Wall Street, the past year and a half must have seemed at times like a
happy re-run of the go-go 1980s.
Investment banks and securities houses have cashed in record earnings as
stock and bond underwriting business has soared. The equity markets have
roared ahead to new heights. Bonuses have rocketed in the wake of record
fees and commissions.
The after-tax profits of New York Stock Exchange member firms reached a
record Dollars 3.8bn in 1991 on record revenues of Dollars 61bn, compared
with the pathetic Dollars 106m loss incurred in 1990. So far this year,
their earnings are keeping up a record pace.
Yet despite the huge amounts of money which have swilled about the US
capital markets since early 1991, the investment bankers, securities
salesmen and brokers of Wall Street have been remarkably subdued about their
good fortune.
After the shocks of the post-1987 crash era, when payrolls, salaries,
bonuses and corporate earnings tumbled amid overcapacity and soft markets,
the 'masters of the universe' in lower Manhattan have learnt to treat the
good times with a certain degree of respect and humility.
In fact, bonuses for all but a few top performers last year did not match
1980s levels, a reflection of a tougher-minded, more performance-related
approach to compensation among senior executives in the securities industry.
There was also less than normal growth in salaries, especially at lower
levels, and, except in a few areas (retail broking, notably), companies were
in no rush to hire new blood. The relief on Wall Street that the red ink and
job losses of the 1988-1990 period was over, however, was genuine enough.
Although the Federal Reserve has endured much criticism for its management
of monetary policy, most of the credit for the turnaround in US capital
markets goes to the nation's central bank.
It was the Fed's rush of interest rate cuts last year (a belated response to
economic weakness) that created the conditions for a surge in capital
raising by companies eager to refinance high-yielding debt, to pay for much
needed restructuring, or (in rarer cases) to pay for expansion.
Lower interest rates also revived individual investors' interest in stocks,
by making alternative short-term assets, such as bank certificates of
deposit and money market funds, look less attractive compared with
higher-yielding equities.
Consequently, investors handed over money to professional investment
managers and stock funds in record amounts.
The greatest growth in domestic capital markets, however, was in corporate
stock and bond issuance, where volume last year jumped to a record Dollars
586bn, up 88 per cent on 1990's total. The bulk of the total was issues of
mortgage-backed securities (Dollars 246bn), followed by corporate bonds
(Dollars 210bn, including junk debt), and common stock (Dollars 54bn), of
which almost half was initial public offerings (IPOs), or flotations.
So far this year, debt and equity issues are maintaining their volume,
thanks to further interest rate cuts, the latest being the half-point
reduction in the discount rate to 3 per cent early this month. In the first
six months of 1992, new stock and bonds sold in the US amounted to a record
Dollars 437bn; up 61 per cent on a year ago.
Mortgage-backed securities dominated again, while issues of investment-grade
debt totalled Dollars 136bn, evenly split over the first and second quarter.
Junk debt remained popular, with almost Dollars 19bn in high-yield bonds
sold in the first half. Just over Dollars 41bn in new stock was issued, of
which almost half was in the form of IPOs. Yet signs are already evident
that the record pace of 1991-1992 is slackening. The IPO market, in
particular, seems to have peaked. Volume did reach a record Dollars 19.4bn
in the first half, but the total would have been much greater were it not
for a large number of postponed or cancelled issues.
Pricing has also become difficult, with 60 of the 150 IPOs that came to the
market in the second quarter being offered at a price below their target
range. The problem has been a new wariness about IPOs among investors, whose
appetite for stock may finally be waning in light of the poor performance of
recent new issues.
According to IDD Information Services, only 29 of the 100 most recent IPOs
were trading above their sale price as of June 24.
Despite this month's interest rate cut, it is unlikely that corporate
capital-raising will maintain the heady pace of the first half of the year.
Much of the financing of the past 18 months has been used to reduce debt and
generally tidy up balance sheets. That trend has probably peaked, and
companies are now likely to wait for a significant improvement in earnings
before dipping into the capital markets again with such vigour.
That means the fortunes of the capital markets will be more closely tied to
the domestic economy and driven less by interest rate.
So far this year, economic growth has averaged around 2 per cent, and
economists are not expecting much more for the rest of 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAING MANAGEMENT has been awarded the management contract for the Pounds 50m
construction project for the Inland Revenue's new centre at Castle Meadow,
Nottingham.
The project comprises 40,000 sq metres of office accommodation in six
buildings arranged along radiating bands of streets focused on Nottingham
Castle to the north. The design of the buildings incorporates load-bearing
brickwork and fair-faced structural concrete members.
A restaurant, social and sports facilities and a nursery are to be based in
a separate amenity block at the centre of the development.
Enabling works throughout the site (which was previously used as railway
sidings) are due to begin in the autumn and will involve the demolition of
buildings and the diversion of numerous services. The project is scheduled
to be completed and the buildings ready for occupation by the end of 1994.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Previous experience in Czech oslovakia has paid dividends for JOHNSONS with
four joint venture projects involving design and construction for its
multi-disciplinary practice. The latest project is a Pounds 25m sports and
leisure development with a hotel and retail mall.
Visits to Czechoslovakia in 1990 quickly resulted in a joint venture
partnership between Johnsons and Hexaplan - a newly privatised firm of
architects and engineers.
At the start of this year the partnership was appointed as consultants and
project managers for the Czech-led project - the Boby Centrum in Brno. The
30,000 sq metre development is the brainchild of former hockey
international, Dr Lubomir Hrstka.
It consists of a hotel, medical fitness centre, covered tennis courts,
discotheque and shopping mall.
Dr Hrstka is involved in sports and fitness facilities throughout the
country under the name of Boby Sports. The Centrum is adjacent to the Brno
Sports Stadia, another of his ventures.
Dr Hrstka provided the drive which inspired the City of Brno, the planners
and banks to respond to a fast-track programme which is unusual in this
country where bureaucracy can still be stifling.

FT  20 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: News-packed week gives food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Friday last week the short-end of the Treasury market enjoyed a short but
sharp rally on rumours that President Bush was afflicted by serious health
problems.
Although the rumours turned out to be false (as they almost invariably do -
in Chicago, they have a saying that the President of the US dies once a
month on the floor of the futures exchange), it showed how jumpy the market
was at the end of what had been an unusually busy and news-packed week.
Thursday's increase in German interest rates was probably the biggest story
because of its international dimensions and the effect the Bundesbank's move
had on the vulnerable dollar. The German rate rise was open to
interpretation in two ways: it was bullish for Treasuries because higher
German interest rates will slow down European, and ultimately US, economic
growth, which is good for bonds; or it was bearish for Treasuries because
with higher German interest rates pushing the dollar lower, the Federal
Reserve will be less likely to sanction another cut in US interest rates for
fear of sending the already weak US currency into a tailspin.
There were a few other stories for the markets to feed on last week. Mr Ross
Perot's sudden and unexpected withdrawal from the election race was
generally well-received, not because of any particular dislike for the
diminutive Texan billionaire, but because his departure removed a large
element of political uncertainty that had been troubling US financial
markets for months.
The Democrats' successful convention in New York, and Governor Bill
Clinton's surge in the polls after the Perot withdrawal provided further
food for thought, food that the markets found less than palatable, given
their concern for what the Democratic candidate might, if elected, do to the
Federal budget deficit with his ambitious spending plans.
As Mr David Ader, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston
said recently: 'One of the significant factors contributing to the
steepening of the Treasury yield curve is this week's Democratic convention.
While the Democrats scream 'Jobs] Jobs] Jobs]' the Street only hears 'Spend]
Spend] Spend]' and backs off.'
Friday morning's trade figures were also worthy of the bond market's
attention. The bigger-than-expected Dollars 7.4bn May trade deficit was
partly explained by a 2.5 per cent decline in exports (imports also fell,
but less sharply).
With exports now down three months in a row, there is little doubt that
economic growth in the second quarter will eventually come out well below
the 2.7 per cent achieved in the first three months of the year. In this
respect, the trade numbers were a positive for Treasuries.
As for this week, in the absence of valuable statistics other than the
notoriously volatile and unreliable advance durable goods orders, due on
Friday, the bond market is likely to focus on Congress, where Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, will be giving his twice-yearly
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.
Mr Greenspan, as always, is unlikely to give away anything that would move
the markets, but he will at least be asked to outline the policy thinking
behind the big cut in interest rates earlier this month.
At the time the rate cut was seen as a panicky response to the dreadful June
employment numbers, and by less charitable observers as a caving in to
political pressure from the White House, but Mr Greenspan's views on the
current state of the economy, and on whether he believes the Fed has
finished easing, should make interesting hearing.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Smith aims at Tory economic record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH signalled a combative start to his leadership of the Labour
party yesterday when he ordered an all-out assault on the government's
failure to deliver its much-promised economic recovery.
His call was met by aggressive speeches from Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon
Brown accusing the government of using attacks on the new Labour leader as a
smokescreen to disguise deep-seated Tory disquiet at the continuing
recession.
Mr Blair, who is expected to be named shadow home secretary this week, said
the barrage of abuse in a series of speeches by Cabinet ministers last
Friday was a 'panic-stricken' response to the danger Mr Smith posed them.
In contrast to the Labour leader, elected by an overwhelming 91 per cent of
his party, Mr John Major led a 'hesitant and divided party' unable to give
the country decisive leadership, Mr Blair said. 'They are a government of
inertia when the country needs action,' he added.
Mr Brown, widely predicted to become shadow chancellor, said the
Conservative manifesto's promise of a swift recovery had been exposed as 'a
fraud'. He demanded action on the rising unemployment, poverty and inner
city deprivation that was now threatening the social cohesion of the
country.
The resumption of party hostilites comes after three months of relative
calm, induced by the Labour leadership election. That ended on Saturday when
Mr Smith, 53, was triumphantly acclaimed leader by 1,500 delegates at a
meeting of Labour's electoral college in Westminster.
His rival Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, recorded just 9 per
cent of the poll, suffering heavy defeats in the constituency, MPs' and
trade union sections.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary, also won comfortably with 57
per cent of the ballot for the deputy leadership. Mr John Prescott came
second with 28 per cent, trailed by Mr Gould with 15 per cent.
In his victory speech, Mr Smith pledged to rededicate Labour as 'the party
of change' and social justice.
But he also insisted that Labour needed to modernise itself by basing its
internal democracy on the principle of one member, one vote, and eliminating
the unions' block votes.
That process begins today when the national executive committee's special
review group on Labour's union links begins its work.
The group is expected to report early in the new year with policy
recommendations to be debated at the party conference in 1993.

FT  20 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Equitable Life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From a European perspective, at least, last week's pricing of shares in the
newly demutualised US insurance company Equitable Life represented more than
just the conclusion of another initial public offering. The sale of 43.5m
shares at a lower than expected Dollars 9 each had an immediate impact on
Axa, the French insurer which came to Equitable's rescue last year with a
controversial Dollars 1bn cash injection. Axa's shares tumbled 7 per cent on
Thursday and Friday as investors calculated that the odds on chairman Claude
Bebear pulling off his great transatlantic gamble may now have lengthened.
The Equitable issue was clearly a difficult one: the final price should be
set against earlier hopes of getting it away at Dollars 11-Dollars 14 a
share. But the lower price means that Axa's convertible bond - on which
incidentally it has been earning a tidy 22 per cent over the last 10 months
 -translates under the original deal into the maximum 49 per cent equity
stake, while the French company can take this to around 60 per cent by the
end of next year. The enthusiasts point out that Axa has won control without
a bid premium. The sceptics wonder whether Mr Bebear should have got
involved at all.
Equitable's shares look cheap in relation to net assets. The non-insurance
activities alone are valued by one analyst at more than Dollars 11 per
share. But there is good reason for that. New management is in place, but
the US company has yet to convince the market that it has mended its old
inefficient and reckless ways. Insurance and annuity surrenders, meanwhile,
are said to be back to normal levels after two dreadful quarters last year.
It remains to be seen whether the improvement will last.
The bigger anxiety is Equitable's mortgage and real estate book. Last week's
pricing leaves scope for further provisions on the Dollars 2.65bn of
potential problem mortgage loans already identified, which so far have been
written down by 25 per cent. The worry is whether the company's professedly
conservative valuations are sufficient protection against a further downward
twist in the US economy. The risks for Mr Bebear have always been great. But
at least they have not markedly worsened in the last few days.

FT  20 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has traditionally been safe to make two assumptions about portfolio
investment in smaller companies. Such a portfolio tends to be less
responsive to cyclical expectations than one containing large companies, and
to outperform over the longer term. The behaviour of the Hoare Govett
Smaller Companies (HGSC) index during the recession suggests that at least
the first of these assumptions should be challenged. During the first half
of this year the index showed the same 4.9 per cent total return as the FT
All-Share. It outperformed by 4.4 per cent during the period of euphoria
that followed the election and underperformed by 1.5 per cent as hopes of
imminent recovery were dashed from late May onwards.
Part of this volatility may be simply due to the way the index is
constructed. It includes the bottom 10 per cent of stocks by market
capitalisation, into which a number of highly cyclical companies will be
pushed as their capitalisation falls in the recession. These are also
companies in which recovery hopes are also most strongly vested.
But there may also be deeper forces at work. According to Paul Marsh of the
London Business School, who helped compile the HGSC index, smaller companies
are becoming more highly geared both operationally and financially. Their
beta - the measure of share price volatility relative to the market overall
 -has risen to about 1 compared with 0.85 when the index was launched in
1987.
Nor do the very smallest companies appear to have retained their tendency to
outperform their bigger brethren. The total first half return on the HGSC
index falls by 0.1 percentage points to 4.8 per cent when extended to
include USM stocks. There is clearly some evidence of the recession at work
here. Institutional investors have become wary of companies with a
capitalisation of Pounds 50m or less. Hoare Govett says there has been
evidence for just over a year that middle-ranking companies by
capitalisation have outperformed the rest of the market.
It might be assumed that such deviations from the historic pattern will be
reversed once the recession ends. Yet the shape of the economy may be very
different by then if ERM membership does lead to a low-inflation, low-growth
Britain. Doubtless, real growth will always be easier to achieve from a
small base. But in such an environment there is more operational risk in
being small as well.

FT  20 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Fear of shopping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The June retail survey from the Confederation of British Industry amply
confirms that if the UK recovery is waiting for the consumer, it will have
to wait awhile. Sales of household goods have fallen further below last
year's levels. DIY stores, which saw growth in May, have slipped back again.
Even grocery sales are slowing. The only bright spots are off-licences and
chemists, which in the circumstances is perhaps not surprising.
As for the outlook, retailers expect flat sales in July, while stocks, which
were cut back sharply in June, are to be cut further. It remains peculiarly
difficult to see what is to change the trend. The underlying message of the
survey is that the weakest area of expenditure still relates to housing. If
last Friday's rate rise by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society is a
guide - to say nothing of the momentary scare over a base rate rise - that
is one area in which consumer confidence could have further to fall.
From a narrower viewpoint, this once more raises the question of how to
value the retail sector. As always, investors are reluctant to be out of
retail on the grounds that it will be the first to enjoy the benefits when
the recovery finally does arrive. But it is slightly unsettling to recall
that retailing has outperformed the market in every quarter but one in the
last two and a half years. Granted, some 60 per cent of the sector by
weighting consists of Marks and Spencer, Boots and GUS, defensive stocks by
any reckoning. But it is also worth recalling that the high rating of the
retail sector in the 1980s was based above all not on trading but on asset
inflation. Doubtless, the sector will be early to benefit from recovery. How
much it benefits may be another matter.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Receivers take charge of Beaver Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAVER Engineering Group, one of the UK's largest family-owned machine tool
companies, has been placed in administrative receivership after losing a
long battle for survival amid the global machine tool recession.
Mr Tony Balding, managing director of Beaver and son of its founder Mr
Victor Balding, has been made redundant, along with about 80 of the
Norwich-based company's workforce.
The job cuts, which reduce the workforce to 60, were made by the
administrative receivers, Cork Gully's Norwich branch, in a restructuring
designed to prepare Beaver for possible sale.
The receivership is one of the worst blows for the UK machine tool industry
in a recession that has claimed about 4,000 jobs over the past two years.
It could lead to more vociferous campaigning by the Machine Tool
Technologies Association, which has been lobbying the government for
short-term incentives to boost capital investment by UK manufacturing
customers.
Beaver, founded in 1951, makes computer numerically controlled lathes and
milling machines, and was one of the most technologically innovative of the
UK machine tool makers.
'If we had made old-fashioned products in dark satanic mills for the past 15
years, we'd have deserved to go bust,' Mr Tony Balding said. Instead, the
product range had been completely updated over the past five years, and two
years ago Beaver moved to a new 100,000 sq ft plant.
Mr Balding attributed the receivership primarily to the continuing decline
in purchases of machine tools. The company did not have enough cash to
support itself over the next two to three months, and its bank, National
Westminster, discontinued its lending facility.
Sales at Beaver fell to Pounds 8.6m in the year ended April, from a peak in
1989 of Pounds 11.5m.
Mr Mark Shires, a principal at Cork Gully in Norwich, said NatWest had gone
to considerable lengths to preserve the business.
He said Mikron, the Swiss milling machine producer, was one of several
companies looking at the slimmed-down business.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Allegations over Mellor spark row on privacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL PRESSURE for a new privacy law intensified yesterday after
newspaper allegations forced a cabinet minister to acknowledge that he faced
marriage difficulties.
Mr John Major was said to have given Mr David Mellor, national heritage
secretary, his full support after the reports on the minister's personal
life appeared in Sunday newspapers.
Mr Mellor offered his resignation in a phone call to the prime minister on
Saturday, but Mr Major refused to accept it, the Press Association news
agency reported last night.
As Labour MPs joined calls for new statutory curbs to limit intrusions into
the private lives of public figures, Mr Mellor's colleagues were predicting
that the incident would further harden Mr Major's support for legislation.
Mr Mellor, whose departmental responsibilities include the press, earlier
this month asked Sir David Calcutt QC to carry out an independent study of
the effectiveness of the present system of newspaper self-regulation. His
report is expected towards the end of this year or early next.
Mr Mellor acted following a series of reports on the private lives of
members of the royal family. But he is among cabinet ministers thought to be
sceptical of the value of statutory curbs.
Mr Major was said to have been furious about the reports and subsequent
revelations that Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, had married after
the birth of her first child. The prime minister has told aides he is
determined to force the press to draw a sharper line between matters of
public interest and intrusions into individuals' private lives.
Colleagues of Mr Major said he believed the allegations about Mr Mellor were
similar 'muckraking', with no relevance to the minister's public position.
Mr Mellor issued a brief statement to the Press Association saying he and
his wife had been experiencing marital difficulties.
It added: 'We want to sort the situation out for the sake of each other and
especially for our two young children. This I hope we can do in private.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / Public spending to be squeezed: Major backs Treasury attempt
to keep to Pounds 244.5bn target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEVERE SQUEEZE on public investment in housing, roads, the inner cities
and other construction projects will be heralded this week by the cabinet's
endorsement of curbs in Whitehall spending.
Mr John Major will tell cabinet colleagues on Wednesday he is backing the
Treasury's attempts to hold next year's public spending to its Pounds
244.5bn cash planning total, in spite of a surge in unemployment benefit
payments.
His stance is understood to follow a warning by Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary, that the share of public spending in national income overall is
likely to rise in 1993-94 for the fourth consecutive year.
The government is committed to a gradual fall in that share, now 41.5 per
cent. But the combination of pre-election spending commitments, a shrinking
economy and higher debt service payments threatens to push it towards 44 per
cent, the highest level since the mid-1980s.
Senior ministers, however, are complaining that the Treasury has targeted
long-term investment programmes for some of the biggest savings. They will
warn Mr Portillo that cuts in capital spending by central and local
government would deliver another blow to the hard-pressed construction
industry. Housebuilders and other construction companies have been among
those worst hit by the recession.
Some of the projects under Treasury review - including a three-year
programme to invest Pounds 7bn in motorways and trunk roads - appeared as
pledges in the Conservative manifesto. But the Treasury is arguing that
nothing can be immune from scrutiny this year because of the threat to the
economy posed by soaring public debt.
The Treasury wants a substantial cut in the Department of Environment's
Pounds 7.5bn budget for housing over the next two years. About two-thirds of
that involves capital spending. Its plans would involve cuts in funds for
the Housing Corporation, which regulates registered housing associations,
and additional restrictions on local authority spending.
Mr Portillo is also seeking significant savings in the urban programme and
spending by the Urban Development Corporation.
In spite of these proposed cuts, Treasury officials remain far from
confident that the government will be able to meet the overall cash target.
The latest calculations suggest that high unemployment and the cost of
introducing the council tax could run to about Pounds 5bn next year.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee,
last night urged Mr Major not to exclude 'sacred cows' such as health,
social services, overseas aid and education from spending cuts.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Tax regime change not way to promote N Sea oil
construction industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr IAN RUTLEDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While wholeheartedly sympathising with the desire of Liberal MPs
Russell Johnston and Charles Kennedy to preserve jobs in the North Sea oil
construction industry, I cannot agree with their view that it is 'essential
to explore whether a change in the North Sea tax regime might promote
development and bring forward orders' ('200 oil jobs to be cut', July 10).
I wonder if they are aware of the extent to which the UK North Sea tax
regime has already become one of the most generous in the world and that, in
1991, Petroleum Revenue Tax, the instrument which ought to be extracting the
economic rent from North Sea hydrocarbon production, has actually become
negative, with repayments of Pounds 200m from the taxpayer to the oil
companies. A substantial array of tax allowances (production allowance,
capital 'uplift', cross-field allowances etc), combined with the lowest
corporation tax in Europe (and lower than the US), means that the UK is now
virtually giving its oil and gas reserves away.
Our calculations show that in 1991 the government's share of the North Sea
surplus had fallen to a mere 14.4 per cent and the average government 'take'
per barrel of oil equivalent produced was only 96 pence. Moreover, an
inspection of the published accounts of oil companies operating in the UK
sector of the North Sea indicates that many of them are currently paying no
tax at all to the UK and many will continue to pay no tax well into the
future. In many developing countries this would be regarded as a national
scandal. Not apparently in Britain.
In his forward to the latest Brown Book on the development of UK oil and gas
resources, the minister for energy remarks that 'over the years a close
working relationship has developed between industry and government'. Surely
it is time to conclude that this close working relationship has become a
little too close.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Costly place to live, even with low inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH BALSOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A big thank you to Guy de Jonquieres ('The price is all right in
America', July 11) for spelling out so clearly what became all too apparent
to me when I returned to Britain in December 1990 after spending three years
in New York - that no matter how low the headline rate of inflation falls,
no matter how low the underlying rate falls, this is a very expensive
country.
If I have one quarrel with his article it is that he places too much stress
on the current exchange rate and the dollar's relative weakness; in my view,
for a whole range of products it makes more sense to shop in the US, no
matter what the exchange rate.
A couple of years ago I paid Dollars 175 for spectacle lenses in New York.
(I am very short-sighted and the lenses are thus complex.) A top chain in
the UK recently quoted Pounds 150 for lenses of a comparable quality. I
would love to know just why it is that British myopes must pay so much more.
I have refrained from buying a car, simply because I cannot bring myself to
fork out so much more than my US friends do when they invest in new cars.
Nor will I buy compact discs in this country; it is outrageous that the
sterling and dollar prices are virtually identical. This is a product that
is, as far as I can fathom, international in all its dimensions -
international pop or opera stars record in studios in countries all over the
world, and the discs are pressed in one country for distribution worldwide.
Can anyone from the record or motor industries offer an explanation, let
alone a defence for the gross differences in prices?
What it all boils down to is that I for one am not going to help kick-start
the economy by going on a spending spree when I know that the same goods are
on offer much cheaper elsewhere. I prefer to do without and save my money
than be taken for a ride by British manufacturers and distributors.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Thatcher has never been noted for her sensitivity but even she must
have realised that the idea of a former British PM working for tobacco group
Philip Morris would leave some people gasping. After all, Philip Morris sold
640bn cigarettes last year, nearly 12 per cent of the world total, and is
second only to the Chinese monopoly in what the anti-smoking lobby says is a
lethal business.
Lady Thatcher's office was doing its best to limit the damage yesterday,
emphasising that Philip Morris was also a purveyor of food, beer and other
beverages, and that no contract had yet been signed. If a deal was done,
however, Lady Thatcher 'would give ad hoc consultancy advice on geopolitical
issues'.
Nevertheless, Philip Morris is mainly interested in selling more cigarettes
outside the US and the non-smoking Lady Thatcher's international experience
and contacts should be invaluable. The consultancy arrangements were
supposed to be kept under wraps, which leaves me wondering if Lady Thatcher
has signed any other lucrative private deal with public corporations since
she gave up full-time politics.

The grandly-named Russian Ministry of Security is trying to prove to its
countrymen that it has utterly renounced its past as the KGB and is now
really looking after their interests. Hence it has helped to organise an
exhibition of cultural contraband: Russian works of art confiscated by the
KG . . . - sorry, security ministry's officers from people attempting to
spirit them out of the country illegally.
The official line is that the attempted smuggling - which increased sharply
during the 1980s - was mainly the work of international gangs of
professional smugglers, robbing Russia of works of art to sell them abroad.
But there's evidence to suggest that many of the 'smuggled' goods were the
private property of emigrants, rather than stolen goods for sale.
Either way, the result is a fine, if eclectic, collection of icons, rare
books, paintings, jewellery and other objets d'art. The only snag is that no
catalogues are available.
There should have been, because a couple of years back a Western businessman
offered to produce some free of charge, and the delighted organisers duly
handed him the necessary photographic and written material. Alas, nothing
was ever delivered.
But that wasn't the organisers' fault. How could they have known it was just
another empty promise from the late Robert Maxwell?

Don't write off board of trade president Michael Heseltine's plans to
revitalise his domain. Although Norman Lamont scrapped the National Economic
Development Office rather than hand it over to Hezza the Prezza, close
onlookers dismiss Westminster gossip that he has had his wings clipped.
Instead, Heseltine's authority in cabinet has been reinforced by a request
from John Major that he join Douglas Hurd in an autumn drive to rally Tory
waverers on Maastricht.
Moreover, back at his department, Hezza is assembling a phalanx of loyal
officials and high-calibre imports to show he doesn't need Treasury money to
expand his power base.
The choice of Walter Eltis as his chief economic adviser should not put
people off the scent. It is one of the less exciting of a string of
appointments designed to beef up the department's Whitehall clout.
Geoff Robinson, former IBM senior adviser, has been chosen as chief adviser
on science and technology at the head of a specialist team. Sir Peter
Levene, a chum from Hezza's defence days and an aide to Major on the
Citizen's Charter, has returned to give general - albeit unpaid - advice.
Alistair MacDonald is back from defence procurement as chief of the new
sectoral working groups. The industrial competitiveness division - also
central to the department's strategy to become industry's voice in Whitehall
 -is to be run by Bob Dobbie, returning to Whitehall after a spell on
another project close to Heseltine's heart - the Liverpool Task Force.
A further muscular mandarin is being brought back from the US to
reinvigorate the trade promotions office, and if Eltis still has any mates
left at NEDO some of them may still be offered jobs.
Diverse though the appointments are, the inside buzz is that the new
recruits have two things in common. First, they are 'doers' with direct
experience of their clients' interests.
Second, and more important, they're all the president's men.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Report suggested sugar should no longer be a 'vexed
question'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DONALD J NAISMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One would have thought following the Department of Health's publication
some four years ago of a report by its Panel on Dietary Sugars and Human
Disease, of which I was a member, that sugar would no longer be a 'vexed
question' (Management July 1). Apart from the undisputed role of sugar, as a
fermentable carbohydrate, in the promotion of dental decay, no convincing
evidence was found for a specific involvement in the causation of any other
disease.
As Dr McGannon points out, the brain is well protected from a lack of energy
by mechanisms that control the blood glucose, its favoured fuel, within
fairly narrow limits. The uptake of glucose from the blood is not
insulin-dependent, but an abnormally large increase in blood glucose
following a meal or snack containing carbohydrate, or decrease (reactive
hypoglycaemia) in response to an excessive insulin secretion, can seriously
disturb brain function. The proportion of healthy people who experience
reactive hypoglycaemia is unknown, but is likely to be small.
Simple sugars like glucose and sucrose (table sugar), and starches after
their digestion, cause the blood glucose to rise, some more rapidly than
others, and trigger the secretion of insulin.
Contrary to what Dr McGannon suggests, the rise following the ingestion of
refined sugar, as in a non-diet cola, is little more than half that recorded
when glucose (the sugar present in fruits and fruit juices) is consumed, and
considerably less than that caused by eating an equivalent amount of starch
in breakfast cereals or wholemeal bread.
I suspect that the distressing symptoms described by Dr McGannon that appear
to afflict our business executives may have their origins other than in
reactive hypoglycaemia. His unusual dietary prescription is unlikely to
appeal either to the workforce or to those responsible for formulating
guidelines for healthy eating.
May I suggest that decisions about what should be served in the company
cafeteria or executive dining room might best be delegated to the catering
officer.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Pensions review needs lay views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RALPH WHITING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a response to the Maxwell pensions scandal and prompted by the
highly critical report of the House of Commons select committee, the
government has set up a committee under the chairmanship of Prof Roy Goode
to review the law relating to occupational pension schemes.
That the Maxwell scandal should have occurred is an indictment of the
current system of law and voluntary regulation under which occupational
pension schemes operate; a system about which most of the professionals
involved in the pensions industry have been too complacent for far too long.
The people who have suffered from the Maxwell and similar pension fund
scandals are not the professionals who make their living from running,
investing and advising pension schemes, but the ordinary members of those
schemes who have contributed from their pay, until very recently on a
compulsory basis, in the expectation that those contributions would provide
them with a secure income in retirement.
It is ironic therefore that the make-up of Prof Goode's committee, recently
announced, should be heavy with pension professionals and advisers and light
on lay representatives of pension scheme members and pensioners. The
committee comprises two academics, a solicitor, an accountant, an actuary,
an investment strategist, a life office chief executive, a retired
investment manager, an industrialist, and a freelance journalist.
While I have no doubt that all the individuals named are people of integrity
and intelligence, they do seem, on the face of it, to be more representative
of the hitherto complacent pensions establishment than the membership of
pension schemes whose interests pensions law should protect.
Noticeably absent is any representative from any trade union or pensioners'
organisation who might be expected to have an understanding of the needs,
requirements and expectations which ordinary members and pensioners have of
the pensions schemes to which they belong but have no professional position
to protect.
What we cannot afford is for this review committee to close professional
ranks and to come to the same conclusion as the Occupational Pensions Board
did on its previous consideration of this subject in 1989. At that time the
board, with the support of most of the pensions establishment, concluded
that there was no case for reform. How wrong it was and how wrong will be
the current committee if it comes to the same conclusion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS Perot has done a double service to his country. His campaign for the
White House demonstrated the depth of dissatisfaction felt by many Americans
about their political system and thus gave a salutary shock to both main
parties. But his timely withdrawal has also removed an element of confusion.
It would have been ironic if Mr Perot's populist campaign had taken the
ultimate choice of the next president away from the voters and placed it in
the hands of politicians.
A Perot presidency would certainly have been a great disappointment to his
supporters, because the premise on which his campaign was based is wrong.
That premise was that there are simple solutions to America's problems, and
that all that is lacking for the application of those solutions is competent
leadership. Such a perception is common among people looking at politics
from the outside, especially perhaps from the world of business. It neglects
the fact that in a democracy those who take decisions in the general
interest face coalitions of those who believe their particular interests are
being damaged. Overcoming this problem is the essence of political
leadership. Effective leadership is unlikely to come from a man who denies
the existence of the problem.
It is somewhat odd that Mr Perot, having decided to withdraw, should now
encourage his followers to keep his name on the ballot and remain in being
as an organised pressure group, seeking to influence the main parties. To do
that they will have to draw up a programme and stress the importance of
specific policy positions, precisely what Mr Perot himself refused to do.
A campaign focused on policy issues would, however, be a welcome change. In
theory it should now be possible. There is a clear choice between two
candidates. They do not represent utterly opposed political philosophies. On
the contrary, both represent the moderate wing of their respective parties,
and therefore should in theory be well placed to compete for the middle
ground. Mr Clinton seems to have made a shrewd move in breaking with
convention and choosing a vice-presidential candidate close to him both
politically and geographically, thereby stressing that the new orientation
of the Democratic party reflects more than a temporary balance of forces
within the party.
But the two candidates do differ in their priorities, and the campaign
should help to clarify that. On issues ranging from taxation through health
care and the environment to the type of judge nominated to the Supreme
Court, it will make a significant difference which of them occupies the
White House for the next four years.
On Mr Clinton's side is the argument that the Democrats are almost certain
to retain control of both houses of Congress, and that a Democratic
president may therefore stand a better chance of breaking the deadlock on
the federal budget. On Mr Bush's side is his much greater experience of, and
interest in, international affairs. Although happily Mr Clinton, unlike Mr
Perot, is not challenging the basic commitment of the US to free trade and
to a leading role in global security, foreigners will worry lest these
matters get a lower priority. On the other hand effective US action to
address its most acute domestic problems is not an alternative to, but in
the medium term a condition of, its remaining an effective superpower. World
leadership begins at home.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Leading Article: National Savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIDAY'S decision by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest
building society, to raise its mortgage interest rate from 10 3/4 to 10.99
per cent was a shock. But this modest increase was not really so surprising.
Nor can it be blamed simply on mistaken policies towards National Savings.
While the Treasury may have made a tactical error, it is its strategic
problems - the fiscal deficit and the rates of interest set by Germany -
that matter most.
The official forecast for the public sector borrowing requirement this
financial year is Pounds 28bn. With little, if any, economic growth in
prospect this year, the PSBR is likely to be larger, perhaps as much as
Pounds 35bn, or 5-6 per cent of gross domestic product. To put this sum in
context, the Treasury expects to collect only Pounds 40bn from value added
tax in 1992-93.
How can the government avoid crowding out other borrowers, when its own
needs are so large? It cannot. It can only choose whom it crowds out and
how.
The government can, and should, underfund the PSBR. In other words, it
should finance as much as possible by selling bills to banks rather than
gilts to the public. This policy would have three merits, apart from
disposing of the arbitrary full-funding rule: first, it would expand broad
money, which has been growing too slowly; second, it would tend to raise
short-term rates of interest, so strengthening sterling, relative to
long-term rates of interest, so facilitating corporate borrowing; and third,
it would reduce the amount of long-term borrowing at nominal rates of over 9
per cent. A government that believes inflation will soon be 2 per cent
should either borrow short term or via index-linked securities.
Yet by raising short-term rates of interest, underfunding would exacerbate
the consequences for mortgage interest of the Treasury's desire to fund part
of its deficit via direct sales to the public. From the point of view of the
building societies, the government is succeeding too well. In the first
quarter of this financial year, National Savings raised Pounds 1.5bn, as
against Pounds 3.1bn in the whole of last year. Last month's net outflows
from the building societies, at Pounds 315m, were the second biggest ever.
The launch of First Option, a one year investment at a gross interest rate
of 10.34 per cent, is making things worse. This rate of interest is higher
than that offered by most building societies, but it is not out of line with
the markets. Nor would borrowing equivalent sums in the wholesale market
preclude pressure on the building societies via the interest that could then
be offered by banks.
Not using National Savings so aggressively would certainly be more tactful.
But an upward drift in mortgage rates relative to money market rates, was
probably inevitable, in any case. A mortgage interest rate of 10 3/4 per
cent only makes sense if the risk is impeccable. But mortgages are no longer
impeccable risks.
With the government an aggressive competitor of the home-purchaser as well
and sterling's credibility now in doubt, mortgage interest rates are bound
to be under pressure. Underfunding, though desirable, would make this
pressure still greater. The government should minimise the extent to which
it is identified as a direct competitor of the house buyer. But there is not
much it can do about the fact that it is.

FT  20 JUL 92 / The Italian auction begins: Privatisation has suddenly been
put at the top of the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cream of Italian business and finance was seduced into rising at the
crack of dawn last month by the prospect of a day on board the British royal
yacht, Britannia, with the excuse of a conference on privatisation.
After being welcomed with 1950s tunes from a Royal Marines' band, the
audience was given a hard-nosed sell of the City of London's services. The
arguments were impeccable: Italy possessed the biggest state sector in
Europe and an impossibly large budget deficit - ergo, privatisation was the
most effective means of reducing the role of the state and releasing
resources. The City was there to help.
At one stage, however, a distinguished Italian financier very politely said
that the gentlemen from London were wasting their time. Things were
different in Italy, and privatisation an unreal dream.
Yet now the new government has unexpectedly placed privatisation at the top
of the agenda. 'I am creating a machine that will be forced towards
privatisation,' Prof Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, told the
FT last week.
Since then, the four principal public entities - IRI, the main state holding
company, ENI, the oil concern, ENEL, the electricity authority, and INA, the
insurance institute - have been converted into joint stock companies under
the tutelage of the Treasury. In turn two super-holdings are being set up,
with the Treasury as the initial shareholder, which will house these four
entities and other state assets, principally the banking groups BNL and IMI.
The super-holdings, with initial assets of L60,000bn (Pounds 27.7bn), will
be responsible for what could become the biggest state sell-off in the
European Community. Certainly, the prime minister intends to change
radically the corporatist culture of a benign state subsidising industry and
deeply involved in every aspect of economic life, which has been a feature
of the country's development since the early days of Mussolini in the 1930s.
Already, Efim, the third-largest state holding, with 37,000 employees and
activities that span aluminium, aerospace, defence and transport, was last
Friday put in the hands of a special administrator charged with winding it
up.
'You begin by saying you are in year zero, and you should reduce the role of
the state as much as you can,' says Prof Amato. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that Italian
state-controlled companies employ 15 per cent of the non-agricultural labour
force, and account for 20 per cent of added value and 25 per cent of fixed
investment; the state also controls two-thirds of the banking system.
In spite of growing pressure from EC partners and the deteriorating state of
public finances, the previous Andreotti government dithered over such a move
for nearly a year and, only three weeks ago, was talking of limiting the
change to ENI, giving the group 60 days to complete its change of identity
into a joint stock company.
The Amato government has moved so fast and kept its plans so tight that the
managers of the companies concerned were largely in the dark. According to
Prof Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister and one of the leading figures
in the privatisation plans, there are two principal lines of action.
The first is to provide the government with room for manoeuvre, free of the
political parties. This explains the control of the state entities being
placed in the hands of the Treasury. Until now the boards of state companies
have been appointed through deals struck by the leaders of the parties in
government, to ensure that their own party patronage is taken care of. Thus
the Christian Democrats have always had the lion's share, followed by the
Socialists - IRI has traditionally had a Christian Democrat president, ENI a
socialist.
In tandem with removing control from the party bosses, the government needs
to obtain quick finance to plug the widening 1992 budget deficit, equivalent
to more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product. To this end, the two
super-holdings will issue convertible bonds or warrants to be underwritten
by a consortium of banks. A 45 per cent ceiling has been placed on private
ownership of the holdings.
But Prof Guarino insists no ceiling has been placed on the sale of shares in
the operating subsidiaries of those companies in the super-holdings. He also
adds that no sector is sacrosanct. The finances of the companies are so
parlous that a large-scale divestment may well be necessary. The resultant
pattern of ownership may be incompatible with the government's desire for a
Germanic model of commercial bank influence over the corporate sector.
The prime minister himself says the bottom line is that the state has no
more money to offer the many companies in need of recapitalisation and debt
relief - and even if it had, the EC would not permit old practices of state
subsidy and grant.
The second aim is to buy time in which to reorganise the existing operating
companies under the holdings and to decide a rational order of sell-offs.
Prof Guarino recognises that this will take about three years because it
will entail issues of industrial strategy and reorganisation, plus tackling
the question of debts. IRI's debts alone are now close to L60,000bn.
This process of reorganisation need not interfere with existing plans for
flotations of companies and banks held by IRI and ENI. For instance IRI's
telecommunications holding, Stet, has begun to cut its stake in Sip, the
telephone utility, to obtain funds. ENI is at an advanced stage in preparing
to sell tranches of Agip and Snam, its oil and natural gas units.
The immediate task is to decide who will manage the super-holdings and the
nature of their respective boards. 'To be credible, we will need competent
people who can demonstrate they are not puppets of the parties,' said a
foreign merchant banker.
The government also has to decide quickly on the composition of the
super-holdings. Should ENI and ENEL be lumped together as a single
energy-based super-holding, and should such a group include IRI? And should
the other super-holding comprise exclusively banking and financial
interests, ie INA's insurance activities, along with the Treasury-controlled
BNL and IMI banking entities?
Logically this broad division into energy/industry and financial/banking
would necessitate hiving off IRI's huge banking and financial interests. The
division by activity could enable privatisation to proceed more rapidly,
especially as the banking sector is better placed than other sectors for
sell-off (parts of the banking sector have already been privatised).
The sceptics still remain to be convinced that the government has not bitten
off more than it can chew. Their objections are part political, part
financial. Thus state investment - an important instrument for development,
especially in the economically depressed south - has often been determined
by political factors. By contrast ENI has expanded under the entrepreneurial
ethos of the late Mr Enrico Mattei, whose skills demonstrated that
energy-dependent Italy could develop a dynamic state company capable of
securing a portion of its oil and gas supplies through innovative
exploration and production deals overseas.
The politicians have also come to rely upon generous state benefits as a
means of ensuring social consensus as well as funding large party machines
that in turn deliver votes. State control of television, the airlines,
railways and the banking system have permitted formidable patronage. Yet
with a fragmented party system, a revolt of the electorate in the north in
favour of clean government and better services, the political side of Prof
Amato's problems may be lesser than they appear at first glance.
More complex are issues of management and industrial relations.
Privatisation brings into play the whole question of industrial relations
which perforce must challenge overmanning, illogical distribution of plant
and unnecessary factories. Overmanning could be as high as 20 per cent in
the public sector. Industrial peace meanwhile has been bought until now by a
combination of generous pensions, well-paid lay-offs, padded payrolls and
politically directed investment. The threatened closure of a factory whether
in the private or public sector provokes a chorus of protests and inevitable
backtracking, especially in vote-sensitive areas such as the south.
Over the past decade industry has lost 778,000 workers, but these have been
covered either by early retirement or by moving into services. However, the
slowdown of the past 18 months, greater competition and higher costs have
put at least 200,000 jobs at risk, according to CGIL, the main union
confederation.
The union leadership recognises that the old forms of militancy no longer
have much support among its members and that Italy is entering a new climate
of industrial relations. Much therefore depends on the outcome of tripartite
talks with the employers and government, currently in progress on a new
structure for wages and employment.
Finally, there is the domestic financial market. Currently, 75 per cent of
savings are in Treasury paper, financing the state debt. So long as interest
rates are high and tax breaks are favourable to Treasury bonds, the public
has little incentive to buy shares in privatised companies, especially when
Italy has such a poor record of protecting minority shareholders. The stock
market itself is a victim of the public's propensity to buy Treasury bonds,
but it is also small because it has failed to modernise and encourage
Italian private companies to use the bourse.
The market's capitalisation is only Dollars 125bn, one-eighth that of
London. Launching even one large issue like that of the bank San Paolo di
Torino for L1,525bn earlier this year poses enormous problems in drumming up
investor support. This suggests that the government has to give priority to
speeding up modernisation of the financial system as a whole - not least to
encourage international investment which will be needed to absorb a sizeable
slice of the privatised offerings. The international financial community has
to be given incentives to buy into Italian stocks, both through greater
freedom to operate on the ground and through attractive guarantees of what
is on offer.
Take the example of ENEL, the electricity authority. Foreign groups have
shown great interest in its potential. But at the moment tariffs are blocked
and the first thing investors are demanding to know about a new ENEL is its
tariffs structure, because only on this measure can they base yields.
The task ahead is thus a minefield of difficulties and the initial positive
moves will need to flesh out a flimsy framework.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Don't look for gurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone foolish enough to look on British economists as gurus should have
been thoroughly disillusioned by the contributions of eight economists
published in the FT on Saturday on whether leaving the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism would 'help Britain'.
Of these, three said 'yes', four said 'maybe', and one, Peter Spencer of
Kleinwort, was brave enough to give a forthright 'no', saying that if the UK
left the ERM, overseas investors would 'find it difficult to believe the
word of the UK government in the future'.
I am not so concerned about the three downright 'yes' answers. Patrick
Minford has always opposed the ERM, and Wynne Godley at least the hard
counterinflationary version. I am more concerned about the four 'maybes'.
Two of these concentrate on predictions rather than giving their own opinion
and are mainly anxious not to be caught by events. Another says the UK was
right to join in 1990, but should soon contemplate departure.
One 'maybe', David Currie, of the London Business School, comes near in his
admittedly very summarised FT contribution to advocating an alternative
package of devaluation plus deep public spending cuts and an independent
Bank of England, the day after he had a letter in The Times cogently
attacking the anti-ERM Liverpool Six. It is, of course, extremely unlikely
that the government would make the Bank independent if it were forced out of
the ERM. (One wit in that institution asked me: 'Would an independent Bank
be able to rejoin the ERM?')
I am reminded of the famous protest by 364 economists after the 1981 Budget.
They all agreed that there were alternatives to government policy, but did
not dare say what they were, lest their apparent unity crumbled. Some of
them indeed advocated joining the ERM] But you can take it that almost any
imaginable economic policy - certainly one pursued by a Conservative
government - would have a majority of British economists against it.
There is a case for floating rates and a case for a quasi-fixed rate
arrangement, like the ERM. The virtues of both systems, as of macro-economic
policies in general, are much exaggerated. But what is truly contemptible is
the British habit of not being willing to stay with any set of policies,
even for a short time, without hankering after another panacea.
What is it fundamentally that prevents the economy moving towards a full
employment equilibrium without inflation? The answer of Keynes was that the
rate of interest got stuck at too high a level. That may have had some
validity in the deflationary years of the Great Depression in the early
1930s. Unfortunately, it was wrongly assumed to be true by a large part of
the postwar economic establishment when the price that has been out of
kilter has been that of labour.
In what conceivable sense are we in a deflation or depression, when the
national income in money terms is rising by some 5 per cent per annum or
more, as it is in most industrial countries, and when a 6 1/2 per cent rate
of earnings increase in the UK after nearly two years of falling output and
employment is regarded as a triumph of moderation? Instead of speaking as if
some exchange rate regime, other than the one we happen to be in, was the
clue to prosperity, economists could more usefully investigate why
businesses are so keen to cut employment, but so reluctant to cut pay and
prices at the slightest sign of trouble. It would be refreshing if
devaluationists began their expositions by explaining that their favoured
measure works, if it works at all, by reducing real wages.
If any country has the right to complain of high real interest rates imposed
by the Bundesbank it is France. That country has a genuinely lower rate of
inflation than Britain - 3 per cent, compared with an underlying 4.7 per
cent - and therefore correspondingly higher real interest rates. Yet,
British opinion takes a lead in the grumbling.
For Britain even to contemplate departing from the ERM while France remains
is simply another instance of the devaluation urge, which has brought the
pound from DM11 in the mid 1960s to less than DM3 today. Each time sterling
fell, there was a plausible short-term rationalisation, but the end result
has been a much higher rate of inflation than Germany with no offsetting
gains in output and jobs.
I am constantly being asked if there are any circumstances in which it might
be right to leave the ERM, and, if I give the honest 'yes' answer, to say by
what date I would contemplate leaving. Such an approach would most likely
lead to throwing in the towel, just before subsequent statistics show that
the country was beginning to come out of recession.
There are alternatives to sticking with it, but they are a great deal worse.
If you want a long-term view, do not ask a sample of economists, still less
a sample of those who have made their names familiar to a wider public.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Iphigenie en Aulide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Theatre du Soleil seldom tours. It performs at the Cartoucherie in Paris
(near the Chateau de Vincennes) and rarely anywhere else. Twenty one years
ago its visit to London's Roundhouse Theatre made a great impact. Now the
European Arts festival has brought the company for a week of performances
(July 16-22) to perform Les Atrides, a tetralogy of Greek tragedies -
Euripides's Iphigenie en Aulide followed by Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy.
Robin Mills, Bradford, has been especially converted for the purpose to
become the Cartoucherie of the North.
Excitement is high, and Iphigenie en Aulide - on which I report here - was
greeted with an ovation. To me, however, the great event of the evening was
simply Robin Mills itself. A large foyer space, transformed into an
astonishingly festive bistro, serves a splendid array of food and drink. The
auditorium was abuzz before it was even half-full, and the news that it
might grow very warm over 140 minutes (no interval) simply added to the
anticipation.
You will have guessed by now that the performance disappointed me. The
Theatre du Soleil's director Ariane Mnouchkine has formed a vivid pop
multiculturalist performing style. Costumes, movement, music all show
elements of numerous idioms. But if you've seen Kabuki theatre or Indian
dance or any of a dozen other styles recently, you can't help seeing how
merely cute the Theatre du Soleil's use of them is. Friends tell me that the
company has changed; one chum who had been thrilled at the Roundhouse in
1971 said: 'They've forgotten everything that made them remarkable.' What
saddened me most was that at the heart of this far-from-radical-now
multiculturalism was standard bad old French hammy acting.
Euripides, by the way, has been rendered into throughly obvious parlance by
Jean and Mayotte Bollack. No simultaneous-translation device is provided and
those with a mere smattering of French will need none. The actors speak
deliberately and in wretchedly short phrases. Characterisation and utterance
are in no way original. Iphigenie is white-voiced, doe-eyed and cloying,
Clytemnestre switches from maternal excitement to distress with an overdose
of larmes dans la voix, Achille is gauche, and so on. Some actors double
roles, rather as the Greeks did, but here they just switch from one
stereotype to another.
Jean-Jacques Lemetre and his assistants accompany everything - monologues,
dialogues and choruses - on a spectacular array of exotic instruments, but -
once you're past the fun of a few Oriental twangs and so on - it's dismaying
how near to Hollywood his technique is. Those may have been Asian cellos,
but the tremolando accompaniment he produced from them for one tense moment
after another was standard melodramatic kitsch. The chorus dance but never
with any of the rhythmic intricacy or impetus of the Greek lyrics.
The pleasure of the evening comes in its trappings: not just the foyer but
also the bare wooden space itself, and the magnificently colourful costumes,
make-up and wigs worn by all. That's the best side of French theatre for
you. Too bad that the evening also showed the worst.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Architecture: The long saga of St Paul's precinct draws
slowly to an amicable close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long saga of one of the most important sites in London is slowly drawing
to a close. Last Friday Paternoster Associates - a partnership consisting of
Greycoat Estates, Park Tower Group and Mitsubishi Estate Company - put in
the final planning application for the redevelopment of Paternoster Square
to the north-east of St Paul's cathedral. The planning committee of the City
of London last looked at the proposals for this vital area in December last
year when they seemed to be far from happy on several fronts. It is - in
theory - not the role of the planning committee to make architectural
decisions and so their objections were mainly to do with the lay-out of the
scheme, and how the scheme had followed the rules relating to St Paul's
heights. There was at that time a feeling that density was the problem too,
and that the proposals were worryingly close to overdevelopment.
From July 23 it will be possible to see the revised proposals in The
Guildhall in the City - although this time there is no large scale
exhibition. What exactly has happened to the scheme since December? It
remains the predominantly traditional scheme that received the blessing of
the majority of the public and The Prince of Wales at an exhibition. The
architects are an interesting list. Tom Beeby from the US designed the
highly successful new Public Library in Chicago. Allan Greenberg is the
leading American classicist. The British contingent of more or less
traditionalist architects are John Simpson, Demitri Porphyrios, Robert Adam,
Quinlan Terry, Sidell Gibson and Terry Farrell.
The major changes concern the new central square which does not now have a
large sunken area but is all on one level. There is a new central market
hall designed by John Simpson which shelters the escalators that lead to the
underground station and to some shopping. There is now a great deal of
shopping at ground level throughout the development. John Simpson has
designed, for the market hall, a Doric temple with obelisks at the apexes of
the pediments. It could be an entertaining building. The biggest re-design
has been carried out on Tom Beeby's large office building at the west end of
the site. It now looks like a fine example of Edwardian Baroque and does
have less mass and bulk than its predecessor. More views of the cathedral
have been opened up throughout the scheme and,although it is hard to
overcome the bulk of so many offices, the ground level of the whole scheme
is now much more interesting.
It has always been my view that there should be more public activities on
the site and that an hotel, the City Corporation's art gallery and part of
the Museum of London belong on this site. A really fine health club would
undoubtedly do well - the one proposed looks on the mean side. Property
developers believe their researchers (despite Canary Wharf) who tell them
that only offices and more offices will succeed when the recession is over.
Although there is optimism that this particular scheme, because of its
marvellous location, may well succeed despite the recession I cannot believe
that it is too late to look at - what the planners call - enhancing the mix.
There are still two very sensitive areas of great concern in the Paternoster
proposals. They do not technically form part of the consortium's plans but
they are very much related to the final plans for the whole area. One is the
site occupied by the ghastly tower block near Newgate Street known as
Sudbury House which is now the responsibility of Nuclear Electric. This is
to be demolished and its replacement will impinge considerably on the master
plan for the whole Paternoster site. A design has been prepared by the Rolfe
Judd Partnership for a large low, deep plan block. To date it looks as
though it will be a compatible, if unexciting neighbour.
The other more significant site is the major one on the north side of
Ludgate Hill, close to the West front of the cathedral which is currently
occupied by Juxon House. This is in different ownership from the major part
of the Paternoster site but talks have been held between the owners to
ensure a degree of architectural compatibility. The architect for the
replacement of Juxon House, is William Whitfield and he is likely to produce
a decent neighbour. He is highly experienced in designing for sensitive
sites. He was consultant on a major office building near Westminster Abbey.
He has designed the new Chapter House at St. Alban's Abbey and his new
offices for the Department of Health by the Cenotaph in Whitehall have won
plaudits from a variety of critics.
I can see no reason for the City of London Planning Committee to be
disappointed in the revised Paternoster scheme - it has been adapted to meet
all their criticisms. The site is so well located that its owners feel that
it is almost outside the property recession. The present near derelict
condition of the site - at the heart of the City  - should shame everyone
into action. I recommend a visit to the Guildhall to see the revised model
(from July 23) particularly as the exclusive group that runs the
Architecture Foundation refused to include Paternoster in their recent 'City
Changes' exhibition at the Royal Exchange. When will we have a genuinely
catholic architectural culture?

Secret History, the documentary series investigating modern mysteries, is
tackling a Big One tonight (Channel 4 at 9 pm)-- The Last Days of Aldo Moro.
The Italian Prime Minister was missing for fifty five days in 1978 before
his body was found dumped in a Rome street. He was killed by the Red Brigade
but of course the programme manages to suggest that his colleagues in
Government were just as anxious to get rid of him.
Simon Brett's genteel comedy After Henry, featuring Prunella Scales as a
middle aged, middle class widow, seems somehow too genteel for ITV. It
betrays its BBC Radio 4 origins. But this new series, going out at 8.00,
deserves a mild welcome back even if it is sometimes too cosy for its own
good.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Almeida Festival - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Besides the two more spectacular pieces already reviewed here, the Almeida
Opera Festival mounted a pair of smaller operas on Friday. They had nothing
in common but their admirable pianist, Helen Crayford. One was a commission
from the American composer Nils Vigeland; the other, a bright little farce
which seems to have been so thoroughly ignored after Ernst Krenek wrote it
in 1945 that it was copyrighted only in 1960.
Vigeland's False Love/True Love is a two-hander on a pair of scenes from
Jane Eyre; first, Jane rejecting Rochester after their aborted wedding, and
then her later return, when - reassured by his having become blind and
crippled - she decides to marry him after all.
Susan Bisatt made a sensitive, lyrical Jane; Meurig Davies's ponytail and
designer stubble looked right for Rochester, but his pitched tone was so dry
and shallow that most of the role emerged in Sprechstimme.
As for the music .. Well: if the programme-book had announced False
Love/True Love as an experiment in adapting an 1885 piano trio by a minor
French composer (somebody from the Chausson-Faure ACT'e' circuit) for
setting Charlotte Bronte's , we should all have believed it without
question. The trio tinkled and warbled away, bland and mild, and the vocal
parts followed meekly.
                         *      *      *
It all had the pastel passion of a period chocolate-box lid. Presumably
Vigeland really did write it himself - but one couldn't guess why. Caroline
Gawn's production, like Brad Cohen's conducting, was ultra-discreet.
On paper Krenek's own comic text for What Price Confidence, about would-be
marital infidelities, and his brittle piano-score (serial, I think, though
lightened by friendly added-note chords), might seem to recall Schoenberg's
dire Von Heute auf Morgen. The recurrent theme of 'having confidence' here
operates rather like the recurrent sneer at 'moderne Menschen' in Frau
Schoenberg's libretto. But Miss Gawn's crisp, witty direction - making
resourceful use of the basic set for thebigger Almeida operas - and Miss
Crayford's impeccably sprightly piano lifted that curse altogether.
With a first-rate quartet of husbands and wives doing their best to err
(Angela Tunstall, Rachael Hallawell, Geoffrey Dolton and Kevin West), the
piece was delightful beyond expectation. Neatly paced, not a minute too
long, Krenek's music points and underlines the comic exchanges wryly and
deftly. How sad that a staging so expertly prepared should get just a single
performance] The Bronte confection was awarded a second showing on Sunday,
but it should have been What Price Confidence.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Medium-term jobs outlook promising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDIUM-TERM employment prospects are surprisingly good, according to a
survey by the Manpower employment agency and the British Institute of
Management.
They say that 51 per cent of employers expect to employ more staff by 1996
and only 30 per cent predict an overall decline.
The survey of 163 chief executives and senior directors also finds that 74
per cent of employers expect flexible working to increase in the next four
years, with rises in contracting-out of non-core activities, flexible
retirement and temporary staff. The public sector expects a faster rate of
change than the private sector.
Since 1985, 88 per cent of organisations have carried out a substantial
restructuring, and 66 per cent since 1990, while 45 per cent plan to
restructure again in the coming year. In 76 per cent of organisations, at
least one layer of management has been removed.
The trend towards a smaller core of highly trained staff and a larger
periphery of temporary and less-skilled staff will continue, the survey
says. The biggest increase in temporary workers is expected to be among
clerical and secretarial staff, and contracting out will grow most rapidly
in facilities management and driving-and-distribution.
Short-term employment prospects are less good than the medium term. Some 50
per cent of employers expect net job losses over the next year, compared
with 19 per cent which expect to increase jobs.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Urban reform planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY

<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment will launch a consultation paper this week
outlining sweeping powers for the proposed Urban Regeneration Agency.
The aim of the new body will be to provide better housing, employment and
training in urban areas, as well as improving the environment. It is
expected to co-ordinate many aspects of urban development policy, including
city grants, housing corporation grants, derelict-land grants, city action
teams and urban development corporations.
The agency may also take over English Estates, an arm of the Department of
Trade and Industry that provides factory space for inward investors. It will
not, however, replace the DoE's City Challenge scheme, under which local
authorities bid for government funds for specific projects.
Plans to create the agency were announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, then
environment secretary, before the general election. Mr Peter Walker, the
former environment secretary and Welsh secretary, has been appointed to head
it.
The consultation paper will be sent to local authorities, heads of industry,
housing authorities and training bodies for comment. It is expected to
include a significant house-building programme, with the agency reclaiming
derelict land and developing it in partnership with business and local
government. It is also expected to recommend that the agency should be able
to make compulsory purchase orders and to override local planning laws.
However, the agency's total budget will not be decided before the coming
round of public-spending negotiations.
Proposals for the agency will be included in the government's Housing, Land
and Urban Development Bill, due to go before parliament in November.
If the bill is passed, the agency could be in operation by late next year.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Row over accounting for leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW is starting over the treatment of leases in company accounts,
following a warning from the Finance and Leasing Association.
The association said last week that proposed changes to SSAP 21, the
accounting standard for leases and hire-purchase agreements, would be
difficult to understand.
It wants to retain a guideline in the existing standard that a company
taking out a finance lease should put it on its balance sheet if the value
of the minimum lease payments is at least 90 per cent of the fair value of
the asset.
However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has
recommended that the so-called '90 per cent rule' should be replaced by more
qualitative measures for determining whether the risks and rewards of a
lease have been transferred to the company that takes it out.
The Accounting Standards Board is revising standards and has invited
comments and proposed changes to SSAP 21.
Two draft chapters in the board's statement of principles, released last
week, would appear to suggest that all leases would be placed on the balance
sheet. The chapters are not in themselves standards but are the framework
for future standards.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Signs of an upturn 'have fizzled out'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOOM of recession has failed to lift after the general election,
according to two surveys published today.
The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey shows
that high street sales last month were below those of June last year, while
the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry reports falling output in the
second quarter of this year.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said
that a small boost to sales in shops and stores in the two months after the
election 'now seems to have fizzled out'. The London chamber said that
indications in its survey for the first quarter that the recession might
have been coming to an end 'appear to have been premature'.
Retailers covered by the CBI survey reported sales last month slightly below
the level of a year earlier - by a balance of minus 3 per cent - the first
decline since March.
After three successive months in which the survey showed that 'strong annual
sales growth had been expected, though not fully realised', the retail
sector now believes future sales will remain flat and poor for the time of
year.
In contrast to the other sectors covered by the survey, wholesalers reported
higher sales volumes than in June last year. Mr Whittaker warned, however,
that the basis of the growth 'may be less secure, with retailers now
reporting sharp cutbacks in orders'.
The survey from the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry shows that
domestic business continued to decline in the service sector during the
second quarter, while manufacturing remained weak in spite of a slight rise
in domestic orders.
Although the survey shows that service-sector companies expecting a rise in
domestic activity over the next three months exceeds those predicting a
decrease by 19 per cent, Mr Malcolm Stephens, the chamber's chief executive,
said that should be interpreted with caution. 'Companies have displayed some
optimism in the past but we have yet to see this translate into improved
levels of activity.'
The surveys coincide with a research document from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
securities house, which argues that the underlying rate of GDP growth during
the 1980s was just 2 per cent and that, on present trends, strong growth
would now produce an 'explosive and unsustainable' deficit in the balance of
payments.
The document suggests that the UK is likely to slip down the international
growth league during the 1990s. It says: 'Government policy, currently
predicated on a 2 1/2 per cent long-term growth trend and higher recovery
rates, will have to be completely recast over the next few years. Taxation
will probably have to rise significantly to contain the budget deficit.
Devaluation of sterling is a question of when rather than whether.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / Change in saving patterns expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAMATIC changes in the pattern of consumption and savings in economies
across the world in the rest of the 1990s will be followed by a radical
restructuring of financial institutions, a report published today predicts.
Mr John Ginarlis of PA Consulting Group says that forms of investment based
on borrowing, such as home-buying, may soon no longer be regarded as
worthwhile options for investors. House-buying will return to being a
consumer activity from which no long-term return is expected.
Low inflation, low monetary growth and high real interest rates have turned
off the supply of cheap money that enabled the housing market to expand.
When consumers realise that the housing market will not reinflate, there
will be a permanent change of underlying attitudes towards investment, Mr
Ginarlis says.
He says savings will remain a more attractive investment than property for
the rest of the 1990s, and predicts that the pool of liquid savings in
advanced industrial economies will grow steadily.
The level of personal savings will rise, partly because of the increasing
average age of the population. The process is expected to accelerate as
governments introduce tax regimes that erode the concessions for borrowing,
such as mortgage-interest relief in the UK, and introduce incentives for
savers.
Mr Ginarlis predicts that financial institutions such as banks and building
societies which until now have been primarily lenders will become mainly
savings-industry specialists.
Investment advisory services which until now have been available only to the
high net-worth individual will be developed for a broader market.
Sophisticated deposit schemes that offer the customer a guaranteed rate of
return using money-market techniques such as hedging will appear.
Financial-services companies will have to reduce their cost bases, including
their branch networks, and try instead to improve their productivity.
Mr Ginarlis warns that financial-services companies that treat recent
changes as merely a cyclical downturn in the market run the danger of
discovering too late that a rising cost base has priced them out of
existence.

<DATELINE>
   THE GENDER gap
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the Conservatives' commanding nine-point lead over Labour among women voters
 -will not be narrowed instantly by Mrs Margaret Beckett's election to the
deputy leadership, an opinion poll showed yesterday.
The figures put Mrs Beckett well behind her rivals Mr Bryan Gould and Mr
John Prescott when a sample of 1,052 voters was questioned on which
politicians were an asset to the Labour party.
In the deputy leadership election, Mrs Beckett won the post on the first
ballot with a convincing 57 per cent of the votes, in spite of what was
widely seen as a lacklustre campaign resting heavily on her gender appeal.
Mr Prescott trailed with 28 per cent and Mr Gould scored just 14.6 per cent.
In the survey by Harris in The Observer newspaper, however, that order was
reversed, with Mr Gould - on 26 points - rated a top asset, followed by Mr
Prescott on 25 and with Mrs Beckett well behind on 17.
The role to be given to the new deputy leader once the shadow cabinet
elections are completed on Thursday is one of the few issues still
apparently unresolved in Mr John Smith's camp.
Mr Gordon Brown is thought certain to win the shadow chancellorship and Mr
Tony Blair is predicted to become home affairs spokesman. Mr Jack
Cunningham, provided he wins a high enough vote, is expected to replace the
outgoing Mr Gerald Kaufman as shadow foreign secretary.
Mr Robin Cook, campaign manager for Mr Smith, is marked down to shadow Mr
Michael Heseltine at trade and industry, though he has also been mentioned
as a possible foreign affairs spokesman.
Mrs Beckett is most often mentioned as either shadow leader of the house,
with additional party organisation and campaigning responsibilities, or as
shadow education secretary. She is seen as highly competent for a
departmental brief, making the latter post the more probable.
Mr Bryan Gould, defeated candidate in both leadership contests, is reported
to want the foreign affairs job but is more likely to be given a lesser
post, possibly shadowing Mr William Waldegrave's Citizen's Charter
activities.
All the appointments, expected to be announced on Friday, are dependent upon
performance in the highly unpredictable shadow cabinet ballot, in which the
270 Labour MPs are voting for a record field of 51 candidates chasing 18
places.
Those thought most vulnerable among the present team include Ms Jo
Richardson, the voice on women's rights, Mr Barry Jones, Welsh affairs, and
Mr Jack Straw at education.
Those candidates widely tipped to win places are Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Mo
Mowlam, Ms Hilary Armstrong and Mr David Blunkett.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Nomura drops action over book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S largest security house, Nomura, has decided to drop its libel
action against Bloomsbury, the independent publisher, after more than two
years of legal wrangling.
The action is believed to have cost well over Pounds 1m, of which the lion's
share has been paid by the Japanese.
It emerged yesterday that Nomura has agreed to a 'drop hands settlement',
under which both sides will bear their own costs, but all claims for damages
are withdrawn.
In April 1990 Nomura issued a writ for libel in connection with The House of
Nomura, a book published by Bloomsbury and written by the US-born
stockbroker Mr Al Alletzhauser. It also pressed for an injunction requiring
that the book be withdrawn.
Nomura went ahead with the action after both the publisher and the author
had rejected earlier demands from the Japanese company that the book should
be withdrawn and a payment of damages should be negotiated.
In the original writ issued in the High Court in April 1990 alleging
defamation, solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines, acting for Nomura, alleged that
the words in the preface to the book 'in their natural and ordinary meaning
meant and were understood to mean' that the Japanese securities house had:
Succumbed to the demands of gangsters and/or extortionists and/or
blackmailers.
Conspired with blackmailers to misuse its funds for the purpose of making
payments to the blackmailers.
Carried out and/or committed immoral and/or illegal acts and/or practices
which they wished to conceal by making payments to blackmailers.
Habitually engaged in the practice of insider trading and misused
confidential information.
Preparations for a trial were still under way in July 1991 when the chairman
and vice-chairman of Nomura resigned after taking responsibility for a
series of scandals.
Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, the chairman, said his resignation would show that the
company genuinely regretted its improper behaviour, which also included
compensating favoured clients for trading losses and lending to a gangster
group.
The resignations led to private celebrations at Bloomsbury, whose managing
director, Mr Nigel Newton, had earlier declared that he was not in the
business of 'sanitising well documented, well researched and well written
works of non-fiction'.
Linklaters &amp; Paines was not prepared to comment on the litigation. Mr Nick
Thomas, of Kennedys, which is acting for Bloomsbury, however described the
out-of-court settlement as 'not quite a total victory but near enough' for
his clients.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Union link faces radical reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Neil Kinnock was elected Labour leader in 1983 he celebrated
afterwards with several union chiefs. At the small gathering to celebrate Mr
John Smith's election, there was not a single union general secretary
present.
Not too much should be read into that. Mr Smith had the enthusiastic
endorsement of all main union leaders, is on good terms with them, and does
not favour a complete break in the institutional links between party and
unions.
But the fact that Mr Smith cannot include any union leaders among his close
friends - with the possible exception of Mr John Edmonds of the GMB general
union - and has not been dependent on them for his victory gives him an
uncluttered hand in the debate on union links.
His acceptance speech on Saturday indicated that he wants reform of the
relationship. He reiterated his support for 'one member, one vote' for the
selection and reselection of MPs and confirmed that the union block vote at
Labour annual conferences is a target for abolition.
Mr Smith, like many others in the party and the unions, wants to escape from
a policy-making process dominated by phantom millions of union members. He
wants to 'individualise' the union-party link and strengthen local
co-operation while reducing the high-profile, undemocratic national links
epitomised by the block vote and the electoral college.
He is therefore attracted to the idea, floated by the GMB, of converting
some of the 5m union members who pay the political levy - often through
inertia - into 'associate members' of local constituency parties. Such
members would pay a little more than levy payers but less than ordinary
members - perhaps Pounds 5 a year.
Union delegations at Labour's conference would then reflect only the number
of associate members they had recruited and would also be able to split on
issues according to how the associate members split.
If, say, 1m of the 5m levy payers became associate members, it would also
help the party's financial plight. On Saturday, union leaders agreed to
increase the levy from Pounds 1.60 a head to Pounds 1.70, but were more
cautious about a proposal for an increase to Pounds 2.15 over the next four
years.
Some unions want to see what emerges from the committee examining the
party-union link, expected to produce a provisional report early next year,
before deciding on long-term funding.
With the exception of the TGWU, most of the big unions are prepared to
contemplate significant reforms, although some - such as the AEEU
engineering and electrical union - see the associate-member plan as too
complex.
'We want to complement, not dominate,' says Mr Tom Sawyer of Nupe, the
public-services union.
Neither the unions nor Mr Smith want a complete break. Some of the new
leader's shadow cabinet colleagues believe he has hitherto been too timid.
Mr Edmonds talks of a 'new constitutional settlement' but also warns of a
possible backlash from unions if their influence is cut too much.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Portillo joins attack on economy plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHOICE of Mr John Smith as leader has compounded Labour's difficulties,
not resolved them, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
argues in a pamphlet published today.
The 25-page critique of the Labour leader's record as shadow chancellor says
his economic policies disclose an anachronistic attitude to wealth, the
individual and the state that contradicts Mr Neil Kinnock's goal of making
the market economy function better than under the Tories.
Accusing Mr Smith of being the Labour figure most associated with high
taxation, Mr Portillo says the former shadow chancellor 'perpetuated the
contradictions and gave voice to the misunderstandings' about how the
economy functions.
His attack is the latest in a sustained Tory assault on the new Labour
leadership as the Conservatives' economic record is itself receiving
wide-ranging criticism.
The Conservative Political Centre pamphlet, entitled The Economics of Mr
John Smith, says the Smith 'shadow Budget' would have deepened the
recession, damaged the housing market and sapped consumer confidence by
affecting those on incomes barely double the national average.
It also challenges the extent to which Labour has embraced an economic
strategy led by market forces, claiming that Mr Smith's 'supply-side'
policies amounted to outdated interventionism by a different name.
The new Labour leader is accused of being 'inconsistent and unreliable' in
his anti-inflation policies by not being sufficiently rigorous on
maintaining interest rates and appearing weak in his support for the
exchange rate mechanism. Mr Portillo says Mr Smith abandoned his commitment
to sterling's DM2.95 central rate in the ERM 'to avoid being outflanked' by
the pro-devaluation Mr Bryan Gould, his rival in the leadership race.
The bulk of Mr Portillo's attack is aimed at the 'shadow Budget' that opened
Labour's election campaign. Claiming that the plan represented a Pounds
6.7bn tax rise in a full year - the largest proposed since the Second World
War - the chief secretary argues that the policy was a tactical blunder.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Party exchanges passion for the new pragmatism: The choice
of leader offers few surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no longer room for the politics of revolution in the dour 1990s.
The departure two years ago of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher marked the
triumph of Tory pragmatism over ideology. Labour's overwhelming endorsement
this weekend of Mr John Smith gave the opposition a leader who, like Mr John
Major, thrives on cautious consensus rather than charisma.
The mood among the 1,000 or so delegates - MPs, trade unionists and
constituency activists - who crowded London's Royal Horticultural Hall was
curiously sanguine. The shock of the election was behind them. There were no
recriminations. They were there to start again.
The only reminder of what might have been came from remaindered copies of
the glossy pre-election policy documents at the bookstall.
Nor were there any surprises. Even the extraordinary 91 per cent of the vote
secured by Mr Smith had been predicted in advance. Mr Kinnock, never a great
friend of his successor, won warm and genuine applause on his last
appearance as leader.
But the quiet, sometimes timid, demeanour of the delegates as the votes were
counted provided ample testimony to the party's desire to replace passion
with respectability.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, who secured victory in the deputy leadership contest
without setting out more than the roughest outline of her personal political
agenda, responded to the mood. Her acceptance speech promised a recasting of
Labour's vision but said nothing of how it might be achieved.
Mr Smith, looking every bit the confident Scottish barrister that Labour
believes it needs to reassure the voters, went further. He will never be a
platform speaker. He prefers precision to rhetorical flourishes. But he
struck the chords that most of delegates wanted to hear.
Labour was the party of change, so it must be ready to change itself. It had
to build into its belief in the virtue of community an exposition of how the
individual would profit from a fairer society. It had to strengthen its
message on the need for democracy and devolution; it had to reinforce its
appeal by modernising its relationship with the trade unions.
Shadow cabinet colleagues welcomed the agenda as a signal that Mr Smith
would press ahead with the reforms of the Kinnock years. All but the union
delegates cheered when the new leader stated the obvious: the block vote at
party conferences and in the choice of leader cannot survive.
But anyone expecting Mr Smith to lead a rush during the next 12 months for
Labour to redefine its policies and its constitution will be disappointed.
If the first thread through his speech was change, the second was
gradualism.
Some of his colleagues share the judgment. Mr Kinnock, the argument runs,
had no choice but to grab his party by the scruff of the neck if the
extremists were to be shaken out and the ideological baggage dumped. Mr
Smith now has time to build a consensus before reshaping the party's
constitution or delivering new policy blueprints on which to fight the next
election.
Other shadow cabinet members view delay as fatal, providing the opportunity
for the union leaders to come up with self-serving fudges that disguise the
exercise of their power while preserving its reality.
The balance that Mr Smith strikes between those two approaches will be
crucial to the party's electoral fortunes. But for now Labour seems content
to lick its wounds. A new leader is change enough.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Smith aides seek to ensure unity at the top: Labour leader
has free hand to tackle union block votes - Beckett trails rivals in 'party
asset' opinion poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH attempt to weld Labour's notoriously faction-ridden leadership into
a coherent team begins today when Mr John Smith's senior aides hold their
first planning session in the leader of the opposition's office at
Westminster.
The prime aim of Mr Murray Elder, the leader's new chief of staff, is to
maximise co-ordination between the Walworth Road party headquarters, the
parliamentary Labour party and Mr Smith's inner office in the Commons.
Under the leadership of Mr Neil Kinnock, officials and MPs frequently
complained of a 'bunker mentality' in the opposition leader's Westminster
offices. That on occasions reportedly caused policy and strategy development
to be duplicated or triplicated as several groups 'second-guessed' each
other's work.
In a further move on strategy Mr Robin Cook, leadership campaign manager for
Mr Smith, said on BBC radio that Labour would use the first year of the new
leadership to re-evaluate its goals, rather than revise policy. Premature
policy reviews after the 1987 election defeat were a 'mistake' that would
not happen again, he said.
The party's national executive committee is due to meet on Wednesday to
begin planning for an 'aims and values' document, scheduled to be debated at
the October conference.
Mr Elder, who was until last week general secretary of the Scottish Labour
party, is determined to draw together the three power centres under a
central command. As political co-ordinator, Mr Elder will work alongside Mr
David Ward, who was until Friday Mr Smith's research officer and who will
take charge of policy development. Mr Alan Haworth, now formally confirmed
as the parliamentary party secretary, will be the third of the triumvirate,
keeping open channels to MPs.
Evidence of the new determination to mesh the leader of the opposition's
office with party headquarters came in the announcement that Mr David Hill,
the communications director, is to double as Mr Smith's chief press liaison
aide.
Mr Dan Corry, head of the widely admired economic directorate that supported
the shadow Treasury team, is also due to be drafted in to the opposition
leader's inner office.
One of Labour's trickier pre-election difficulties arose earlier this year
when Mr Kinnock hinted at a private dinner with journalists at a London
restaurant that the proposed lifting of the ceiling on national insurance
contributions could be phased in. That was immediately ruled out by Mr
Smith.
Insiders attributed the proposal to advice from Mr John (now Lord) Eatwell,
Mr Kinnock's personal economics adviser, in conflict with the views of his
shadow chancellor. The changes envisaged by Mr Elder are aimed at
eliminating such incidents.

Commercial clients are shopping around - often going outside London - and
competition has brought charges to between Pounds 100 and Pounds 200 an

FT  20 JUL 92 / BA cabin crew back one-day strikes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways cabin crew on European short-haul routes have voted for a
series of one-day strikes in a dispute over pay and conditions.
The decision was taken at a meeting of 300 members of the TGWU general
union. The meeting followed a ballot for strike action, which was carried by
a majority of 53 per cent.
The union said the dispute was over BA's decision to move crews to a
subsidiary company with inferior salaries and conditions. Crews affected are
based in Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland.
BA said it did not expect services to be disrupted if cabin crews did take
action.
The airline added: 'We have not forced anybody into anything - we have union
agreement to the establishment of British Airways Regional, which is
necessary to cut costs and secure the long-term future of services out of
these regional points.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / Generators 'may be forced to give away electricity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY generators may be forced to give away power or even to pay
people to take it if generating capacity continues its present hectic rate
of expansion, according Oxford Economic Research Associates.
The bizarre prospect is raised in a report, published today, that calls for
a fundamental review of the regulation of the electricity industry and its
impact on investment.
The report says that the rush of new entrants into the generating business
since privatisation might be damaging.
Most new projects have to run all the time to be economic and are on fuel
supply contracts that oblige them to take fuel whether they need it or not.
The result might be a situation in which generators are forced to bid zero
or even negative prices to sell into the pool where electricity is traded.
Low pool prices will encourage large users to purchase short-term, which
will further undermine the development of an orderly contract market.
The study blames booming capacity on the failure of the pool to provide the
right price signals, and lack of clarity from the electricity regulator. It
also warns that consumers will eventually have to pay more for electricity
because of the high cost of the new gas-turbine generators which are driving
out old coal-fired stations.
The report concludes: 'There is a real danger of volatile swings in
investment, detrimental to electricity customers'.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Rover aims for less bark and more bite: The group's new car
plant at Cowley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER is not noted these days for shouting about things, 'at least not until
they've been completed,' says Mr John Towers, group managing director,
employing understatement with calm deliberation.
Today the production line at the Rover Group's old-established North Works
at Cowley will fall silent. On the other side of Oxford's ring road, Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will formally open a new,
highly flexible Pounds 200m manufacturing facility.
Although it is Rover's biggest single production investment since
privatisation in 1988, the investment programme has been undertaken with a
marked absence of the self-congratulatory fanfares that marked so many of
the activities of what, before privatisation, was BL.
At an informal tour of the new plant last week, long-serving executives with
experience of both regimes recalled with embarrassment the old BL
trumpetings such as 'A Miracle is Born' at the launch of the Maestro, or
customers of the early Montego Turbo being told the problem was not the
model's wayward handling but their inability to drive properly.
Construction of the centre, which includes a large assembly hall and new
robotic systems to make car bodies, dispels years of speculation that
Rover's long-term intention was to close the sprawling Cowley operation with
the loss of its remaining jobs. The 220-acre site employs more than 3,000
people.
As part of the rationalisation of the four sites, the North and South Works
are to be redeveloped as a commercial and industrial park by Arlington
Securities, the property subsidiary of Rover Group's 80 per cent owner,
British Aerospace - the other 20 per cent is held by Honda.
The new plant, capable of producing 110,000 cars a year on two shifts, is
already producing the latest versions of Rover's 800-series executive car
range.
The new facility is not expected to add significantly to Rover's output. Mr
Towers said the company expected combined production from Cowley and its
Birmingham plants not to exceed 550,000 a year for the foreseeable future.
Rover had no intention of seeking to regain its former status as a volume
manufacturer.
The entire facility is within the 112-acre Cowley Body Plant, which will
also continue to manufacture bodies for Rolls-Royce, among other pressings.
The overall effect is to maintain all Cowley's previously existing
activities but within a site less than half the original size.
The flexibility of the 360,000 sq ft assembly hall which is the core of the
investment is designed to match the new-found flexibility of the
3,000-strong Cowley workforce. The employees have accepted Japanese-style
working practices, under what Rover describes as its 'new deal' which
elevates all of them to staff status.
Mr Towers says the most significant aspect was giving people the space to
realise their full potential. He adds: 'Eastern success is not so much
processes as letting people contribute.'
While more sophisticated robotics have been introduced where felt to be
necessary in the body welding and pressing plants, 'this has been done only
in areas where they have been felt critical for flow and quality'.
Western manufacturers which have tried to automate themselves into
competitiveness with the Japanese car industry have been misguided, he
insists.
'Seeking a one-off improvement of 1,000 per cent is the wrong approach. What
you need, and what we are pursuing, is 1,000 improvements each of 1 per
cent', the approach embodied in Japanese 'lean' production.
Mr Towers claims that the plant's flexibility and the adoption of other
Japanese-inspired techniques such as simultaneous engineering will take
Rover to 'world-class' levels of efficiency within the next two years.

FT  20 JUL 92 / ITV presses ahead with satellite channel plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of leading ITV companies are pressing ahead with plans for a new
satellite television channel involving an investment of Pounds 25m to Pounds
30m. The channel would be broadcast on the Astra satellite system and
consist, at least at the outset, of programmes from the ITV archives.
The enthuasiasm for the channel is a clear sign that the companies believe
satellite television is likely to continue growing and that they should be
part of it.
Companies backing the plan in principle are London Weekend Television and
Central, as well as two of the companies that begin broadcasting in January
 -Carlton Television, which ousted Thames in London, and Meridian, winner of
the south of England franchise.
Consultants Booz Allen have been commissioned to carry out further research.
The final decision on the channel will be taken in September and the service
could be launched early next year. Senior ITV executives believe there is a
high probability that the channel will go ahead.
The hope is that all 16 ITV companies will take a stake. The channel would
initially be funded by advertising but might move to subscription later.
At the same time, Thames Television and the BBC are trying to raise finance
for UK Gold, a satellite channel based on their archives, to be launched
this autumn.
BBC Enterprises recently said it would like to take stakes in up to five
satellite channels covering everything from news and children's programmes
to documentaries and wildlife.
ITV has become interested in satellite television again, partly as a
defensive measure but also to defuse current troubles with the Office of
Fair Trading.
The OFT is believed to be unhappy about ITV plans to buy the rights to
programmes for up to 15 years to deprive other potential users. There might
be less objection if the programmes were shown on a satellite channel,
rather than just kept on the shelf.
A survey by LWT of regular viewers of televised football found only 3 per
cent of those without cable or satellite equipment would definitely get it
when BSkyB starts to broadcast live premier league games.
Just over half of those with equipment said they were likely to subscribe to
the service from BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has
a significant stake.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Recession found to hit IT jobs hardest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVE jobs in the computer sector have suffered worst in the recession
but their redundancy packages are among the most generous, according to
Drake Beam Morin, outplacement company.
The company, which provides counselling for people made redundant, found
that 28 per cent of executive clients and 33 per cent of other clients came
from information technology companies.
The survey says that most IT companies have progressive management practices
and while some have had to abandon jobs-for-life policies, they have offered
redundancy packages on average 30 per cent higher than is usual in other
sectors. Three quarters of recent pay deals are worth between 4 per cent and
5.9 per cent, with most towards the lower end, according to a report from
Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Ucatt to reform voting and finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UCATT, the construction union, is to reform completely its system of
electing officials and controlling its finances.
The decision follows a year-long internal inquiry by Mr John Hand QC, who
found that the existing electoral systems were open to abuse. Financial
controls were found to be loose and, in certain respects, negligent.
The investigation started after a change of control of the union's executive
last year.
The union has already changed its bank and auditors since Mr George Brumwell
took over as the general secretary in February, and a fresh investigation is
to be mounted into missing financial reports.
The union is to appoint a professional general manager for the first time
and a new system of scrutinising expense claims and monitoring budgets is to
be introduced.
The report concluded that allegations against named individuals could not be
proven. It was highly critical of irregularities and an absence of natural
justice in the conduct of the union's proceedings.
Among the recommendations to be considered by Ucatt's general council on
Thursday is that 'those charged with the leadership of the union make it
clear that electoral irregularity and/or malpractice will not be tolerated'.
The report also recommends 'that the union seeks to uphold the general
principles of natural justice when taking any disciplinary action against
members or officials'.
Central to the reforms, which will be considered by an emergency rules
revision conference will be the method of installing the union's officials.
Mr Brumwell said yesterday: 'I am glad this report is now out. It gives us
the chance to bury the wrongdoings of the past and make a new beginning
under new management. I am determined that Ucatt will become the most open,
democratic and effective union in the TUC.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / The European Market: EC probe and over-supply hit PVC makers
 -Without further price rises or rationalisation, the outlook for PVC
manufacturers is bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE tricky times for west European manufacturers of PVC. Their latest
problems began at 9.30am on Tuesday July 7 when European Commission
officials raided the Newton Aycliffe offices of Hydro Polymers, a PVC
subsidiary of Norsk Hydro.
Over the next two days, startled executives in eight other companies faced
questioning from the Commission trustbusters. The raids signalled a new
investigation into alleged price-fixing in the DM6bn-a-year European market
for PVC, the plastic widely used in the construction industry and in
packaging.
But if PVC manufacturers are fixing prices, they are doing it badly. Prices
are depressed by poor demand and rising imports. All suppliers are suffering
heavy losses.
The companies raided this month were BASF, Huls, Hoechst, Wacker Chimie,
Atochem, Shell, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij, Norsk Hydro, Solvay, Cires and
EVC, a joint venture between ICI and Enichem. Some were among the 23
plastics groups fined Ecu60m (Pounds 42.4m) by the Commission in 1989 for
price-fixing in the early 1980s. The decision was overturned by the European
Court of First Instance in March for procedural reasons.
The raids followed complaints by UK customers of rises of some 30 per cent
in February and March. A similar rise was achieved by German manufacturers
in January. EC officials must decide if the rises were because of a tighter
market or an orchestrated effort to raise prices.
The industry certainly needed price rises if they were to stem losses. In
Germany, Europe's largest market, the price of high-quality PVC slumped last
year from about DM1.75 per kilogramme to DM1, according to Mr Denis
Gatfield, managing director of Hydro Polymers. The industry reckons it needs
prices of DM1.45 to break even.
'In periods of over-supply we get screwed,' says Mr Gatfield, 'We were in a
period of over-supply.'
Demand for PVC last year was about 5.3m tonnes, down about 4 per cent on
1990, according to Mr Erich Schnitzler, executive vice-president of PVC at
Hoechst. The fall in demand was aggravated by rising imports, which have now
reached about 12 per cent of the west European market. Imports were about
515,000 tonnes in 1990 and could be as high as 700,000 tonnes this year,
according to Mr Jacques Stevens, manager responsible for PVC at Solvay.
The US remained a significant importer last year, and countries such as
Mexico, Brazil and Libya all increased production. But it is increasingly
aggressive eastern European manufacturers that now provide more than half of
all imports into the EC.
Mr Stevens explains: 'Imports from the eastern countries are a long way from
being cost-calculated. There's no demand locally and they need hard currency
desperately. That affects prices.'
Although UK and Scandinavian markets are depressed, German demand is
buoyant, growing at about 5 per cent. Growth in France and Italy is also
strong at about 4 per cent.
The problem of US imports has also eased, according to Mr Stevens. With US
domestic demand stronger than last year, products previously exported have
been diverted to the home market.
Nevertheless, margins remain poor, according to Mr Robert Genin, marketing
director of polyolefins and PVC at BASF: 'Actually, to tell the truth,
margins are lousy. This is still a non-profitable sector. We need another 15
pfennigs to be profitable.'
Demand for new PVC could fall as more is recycled. Moreover, although
European supply is static, two large US manufacturers, Shintech, a
subsidiary of the Japanese group Shin-Etsu, and Georgia Gulf, are
considering new capacity. Mr Schnitzler at Hoechst fears that if the US
market slows and the dollar weakens further, there could be US dumping into
Europe.
He believes that the European market will grow at only 0.5 per cent a year
over the next five years. Others are more optimistic. Mr Genin at BASF and
Mr Stevens at Solvay reckon that the market could grow at between 1.5 to 2
per cent a year.
'If this sort of unprofitability continues, we can expect some changes in
ownership and some plant closures,' says Mr Gatfield at Hydro Polymers.
The industry needs rationalisation or further price rises. Otherwise, even
without the Commission's attentions, the outlook for PVC manufacturers will
remain bleak.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HINDU militants at Ayodhya in northern India yesterday stepped up
construction of a temple at a disputed site, increasing prospects of
confrontation with the Uttar Pradesh state government.
Their move came as all-party talks in New Delhi failed to reach a political
consensus on the issue. Fourteen hours of talks on Saturday ended in failure
to resolve a dispute over building a temple to Lord Rama on a site where a
16th-century mosque now stands.
A court in Uttar Pradesh last week ordered a halt to the building of the
temple, which has ignited bloody religious riots over the past three years
and has been a bone of contention for decades.
But Hindu leaders on Saturday rejected attempts by local authorities to get
them to abandon the building work.
Hundreds of supporters of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), the militant wing
of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), defied the district
magistrate's attempts to implement court orders which prohibited all
building activity on the disputed site.
'We will not allow the work to be stopped, and if necessary, we will face
bullets,' said VHP general secretary Ashok Singhal after meeting a district
magistrate.
Prime minister Narasimha Rao told the meeting in Delhi that if the state
government continued to be blocked in attempts to enforce the court orders
it would amount to 'a breakdown of the constitution'.
Mr Rao has been under pressure within his minority Congress party government
to invoke a provision allowing the central government to dismiss a state
government for law and order reasons.
The Uttar Pradesh government is ruled by the BJP, chief rival to the
Congress party, which came to power last year on the strength of a campaign
to build the temple.

FT  20 JUL 92 / New car sales in west Europe fall by 5.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 5.3 per cent in June to 1.13m from
1.19m a year ago, according to industry estimates.
Demand weakened in Germany and in many of the small and medium-sized
European markets. New car sales in June were lower than a year ago in 11 of
17 markets across west Europe.
The decline in June accelerated the downward trend that began in March.
Sales have been lower than a year ago in three of the last four months.
New car sales in the first six months of the year fell by 1 per cent to
7.34m from 7.42m in the same period a year ago, according to industry
estimates. Sales were lower than a year ago in 8 of 17 west European markets
including Germany and the UK.
The significant fall in sales in June was caused most importantly by an
estimated 17.4 per cent drop in demand in Germany to 356,000.
New car sales in Germany are retreating from the record levels achieved a
year ago in the wake of unification.
The sharp fall in sales in Germany, the biggest single European new car
market, was exacerbated by the declining demand in most small and
medium-sized European markets in June, led by a sharp 22.5 per cent drop in
sales in Finland.
These declines could not be compensated by the continuing strength of demand
last month in Italy and Spain, where new car sales were 9.6 and 13.4 per
cent higher respectively than a year ago, nor by a rebound in sales in
France where new car registrations rose by 7.7 per cent year-on-year.
The fragile recovery in new car demand in the UK continued last month with a
rise of 4.4 per cent, but in the first six months sales were still 4.1 per
cent lower than the very depressed level of a year ago.
Japanese car sales in west Europe fell by 5.7 per cent in the first half of
the year.
Japanese car makers have been hit by the changing pattern of new car sales
across Europe and the relatively higher decline in demand in the unprotected
European markets where they have their main strength, most importantly in
Germany. Demand has grown most strongly this year in the protected markets
of Italy and Spain, where Japanese car makers have only a small share.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has
established a record lead in the first six months.
It boosted its share of west European new car sales to 17.7 per cent from
16.8 per cent a year ago, thanks most importantly to the success of its Audi
and SEAT marques. Sales of its up-market Audi brand rose by an estimated
12.7 per cent in the first six months narrowly outselling both BMW and
Mercedes-Benz, while sales by SEAT, the VW group's Spanish subsidiary, were
14.6 per cent higher than a year ago.
Skoda, the Czechoslovak car maker where VW has management control, fared
less favourably with sales in west Europe falling by 6.3 per cent. Sales of
the VW brand rose by an estimated 1.9 per cent helped by growing output of
the new generation VW Golf, Europe's best selling car.
Among the big six volume car makers in Europe Fiat of Italy and Ford of the
US have lost most ground with declines of 6.2 and 6.1 per cent respectively.
BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, has made some of the biggest
gains.
The company increased its sales by 13.3 per cent in the first six months and
for the first time in its history has outsold Mercedes-Benz in west Europe
in the first six months.
The main loser among European car makers is Rover, the subsidiary of British
Aerospace, whose sales in west Europe plunged by 16.4 per cent in the first
half of the year to 156,000, depressing its market share to only 2.1 per
cent.

ALGERIAN Prime Minister Belaid Abdesselam formed a 22-strong government
yesterday, naming new men to the key oil and interior ministries in a
country hit by debt and shaken by unrest, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Twelve days after taking over from Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the new prime
minister appointed Mr Hacen Mefti to head the energy portfolio and Mr
Mohamed Hardi as interior minister.
A notable departure was General Laarbi Belkheir, former President Chadli
Benjdedid's right-hand man, as interior minister.
Mr Abdesselam kept the key economy portfolio himself.

<TEXT>
FOREIGN ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean)
converge in Manila today for discussions this week on concrete programmes to
expand regional co-operation.
The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial
disputes involving three Asean members - Brunei, Malaysia and the
Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan over the Spratly Islands in the
South China Sea. All six countries have claims over the islands.
The disputes could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil
exploration in the area.
The meeting is the first since the January accord among the six Asean
governments, which include Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand - to transform
the region into a free-trade area by 2007.
They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing
international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and
development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US,
Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Raul Manglapus, Asean standing committee chairman and Philippines foreign
affairs secretary, confirmed yesterday that the Spratly disputes will be
discussed.
China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to
drill for oil in the disputed territories. Vietnam recently increased its
campaign by wooing Malaysia with participation in an exploration venture.
Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker
on a reef and had authorised its army to use force if necessary to control
the islands.

FT  20 JUL 92 / EDF seeks go-ahead for reactor order
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's most nuclear-dependent electricity monopoly, Electricite de
France (EDF), has asked the French government for clearance to order its
first new nuclear reactor for five years, William Dawkins reports from
Paris.
This could hamper the Socialist administration's attempt to court France's
influential ecology parties in the run-up to the general election next
March.
The moderate Generation Ecologie wants a freeze on nuclear power, while the
Verts, or Greens, want to ban it. Between them they won nearly 14 per cent
of the vote in last March's regional elections.
The government will therefore be under pressure to put off a decision until
after the general election.
However the EDF says it must order a new reactor early next year to cope
with growth in electricity demand.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S unemployment pay system was temporarily rescued from impending
bankruptcy over the weekend by a hard-fought accord between French employers
and a majority of trade unions.
The Patronat employers' organisation and three of France's five main trade
unions agreed to raise contributions to Unedic, the unemployment pay body,
by a shared 0.8 per cent, and reduce payouts to those out of work for more
than four months.
Payments from Unedic, which is funded entirely by companies and their
employees, would have dried up from October without the accord, which runs
until the end of next year. The deal will save FFr25bn (Pounds 2.56bn) by
then, easily clearing Unedic's more than FFr15bn deficit, said negotiators.
The Communist-led CGT, France's largest trade union, refused to sign the
deal on the grounds that workers and the unemployed were being asked to
shoulder too much of the cost of the rescue. The FO union, which founded
Unedic with the employers in 1958, reserved judgment.
Despite the union split, the compromise deal is binding. The fruit of more
than a month's negotiations, it culminated in an all-night bargaining
session ending on Saturday morning.
The talks have been followed closely by the government, which is powerless
to intervene directly but eager to avoid worsening the plight of nearly 3m
unemployed.
The rise in contributions will be split equally, 0.4 per cent each way,
between employers and workers.
The 0.8 rise lasts until the end of the year, when the extra payment reduces
to 0.5 per cent for the following six months and then falls again to 0.4 per
cent until the end of December 1993, by when employers and unions will
review the deal.
From August, individual payouts will drop by 17 per cent from the fourth
month out of work and again every subsequent four months.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Bonn crusader shares vision of circular rubbish / Exploring
a dramatic new chapter in Germany's environment laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S messianic environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, has a way with
words. In his book, rubbish is not garbage: it is a secondary raw material.
In his mind's eye he sees product cycles not as lines littered with ups and
downs, but as near-perfect circles.
This vision lies at the heart of his latest offering, tabled at the weekend.
His 'circulation economy law', he said, 'will bring about a change in the
behaviour of manufacturers, distributors and consumers' and spell the end
for 'ecological subsidies in our way of life'.
The aim of the new law - in reality a top-to-bottom amendment of existing
legislation on the handling and treatment of rubbish - is to force
manufacturers and distributors of all goods to take their products back at
the end of their useful life.
They must then either be re-used, recycled or burnt in power plant. Only
those remnants with no possible use may be classed as 'rubbish' and dumped
in the traditional way.
The costs of collection and reprocessing should be included in the selling
price, but must not exceed existing public authority charges for waste
handling and disposal, he said. Transformation of today's throwaway society
into the circulation economy would take 10 years or more.
Part new, part recycled, Mr Topfer's initiative is a logical, if dramatic
new chapter in a long-running series of environmental strictures from the
Environment Ministry.
Since December 1 last year, transport packaging of all goods has routinely
been taken back for recycling. Since April, German shops have been kitted
out with bins to collect outer-packs from self-service goods: items such as
toothpaste boxes.
From January 1 next year consumers will be able to drop off the toothpaste
tube and other sales packs - cigarette boxes, yoghurt pots - on their
shopping trips, and a 50 pfennig charge becomes payable on drinks cans.
Virtually all supermarket goods are marked with a green spot, the sign that
a levy has been paid to Duales System Deutschland (DSD), a joint company set
up by industry and retailers, to pay for collection and recycling through
private channels working in parallel with but independently of the public
waste network.
Half the packaging industry's 600,000-tonne annual demand for tinplate is
recycled. By 1995, DSD says, the proportion will be 72 per cent. Or, in Mr
Topfer's language, the circle will be 72 per cent complete.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Perot refuses to quit US political stage: The Texas
billionaire is determined to influence events ahead of presidential
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSS PEROT may no longer be running for president but the Texas billionaire
still seems to think he can influence the course of US politics this year.
Over the weekend several dozen of the state co-ordinators of his
non-candidacy gathered in Dallas to discuss the next steps with Mr Perot.
Some attempts were apparently made to persuade him to reconsider and, having
failed, yesterday's deliberations focused on some unscripted ideas Mr Perot
had tossed off in two bizarre television interviews on Friday night.
These came only a day after the formal ending of his undeclared candidacy.
In them he called on his 'volunteers' to form 'an army of patriots' to put
pressure on Democratic and Republican candidates running for president and
Congress.
'This is a much bigger, bolder step,' he said. 'What we're laying out
tonight is a plan to have the House, Senate and the White House march in
step, fix the economy and put America back to work.'
Sounding more like a candidate himself, he said he would not withdraw his
name from the 24 state presidential ballots on which he is already
registered, nor discourage the ending of incomplete petition drives.
Simultaneously he insisted repeatedly that he was no longer running.
He again promised to publish soon an economic policy plan, the absence of
which was considered one of several fatal flaws when he still had his eyes
set on the White House.
This plan, according to his few surviving political aides, would include
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 261.7bn) in budget savings over five years, achievable
through a 10 per cent reduction in the federal bureaucracy, the elimination
of many subsidies, higher income and social security taxes on the wealthy,
and increases in petrol taxes.
The weekend meeting in Dallas was called before he spoke on television on
Friday night. Some attending said Mr Perot had promised financial assistance
to the continuing effort, but others reported that his commitment was vague.
Most of his remarks were broadcast on the Larry King Live programme on Cable
News Network, the vehicle he had used to launch his efforts earlier in the
year.
Mr Perot seemed positively liberated to be talking to his friendly host,
free from the presence of hostile journalists and the professional political
advisers he had imported and then mostly ignored.
Two of them - Mr Ed Rollins and Mr Hamilton Jordan - have begun to paint a
picture of an extraordinarily disorganised and amateur effort, in which all
decisions were taken or ducked by Mr Perot alone.
Mr Perot, they said, only seemed comfortable on talk shows and in rallies
surrounded by his faithful. They warned him that this was an illusion and
that other fringe candidates - for instance, the Rev Pat Robertson four
years ago - also drew large crowds at the outset. But Mr Perot resisted all
attempts to have his image and arguments professionally burnished.
Mr King, the most prominent of the talk show hosts, seemed almost distressed
that Mr Perot had withdrawn and on several occasions virtually begged him to
reconsider. It may or may not be relevant that Mr Perot's frequent
appearances have done wonders for the show's ratings.
Several callers, however, expressed their disappointment and sense of
betrayal that he had backed out, though others were wide-eyed with
enthusiasm at the prospect of a new and different effort. One of them was
the entertainer Cher, who said she would stay involved 'as long as I know
you won't quit'.
The campaigns of President George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
nominee who has surged ahead in the polls, were still wooing Perot
supporters furiously over the weekend.
Even Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-president who a month ago was calling Mr Perot
'a temperamental tycoon with contempt for the constitution', had only kind
words to say.
Both are operating on the assumption that, no matter what he says to his
faithful flock, Mr Perot cannot come back. There is no recent record of this
happening in the space of an election year. Senator Gary Hart tried to do so
four years ago after dropping out, and Mr Paul Tsongas allowed his name to
remain on Democratic primary ballots this year after he suspended his
campaign, but to no avail.
However, in focusing on economic issues, especially the budget deficit and
the national debt, Mr Perot has at least lent his name, though typically not
the responsibility for his actions, to a cause which has other powerful
advocates.
Senators Warren Rudman and John Danforth, both Republicans, and Mr Tsongas
on the Democratic side are continuing to exert pressure on Mr Bush and Mr
Clinton to be more specific about their deficit reduction ideas. Both
candidates may face a decisive televised debate devoted to this issue, at
least if Mr Danforth has his way.
But Mr Perot's commitment to this cause must remain suspect for the simple
reason that he refused to let it be published while he was still an
official, if undeclared, candidate. He had promised early in May that it
would be ready in 60 days, but when he quit in the third week of July its
contents were still unknown.
It seems as though he had worked out it would be so unpopular as to damage
fatally his chances, which were already dwindling. Mr Jordan admitted it
would have created 'a firestorm' when made public, probably consuming in the
process Mr Perot.
He pre-empted that probability by withdrawing, which lessens the realistic
chances of his 'army of patriots' being more than a marginal force in the
remaining three and a half months of the campaign.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Foreign banks seek talks on Efim loans: Italian government's
stance criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S foreign bankers' association (Aibe) is seeking an urgent meeting
with the government to discuss the status of some L3,000bn (Pounds 1.4bn) of
loans extended to Efim, the state industrial holding group ordered to be
wound up last Friday.
A banker heading one syndicate of foreign banks owed money by an Efim
subsidiary voiced concern over the lack of consultation with bankers. By the
end of the last week, he said, no banks had been 'contacted at all by Efim
or the Treasury. It is all very unsatisfactory.'
According to unofficial versions of a decree to be published today, Efim's
debts and those of its 80 subsidiaries, totalling L8,500bn, will be frozen
for a maximum of two years. The decree also says the Treasury has the
discretion to limit the freeze on debt payments for individual companies to
a period 'no greater than 18 months'.
Mr Giuliano Amato, prime minister, talked on Friday of the freeze being 'no
less than one year'.
The government has not formally justified the freeze but the group is
believed to have negative net worth. Mr Alberto Predieri, the new
administrator of Efim, will need time to value the group and determine the
fate of its subsidiaries. Mediobanca and Warburgs have been engaged as
advisers on the valuations.
Efim's long-awaited liquidation is part of the new Amato government's
radical approach to reorganising the Italian public sector.
According to the decree, creditors will be offered in 1993 government paper
denominated either in lire or Ecu with a ceiling of L4,000bn. The interest
will be determined by the Treasury but the decree says that, beginning in
1994, the service costs of this paper will be L720bn.
It is understood that at least six syndicated foreign loans - four in Ecu
and two in yen - have been extended to Efim and its subsidiaries. Japanese
institutions, including Mitsubishi Bank, are believed to be among the most
exposed. However, Chemical Bank recently organised a private Dollars 300m
(Pounds 157m) placement.
Foreign bankers are still angry about the collapse last year of
Federconsorzi, an agricultural co-operative with indirect government
backing. 'They frankly have to get this one right otherwise Italy will be no
better than an Argentina or a Brazil,' a banker said.
The administrator has 90 days in which to prepare a report on how the group
is to be liquidated. The main loss-making sectors are aluminium (Alumix) and
glass (Siv).

FT  20 JUL 92 / Battle with Aids 'at impasse'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE worldwide Aids epidemic is racing ahead while the international response
has stalled, 11,000 delegates to the seventh world conference on the disease
heard last night.
Dr Jonathan Mann, conference chairman, told the opening session of the
week-long meeting in Amsterdam: 'The global effort against Aids has reached
a dangerous impasse.
'A realistic analysis reveals that the gap between the expanding epidemic
and lagging national and international response is growing rapidly, leaving
the world more vulnerable to the spread of Aids.'
The Harvard Aids Institute in the US, which Dr Mann directs, has just
completed an independent analysis of the epidemic. It predicts that the
number of people infected with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, will rise
from about 13m now to 20m by 1995 and somewhere between 50m and 120m -
including more than 10m children - in the year 2000.
The latest official prediction from the World Health Organisation is only
slightly less alarming. It predicts that 30m to 40m men, women and children
will have been infected by the turn of the century. About 60 per cent of the
adults are expected to develop full-scale Aids within 12 years of infection.
As Dr Joost Ruitenberg, conference co-chairman, noted: 'The developing world
is increasingly bearing the burden of the HIV/Aids pandemic, accounting for
approximately 80 per cent of the world's HIV infections.'
The virus is racing through Asia. Dr Max Essex, of the Harvard School of
Public Health, who is chairing the conference's scientific programme, said
the fastest heterosexual spread seemed to be in northern Thailand - perhaps
because a new and virulent HIV strain had evolved there.
No one is expecting any dramatic scientific or medical breakthroughs to be
announced in Amsterdam this week, although with more than 960 speakers
scheduled for conference sessions there is bound to be some progress.
One area where hopes are relatively high is vaccine development; 15 HIV
vaccines are currently undergoing early clinical trials in human volunteers.
The meeting will hear of long-term research into 'gene therapy' - using a
genetic approach to attack HIV.
 - Greater emphasis is also to be placed on social approaches to the
disease.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAFIA intensified its intimidation campaign against the Italian
judiciary yesterday by assassinating Mr Paolo Borsellino, the most senior
magistrate fighting organised crime.
He and five bodyguards were killed by a huge car bomb in Palermo, capital of
Sicily. At least 15 people were injured.
Mr Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, promised a tough response to
those who were 'at war with with the state'. He said: 'I am certain that the
government, parliament and judiciary will respond with the necessary unity
of intention and strength.'
Last night Italy's three biggest trade unions called a general strike in
Sicily for the day the victims are buried.
Mr Borsellino was leaving a block of flats after visiting his mother when
the bomb, planted in a Fiat 600, was detonated. Police said more casualties
would have occurred had it not been a Sunday afternoon when the city was
largely deserted.
This was the second time in two months that the Mafia had struck in a
spectacular manner against the judiciary.
On May 23, Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading figure behind the judiciary's
fight against the power of the Mafia throughout the 1980s, was assassinated
with his wife and three bodyguards.
Mr Borsellino, who was Mr Falcone's closest friend, was widely seen as the
main candidate to become Italy's new 'super-magistrate' dealing specifically
with organised crime. The new Amato government had pledged to make the fight
against organised crime a priority but the Mafia struck at a time when the
government's attention was focused on deteriorating public finances.
Significantly, the Falcone assassination also occurred at a delicate moment
when parliament was dithering over who to elect as Italy's next president.
For several days the authorities in Sicily have been in a state of alert
over the possibility of an attempt on the life of a prominent public figure.
Mr Borsellino said after the Falcone killing that he was aware he was in the
sights of the Mafia. The Mafia had never forgiven him, along with Mr
Falcone, for initiating the important trials of the 1980s, which
demonstrated that the Mafia was a well-structured organisation of criminal
families.
Yesterday Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, urged Mr Amato to call
an extraordinary session of parliament to push through anti-Mafia measures
approved by cabinet last month.

MR JAMES BAKER said in Jerusalem last night that he was optimistic about
progress in Middle East talks and welcomed moves by Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin to curb Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
After talks with Mr Rabin, the US secretary of state struck an upbeat note
which contrasted with the tense relations between the US and the previous
Israeli government led by Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
Mr Baker signalled a shift in Washington's attitude to Israel's request for
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees, hitherto blocked because
of Mr Shamir's refusal to stop settlements.
'I share what I believe is your optimism for the opportunity of moving
forward in the peace process,' he said as he stood alongside Mr Rabin, who
has promised to accelerate the US-brokered negotiations begun last October
in Madrid.
Mr Rabin thanked the US for its readiness to take part in the acceleration
of the peace process and 'the improvement in relations between the two
countries'.
In a further move to advance the talks, Mr Rabin is to fly to Cairo tomorrow
to meet President Hosni Mubarak, in what will be the first meeting since
1986 between the leaders of Israel and Egypt. Mr Baker will today have
further talks with Israeli officials and will meet Palestinian leaders in
Jerusalem before travelling to Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia this
week.
At its first cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Rabin's Labour-led government
decided to halt the establishment - pending review - of some 10 Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories. Last week, the housing ministry
temporarily froze unsigned contracts for new building in existing
settlements while a similar review was conducted.
Although he has stopped short of a complete freeze, Mr Rabin hopes his
gesture will win the US loan guarantees needed to help Israel finance the
absorption of mass migration from the former Soviet Union, and facilitate
progress in Middle East talks. Washington and the Arabs regard settlement
expansion as an obstacle to peace.
Mr Baker said: 'Let me say it will make a big difference, certainly with
respect to the views and positions of the US. I am quite confident that we
will be able to make the point with the Arab countries and Arab
representatives that we now have a government here that is serious about
limiting this question with regard to the settlements.'
However, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian peace team that will
meet Mr Baker on Monday, said: 'We think that all settlements have to stop
and are illegal, and if we are to maintain the integrity of the peace
process, then all settlement activities must come to a halt.'
Mr Baker, whose meeting with Mr Rabin was picketed by rightwing
demonstrators opposed to the peace process, spent 90 minutes with Mr Rabin
immediately after arriving in Jerusalem.
The meeting was the start of Mr Baker's five-nation trip to revitalise the
Middle East talks. He said that while no date had been set the talks were
expected to resume in Rome in September.

MORTAR and machine gun fire echoed through Sarajevo last night, indicating
that warring factions in the Bosnian capital had ignored a ceasefire
negotiated by the European Community.
The fighting persisted several hours after the deadline of 6pm set for the
truce between the three main ethnic groups of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. It
came as Mr Milan Panic, the new prime minister of Yugoslavia  - comprising
Serbia and Montenegro - made a hastily arranged visit to Sarajevo.
Bosnian radio, which also reported renewed clashes around Tuzla and Jajce,
north of Sarajevo, said the mortar attacks had pinned down Mr Panic at the
United Nations headquarters after talks with Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
president of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Panic offered to start immediate peace talks with Bosnian leaders to end
the four-month war in Bosnia.
After almost three hours of talks with Mr Izetbegovic, he said the Yugoslav
and Serb side was ready to end 'this stupid, unbelievable, unconscionable
war'.
He said he had given Mr Izetbegovic 'a very short time to reply' and that,
if he did not agree, the world would know which side wanted to continue the
war.
Mr Panic's peace mission follows the imposition on May 31 of tough UN
sanctions on Yugoslavia in retaliation for backing Serb militia in Bosnia.
Fighting between Serbs and mostly Moslem forces loyal to the Bosnian
government yesterday continued in Gorazde, eastern Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo
said civilians and Bosnian forces had suffered heavy casualties.
Around 70,000 people are reported to have been trapped in Gorazde, which for
three months has been surrounded by Serb militia and entirely cut off from
the outside world. Gorazde is the region's last Moslem stronghold.
The EC-sponsored ceasefire was intended to last at least 14 days, allowing
time for all three sides to hand over heavy artillery to UN peacekeepers. It
also calls for some 1.2m refugees to be allowed to return home.
Mr Panic said his peace mission had the backing of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
militant leader of Bosnia's Serbs.
The 62-year-old California millionaire who has US-Yugoslav dual nationality
was due to travel to New York yesterday to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary general.
During a visit at the weekend to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Douglas
Hurd, foreign secretary, called the ceasefire agreement 'a testing point'.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Treasury may act over savings: Building societies blame
government for heavy outflow of deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES are step-ping up pressure on the government to make
National Savings products less competitive after suffering their second
biggest monthly outflow of deposits ever in June.
In response to warnings by societies that competition from National Savings
could force them to push up both their savings and mortgage rates, the
Treasury said it was considering whether to cut the rate offered on its
highly successful First Option Bond, launched two weeks ago. A Treasury
official said: 'The rates are under continuous review in the light of market
developments and we could not speculate on if and when rates might change.'
The Building Societies Association will announce on Wednesday that Pounds
315m flowed out of their savings accounts last month.
Leading building societies blamed the government's campaign to attract funds
into National Savings investments.
'If we have to go on competing with the (National Savings) rates that are
out there, mortgage interest rates are going to have to go up,' said Mr
David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial building society,
the seventh largest.
He said his society would decide whether to increase its mortgage rate in
'the next 10 days'.
On Friday, the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth biggest society, raised
its home loans rate from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent. The Alliance &amp;
Leicester, the fourth biggest society, will decide in the next two days
whether to follow suit.
The Treasury said yesterday it had no plans to withdraw its popular new
First Options Bond, despite the threat posed by it to mortgage rates.
It attracted Pounds 112m during the nine days since it became available on
July 7, an unusually high amount for any new savings product.
The bond competes directly with building societies by offering a one-year
investment with basic rate tax deducted.
Its current gross interest rate, of 10.34 per cent, is superior to any
directly comparable building society product.
National Savings said yesterday that in June, before the First Option Bond
launch, its products attracted Pounds 218m of net new investment - Pounds
131m lower than the figures for May but significantly better than the
previous June.
Since the beginning of the year, National Savings has been promoting its
products heavily.
Mr Mark Boleat, chairman of the Building Societies Association, said: 'The
government is well aware of the nature of the problem.' But he pointed out
that the government was under great pressure to fund its borrowing
requirement.
A withdrawal of the bond - or any change in the interest rate to make it
less attractive - would cause difficulties to the government, he said.
Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, said: 'Mortgage
lenders are in for a further difficult period'. He warned that a continuing
recession in the housing market would lead to the collapse of construction
companies.
Halifax, the biggest provider of mortgages in the UK, said: 'We do not want
to do anything which would cause difficulty for the housing market, and at
the moment we have no immediate intention of raising mortgage rates.'
Only once has the outflow of deposits from building societies been greater.
That was in September 1986, when savers withdrew funds to invest in the TSB
flotation.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Wobbly dollar is no big deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gulf between US and European attitudes towards exchange rates is so
broad as sometimes to seem unbridgeable. The dollar's recent weakness has
received scant coverage in the American press - at best short stories on the
business pages. The German discount rate increase, for example, not only
failed to make the front pages of the New York Times or Washington Post; it
was not even in their lengthy inside news summaries. If you failed to turn
to the business sections, you missed it altogether.
The Democratic convention was admittedly monopolising the public's
attention. But even on an ordinary day little would be made of a decision by
the Bundesbank. Few Americans know or care what the dollar is worth in terms
of other currencies. They certainly do not expect fluctuations on the
foreign exchanges to have much impact on domestic economic policy. Americans
would be stunned if the Federal Reserve - the central bank - were to
announce that it had to raise interest rates in order to defend the dollar.
On Main Street, the Fed's sole task is seen as bolstering the flagging
economic recovery.
In US financial markets, similar attitudes prevail. On a tour of Wall Street
last week, every analyst I consulted expressed concern that the domestic
recovery might be losing momentum. All anticipated further dollar weakness
but none saw this as a cause for great concern.
Even the Fed seems unusually relaxed: the most recent published minutes of
its policy-making open market committee barely mentioned the dollar. Mr Alan
Greenspan, the chairman, is likely to refer to exchange rate movements in
his biannual Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony on Tuesday, but he can
hardly deny that the Fed has so far focused almost exclusively on the needs
of the domestic economy.
Having grown accustomed to US indifference to exchange rates, it can be hard
to grasp what a different world the UK inhabits. It seems incredible that
minute movements of sterling within the EMS can send shock waves through
British society. Two decades after the world's biggest economies opted for
floating exchange rates, the sight of Mr John Major, the prime minister,
solemnly ruling out devaluation seems oddly old-fashioned. It reminds me of
the 1960s and Harold Wilson's valiant - but ultimately doomed - fight to
avoid the humiliation of devaluation. In the US, few people regard the
exchange rate as a symbol of national virility; the attitude, rather, is
that if the dollar drifts lower against the D-Mark and yen, US exporters
will gain a welcome edge in overseas markets.
What accounts for this striking difference in attitudes? The US psychology
is different partly because Americans have been owners of the world's only
viable international currency for half a century. The dollar, they point
out, is still overwhelmingly the most popular unit of account and store of
value in global transactions. The US can borrow apparently limitless sums
without taking on a currency risk. In a real sense, therefore, American
insouciance about the dollar's value in terms of lesser currencies is
justified. At the same time, the biggest potential disadvantage of a
depreciating currency - accelerating inflation - is rarely perceived as a
serious risk.
The relaxed attitude towards the inflationary consequences of dollar
depreciation is justified in two ways. In the first place the US is a huge,
continental economy in which trade still plays a relatively minor role.
Exports and imports account for only 10.5 per cent and 10.9 per cent
respectively of US gross domestic product, compared with ratios of closer to
a third in the UK. This means that increases in the prices of imports have
only a small impact on the overall price level. In addition the US has the
world's most competitive labour market - reflecting both the weakness of
unions and its willingness to permit immigration of low paid workers. The
British assumption that depreciation will be automatically dissipated in
higher pay awards does not apply: with most categories of workers
experiencing steady falls in real wages, depreciation is more likely to lead
to higher profits and investment.
Look at what has happened since 1985, say American economists. The dollar's
plunge against the D-Mark and yen did not set off an inflationary spiral. On
the contrary, exports surged, imports began to level off and the trade
deficit narrowed sharply. The conclusion is that a little more of the same
medicine will do no harm.
Americans and Europeans seem destined to continue misunderstanding each
other. The US is quite comfortable with a floating exchange rate: it is hard
to imagine circumstances in which US monetary policy would be tightened
ahead of the November election. When the Fed does eventually tighten, it
will be moving mainly in response to its assessment of domestic inflationary
pressures. Europeans are likely fully to understand America's carefree
attitude to the dollar only if they finally achieve economic and monetary
union. Trade would then be a relatively minor component of the integrated
European economy. And Europe's currency would be mighty on the world stage.
In the fullness of time, London may be as blithely indifferent to exchange
rates as the capitals of Nebraska or Arkansas.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Europe's timely champion - Nicolas Hayek,
chairman of SMH watch company, talks to Ian Rodger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not easy these days to champion the cause of European manufacturing of
consumer products.
Philips' warning last month of serious problems in its consumer electronics
division comes after years of bad news from European makers of motorcycles,
cameras and cars, all adding to the view that Europeans can no longer
compete in these product areas with low-cost competitors from the Far East.
Nicolas Hayek is in the rare position of being able to refute the
Cassandras. Hayek, a Swiss consultant to European and US manufacturers such
as Siemens, AEG Telefunken, Olivetti, Deere, and US Steel, since the early
1960s, masterminded the rescue of the Swiss watch industry in the 1980s. And
he did it by taking on and beating the dominant Japanese competitors at
their own game - attacking the low-margin, cost-sensitive mass market.
For Hayek, reviving the Swiss watch industry was simply a matter of proving
what he had long believed. 'No other area in the world is as rich in highly
gifted people as western Europe. If we use our people well, we can always
make high-quality, low-cost consumer products and make them better than
people in Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea or Japan.'
On the other hand, he warns: 'If we lose our know-how to make products, then
we will lose our financial independence. And if you lose your financial
independence, you lose every other kind of independence.'
Although he grew up in Switzerland and has worked all his life there, Hayek,
whose mother was Lebanese, father American, bears little resemblance to the
reserved, correct businessmen normally associated with the country.
He wears wrinkled, shapeless suits over ill-fitting shirts and flamboyant
neckties, sports at least one watch on each wrist and puffs away at huge
cigars or a pipe. Whereas many Swiss businessmen shrink from publicity, he
delights in transmitting his often obscure ideas and startling opinions at
the drop of a microphone.
In 1981, he was called in by the Swiss banks to rescue the two most
important companies in the country's cherished but fast-declining watch
industry, Asuag and SSIH. These two were important not only because of their
size and because they made finished watches that carried famous brand names
such as Omega, Longines and Tissot, but also because they supplied large
numbers of components and fully assembled watch mechanisms, or movements,
for sale to other watchmakers in Switzerland and around the world.
Thus, their dilatory introduction of quartz and electronic technologies in
the 1970s, which enabled the more nimble Japanese makers to make huge gains
in world markets, especially of high-volume, low-priced models, undermined a
large part of the Swiss industry. Swiss exports of watches and watch
movements crashed from a peak of 91m units in 1974 to only 43m in 1983.
This pattern had been seen in other European consumer product industries,
and the solution most frequently chosen was to retreat to up-market or
specialised niches. Hayek, who had counselled many companies against that
strategy, had his chance to prove they were wrong.
At SSIH and Asuag, which he later merged into a group called SMH, the main
challenge was to overcome the disadvantage of Switzerland's high wages.
Hayek did it by designing watches with a drastically reduced number of
components. Also, he ordered that different models should, wherever
possible, use common parts. And, with the banks' support, he invested
heavily in assembly automation.
At first, most of this effort was concentrated on the Swatch, a line of
cheap and cheerful watches introduced in the autumn of 1982 that would
become one of the great marketing success stories of the 1980s. Swatches
feature plastic straps and mountings in various colours. Models with new
face designs, from the elegant to the outrageous, emerge every few months.
At roughly Pounds 20 apiece, Swatches are accessible to all and seem to be
acceptable to many.
SMH has sold more than 100m Swatches since their introduction, making it the
best-selling watch line in history. Perhaps as important, many of the
disciplines and innovations that went into its success could be transmitted
to factories making the group's up-market brands, thereby improving margins
on them and freeing up funds to bolster their marketing. Also, the high
production volume of movements required for Swatches yielded economies of
scale that have enabled SMH in the past two years to compete profitably in
world markets for movements.
The result: Swiss watch and movement exports last year surpassed their 1974
peak level and SMH became one of Switzerland's most successful industrial
companies with net profits of SFr252m. This year, it is set to overtake
Citizen of Japan to become the world's largest producer of watches and watch
movements.
Hayek believes that the SMH experience is transferable to other consumer
products. He says most Japanese managers do not understand how to put what
he calls 'messages of emotion' in their products, which may have an image
but nothing more, he claims.
'If you take Playboy magazine and see a pretty girl in it, that is an image.
You may like it, but if you show it to your wife or to a man who likes men,
they might react differently.
'But if that girl were here giving one message, if the message was clear,
differentiated, intelligent and not too long, she could give all of us the
same message. This is what I call the message of the brand.'
Hayek refuses to explain this beguiling analogy further because, he says, he
does not want to make things easier for his Japanese competitors.
Armed with confidence in his marketing skill, Hayek has perhaps inevitably
begun to think of producing other consumer products himself. SMH has
diversified into personal telecoms products, making a Swatchphone and a
Swatch wristwatch pager. But his most audacious project to date is a joint
venture with Volkswagen, the German car maker, to make an environmentally
friendly car. The project was announced two years ago with considerable
fanfare and an appeal for inventors to contribute ideas, but details of the
car's design have been kept secret.
Hayek originally said he would unveil a prototype this year, but he has
changed his mind, claiming that such a move would give away some of the
ideas to competitors. He says he will reveal the real thing in 1996.
Is this hubris? Would he, wearing his consultant's hat, endorse a plan by a
watch company to make a car? 'If they had the people, yes. Making a car is
not a difficult thing because the basic technology has not changed in 50
years.'
His appeal in the media two years ago raised Hayek's profile in Switzerland
and abroad. He makes no apology for devoting much of his time to interviews.
The biggest challenge for management today, he says, is communicating.
'Europe has had a fantastic boom in the past 50 years, but we have created
very rigid structures in our societies. Bankers and businessmen no longer
like to take risks. So we have to be very strong communicators and convince
the people around us of the value of our ideas.'
He has also embraced the environmental cause and last March addressed the
United Nations general assembly preparatory session for the Rio summit on
the global environment.
'Each one of us has a responsibility. Because I am an entrepreneur, I have
more resources and capability to change things than politicians who talk
very much and do very little. That is why we started with the car two years
ago. That is why we are going to sell watches without packaging.'
Like most Swiss industrialists, he is eager to see Switzerland join the
European Community. But whereas most say joining would be good for
Switzerland, Hayek emphasises what Switzerland can do for the EC.
'I think Europe has to be constructed according to a Swiss model. That is
the only way it can work and survive. With all these different cultures and
languages, it would be a catastrophe to go the centralised way.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / European Law: A code for EC lobbying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND S CALAMARO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A key committee of the European Parliament is considering a report
containing proposals aimed at 'laying down rules governing the
representation of special interest groups at the European Parliament'. In
other words, the EC Parliament will consider regulating lobbying. Lobbying -
which could be generally defined as the influencing of legislative,
regulatory and political decision-making - is one of the ways in which the
governed communicate with government and is very serious business in the EC.
The report marks the beginning of an important debate within the EC, a
debate whose outcome will determine no less than the integrity and
effectiveness of the European Community's law-making processes. While it
technically addresses lobbying of the EC Parliament only, the EC Commission
has also begun to consider this subject, and the debate in one body will
undoubtedly be heard in the other.
The title of the report is a bit too modest, for while it refers only to
'special interest groups' (one imagines truffle producers or vinegar
bottlers), it actually applies as well to general interest groups such as
associations of labour unions, manufacturers, employers and others. The
primary author and 'rapporteur' of the report is Marc Galle, MEP, a courtly
former literature professor whose gracious manner belies his canny wisdom.
Mr Galle, a Belgian, was confronted with two main questions: should
lobbyists be required to be 'registered', and should there be a code of
conduct applied to lobbyists? While it still faces many changes and
amendments, the report answers both these basic questions in the
affirmative. It does not actually propose a code, only that one be drawn up,
with input from lobbyists.
At its worst, such a code of conduct could isolate decision makers from
lobbyists or, at the other extreme, allow lobbyists to exert improper
influence. At its best, the code could steer the EC away from the sort of
seamy system that now exists in the US, where the giving of money is
intertwined with the exertion of influence over legislation.
Drawing on some years of experience in both Washington and Brussels, I would
offer the EC Parliament, and eventually the EC Commission, these suggestions
for a lobbying code: Distinguish between obtaining information and lobbying;
only the latter should be subject to registration, a code or any regulation
whatsoever.
Information in the EC - for example, the status of a directive, the
scheduling of an official meeting, the text of an official document - should
either be public or confidential. If it is public, anyone who asks should be
able to obtain it. It should not be given, as is now often the case, to
lobbyists or some lobbyists, based on who their friends are. If information
is confidential, it should be made available to no one outside the EC
offices working on the matter.
Have a clear definition of what constitutes lobbying, thus requiring
registration and code compliance.
Here again, the EC should avoid the US experience of having a law (in the US
it is the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946) with so many
uncertainties that it is virtually unenforceable and unenforced.
Distinguish between being paid to lobby, by an employer or a client, and
lobbying out of personal interest.
Here, the US experience is positively instructive, since there is a
constitutional protection of the right to petition the government. Ordinary
people in Europe should be encouraged to lobby the EC and should face no
restrictions.
Impose a clear separation between lobbying and the giving of money or
anything else or value.
One could argue whether inviting an MEP or EC official to lunch or dinner is
corrupting. As long as a particular lobbyist does not consistently entertain
a particular official who has authority over a matter the lobbyist is
working on, I do not think so. But the real question here has to do with
lobbyists paying MEPs, their assistants or other EC officials, be it
outright or under some form of employment or consulting contract, or making
other gifts that are of greater than nominal value.
Have rules that will reveal generally which principal is lobbying what
issue, but do not impose such stringent, bureaucratic or vague requirements
as to constitute a barrier to proper lobbying. Lobbying should be a right,
and the public should have a similar right to know generally who is lobbying
on what.
Here, Mr Galle's report sounds the right note, explicitly seeking to ensure
that 'lobbying is transparent (and) that various lobbying groups are placed
on an equal footing'. Another US law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act of
1938, has the opposite problem from the 1946 Lobbying Act: it requires so
much detail that it has often been criticised as being unduly burdensome.
Do not discriminate between lobbyists from the EC versus those from without.
Doing so would be a form of protectionism and could invite damaging
retaliation. To the extent such limitations exist outside the EC, the EC
should use the present process as leverage to get those limitations removed.
The author, partner in charge of the Brussels office of the law firm
Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts, was US deputy assistant
attorney-general for legislative affairs, 1977-79.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Is the worst over?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW in the markets now believe that there will be a narrowing of the
short-term interest rate differential between Germany and the US until the
fourth quarter, writes James Blitz.
That was the fundamental lesson of last week. The discount rate rise, though
symbolic, is a sign that German short term rates will stay high for the
remainder of 1992. At the same time, indicators like last week's fall in
June housing starts by 3.2 per cent make it even less likely that there will
be a rise in US rates. The yawning rate differential makes the cost of
holding dollars too great and may push the currency down to its all time low
of DM1.4430 soon.
The main debate now is whether the Bundesbank needs to tighten policy even
further by raising the Lombard rate. Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS believes the
worst is over and that, by the time the Bundesbank next meets, it will have
good figures on money supply and inflation. He also believes that weak
indicators on German production and growth will force the Bundesbank to ease
policy in the fourth quarter.
Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi International thinks a Lombard rate rise is
still possible. While the next set of inflation figures, for July, should
bring the annualised rate down to 3.5 per cent, he thinks that the
Bundesbank will continue to fret about the inflationary phenomena to come.
These include the projected rise in VAT from 14 per cent to 15 per cent,
increased petrol taxes, and what could be another difficult wage round.
The figure for June M3 money supply, which should appear on Friday, will be
the first indication of who is winning this debate.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading local schools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
School rebuilding contracts worth altogether nearly Pounds 4m have been won
by TAYLOR WOODROW companies in Leeds and London.
In Leeds, Taylor Woodrow Construction Northern has been awarded two design
and management contracts by the city council, totalling some Pounds 2.7m, to
increase accommodation at two local schools as part of an education
reorganisation programme.
At City of London School for Girls, Myton is undertaking a Pounds l2m
contract for alterations and refurbishment.
The larger of the Leeds contracts, at just under Pounds l9m, involves
building work at Temple Moor High School, Field End Grove, comprising extra
classrooms, music rooms, sixth-form facilities, staff offices and dining
hall in a two-storey complex. Facilities are being remodelled to create a
new drama centre, classrooms and new laboratories.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: M4 motorway scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRU CTION is to undertake a Pounds 19.7m contract for the
construction of the M4 motorway between Baglan and Briton Ferry in West
Glamorgan for the Welsh Office Highways Directorate.
This is the last of three contracts to be let between Baglan and Lon-Las to
complete the motorway between Pont Abraham, Dyfed and London.
The roadworks consist of the construction of about three kilometres of dual
two-lane motorway and about one kilometre of slip roads. The project also
includes the construction of about 300 metres of dual 7.3 metre-wide side
road over the main South Wales railway line.
At the western end, the new motorway will connect with the Briton Ferry to
Earlswood section, which is currently under construction, and its eastern
end will connect with the existing motorway on the Port Talbot bypass near
the end of the Llywelyn Street viaduct.
Temporary traffic management measures will be introduced during the contract
period where the new motorway and slip roads join the existing motorway.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Economics: Signals from Germany set to steer UK interest
rate debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RAFT of UK economic statistics will provide ammunition for all camps in
the ongoing debate over the course of British economic policy. But the most
important signals for the future course of British and European interest
rates will come from Germany.
Today's monetary data are likely to provide grist to the mill of the
government's monetarist critics. Broad money growth in June is not expected
to show signs of accelerating, year on year, from sluggish levels. The
government's favoured indicator - M0 - is expected to slow slightly to an
annual growth rate of 1.8 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in May.
Market operators will also be watching Wednesday's trade figures to see
whether a further upward lurch in the visible trade deficit will adversely
affect sterling's weak position within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The June trade deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 1bn, up Pounds 0.15m
from May.
Government officials and managers, anxious for evidence that the economic
recovery is under way, will have much material to pick over, including
today's distributive trades survey and the June retail sales figures -
expected to be just above May's disappointing level. The best indicator of
UK businesses' expectations will be the quarterly survey of the British
Chambers of Commerce on Thursday.
Yet the week's most important news will come from Germany, where the gloom
aroused by the continued rapid growth of broad money may be compounded by
high producer and cost of living inflation. The Bundesbank will need to see
signs of moderation on all these fronts before the risk of higher German,
and therefore European, interest rates can be discounted. Elsewhere in
Europe, analysts are expecting a French trade surplus of FFr2.5bn in June,
FFr2bn down on May but continuing this year's trend of small surpluses after
years of deficits.
The two US presidential candidates will be more interested in domestic news.
A batch of economic data, particularly durable goods orders and auto sales,
will provide clues as to whether Mr Bush can expect a pre-election recovery.
The following highlights of this week's releases of economic data include
the median of forecasts in brackets provided by financial information group
MMS International.
Today: UK, CBI July Distributive Trades Survey, June monetary aggregates (M0
up 1.8 per cent on year, M4 up 5.1 per cent on year, M4 lending Pounds

RESULTS DUE
Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news company, is expected to
report tomorrow a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 187m for the
six months to June 30.
Most interest will focus on the group's two most recently launched financial
products. The second phase of Dealing 2000, the group's automated foreign
exchange trading system, finally started in April, while last month saw the
launch of Globex, its long-delayed international after-hours screen trading
system for futures and options.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, reports
second-quarter results tomorrow. After weeks of focusing on Wellcome and its
share offer, analysts have been dusting off their SB files. Estimates for
pre-tax profits range from Pounds 246m to Pounds 258m, compared with Pounds
230m for the period last year.
They will looking particularly at the rate of growth of Relafen, SB's
arthritis drug, and how Kytril, its anti-nausea medicine is competing with
Glaxo's Zofran. Few signs of growth in the consumer businesses are expected.
John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retailer and newspaper wholesaler, is
expected to report today pre-tax profits of about Pounds 23m for the
year-ended April, little changed from last year's Pounds 21.5m after Pounds
4m of exceptional charges.
Wholesaling has held up well but retailing has failed to show concrete
improvement. Problems persist with its Early Learning Centre business in the
US. Further provisions are expected and its sale is likely.
Greycoat,the property developer, is likely to report on Thursday a full-year
loss of about Pounds 7m, a big improvement on the previous year's Pounds
38.5m after Pounds 64m of provisions.
First Technology, the maker of sensors and crash dummies, appears to have
survived a nasty financial mishap. From a loss of Pounds 3m, it is likely to
have done better than break even for the latest year when it reports on
Thursday.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Bonds: NatWest securitisation move marks new
era for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank's announcement that it will sell part of its
corporate loan book through the US securities market could mark the start of
a new phase of innovation by European banks.
The technique, called securitisation, is by no means new to European
financial institutions. Mortgage lenders have been securitising home loans
since the early 1980s - the sterling mortgage-backed bond market amounts to
around Pounds 10bn.
Other financial assets such as car loans have also been repackaged and sold
in the form of securities.
However, NatWest will become the first UK bank to securitise loans to
companies. According to experts in structured finance, other types of
financial asset will be securitised soon in Europe.
'Mortgage lending has slowed dramatically so there is less pressure to
securitise mortgages. Banks are turning their attention to securitising
other types of asset,' commented Mr Steve Din, structured finance analyst at
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, in London.
Other than commercial bank loans, trade receivables - debt owed to non-bank
companies in the normal course of trading - and leases are the most likely
candidates for securitisation.
Earlier this year GPA, the aircraft finance company which recently cancelled
its planned flotation, made a pioneering issue of bonds backed by aircraft
leases.
Securitisation of leases on 'small ticket' items - anything from coffee
machines to photocopiers - is also possible.
On April 30, the Bank of England issued new regulations for the
securitisation of credit card receivables, opening the way for banks to
securitise another category of risk assets.
The theory behind securitisation is simple: risk is transferred from the
holder of a financial asset, such as a loan or a lease, to the holders of
securities backed by that asset.
Since the risk is transferred, the original lender can remove the asset from
its balance sheet. In addition, it raises cheap finance by issuing secured
bonds which can be used to fund new loans.
The drawback is that securitising assets is a complex and expensive process.
The NatWest structure involves a Delaware-based special purpose vehicle
buying sub-participations in corporate loans from the bank, via a Cayman
Islands subsidiary. The special purpose company, Thames Funding, will then
issue commercial paper backed by the loans.
It is a matter for debate whether corporate borrowers should be concerned
that their loans are being securitised.
NatWest said last week that informal discussions with companies revealed no
objections to the idea.
After all, banks already sell loans in the secondary market - in Europe
usually by selling sub-participations to other banks. The NatWest
securitisation works on the same principle, except that the risk is
transferred one stage further by the issue of asset-backed commercial paper.
However, not all corporate treasurers take a favourable view of either the
secondary market in loans or securitisation. Some large UK companies specify
in their terms of borrowing that the lender must not sell sub-participations
to other banks.
One concern is that the company can end up dealing with a large number of
banks which it did not even know were lenders.
'A company goes to a big bank because it wants a relationship. If sell-down
isn't handled very carefully a simple bilateral loan can come to resemble a
complex multi-option facility,' said the treasurer of one large UK
industrial company.
Although the commercial paper issued by Thames Funding will be issued in the
US and is denominated in dollars, NatWest has the option of securitising
loans made in sterling or other European currencies, so long as the currency
risk is fully hedged.
Loans to up to 10 nominated companies can be securitised through Thames
Funding, although NatWest does not intend to announce which companies are
involved.
The commercial paper has been rated A-1 by S&amp;P and P-1 by Moody's Investors
Service, on the grounds that all of the 10 companies in the securitisation
pool also carry this top short-term rating.
This suggests that NatWest will choose to securitise low margin loans to big
corporations, liberating capital to make new loans at a higher margin.
There are some complications. For example, if a company repays one of the
loans early, NatWest must bridge the gap until the matching commercial paper
is retired.
The maximum maturity of commercial paper under the programme is 95 days, so
in the worst case NatWest might have to pay interest on CP for three months
while receiving no income from the underlying loan.
Despite the cost of setting up the structure and some of the hidden risks,
NatWest concluded that securitising corporate loans was worth the
investment. Faced with similar circumstances, other European banks are
likely to reach the same conclusion.
Certainly every UK clearing bank has a team of corporate financiers looking
at securitisation.
It is easy to see why. By taking securitised assets off balance sheet, banks
are able to make more loans. Since the risk has been transferred to bond
holders, capital which backed the securitised loan is free to back new
lending.
National Westminster has a capital-to-assets ratio comfortably above the 8
per cent level demanded by international banking regulations. However,
capital has become a scarce commodity. In the longer term, securitisation
looks likely to become an important method of balance sheet management for
banks.
Regulators appear happy with the technique, so long as there is no danger of
securitised assets unexpectedly returning to the balance sheet.
Accountants are less sure. Last October, the UK Accounting Standards Board
proposed that securitised assets should not be taken off balance sheet where
the original lender retains an 'economic interest' in the loans.
Such a ruling would cover nearly all securitisations, since the originator
of the loan does maintain a clear economic interest - through its continued
relationship with the borrower and the administration of the loan, usually
for a fee.
The ASB admits to receiving a great deal of adverse comment. It will put
forward further proposals in the autumn.
But whatever it decides, UK banks are looking hard at the economic case for
securitisation and starting to conclude that the long-term benefits outweigh
the immediate costs.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: A new twist to ease the slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When two doctrinal opponents agree that a simple tactical change could at
the same time support sterling, encourage investment and reduce government
spending, their argument surely deserves official attention.
It seems unlikely to get it, though, because it runs against fashionable
theory, and breaks one of the government's self-imposed rules.
This proposed trick is simply under-funding the public sector borrowing
requirement - selling bills to the banks rather than gilts to the pension
funds.
Last week Mr Roger Bootle of Midland Montagu argued for it. Professor Tim
Congdon has been promoting it for a long time past. Prof Congdon is a
monetarist Liverpool Sixer, Mr Bootle a pragmatic supporter of the ERM, and
this may be the first time they have agreed on anything. And their proposal
has another merit which they both overlook.
Mr Bootle's main case rests on interest rates. If the authorities sold bills
aggressively, and starved the market of long dated paper, short rates might
edge up, and so support sterling; and gilt yields would come down, which
would ease long-term industrial financing, through bonds and equities.
How much would rates move? Not at all, according to fashionable theory,
since short rates are supposed to be a function of exchange rate
expectations (despite the fact the Professor Charles Goodhart has shown that
interest differentials are hopeless exchange rate predictors).
As for gilts, the market would not respond to lower sales, according to the
efficient market hypothesis, since it would know that higher sales would
follow later.
The fact is that under-funding was tried in America a quarter of a century
ago, before we learned it couldn't work. It was known as Operation Twist
(twisting the yield curve), and it did work. It would work again; the laws
of supply and demand are more reliable than later elaborations.
But it is hard to say how much rates would move, and harder to say how much
it would matter. The US is stuck in the doldrums, despite a 3 per cent
discount rate (and a heavy devaluation).
What about the Prof Congdon case? This is based on the fact that
under-funding would cause a large rise in M4, the main Congdon indicator
which is growing much too slowly. Here there is no doubt about the effect:
the rise in M4 is an arithmetic certainty. But would this prove anything -
apart from Goodhart's Law, which states that when you fiddle the money
numbers, they become meaningless? Remember that a decade ago we contrived a
slump despite exploding money numbers.
It is memories like this which no doubt inspired the present Treasury rule
of full funding - a gilt or a savings certificate to cover every debt.
Under this rule, government borrowing has no effect on the money supply. It
might be called Congdon's Benefit, since it ensures that broad money is, for
a change, a reliable indicator of private bank credit. But this interesting
statistic is unduly costly, to taxpayer, the banking system, and to the
house-buyer.
The taxpayer suffers, as Mr Bootle points out, because if you believe, as
the authorities say they do, that inflation and interest rates are falling,
issuing long gilts at current yields is recklessly extravagant.
As for the banks, their balance sheets have been debauched by their own
folly and earlier official over-funding, when the Bank of England bought all
their best credits and sold gilts to pay for it.
Under-funding in present circumstances would be simple justice, and would
enable the banks to rebuild a decent holding of government paper - if not
the 70 per cent they held before Competition and Credit Control started two
decades of monetary bungling.
The banks are now sober, and under-funding would help make them sound -
perhaps the biggest long-term benefit to confidence. The saving on public
expenditure would be worthwhile, and painless. It's not a panacea, but it's
the right thing to do.

FT  20 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Yields rise on Bundesbank move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS lost ground due to widespread worries about possible Bundesbank moves
later this year to push up German interest rates, possibly leading to a
tightening of monetary policy across Europe.
The concerns spilled over into the bond markets on Friday, with German
government securities (bunds) seeing significant price falls and the effects
spilling over to gilts.
During the week, yields on short-dated UK securities climbed by up to 0.2
percentage points (20 basis points), reflecting the reduced prices. The
yield increases were less marked for longer maturing bonds.
The Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to increase its discount rate by an
above-expected 0.75 percentage points was the main trigger for the increased
gilt yields. While the German central bank resisted the temptation to
increase its more internationally important Lombard rate - this staying at
9.75 per cent - a move along these lines cannot be ruled out over the next
few months.
Accordingly, the UK money markets were convulsed with speculation on Friday
that base rates may have to rise by the end of the year because of the
effects of a Lombard rate increase on the level of sterling in the exchange
rate mechanism .
The Bundesbank move overshadowed good news on UK inflation earlier in the
week which had driven gilt prices higher. The index of average earnings
across the economy rose in the year to May by an underlying 6.5 per cent,
after 7 per cent in April and 7.5 per cent in the previous month.
While the level of price increases for manufactured goods in the year to
June remained at 3.6 per cent, the same as in May, factory output fell by
0.6 per cent in May compared with April, indicating weak demand and a
continuation of the recession.
Meanwhile, Britain's public sector borrowing requirement jumped to a higher
than expected Pounds 4.23bn last month as the recession depressed government
revenues and boosted spending.
It brought the total borrowing requirement in the first three months of the
1992-93 financial year to Pounds 10.8bn, fuelling fears that the government
will not be able to keep borrowing within its Pounds 28bn target. That is
likely to have repercussions on the gilt market - which fears higher gilt
issues will depress prices and push up yields.
In the context of ways of managing the high PSBR, an intriguing suggestion
has come from Mr Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu, a leading gilt broker,
on how the Treasury could both help help economic recovery and get the gilt
market out of its difficulties. Mr Bootle says that rather than fund all the
PSBR - which Greenwell expects this year to reach Pounds 33bn - via gilt
issues the government should deliberately underfund. That boils down to
financing the deficit partly by sale of short-term Treasury bills, which
feed into the money supply and boost economic activity. By reducing gilt
issues, such an option would also put a floor under prices. According to
Greenwell's arithmetic, total gilt issues this year under full funding would
need to be Pounds 35bn. By under-funding by Pounds 10bn, that would release
Pounds 10bn into the economy to stimulate growth.

FT  20 JUL 92 / German Bonds: Ground trembles beneath the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the Richter scale of seismic disturbance in the bond markets, the impact
of last Thursday's 0.75 percentage point rise in Germany's discount rate
took time to register.
Other European bond markets even managed a spontaneous half-hearted cheer of
a rally in their relief that the ground had not shaken harder. But by the
end of Friday, the subterranean after-shocks set off by the Bundesbank's
action had given a thorough shake to the foundations of the exchange rate
mechanism.
The shudders were not only felt in bond markets at the outer margins of the
ERM.
The yield on 10-year French government bonds jumped from 8.85 per cent to
8.97 per cent, opening up the widest gap between French and German bond
yields this year at nearly 90 basis points.
French bond prices, of course, reflect the other great fear that stalks the
markets: that French voters will say 'non' in September to Maastricht
proposals for economic and monetary union, and put a bomb under the
seemingly inexorable convergence of bond yields across the EC.
With German monetary tightening acting as another turn of the screw on the
hard-pressed economies of its neighbours, that no vote may have become a
little more likely.
The tremor that passed through the markets on Friday was felt equally
strongly from southern Europe to Scandinavia. Spanish bond prices, which had
nose-dived by Thursday to their lowest for some time, took one look over
their shoulder and kept on going. Ten-year bond yields, which had leapt to
11.80 per cent on Thursday, jumped further to 11.93 per cent.
Italy's monetary authorities may have earned plaudits in the market for
acting decisively to raise the country's discount rate by 0.75 percentage
point on Thursday (the second rise in a fortnight) but it did not insulate
Italian bonds from the rout. Net yields on 10-year bonds followed those of
their Spanish counterparts, moving up from 11.75 per cent to 11.92 per cent.
The ripples beyond the immediate confines of the ERM bloc extended to
Sweden, where 10-year bond yields ended the week at 10 per cent, around 10
basis points up on the week, although Finland escaped the worst of the
slide. A currency swap agreement between Finnish and other European central
bankers, designed to underpin the Finnish currency and fortuitously
announced on Wednesday, left yields by the end of the week firmer at just
under 12 per cent.
The sharp drops of Friday took place against a background of thin trading in
cash markets, with investors either already on holiday or too nervous to
act. Most are only likely to shake off the paralysis when they feel they
know the answer to one question: what will the Bundesbank do next?
The narrowing of the gap between the discount and Lombard rates to 1
percentage point has been interpreted by some as a sign of pressure for
another Lombard rate rise. However, as the graph shows, the gap between the
two has been narrower in the past, particularly when the interest rate
environment changes quickly.
Certainly there were no hints on Friday of further stringency. The gap
between three-month and 10-year German interest rates, at 180 basis points,
is already as great as at any time recently, but there was no indication of
short-term interest rates creeping up, further inverting the yield curve.
'The Bundesbank is relieving tensions in the money markets,' said Mr Klaus
Baader, economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, on Friday. 'A Lombard
rate rise certainly isn't programmed into the markets yet.' Mr Baader summed
up the mood of most investors and analysts: 'German monetary policy is very
finely balanced between tightening and easing.'
Some clue could come this week, with the latest inflation and money supply
data. Market observers are looking for a sharp fall in the headline
inflation rate from its 4.3 per cent level, while M3 growth is expected to
ease from the 8.7 per cent recorded for May. If the market's expectations
are disappointed, fears will intensify that the Lombard rate will be raised
later in the summer. And with the French preparing to vote on Maastricht,
that really would make the earth beneath the bond markets move.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sanyo to postpone memory chip
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANYO Electric is to postpone mass production of four-megabit dynamic random
access memories (D-rams) because of sluggish market conditions, the company
announced.
Although the Japanese electronics company has never been a leading D-ram
producer, its decision to scale back its involvement signals a trend among
Japanese semiconductor producers who are increasingly disenchanted with the
D-ram business.
Industry analysts expect several minor D-ram producers to follow Sanyo's
example and back away from the volatile memory chip market.
Last week Sanyo reported an 82.5 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax
profits to Y3.34bn (Dollars 26.8m) in the half year to May.
D-ram prices have skidded over the past year in the face of mounting
competition from South Korean producers and sluggish demand from the
recession-bound computer industry.
The situation facing Japanese D-ram producers is reminiscent of that
encountered by US producers in the mid-1980s when most US companies
abandoned the market.
Sanyo said that it would continue to develop higher capacity D-rams to keep
pace with advances in semi-conductor production technology.

Dollars 7m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Reichmann family has sold its Gulfstream executive jet to help pay the
debt restructuring costs of Olympia &amp; York.
The latest report on the ailing developer's finances compiled by auditors
Price Waterhouse says the jet, which fetched USDollars 6.8m, was owned by a
private Reichmann company outside the court protection order granted to O&amp;Y
and its Canadian subsidiaries two months ago.
O&amp;Y is restructuring the bulk of its CDollars 13.5bn debt (USDollars
11.4bn). Only its US operations remain outside the protection of bankruptcy
courts. Lenders are in the unenviable position of seeing some of the income
from O&amp;Y properties previously earmarked for debt-service payments now being
funnelled into the company's administrative and restructuring costs.
According to the Price Waterhouse report, restructuring costs - consisting
mainly of fees to lawyers and accountants - will total CDollars 9.3m in July
and August alone. All debt-service payments have been frozen.
Price Waterhouse, one of whose partners is acting as O&amp;Y's information
officer, projects the developer's Canadian operations will have a cash
outflow of CDollars 8.3m in July and another CDollars 5.2m in August. Under
a court order granted earlier this month, the shortfall will be funded as
far as possible from the sale of unencumbered assets.
The information officer said he expected O&amp;Y's first-quarter results, for
the three months ended April 30, to be released in early August. The results
are likely to include a large writedown on O&amp;Y's investment in the Canary
Wharf project in London's Docklands, which is currently valued at CDollars
3.6bn.
The Reichmanns' entire equity in O&amp;Y has already been wiped out with
writedowns totalling CDollars 1.4bn in the fiscal year to January 31 1992.

Japanese pension fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHRODER Investment Management, the fund management arm of the UK merchant
banking group, has become the latest overseas firm to win pension fund
management business in Japan.
The firm has been appointed to manage Y3bn (Dollars 24m) by Japan's third
largest pension fund, the Public School Teachers Mutual Aid Association.
It becomes the third overseas manager to manage assets for the teachers'
fund, joining Jardine Fleming and Merrill Lynch.
Although the three overseas firms manage only a small portion of the fund's
Dollars 41bn assets, the appointment of Schroders underlines the gradual
progress being made by overseas managers in Japan.
However, despite the partial deregulation of the pension fund management
business, overseas managers can only be alloted new money flowing into
pension funds.
Existing assets must remain in the hands of the trust banks and insurance
companies which dominate the industry.
Moreover, while public sector funds are slowly opening up to foreign
investment managers, private sector companies have been more conservative.
Earlier this year, Nagasakiya, the retailer, became the first private sector
company to appoint a foreign-based fund manager, allotting Y1bn of its
Y23.7bn pension fund to Invesco MIM.
In June, Hitachi, the electronics group, followed suit, appointing Invesco
MIM and Mercury Asset Management.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products, one of Canada's largest pulp and paper

heavy losses in the second quarter.
The second-quarter loss deepened to CDollars 59.5m (USDollars 50.42m), or
CDollars 1.13 a share, against a loss of CDollars 56.4m, or CDollars 1.28, a
year earlier, on sales of CDollars 462m, against CDollars 502m.
A lower Canadian dollar and severe pruning of costs were not enough to
offset depressed product prices, the company said.
The half-year loss was CDollars 130.6m, or CDollars 2.59 a share, compared
with CDollars 106.5m, or CDollars 2.42, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars
892m, against CDollars 991m.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance will allow a greater range of companies to issue
bonds overseas from next month, in a move which will ease the pressure on
some Japanese companies which need to refinance equity warrant bonds issued
in the late 1980s.
The ministry will also loosen restraints on yen denominated bond issues in
the domestic market by foreign issuers - known as 'samurai' bonds - allowing
new low-rated borrowers into the market.
Both moves are in line with government proposals earlier this year to
eliminate limits on corporate bond issuance, allowing a broader range of
companies to raise funds.
The easing of limits will create an alternative funding method for weaker
Japanese companies needing to refinance repayments on equity-linked issues.
The slump in the Tokyo stock market has dried up sources of equity-linked
financing.
Moreover, Japanese banks, faced with increasing bad loans and the need to
meet international capital-to-assets ratios, are setting tougher standards
on loans.
From next month, Japanese companies with a single-A credit rating or higher
will be able to issue straight bonds denominated in a foreign currency, yen
bonds issued in the Eurobond market and warrant bonds. A rating of triple-B,
the lowest investment grade credit rating, will be the minimum requirement
for a company to issue yen denominated convertible bonds.
In addition, numerical standards on net assets, dividends and profits will
also be eased. Bank-guaranteed bonds with warrants, straight bonds and
warrant bonds guaranteed by a parent company are also subject to easier
requirements.
For samurai bonds, foreign borrowers or international organisations with an
investment grade credit rating will be able to access the market.
Currently, the issuance in the Samurai market is limited to foreign
organisations with ratings of single-A or higher, or with a triple-B rating
and a government guarantee.
Ministry officials said the move was aimed at increasing domestic capital
outflow abroad.
However, the easing of restrictions comes when many Japanese investors are
looking to decrease investment portfolios rather than expand.
Many face large losses on investment portfolios due to the sharp decline in
share prices, and the decline in profits due to the economic downturn is
squeezing cash flow.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government has placed Overseas Trust Bank (OTB) up for sale,
offering foreign banks a rare opportunity to buy into the colony's lucrative
banking market.
A government spokesman said the time was ripe to return the bank to the
private sector. 'It has been restored to health and should be able to
perform with results comparable to other banks of its size.'
OTB has 48 branches in the colony and, in the year to June 30 1991, made a
net profit of HKDollars 210m (USDollars 27.7m). It is expected to fetch more
than HKDollars 3.5bn.
OTB was rescued by the Hong Kong government in 1985 after investigators
discovered widespread fraud and false loans totalling USDollars 90m on its
books. In June 1991 it still had accumulated losses of HKDollars 2.15bn.
It used to be the colony's third largest listed bank after Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank, but is now comparable to the colony's two smallest listed
banks Wing Lung and Dah Sing.
Over the past months several local banks have expressed interest in buying
OTB. Foremost among these is Dao Heng Bank, the banking subsidiary of the
Guoco Group, Dah Sing, and Xiamen International Bank, owned by the
provincial government of Fujian in China.
But the proposed sale also represents one of the few opportunities for a
foreign bank to acquire banking assets in Hong Kong. Retail banking, which
is regulated by a cartel, is very profitable and OTB is in the top five in
terms of size of branch network.
It would also offer a foreigner a base from which to build business in
China. This is restricted mainly to cross-border loans and trade finance but
with the financial liberalisation under way in China there may be
opportunities to expand further.

However interim pre-tax profits slumped to Pounds 3,000, compared with
Pounds 141,000 a year earlier. This reflected lower interest rates, coupled
with a fall in interest on the reduced level of liquidity and higher
contracted advisers fees - both due to an increased level of investment over
the past 18 months.
After tax of Pounds 1,000 (Pounds 61,000) diluted earnings per share fell

Fifth Grosvenor Fund. It intends to raise more than Pounds 25m for the new
fund.
The fund will take the form of a UK limited partnership, which GVM has used
successfully in the past. Investors are likely to be big UK pension funds,
insurance companies and overseas institutions.
One of the limited partners will be an exempt unauthorised unit trust for
those funds unable to invest directly in a partnership.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of investors has acquired a 29.9 per cent stake in Tamaris, the
troubled nursing homes operator, from Chalfont Lifecare. Chalfont, however,
retains a 20.4 per cent equity holding.
The investors, via a company called Atlantic Shelf 8, have bought 5.34m
ordinary shares at 0.75p each and with the co-operation of the company's
bankers, have agreed a partial refinancing to nurse Tamaris back to health.
Mr Barry McFadzean of Atlantic has been appointed to Tamaris as
non-executive chairman, while three directors - Messrs Cameron Brown, Hanafi
Fraval and Keith Smith - have resigned.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Improved terms win Finanzauto
for Bibby

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate, announced
that its Pounds 86.2m hostile bid for Finanzauto, the leading distributor of
earthmoving equipment in Spain, had been accepted in respect of 89 per cent
of the capital.
The acquisition, which was secured after Bibby improved its offer by 13 per
cent last month, marked the first hostile takeover in Spain of a domestic
company by a wholly foreign-owned corporation.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman of Bibby, said the future development of
Finanzauto, the sole distributor of Caterpillar equipment in Spain, would be
a joint effort between Bibby and Barlow Rand, the South African group which
owns 79 per cent of Bibby.
Finanzauto, which controls some 25 per cent of its domestic sector in Spain,
faces a bleak immediate future, for official construction tenders in Spain
have fallen by 56 per cent in the first four months of this year and are at
their lowest level since 1987. Its group profits fell by 68 per cent to
Pounds 4.8m last year.
Mr Mansell-Jones said there was no 'quick fix' for the Spanish company and
that it would be two years before the benefits of the acquisition filtered
through. 'Our highest priority will be to reduce (Finanzauto's) indebtedness
and not to produce dividends,' he said. Bibby was likely to dispose of the
Spanish company's leasing division and other non-core assets.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Power Corp passes final dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POWER Corporation, the Dublin property developer, saw its pre-tax profits
fall from IPounds 15.6m in the year 1990 to IPounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.6m) for
the 15 months to March 31 1992, and confirmed the market's worst fears by
passing the final dividend.
The profit for the period was up to IPounds 3m below forecasts.
Mr Robin Power, chairman, said the dividend was waived 'because of the depth
of the property and financial recession' and because the company's gearing
was 'temporarily high' following the acquisition of the outstanding 50 per
cent stake in the Trocadero Centre and Island Site in Piccadilly, London,
from Brent Walker.
Dividends will be renewed 'when the board considers it prudent to do so,
which should occur in the reasonably near future.'
The interim dividend of 2p already paid becomes the total for the period,
and compares with 5.76p for the previous year.
Gearing was 74 per cent, with balance sheet borrowings of IPounds 166m. The
Trocadero Centre and Island Site had off-balance sheet borrowings of IPounds
256m, which would increase gearing to 180 per cent if consolidated.
Power was in discussions with an institution to dispose of a 50 per cent
interest in the Trocadero; if that failed the centre's borrowings would be
consolidated, Mr Power said.
Turnover in the 15 months was IPounds 32.3m (IPounds 35.1m) and earnings per
share were 9.15p (10.54p).
Net asset value rose to 202p (198p). Power owned 1.3m square feet of
predominantly retail space, of which 1.1m square feet was leased or under
offer.
Power currently had no material capital expenditure commitments. Its only
new development was in Beverly Hills, California, where it had been granted
planning permission to redevelop a 30,000 square foot site.
On prospects Mr Power said there should be some recovery in property values
in the latter half of the current year.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: A growing trend towards
alliances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Brian Bollen
LIVING together rather than marrying is increasingly popular in
international business.
Alliances and partnerships which fall short of total commitment but which
help contain the costs of research, development and manufacturing are a
growing trend, particularly in the global computer industry.
Announced last week, the largest such alliance to date sees IBM of the US,
Japan's Toshiba, and Siemens of Germany joining forces to research and
develop advanced computer memory chips.
Meanwhile, Japan's Fujitsu is establishing a partnership with Advanced Micro
Devices of the US to manufacture flash memory devices, the current hot
product in the sector.
Last week's batch of non-core disposals included the sale by UK construction
group Tarmac of its Briggs Oil bitumen business to Nynas Petroleum of
Sweden. Tarmac wants to cut gearing to 25 per cent, from 51 per cent at the
end of last year.
The opportunity for UK-based industrial conglomerate BTR to make a strategic
purchase of a clutch of businesses in the UK and mainland Europe arose from
Pirelli of Italy's decision this year to concentrate on core businesses and
cut debt. BTR simultaneously announced the disposal of interests in Richmond
Power Enterprise in the US, a peripheral business acquired when it bought
Hawker Siddeley last year.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank ended its direct involvement in Cathay Pacific
airline by selling its last 10 per cent to China National Aviation
Corporation and China Travel Service.
Privatisation in eastern Europe continues, albeit at a jogging pace other
than in east Germany. The Treuhand privatisation notched up another first -
the sale of electronics company Werk fur Fernsehlektronik to Samsung
representing the first acquisition of an east German business by a South
Korean company.
US hotels group Marriott Corporation's purchase of the Duna Intercontinental
hotel is being seen as a victory for the State Property Agency's commitment
to competitive bidding.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Carlton raises Pounds 64m via
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications, the media group which holds the London regional
television licence, has raised Pounds 64.25m from a convertible bond issue.
The bonds carry interest of 7 1/2 per cent, payable semi-annually, against a
yield on the shares of about 3.2 per cent. Goldman Sachs, which lead managed
the issue, priced it on the basis that Carlton would deliver annual dividend
growth of about 12 per cent.
Bond holders have the right to convert into Carlton shares at 696p, a 16 per
cent premium over the 600p share price when the issue was priced.
On full conversion Carlton's capital would be increased by just under 5 per
cent, the level at which existing holders must be offered pre-emption rights
under guidelines issued by institutional investors.
The lead manager said the issue was considered aggressively priced by many
UK fund managers and some 70 per cent was sold to continental European
investors.
Carlton said the proceeds will be used to fund small acquisitions and for
general corporate purposes.
This is the first convertible issue by a UK company since Thames Water
launched an Pounds 80m deal last August. However, bankers said the heavy
supply of rights issues and flotations was leading more companies to
consider convertibles as a means of raising long-term equity-linked finance.

FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Near Pounds 6m downturn pushes
Jacques Vert Pounds 2.8m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS FORECAST in May, Jacques Vert has tumbled from profits of Pounds 3.01m to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.81m in the year to April 25 after the costs
incurred from its reversion to its profitable core.
The womens wear group, which is about 59 per cent owned by its joint
chairmen, is passing its final dividend, which leaves the 2p interim as the
total. Last year's it paid 10p for the full year.
The factory at Upton, Yorkshire, had been closed after a drawn-out wrangle
with the local council, which planned an open-cast coal mine next to it.
Closure and redundancy costs accounted for about half of the Pounds 1.75m
exceptional charges. The balance was for stock provisions, of which Pounds
690,000 related to continuing operations.
The Alain Cannelle leisure wear label was discontinued and its associated
warehouse in Harlow closed, as were the group's three loss-making outlets in
the US.
These moves resulted in extraordinary costs of Pounds 1.84m. In all, the
restructure involved a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce to 750.
Mr Alan Green, joint chairman, said: 'The past is the past; we can now
concentrate on the future.' He was keen to point out that continuing
operations - essentially the Jacques Vert and JV Plus brands - made profits
of Pounds 1.02m before the exceptional stock provisions.
The Grace collection will launch soon and the joint venture with the Ben de
Lisi label was making progress, said Mr Green.
So far, none of the Upton production had been switched either to the
Washington, Tyne and Wear, or to the Newton Abbot, Devon, factories, he
said. At least in the short term some was being sourced in eastern Europe
and Portugal.
Mr Malcolm Heald, who replaced Mr Sashi Mylvaganam as finance director this
year, said that borrowings had edged up to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 5.9m), but
that gearing climbed more steeply from 51 to 79 per cent. He said the
company would reduce its debt with profits.
Turnover fell from Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 40.9m, or to Pounds 38.9m for
continuing operations, and losses per share were 21.27p (earnings 21.86p).

FT  20 JUL 92 / Economic Notebook: A Japanese lesson for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is unfortunate that in the rush to offer economic advice to eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, so little is heard from Japan. After
all, Japan's post-Second World War economic performance puts most
industrialised nations to shame.
With its industry destroyed and cities ravaged, Japan was in 1945 in a worse
economic condition than the ex-communist states are today. Some European and
US experts judged recovery would take generations. Yet by the 1964 Tokyo
Olympics, Japan was already on the way to becoming an economic superpower.
Moreover, Japan employed economic policies which differed significantly from
those of Europe and North America. Japan put less faith than the west in
market forces and more trust in government intervention. Russians and east
Europeans are in danger of ignoring this experience. So is the International
Monetary Fund, which is co-ordinating western economic aid for the
ex-communist states.
Russians and eastern Europeans naturally find it easier to consult Americans
and western Europeans than Asians. Westerners are closer, geographically and
culturally. Many Japanese find Russia and eastern Europe remote and their
complex political heritage difficult to understand. Also, the territorial
dispute between Japan and Russia casts a shadow over any dialogue between
Tokyo and Moscow.
Japanese officials have in the past been diffident about offering economic
advice to other countries. Partly, this reflects a lack of intellectual
self-confidence vis-a-vis westerners. Partly, officials have been reluctant
to emphasise the unique points of Japanese economic development, especially
government intervention. They have usually preferred to discuss the role of
free markets and other similarities between Japan and the west.
However, the Japanese economic establishment is coming out of its shell. As
Japan's overseas aid has grown, so has officials' willingness to direct the
way the money is spent. Over the past year, Japanese officials have been
involved in increasingly frank exchanges with the IMF and the World Bank.
Japanese officials have questioned the US-influenced institutions' espousal
of free markets as an economic panacea and suggested a more interventionist
approach. In response, the World Bank has launched studies of Japanese
development.
But nothing Japanese officials have done so far has been as timely as the
two reports its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
presented this year to the Russian authorities. The first describes Miti's
approach to economic development and the specific policies Japan followed
from 1945 to the mid-1960s. The second analyses Russia's economic
predicament and prescribes a policy.
Miti's researchers see as a good starting point the advice offered by the
IMF which Russia has accepted as a condition of receiving the Dollars 24bn
(Pounds 12.5bn) aid promised by the Group of Seven industrialised countries.
The programme commits Moscow to cutting government subsidies, reducing money
supply growth, and introducing a freely-convertible currency. Miti's
researchers also support the IMF's views on the need for large-scale
deregulation and privatisation.
But Miti's researchers believe this does not go far enough. They would like
the plan supplemented with a Japanese-style 'priority industry' policy. Just
as the Japanese government favoured the coal and steel industries in the
late 1940s with special credits and other measures, so Russia should pick a
priority industry.
Miti researchers say the favoured industry should be oil, because the
industry can quickly become internationally competitive and earn foreign
exchange; investment would lead to the import of high-quality technology;
and it would benefit other domestic industries such as steelmaking.
The reports recommend government support for oil production, including
government-financed loans. But they warn the industry must not be allowed to
export its output in an untrammelled way - for fear of starving domestic
consumers of oil and prompting inflation. The papers advise Moscow to impose
export quotas and/or tax oil exports and use the proceeds to subsidise
domestic consumption.
The reports say introducing price liberalisation and competition is of
utmost importance, So is encouraging entrepreneurship. But in Russia price
mechanisms barely function; and capitalist culture has been suppressed
during 70 years of communism. So, some market-oriented government
intervention could help. It may be particularly necessary to avoid a sudden
collapse in output which might bring rapid abolition of government
subsidies.
Mr Hiroya Tanigawa, one of the reports' authors, says: 'In our view it's
difficult for developing countries' industries to follow market signals only
. . . The example of many Asian countries shows government intervention can
be successful in economic development.'
Mr Tanigawa and his colleagues admit there are huge differences between
Japan and Russia, not least the fact that the Japanese trust their
bureaucrats and Russians do not. But they believe the Russians may have no
choice. 'Our basic stance is in stark contrast with the IMF Memorandum
(reform plan), which thinks that macroeconomic stability will be brought
about before long. We believe that the macroeconomic stabilisation will take
rather a long time (about five years) and that some strategic industrial
policies need to be taken in this transitional period.'
Mr Tanigawa says he and his colleagues had a sympathetic hearing in Moscow
even though the eventual plan adopted owed little to their advice. Miti's
ideas also went largely unheard in eastern Europe.
However, in east Asia it is a different matter. South Korea has in the last
30 years copied many features of economic development from Japan. So has
Taiwan. Today, it is China's turn. Mr Tanigawa, who recently gave a lecture
at Beijing University, says: 'China is modelling itself on Japan very
eagerly.'
The Chinese language has been chosen for the first foreign translation of a
17-volume history of Miti and Japan's post-war development. Just a
one-volume summary will be published in English and nothing at all in
Russian.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL phase of Wellcome's international share offer is expected to
coincide with positive news for the company's anti-Aids drugs.
The results of clinical trials involving the company's AZT drug Retrovir,
which still has a virtual monopoly of the Aids drug market five years after
its launch, will be given later this week at a world conference on Aids,
taking place in Amsterdam.
Hopes are high that a study to be released by Prof David Cooper of the
University of New South Wales, Australia, will provide new evidence that AZT
helps delay the onset of Aids symptoms in people infected with HIV, the
virus that causes the disease. Wellcome needs such evidence to expand AZT
sales.
Another study is expected to show that a combination of Wellcome's two
best-selling drugs - AZT and Acyclovir, which is normally used to treat
herpes infections - can prolong the life of people with advanced HIV
infection.
Other conference sessions will show that the level of medical concern about
AZT's side-effects is declining. Although the drug is still controversial,
it is becoming established as a reliable Aids treatment.
Few of the exciting leads on Aids treatment discussed at previous world Aids
conferences have come to anything. The handful of promising new treatments
mainly give their best results in combination with the Wellcome drug.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Hanson considers buying British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday said it would give
consideration to buying British Coal once any financial information on the
privatisation of the coal producer is made available.
Mr Martin Taylor, deputy chairman of Hanson, yesterday confirmed the
company's interest in looking at all the information the government produces
for the forthcoming privatisation of British Coal.
He did not rule out offering to buy the whole of British Coal - the
government's current plan is to split it into units before privatisation.
But he also made clear that Hanson, which holds a large interest in the US
coal company Peabody Mining, had made no commitment to bidding for it and
that no decisions could be made until all the information had been made
available.
Coal mining is one of the core businesses on which Hanson intends to
concentrate.
He said: 'We are in the coal industry in the United States, and our
obligation is to look at whatever the government says about British Coal and
what it wants to privatise.
'Having looked at the terms and analysed them we would decide whether
there's something which makes us want to make an investment.'
In 1990, Hanson spent a month in negotiation with the government to buy
PowerGen, one of the newly privatised electricity generators.
The negotiations failed, bringing down Hanson's share price, but many
commentators believed Hanson's involvement had a strong effect on PowerGen's
management and may also have helped the government to raise more from the
eventual privatisation of PowerGen than would otherwise have been the case.
Other companies have expressed an interest in buying British Coal. They
include Anglo United, which owns the Coalite smokeless fuel business and has
been researching a possible British Coal acquisition since 1989, and Ryan
Group, the UK's largest privately owned coal producer, which has said that
it will bid for a part of the company on privatisation.
Anglo's ability to buy British Coal has been constrained by its recent
financial performance, which was below earlier expectations.

FT  20 JUL 92 / In the footsteps of a legend: Digital's incoming president
will have his work cut out for him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of speculation and impatient grumbling within the ranks, Mr
Kenneth Olsen, 66, founder and president of Digital Equipment, last week
finally announced his intention to retire.
This living legend of the computer industry will leave behind a proud but
troubled company. With revenues exceeding Dollars 14bn (Pounds 7.3bn) last
year, Digital is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world
behind International Business Machines.
Digital pioneered the minicomputer as a cheaper alternative to mainframe
computers and later moved ahead of its competitors in recognising the
importance of connecting computers of different types and sizes on networks.
Today, however, Digital is floundering; trying to come to terms with
fundamental shifts in computer technology that have undermined its business
model.
The role of minicomputers is being usurped by networks of personal computers
and workstations. Also, the industry-wide trend toward 'open systems', based
upon industry standard software, has undercut Digital's proprietary systems.
These challenges have squeezed profit margins throughout the computer
industry. But Digital has tried to respond: it offers a broad range of open
systems products and has recently stepped up efforts to compete in the
markets for workstations and personal computers.
Yet critics, within the company and among industry analysts, say Digital
resisted change for too long and in spite of job cuts the company remains
grossly overstaffed.
They blame Mr Olsen. He has ruled Digital from the day, 35 years ago, when
he set up shop in a disused woollen mill in Maynard, a small New England
town west of Boston.
He shaped Digital with his own brand of authoritarian leadership combined
with egalitarian personnel principles.
Although for years he resisted laying off workers, on several occasions he
sidelined executives who crossed him. Yet the tenacity with which he built
Digital also proved to be Mr Olsen's failing.
Just a week ago, at an event marking the introduction of new products, Mr
Olsen reiterated one of his favourite themes; the superior qualities of
Digital's proprietary VMS software and the weaknesses of UNIX, the AT&amp;T
computer operating system that is at the heart of 'open systems' and a key
element of Digital's current product strategy.
Digital marketing executives winced when Mr Olsen tossed in remarks to
'trash UNIX'.
'VMS (Digital's proprietary minicomputer operating system software) was his
first-born child. He adopted others along the way, but never felt the same
about them,' says a Digital insider.
Digital Equipment without Mr Olsen is hard to imagine. Although the prospect
of his departure, on October 1, has been greeted with a sigh of relief from
many Digital executives, he will be missed.
Mr Robert Palmer, 51, Mr Olsen's hand-picked successor, is a dark horse.
Like most Digital executives, he has made few public statements in the past
and has so far declined to discuss his future role. Digital insiders are,
however, pleased by his appointment (which has yet to be confirmed by the
board) and describe him as a 'sharp, aggressive and determined to get
Digital back on its feet'.
He joined Digital in 1985. He was one of the founders of Mostek, a chipmaker
that has been acquired by United Technologies.
Mr Palmer will take over Digital at a point where the company's route to
recovery has already been mapped. Before the end of this year Digital will
launch the first of a new generation of products upon which the companies
hopes for the future are pinned.
Its semiconductor operations, previously headed by Mr Palmer, have developed
a blindingly fast Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor,
called 'Alpha'. Alpha will become the foundation for Digital's new product
line which ultimately will span desktop computers through high performance
minicomputers.
Before Mr Palmer takes over, Digital is expected to begin large-scale
cost-cutting. The initiative, which could include thousands of lay-offs, may
be announced this week when Digital reports its quarterly results.
Digital, which employs about 116,000 people, has cut more than 23,000 jobs
over the past two years and closed numerous manufacturing operations. The
company suffered its first annual loss in 1991, and lost another Dollars
404m in the first three quarters of this year. When year-end results are
announced, the red ink is expected to gush again.
With Mr Olsen's departure, industry analysts expect Digital to cut overheads
and focus its product strategy more clearly upon open systems. But it could
take months to return Digital to profitability and the company faces heavy
charges as it reshapes its operations.
Analysts predict that Digital will report an operating loss of about Dollars
200m for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, and the company may take
charges of as much as Dollars 1bn to pay for job cuts and restructuring.
The transition to Alpha products may also be difficult. As sales of
Digital's established products slow down, speeding the new products to
market will be crucial.
Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Mr Palmer, however, will be to follow
in the footsteps of an industry legend. He needs to articulate a vision of
Digital as a future technology leader rather than a company clinging to the
memories of its past success.

FT  20 JUL 92 / KIO set to change investment strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office is changing the mix of its investments having
been left with an 'unbalanced portfolio' after the crisis sale of around
half its assets following the Gulf war.
According to a financier with a close knowledge of the KIO - which has
between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 35bn (Pounds 18.3bn) under management, down
from a peak twice as great before the Gulf war - the London-based body is
also returning to a policy of becoming a more passive investor in companies.
In the 1980s, the KIO was known as an aggressive purchaser of big strategic
stakes in politically sensitive companies, such as BP, the UK oil company,
and Midland Bank.
The fund has become reluctant to exceed the 3 per cent level of equity
investment at which an interest in any quoted UK company must be disclosed,
unless the investment is regarded as an outstanding prospect.
The financier said the pressure on the KIO to remit funds for the rebuilding
of Kuwait has eased. On the other hand, the fund does not expect to receive
new injections of funds from the Gulf for at least a year.
The sell-off of investments in the past year is understood to have left the
KIO with an inappropriate mix of assets. It is now turning its attention to
'rebalancing' its remaining investments.
Large new investment funds will not be available to the KIO until Kuwait's
oil production has returned to its pre-war level of 1.5m barrels a day - a
target the government is confident of reaching early next year.
It is understood that Mr Ali Rashaid Al-Bader, the KIO's new president, will
oversee a relatively cautious investment strategy and avoid high-profile
investment manoeuvres.
Current management is understood to be keen to avoid initiatives such as
Ercros, the Spanish chemicals group in which the KIO holds a 39 per cent
stake. The KIO has been drawn into complex negotiations to rescue the group.
But indications that the KIO is preparing to pump more money into Ercros
support the view that it is not about to extricate itself from Spain
altogether.
Nor is it expected in the short term to offload large publicly disclosed
equity interests such as its 9.9 per cent stake in BP.

Sir, In your edition of July 9, you published a photograph of a policeman
pointing a pistol at a French truck driver at the wheel of his vehicle.
Because the caption did not make it clear, it should be said that the
policeman was not the aggressor.
The truck driver had in fact been threatening to run him down, and the
policeman's action was therefore a legitimate defence.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Contracts for directors in line with risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL DYCKHOF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With the recent cutting back of the Top Pay Review Board's
recommendations for pay awards for senior public appointments ('Top public
pay rises cut to 4 per cent', July 10), much has been made of the difference
in the risk/reward ratio between the public and private sectors.
While it may now be argued that this ratio, given the current economic
situation, is broadly correct for the public sector, it is open to question
whether in the private sector reward has not overtaken risk.
Chairmen of board remuneration committees might now begin to wonder whether,
with salaries broadly equivalent to worldwide values and with
well-constructed incentive schemes giving the potential for considerable
enhancement, the other benefits considered appropriate for senior private
sector positions should be reconsidered.
No one would grudge share options to a captain of industry - particularly as
they are, as a recent correspondent suggested, 'a gamble to which he or she
is entitled' - nor such trappings of office as cars. However, it could be
questioned whether contracts of two, three and even more years should
continue to be available.
There have been many instances recently where a person who has manifestly
failed has left the company with a substantial sum of money. For a
shareholder, this is a questionable outcome as in the preceding years
substantial remuneration will have been paid. Would it not be much more
equitable if company directors and senior executives were to have the same
notice and redundancy terms as any other employee in their company?

<TEXT>
Sir, I am sure than Mr Brian McEvoy (Letters, July 11) and your readers will
wish to know the real reason for the extended journey time for trains from
Bristol Parkway to London. He is wrong in claiming that the changes are
designed to help us meet the Passenger's Charter targets.
The few extra minutes allowed in the summer timetable reflect the delays
arising from the temporary reduction in the number of tracks available on
the approach to Paddington station, made necessary by the scheme completely
to replace track and signalling.
This Pounds 40m-plus project will improvement reliability and speed and open
the way for a new generation of services, including the Heathrow Express
electric trains. The slightly longer journey time is for the best reasons -
the long term benefit of passengers.
We intend to reinstate the shorter journey time next year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G TURVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Significantly increasing charges to road users will not, as suggested
in your leader ('No revolution for British Rail', July 15), bring about a
rail revolution. That revolution will only occur when railways offer their
customers, both passenger and freight, efficient, reliable and economic
services.
Obviously while every realistic opportunity for moving more freight by rail
must be pursued, the prospects for substantially increasing the amount
carried is limited. In practice increasing road charges will simply raise
transport and industrial costs for the vast majority of companies who have
no alternative but to use road. Fuel duties sufficient actively to
discourage private motoring would have to be so high as to be politically
unacceptable.
The transport debate must be focused on maximising the productivity of our
transport systems, not on the ways in which transport can be restricted and
penalised.

Sir, In your article, 'Airlines step up drive for EC control system' (July
16), you report the Association of European Airlines' (AEA) support for a
harmonised system of air traffic control.
The British Air Line Pilots' Association supports an integrated ATC system,
for our members are well aware of the air traffic problems facing Europe.
With the prospect of sustained long-term traffic growth, the need to upgrade
and integrate the existing national ATC systems becomes ever more urgent.
Technology alone is no answer: equipment and procedures must be
standardised; and much greater investment is required as part of a
Europe-wide co-ordinated development. We must move speedily towards a
unified system that transcends national frontiers.
Progress has been made towards closer co-operation between governments under
the auspices of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) and
Eurocontrol. However, the present approach of inter-governmental
co-operation has some limitations and we believe new impetus could be given
if the European Commission were to play a more leading role. Chris Darke,

FT  20 JUL 92 / The cost of using price to choose a computer / Examining the
benefits and pitfalls to customers of greater competition among PC
manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a decade after the first personal computers were soldered together
in garages, it is still possible to build your own. A video cassette
available through the pages of personal computer magazines explains how to
build a professional-quality personal computer from readily available parts.
The do-it-yourself approach is symptomatic of a broader trend among
customers from all sizes of company to choose a personal computer (PC) on
price alone rather than brand name or maker's reputation.
Take, for example, Mr Tom Nelson, president of Control Manufacturing of
Napa, California, a supplier of industrial control and monitoring systems.
He uses personal computers extensively in his business and buys six to eight
a month for his customers. 'We have switched over the past six months from
buying exclusively IBM and Compaq (the high-price aristocrats of the PC
business) to clone makers like Dell, Compuadd and AST.'
Clones make PCs functionally identical to IBM ones but they sell more
cheaply by shaving profit margins and holding overheads to a minimum.
'It used to be that for a big job, the difference between an IBM or Compaq
and a clone did not matter. It was a few hundred dollars in a Dollars
100,000 contract. When the price differential got to 25 per cent, it made a
big difference and our customers started asking for clones,' said Mr Nelson.
His comments are graphic evidence of the unprecedented decline in the cost
of personal computers. In the past 12 months alone, the selling price of PCs
has fallen by between 25 per cent and 45 per cent. The trend is being driven
by companies such as Dell Computer, the pioneer in selling 'off-the-page'
(mail order), and a myriad of computer assemblers operating in the Far East.
Now, IBM and Compaq are being forced to follow suit.
A Compaq computer which sold for Pounds 2,495 in the UK a year ago now sells
for Pounds 1,395. The company had never sold a machine costing less than
Pounds 1,500 a year ago; now, its cheapest computer costs Pounds 550. US
prices are even lower.
The specification of mach-ines on offer at cheaper than Pounds 1,000 is
extraordinary. The basic offering from the UK maker Elonex includes a
high-performance microprocessor (33MHz 386SX), vast storage capacity (50MB
hard disk and 2MB of random access memory), colour monitor, together with
mouse, windows and disc operating system (Dos). All of this was state of the
art a year ago; now it can be had for a mere Pounds 795 plus VAT.
In spite of prices falling for two years, they still have some way to drop.
Manufacturers trying desperately to match overheads to declining sales
revenue, and dealers struggling with the narrowest of margins, are
despondent: 'It is getting worse by the week,' said Mr David Southworth,
managing director of P&amp;P, one of the UK's largest distributors. 'The volume
is not there.'
Customers should benefit from the new low prices, but the equation is more
sophisticated than that, makers and dealers insist. Computers may command
commodity prices but they are not yet commodity items. Selection and
installation of the right software can be complex. Operation is rarely
straightforward. Setting up even the simplest network of interlinked
computers requires expert skills.
The price of PCs conventionally contains an element to help pay for all this
technological support. Customers paying the bare minimum for a clone of an
IBM system will have none of these benefits and may have to pay through the
nose to get the best out of their systems, the argument goes.
Confirmed Compaq customer, Mr Glen Sandusky, of Miller, Mason and Dickenson,
a US corporate benefits consultancy, agrees: 'Price is not the main issue.
We want something that works and we do not want to buy from a company that
will not be around in a year or so.
'Price declines are great for corporate customers but everybody cannot
compete on these terms and there is going to be a shake-out.'
The more sophisticated customers fear that if prices continue to fall, the
big manufacturers will be forced to cut spending on research and
dev-elopment, so prejudicing the development of the next generation of PCs.
But lower prices are promoting significant changes in buying policies. Large
organisations with in-house computing departments feel comfortable taking on
responsibility for developing and maintaining their systems and are
increasingly buying on price alone.
Mr Roger Wells, administration manager for the UK engineering group Brown,
Root, for example, believes his company is one whose new buying policies
have helped persuade IBM and Compaq to take the low-cost route. As prices
have fallen, so the company has moved from rental to purchase.
'We now see PCs entirely as commodities,' Mr Wells said. 'We are even
thinking of abandoning third-party maintenance. If a machine fails we will
repair it with parts cannibalised from another.' A former IBM and Compaq
user, the company would be happy to buy clones, he said.
Barclays Bank, one of Europe's largest PC buyers, has also changed
purchasing policy as prices have fallen. Mr Toby Broome, head of purchasing,
says it is no longer prepared to buy at discounted rates only for volume
purchases. 'We want the same price whether we are buying one PC or 1,000.
And we are not prepared to pay more than in a high-street retailer.'
Smaller companies are tempted by a combination of price and support. Ms
Pauline Willett, systems manager for Hacker Young, a medium-sized British
accountancy firm, says the company, formerly a Compaq user, switched to
Elonex last year. It was tempted by price savings of 50 per cent and
significantly better service, especially in networking.
For tiny companies, computer purchase has become more confusing as buyers
must choose between a plethora of machines, all apparently similar in cost
and function.
Ms Elizabeth Bryant is setting up a seminar business. A computer would make
administration easier, but Pounds 3,000, the cost of an adequate system a
few years ago, would have been beyond her budget. Prices now start well
below the Pounds 1,500 she is prepared to spend. Unimpressed by brand names,
her chief concern is to get immediate benefit from her purchase and she
understands the need for support from her supplier.
Mr Martin Nielsen, managing director of The Business Superstore, the UK's
latest low-cost business equipment marketing venture, believes Ms Bryant
represents a substantial, unsatisfied demand for PCs among small businesses
and serious home users.
He argues that lower prices broaden the market and make buying decisions
easier. He also believes that if all else is equal, established brand names
count - at least in Europe.
His sales approach is modular; customers can buy a bare machine, adding on
maintenance and other services at a price, so combining the benefits of
low-cost hardware with customer support.
Yet he may be overestimating the market power of established brand names.
One customer this week, looking at the array of computer power on offer at
Mr Nielsen's north-west London store, agreed price falls had accelerated his
decision to buy his own machine: 'It will be a clone, though. A Dell or
something like that.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Labouring on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWLY elected leader of the Labour party, Mr John Smith, sounds
remarkably like a man who believes that with just a little extra effort on
the part of the opposition the Conservatives will be dismissed at the next
general election. His acceptance speech on Saturday had the tone of a 'one
more heaver', a man not yet ready to entertain the sweeping changes that
will have to be made if Labour is to fulfil its primary function of acting
as an electable alternative government.
Mr Smith did of course talk of change. He touched on many of the issues of
immediate concern to the would-be reformers in his party. Labour must appeal
to women, he intimated. It must attract the green vote and also address
itself to poverty in the developing countries. Constitutional reform will be
high on his agenda. There will also be reform of the internal workings of
the party, which he accepts can no longer be based on the exercise of the
block vote by trade unions. He projected himself as an internationalist, a
good European, leader of a party committed to the social chapter rejected by
Britain at Maastricht. Perhaps most promisingly for Labour's future chances,
he proposed to speak for all the opposition parties, plus disgruntled
Tories.
Thus the desire to broaden the base of his party's support is clearly there.
What is missing is evidence that Mr Smith understands how to set about this
daunting task. His appeal to the altruism of middle-class voters reflects a
genuine moralistic streak within the Labour movement, but the truth is that
successful political parties nearly always reflect the interests of
particular groups of supporters. Labour's traditional working-class base is
steadily shrinking. It has yet to make headway in the south of England. It
must find new ways of appealing to the middle-classes. Nothing that Mr Smith
said on his first day as leader gives reason to believe that Labour is ready
thus to reposition itself in the marketplace of British politics.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Verdi Requiem - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday the 98th BBC Promenade Concerts season was launched with splashes
of ceremony: the Princess of Wales (vigorously cheered) and the Prime
Minister (cheered and booed) arriving in the grand tier, Britten's ingenious
arrangement of the National Anthem to open the three-month festival, the
Albert Hall brilliantly lit - the concert was being transmitted live on
television and radio.
A splashy send-off was deserved. Judged from the printed schedule, this
summer's mixture of works and performers has been gauged by John Drummond,
the Proms Director, with as much skill and cunning as ever. The opening
evenings afforded a choice example of that scheduling skill  - each filled,
entirely or in large part, with one of the large-chorus, large-orchestral
Proms staples that reach out to fill every corner of the great hall with
exhilarating sound.
On Friday it was the Verdi Requiem, in which the BBC Symphony Orchestra and
BBC and LSO choirs were conducted by Andrew Davis; on Saturday, in a Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra concert of English music conducted by Vernon Handley,
it was the Vaughan Williams Sea Symphony, sung by the Brighton Festival
Chorus and London Choral Society. Neither concert lived up to its
printed-page promise; nevertheless, the feelings of gladness that surge in
every Prommer's breast as the season begins, and gratitude for the largesse,
idealism and flair that continue to mark the whole enterprise, survived
untarnished.
The best thing about the Verdi was the unvaried excellence of the combined
choirs: disciplined across an extraordinarily wide dynamic range, sharp of
word and pithy - but also appealingly delicate - of tone and line, never
lapsing into the enthusiastic imprecision that so often afflicts British
choral groups in such circumstances. The playing of the BBC orchestra was
similarly controlled, but tended to point rather more clearly to what I
sense were the limitations of Davis's approach.
It was an expansive interpretation of the Requiem, sensitively and warmly
felt, of a soft-focused, generalised kind. Movement followed movement in a
mode of textural blandness; the Latin temperament of the music - the
instrumental detail and singing line that cry out to be urgently seized and
shaped for dramatic ends - was consistently smoothed out and petted down.
The quality of the solo singing did nothing to restore the balance. This
was, indeed, one of the less well-assorted Verdi Requiem quartets in Proms
history; it was capped by the American Susan Dunn, a soprano whose youthful
vocal velvet, so beautifully demonstrated on records a few years ago, has
got badly frayed in the alarmingly short time.
The best thing about Saturday's RPO concert was Mr Drummond's lively and
affectionate post-interval tribute to the late Charles Groves, who should
have conducted it. The programme was unified by - to put it crudely -
second-rate-ness rather than national identity: Walton's wearisomely
rogueish and cliche ridden Scapino Overture, Delius's mildewed, occasionally
radiant Concerto for Violin and Cello (Tamsin Little and Raphael Wallfisch
the admirably convinced soloists), and then the Sea Symphony in all its
plodding predictability.
Here likewise, an occasional moment of inspired invention comes to provide
relief. But perhaps blame for the overall want of 'lift' in the experience
deserves to fall on the conductor and his executants (hit-and-miss choir,
meat-and-two-veg. orchestra) were responsible: I recall that when Bernard
Haitink and the LPO revived this symphony, some years back, its horizons
appeared far wider, its rhythmic energies far less four-square. At least the
two solo singers, Joan Rodgers (soprano) and Simon Keenlyside (baritone),
brought a touch of unfailing distinction to the proceedings.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Management: Why a local authority sent its scheme to
Coventry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coventry Council's experiment with performance-related pay lasted just 18
months. When the authority withdrew its scheme in 1991, it joined a tiny
minority of organisations which have abandoned the concept.
The case of National Westminster Bank is more typical. Three years after
introducing a PRP bonus system for managers, it launched a review which
showed that the scheme needed to be improved.
The experiences of Coventry and National Westminster both provide insights
for other organisations considering PRP schemes.
Coventry's decision to introduce performance pay for chief officers in 1989
was prompted by a feeling that existing rates were not attracting good
enough candidates for vacancies.
The council opted for the cheaper of two schemes suggested by management
consultants. In retrospect, says Roger Manning, head of employment policy,
the council did not pitch at the correct level. 'We still left ourselves
downmarket.' Partly as a result, a further review was necessary within two
years and by then PRP had gained a bad name at the authority.
Some of the problems stemmed from the rapid introduction of the scheme.
Manning says the first appraisals triggering performance pay were based on
'somewhat arbitrary' judgments. 'People got less than they thought they
might and it was not handled sensitively. We did not take enough time.'
Such difficulties could have been overcome but some of the senior
councillors who had originally been keen on PRP had been replaced by members
who were less comfortable with the time-consuming job of assessing the work
of senior officers they dealt with.
In addition, a new chief executive was not as enthusiastic as his
predecessor and was keen to stress the value of team work in the council.
Resentment surfaced from people below chief officer level, some of whom
believed their contribution was making money for their superior but not for
themselves.
'It became clear that the contribution of chief officers was dependent on
people who worked for them and to them,' says Manning.
'We felt we had to either extend the scheme downwards to make it more
broadly based or we had to come out of it.'
National Westminster's annual bonus scheme for its 6,500 managers was
introduced four years ago to complement other payment mechanisms including a
grading structure and profit sharing. It can add up to 20 per cent to the
salary of junior managers and 30 per cent for executives.
Mike Goodswen, deputy general manager, personnel, says the bonus scheme has
played an important part in reinforcing bank business planning and business
objectives.
However, a survey of employees conducted after three years showed a large
measure of discontent. Some 11 per cent wanted the scheme abolished, while
two-thirds felt it was too bureaucratic. Others felt they were not heavily
enough involved in the target-setting process.
In addition the bank was concerned that the scheme might be too individually
based and jeopardising moves towards team work.
As a result, the scheme has been changed so that payments can only be
triggered when a whole unit meets its targets.
The revised scheme focuses on objectives which apply to all managers in a
unit. However, individual assessments are still made and if a unit pool is
triggered, the unit manager decides how it is distributed. The revised
scheme is also less prescriptive than before.
Previously, written objectives and assessments were agreed between an
individual and his superior. The flow of paper was added to by a
'grandfathering' system, which the superior's superior was required to
supervise.
Under the revised system, grandfathering and the requirement for written
individual assessments have disappeared.
The bank also encourages participants to crunch fewer numbers. 'There is
more of a tendency to assess softer targets such as improving morale of
staff and customer satisfaction rather than just attaining numerical
objectives,' says Goodswen.

Declan Kelly, whose privately owned housebuilding business went into
liquidation 2 1/2 years ago with debts of Pounds 200m, has resurfaced as
chief executive of Durkan Partnership,
The company, a subsidiary of privately owned developers Durkan Holdings,
specialises in building homes for housing associations.
Kelly's appointment marks a return to his roots; in the 1970s he was among
the pioneers of building low-cost homes for housing associations in
partnership with building societies.
A cheerful and enthusiastic Irishman, Kelly ran into trouble after expanding
into speculative private housing development. He says: 'Like many others I
was caught out when interest rates soared and property values fell.'
Since the business failed he has been keeping his hand in by building about
half a dozen homes a year in the west country in partnership with David
Smith, a former director of Declan Kelly Holdings. He has also spent a lot
of time advising the appointed receivers; they are still trying to raise
cash from the failed business which was involved in a string of joint
venture developments.
'Some of the sites have been mothballed by creditor banks which are waiting
for the market to improve. Others were sold almost immediately, but I am
conscious of all the people who are owed money and have been working as hard
as I can to assist,' says Kelly, now 49. 'It has been a horrid two years,
but I like to think I still have more friends than enemies in the industry.'
Building for housing associations, which since the 1989 Housing Act, are
encouraged to raise an increasing proportion of their finance from private
investors, is one of the few growth areas in the housing market. Durkan
Partnerships, which currently builds about 250 homes a year, plans to double
over the next few years, says Kelly.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Management: You pays your money . . . - Performance-related
pay has taken root in British industry over the last decade. But the
programmes have critics among bosses and employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personnel managers in the private sector love it. Their public sector
colleagues are learning to live with it. Employees in both sectors are
attracted to the idea, but often dislike the practice.
During the last decade, individual performance-related pay has taken root in
British service and manufacturing companies. The government's determination
to press ahead with its Citizen's Charter, and its stress on improving
public services, means such systems will be rapidly extended throughout the
public sector.
However public sector employers, and private sector personnel chiefs
thinking about PRP schemes, will need to tread warily. Recent studies show
that such schemes are sometimes clumsily introduced with harmful
consequences for staff morale.
Nor have supporters of performance-related pay been able to convince
sceptics that it has a direct effect on efficiency or productivity. Some
personnel managers who have introduced it admit privately that schemes can
be expensive and they are uncertain whether they motivate people.
Sir Douglas Smith, chairman of Acas, the conciliation service, has detected
a cooling of private sector enthusiasm in the last year. 'Some employers are
questioning whether the rush to performance pay was too fashionable. They
are asking how objective you can be in setting standards in many occupations
and companies. When it becomes too subjective, doubts begin to arise in
people's minds.'
Nonetheless, there is little evidence of schemes being withdrawn. That says
a considerable amount about how robust they are, given their widespread
adoption by British industry.
According to a recent survey by the National Economic Development Office and
the Institute of Personnel Management*, 47 per cent of private sector
companies have PRP schemes for all non-manual grades and a further 21 per
cent were using it for some non-manuals.
PRP is not just a phenomenon of the last decade; about a third of the
schemes surveyed by Nedo and the IPM were more than 10 years old. But the
Thatcher years' emphasis on the individual, the work ethic and industrial
efficiency saw their strongest growth.
Among the attractions of PRP is that, properly administered, it can be
fairer than systems which reward employees merely for long service and do
not discriminate between the good and bad.
Many employers also introduce PRP as one of a series of measures to change
the culture in the workplace. Other changes include improved communication
systems, profit sharing and company health schemes, all designed to to make
individuals associate themselves more closely with their employers.
Not surprisingly, trade unions remain suspicious - and sometimes with good
reason - that the real motive for introducing PRP is to diminish their
power. Ian Kessler and John Purcell**, working from Templeton College,
Oxford, studied nine PRP schemes and found that in at least three cases,
management was consciously trying to weaken union power, even though pay was
not the only weapon employed.
Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white collar rail union, has
no doubt that British Rail aimed to weaken his organisation when it brought
in performance-related pay in 1988 for employees earning between Pounds
13,000 and Pounds 30,000 and derecognised the union for pay bargaining
purposes.
If union leaders are almost universally disparaging about PRP, their members
are often prepared to be more accommodating.
A survey of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation by the London School of
Economics last year found that 57 per cent agreed with the theory of PRP .
The problem was the operation of the scheme, which was introduced in the
late 1980s. Some 80 per cent of respondents said PRP had not improved the
quality or quantity of their work. Nor had it made them work harder.
One clue to their reasoning might be given in one of the responses of
reporting officers, a third of whom thought favouritism was used in
assessments. More than half said PRP demotivated the staff.
According to Vicky Wright, of Hay Management Consultants, mismatches between
theory and practice are common in the private sector if insufficient thought
is given to introducing them. She cites one insurance company where 92 per
cent of employees believed in the concept of PRP but 82 per cent disliked
the current scheme.
What steps, then, should employers take to guard against alienation and
potential failure?
INTEGRATION
Most consultants say the best schemes are introduced in conjunction with
other human resource management techniques and in the context of a
performance management system. Organisations with PMS generally have a
shared vision of objectives, conduct formal reviews of progress towards
targets and evaluate the effectiveness of the process.
That, in turn, requires commitment from top management, both to the scheme
and to training for the personnel beneath them who will put any scheme into
operation and attempt to ensure it is fair.
MONEY
Care should be taken with how money is allocated. The Treasury believes that
one reason why the Inland Revenue's scheme attracted internal criticism was
that payments were restricted only to the highest performers.
Under the new system, currently under negotiation at the Inland Revenue, and
other government departments, every civil servant is likely to have at least
some of his or her pay influenced by performance.
The Treasury has also abandoned a quota systems used in some of the early,
more rudimentary, PRP schemes in the civil service. It believes quotas
caused resentment because civil servants could achieve targets only to find
they were rejected for a performance award because too many colleagues had
also achieved their targets.
Theoretically PRP schemes should be self-financing and most personnel
managers believe they are. Nonetheless, companies should be aware that in
the first year or so, they may incur extra costs in consultancy fees,
training, communication and, in some cases, buying the support of employees
for the scheme against union opposition.
TEAM WORK
Companies introducing PRP also want, as part of another fashionable trend,
to encourage employees to work in teams. The two concepts sometimes clash
with one another because PRP can, if employers are not careful, encourage
employees to compete with one another. They need not. Grand Metropolitan,
for example, encourages its business units to identify team objectives
'where appropriate' in assessing performance pay for managers.
Discrimination
Personal assessments inevitably raise questions about objectivity and there
are particular dangers in discriminating between the sexes. The Equal
Opportunities Commission says that even the most objective systems of
performance pay and appraisal are likely to apply more readily to jobs
performed by men than women.
Organisations guilty of discrimination risk not only alienating their female
workforce but also leaving themselves open to a challenge under European
legislation.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Producers attack network system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT producers have accused the Independent Television Commission of
'failing to discharge its statutory duty' in making fair arrangements for
the ITV network.
The attack, backed up by counsel's opinion, is in a submission from the
Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact) to the Office of Fair
Trading.
The OFT has been given responsibility for ensuring that there are no
anti-competitive elements in the new ITV network arrangements for the next
10 years and that independent producers are not discriminated against.
Among the changes Pact wants are:
A network centre set up as a free-standing company rather than as part of
the ITV trade association.
A separate programme licence for independents who would not have to supply
their programmes through a 'commending' ITV company.
A five-year exclusive licence for programmes instead of the 15 years that
ITV is seeking.
The ITV proposals are also criticised in a submission to the OFT from
lawyers Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones.
In an independent view, Mr Michael Henry, a media lawyer at the firm, says
he believes that the networking arrangements in their present form 'have no
chance whatsoever of satisfying the 'competition test' set out in the
Broadcasting Act.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Asean talks will take up disputes over islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean)
converge in Manila today for discussions this week on concrete programmes to
expand regional co-operation.
The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial
disputes involving three Asean members - China, Vietnam and Taiwan - over
the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea, a quarrel which could
deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil exploration in the area.
The foreign ministers' gathering is their first since the January accord
among the six Asean governments - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Brunei - to transform the region into a free-trade
area by 2007.
They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing
international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and
development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US,
Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Raul Manglapus, chairman of the Asean Standing Committee and Philippines
Foreign Affairs Secretary, said yesterday that the Spratley disputes will
also be discused. The three Asean members involved - Brunei, Malaysia and
the Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan all have claims on the
islands. With the exception of Brunei, all also have troops on some of the
islands, under which may lie oil and gas reserves.
China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to
drill for oil in the disputed territories, and Vietnam recently increased
its campaign by wooing Malaysia to participate in one exploration venture.
Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker
on a reef and had earlier authorised its army to use force, if necessary, to
control the islands.
Nevertheless, Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, has been invited to the
Manila meetings and is expected to hold talks with his Asean counterparts as
a group and individually.
Mr Manglapus said this week's meetings will tackle 'some guidelines (that)
will provide us with the start of a kind of modus vivendi between contesting
nations before a final resolution is arrived at'. And, while analysts are
not optimistic that a definitive end to the disputes can be reached this
week, Mr Manglapus noted 'a strong feeling on the part of our partners (for)
a peaceful solution.'

FT  20 JUL 92 / Britain remains odd one out in low-debt Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK has chosen not to compound the economic pain being suffered
by its European partners, at least for the time being. But it is now not
only possible, but probable, that European interest rates will go up before
they start to fall. Almost every member country of the European exchange
rate mechanism will choose to grit its teeth and bear the pain, while the
dynamic of European politics will require the UK government to follow suit.
But the uniquely British economic predicament will make doing so
particularly costly.
Almost all the information needed to track Europe's monetary mess is
contained in this week's table. The acceleration of Germany's money supply
following unification, the rise in its short-term interest rates, the
virtual disappearance of short-term interest rate differentials between
Germany, France and the UK, and the subsequent divergence between high
European interest rates and falling rates in the US and Japan, these are all
apparent.
The acceleration of German broad money growth this year, combined with the
Bundesbank's recent reaffirmation of its 3 1/2 -5 1/2 per cent target range
for 1992 M3 growth in 1992, suggest that policy in the ERM will remain tight
for some time. If the Bundesbank is serious about meeting this target range,
then it will almost certainly have to raise the European interest rate floor
sometime in the next few months.
A series of interest rate cuts in the US and Japan mean that the stance of
monetary policy, measured by yield gap between short and long-term interest
rates, is now much looser in these countries than in Europe. Yet the stance
of monetary policy is only one determinant of the economic plight of
nations. The US, despite a much looser monetary and fiscal policy, is still
experiencing sluggish economic growth: no faster than either continental
Europe or Japan but much faster than recession-mired Britain.
The missing link is debt. The depth of the US and UK recessions, and absence
of sustained recoveries, are both explained by the uncharacteristic
willingness of consumers to save rather than spend. Consumers in these
countries are still paying the price of past profligacy. The interest
burdens faced by households depend both on the level of interest rates and
the stock of debt; and while the US may have lower interest rates, it also
has a very high stock of consumer debt. The consequence, as the chart shows,
is a very high gross interest burden relative both to the past and to other
countries.
The chart should be interpreted with care. The OECD's Economic Outlook, from
which it comes, cautions against simple cross-country comparison, because of
differences in national definitions of gross interest payments and household
disposable income. Some countries do not record disposable income net of
interest payments, while in others the flow of mortgage interest payments is
not recorded in the national accounts but estimated by national authorities.
Yet the broad trends are clear both within and across countries. The
build-up of household debt in the 1980s was an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon,
concentrated in those countries where financial deregulation encouraged
consumers to borrow. Continental Europe escaped this debt build-up, as did
Japan. While European interest rates are still high, the interest burden
remains comparatively low.
The UK lies, both spatially and economically, somewhere between continental
Europe and America. It combines European interest rates with an Anglo-Saxon
debt burden. Like the US, it is currently trying to pay off rather than
inflate away the outstanding stock of debt, but double digit interest rates
make the cost of doing so much greater. It is little wonder that the UK is
suffering the longest and deepest recession of any developed country. The US
experience does not suggest that even a sharp cut in UK interest rates would
fuel more than a limp recovery. But for the present, even that remains a
distant hope.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Spain acts to haltrunaway deficit

THE SPANISH government will tomorrow attempt to bring its runaway public
finances under control by announcing a risky fiscal package designed to cut
this year's deficit by Dollars 3.26bn (Pounds 1.7bn).
The Finance Ministry, which has admitted it has badly miscalculated the
effect the slowdown in the economy would have on tax revenues, is expected
to announce an immediate increase in the top rate of value added tax from 13
per cent to 15 per cent, an increase in the tax on personal incomes, and
spending cuts expected to affect most ministries.
Such an increase in VAT, six months before Spain would have been obliged to
introduce it under European Community tax harmonisation agreements, will
increase revenues for the rest of this year by about Dollars 900m. The
government is hoping to take in an extra Dollars 400m by withholding more
tax. Madrid had been forecasting revenues of Dollars 128bn in 1992 but had
reached only Dollars 54bn by the end of June.
It has struggled also to find budget cuts of around Dollars 1.9bn for the
rest of this year - with roughly 80 per cent of government spending already
committed. This compares with the Dollars 3.5bn it was forced to cut this
time last year when faced with a similar crisis. Now, though, the government
has come under pressure from the ruling socialists not to cut social
spending as a general election must be held by October 1993 at the latest.
The budget deficit in the first six months of 1992 was more than 40 per cent
over target, making it impossible to lower the deficit from 4.4 per cent of
gross domestic product last year to 2.6 per cent as pledged in plans
presented to the EC. The measures to be announced tomorrow will attempt to
re-establish that target, although a VAT increase is likely to damage
efforts to end the year with inflation of below 6 per cent.

THE DEFENCE ministers of the four partner countries in the ailing
Eurofighter consortium are expected to meet in Madrid on August 4, in an
effort to persuade Germany not to pull out of the project, according to
industry officials.
Proposals for going ahead with a substantially cheaper version of the
aircraft - at least as far as Germany is concerned - are likely to be
discussed.
Britain, Italy and Spain remain committed to the European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA) project, although all three defence ministers, who met in London last
week, agreed they would also like to see significant savings. Spain in
particular is understood to be sympathetic to the German position.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, says he wants to see an
entirely different aircraft developed, more appropriate to the post-cold war
security threat in the year 2000, if possible using the development funds
committed to the EFA. Germany has so far spent some DM3bn (Pounds 1bn) out
of total development funds allocated by Bonn of nearly DM6bn.
Industry and defence ministry experts in the management agency with overall
responsibility for the Eurofighter met in Munich last Thursday to discuss
the state of the aircraft development programme, in the light of Germany's
decision not to go ahead with full-scale production from 1993.
According to a report in the Welt am Sonntag Sunday newspaper in Germany,
they agreed that it would be possible to reduce the 'lifetime cost' of the
aircraft by 25 per cent - from the current estimate of DM133.4m per
aircraft, to just DM99.8m. This would be managed primarily by not installing
some of the more sophisticated items and software.
Although the details of the newspaper report could not be confirmed, the
German defence ministry said a regular meeting of the Eurofighter management
agency had taken place. However, it was a routine meeting without any
special items on the agenda.
He confirmed that Mr Ruhe was going to Madrid on August 4, but the purpose
of the visit was to meet his Spanish counterpart, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas,
for a first bilateral exchange since he (Mr Ruhe) took office. It would be a
brief visit but, if the other defence ministers were invited, he was happy
to meet them.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Baker ducks questions on campaign role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jamer Baker, US Secretary of State, has left open the possibility that he
will shortly give up his post to run President George Bush's re-election
campaign, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
En route to the Middle East at the weekend he repeatedly ducked questions on
his next step.
Last week he spent two days on a private fishing trip with Mr Bush, during
which the question was discusssed.
The arguments in favour of a reshuffle at the top of the Bush campaign has
been reinforced by a surge in support for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
party nominee, after a successful convention in New York last week and the
sudden withdrawal of Mr Ross Perot as a prospective independent candidate.
Most polls give Mr Clinton a lead of more than 20 points over Mr Bush. Even
though Democrats concede this must be a temporary phenomenon, it was the
biggest convention 'bounce' a candidate has received in polling memory.
There also could be no disguising the large and enthusiastic crowds greeting
Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, on their campaign swing in
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the start of a 1,000 mile, six-state bus
journey from New York to St Louis through important rust-belt states.
The immediate Republican response, a clear harbinger of the campaign to
come, has been to portray Mr Clinton and Mr Gore as liberals from the
standard 'tax and spend' Democratic tradition.
The Republicans have also begun an attempt to pick Mr Clinton's character
apart. The initial spear carrier was Senator Jake Garn of Utah who, at a
Bush campaign rally in Provo and in the president's presence, derided Mr
Clinton and Mr Gore as 'pretty boys'.
Mr Garn attacked Mr Clinton for enrolling in the military reserves to avoid
being drafted to fight in Vietnam, saying that to have fled to Canada would
have been better.
Mr Bush did not join in the onslaught on Mr Clinton, implying that at least
until after the Republican convention next month in Houston the president
will let his surrogates do the dirty work while he takes the high road.
The problem for Mr Bush is that he is still not articulating any vision of
his own, preferring to blame Democratic control of Congress for the
frustration of his policies.
This is where Mr Baker's known knack for projecting policies would be
invaluable. A few more bad polls for the president and the demands for his
return may become deafening.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE investigation into political corruption in Milan took another turn at
the weekend with the announcement that Mr Silvio Lega, assistant secretary
of the Christian Democrat party, had been served with an advisory warrant.
Mr Lega, 47, is being canvassed as the most likely successor to Mr Arnaldo
Forlani in the key post of Christian Democrat secretary-general. Mr Forlani
resigned last month after failing to obtain sufficient support for his
attempts to become Italian president.
Mr Lega, a deputy from Turin, has been seen as having the necessary youth
and dynamism to revive the party's fortunes after its share of the vote fell
to 29 per cent in April's general elections.
He is being investigated for alleged illicit financing of political parties,
along with fellow deputy Bruno Tabacchi, former Christian Democrat president
of the Lombardy region. Both said they had nothing to hide.
Their alleged involvement brings to almost 70 the number of politicians,
local and national, connected by Milan magistrates to a sophisticated system
of rigged contracts and political kick-backs.
Mr Salvatore Ligresti, Milan's construction supremo, was arrested last week
for alleged payment of bribes to secure public works contracts.
The next step in Mr Lega's case will be a request to have his parliamentary
immunity waived. This has already happened in the case of five deputies
linked to the Milan affair.
The most damaging aspect of Mr Lega's alleged involvement is the nature of
the accusations. Mr Maurizio Prada, a senior Christian Democrat politician
in Milan arrested earlier in the magistrates' inquiries, has alleged that
some of the money he collected through bribes and contract commissions were
handed over to the national party.
Christian Democrat officials maintained over the weekend that Mr Prada was
spitefully incriminating others after his recent expulsion from the party.
But such accusations and counter-charges will affect the forthcoming
election of a new party secretary.
The Milan corruption scandal also promises further developments on the
contractors' side. Mr Ligresti is said to be co-operating with the
investigation and for the first time since his arrest two months ago Mr Enzo
Papi, the managing director of Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's construction group,
is beginning to talk.

FT  20 JUL 92 / EC anti-trust fears over Nestle bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL anti-trust authorities are concerned that European Commission
approval of a FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) bid by Nestle, the world's largest
food group, for Perrier, the French mineral water group, would set worrying
new precedents in EC competition policy.
European commissioners are likely to approve the deal, probably this
Wednesday, on condition that Nestle sells off eight mineral water springs to
a single buyer.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, names four of the brands to
be sold, including Saint Yorre, but Nestle/Perrier will be able to keep the
best-known brand-names.
The springs for sale have a capacity of about 3bn litres of still and
sparkling water - 20 per cent of the French mineral water market. But some
hardline national competition authorities believe Brussels should have based
its decision on the existing market, rather than on future capacity.
The hardliners - which include Britain's Office of Fair Trading and
Germany's Bundeskartellamt - are also upset that Nestle will be allowed to
proceed with its contract to sell the Volvic brand to BSN, the French food
group. 'In public, (the Commission) will try to present the solution in
competition terms, but if you look deeper into this you will find there are
no real competition arguments,' one national official said.
Some commissioners, and the Commission's legal service, have also found
flaws in the radical proposal.
For example, some of Sir Leon's colleagues believe that because it seems to
dictate the shape of the French mineral water market, the proposal is really
interventionism disguised as competition policy.
Others point out the Commission is legally unable to prevent the third party
which buys the Nestle/Perrier brands from selling them on to BSN. That would
defeat the object - to prevent Nestle and BSN building a 'duopoly' of the
French market.
If the recommendation is approved, it could widen the scope of the
Commission's merger authorities to examine potential duopolies and
oligopolies - two or more large players carving up a market.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Rover's new plant dispels speculation over Cowley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP, the carmaking subsidiary of British Aerospace, today opens a
Pounds 200m manufacturing centre at its Cowley complex in Oxfordshire  - the
company's biggest single production investment since its privatisation in
1988.
Construction of the centre, which includes a large assembly hall and new
robotic systems to make car bodies, dispels years of speculation that
Rover's long-term intention was to close the sprawling Cowley operation with
the loss of its remaining jobs. The 220-acre site employs more than 3,000
people.
The investment, which provides Rover, formerly BL, with what it claims is
one of Europe's most advanced and flexible car plants, underlines the
company's 'total commitment' to manufacturing at Cowley, according to Mr
John Towers, Rover managing director.
The plant, capable of producing 110,000 cars a year on two shifts, has begun
producing the latest versions of Rover's 800-series executive car range in
the last few weeks, but is being opened today by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
Later this year the 360,000 sq ft assembly hall will also start producing
the Synchro, a medium-sized saloon developed jointly with Honda.
Assembly of the ageing Maestro and Montego models is being moved from the
nearby Cowley South Works to a 'lower-volume' assembly facility within the
new complex, which will also produce a limited edition MG - the RV 8 - to be
launched in September.
Cowley North Works, where the Rover 800 has been built for the past six
years, is ceasing car assembly and the South Works is to close by the end of
the year. The only job losses will be through natural wastage.
The new facility is not expected to add significantly to Rover's output. Mr
Towers said the company expected combined production from Cowley and its
Birmingham plants not to exceed 550,000 a year for the foreseeable future.
Rover had no intention of seeking to regain its former status as a volume
manufacturer.
Rover said that planning permission had just been received for the two old
Cowley sites to be turned into a business park expected to create 5,000 jobs
for a variety of companies.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (8): An innovative
way of raising money - The vogue for securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE global market for asset-backed, or securitised, debt has expanded
further this year, but development is being hampered by regulatory
roadblocks in nascent markets and by the effects of economic recession in
the more mature markets.
The year has been marked by a number of innovative deals, such as the first
securitisation of Latin American government debt, and GPA Group's
ground-breaking Dollars 500m issue backed by aircraft leases.
In securitisation, an issuer removes assets from its balance sheet and
repackages them as bonds which are then sold to investors.
In the US, by far the world's largest market, the decline in consumer credit
has led to a decrease in activity in some areas of the asset-backed market.
Total asset-backed issuance for the first half of 1992 reached Dollars
22.13bn, 5 per cent below 1991, according CapMac's ABS MarketWatch, a
newsletter published by one of the market's specialist insurers.
Demand for loans has dropped sharply, and consumer installment credit has
been declining as a percentage of income since late 1989.
Meanwhile, better access to equity markets has allowed many banks to
strengthen their balance sheets, so the drive to meet regulatory
capital-to-assets ratios is no longer a key motivation for banks to shed
assets.
However, the US market still has considerable growth potential.
Securitisation of some assets, such as car and boat loans, is on the
increase. As a percentage of total installment debt, securitisation is
growing steadily. Penetration of the credit card market is substantial and
securitisation in the car loan sector represents less than 10 per cent of
the total available, according to estimates by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agency.
The lack of supply has boosted demand, as the low interest rate environment
in the US encouraged investors to buy securities offering yields above the
US Treasury market. In June, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, the
Japanese car manufacturer's US financing arm, paid a yield spread only 40
basis points above the comparable US Treasury rate for a Dollars 600m issue
of bonds backed by car loans, a full 20 basis points below the previous
record low spread. The same week, MBNA, the US bank, set a record low yield
spread of 55 basis points on a Dollars 500m issue of credit card-backed
bonds.
Analysts believe that when the economy begins to heat up, demand for loans
will re-emerge, bringing bank liquidity under renewed pressure and fuelling
bank demand for capital. At that point, securitisation will again become an
attractive alternative source of funds for banks.
Meanwhile, the US mortgage-backed market has come through a potentially
traumatic period in surprisingly good shape.
The Dollars 1,000bn sector has experienced record volume so far this year,
after lower interest rates prompted homeowners to prepay existing mortgages
and take out new debt at lower rates, triggering early redemption of
billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities. Despite the negative
impact of prepayment, demand for the surge of fresh paper has remained firm,
with high levels of re-investment reported.
In addition, the market 'has been a direct beneficiary of new capital
requirements', said Mr Michael Waldman, head of mortgage research at Salomon
Brothers, since mortgage-backed securities command a low risk weighting,
increasing their attractiveness for US banks.
Under Basle capital adequacy guidelines, securities backed by the Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) carry a 20 per cent risk
weighting in the US.
In the UK, the most developed market outside the US, the depressed state of
the housing market continues to cast a pall over the sterling
mortgage-backed sector. Together with the deteriorating credit quality of
several UK composite insurers, which provide some credit enhancement, the
housing slump has led to a number of downgradings in the Pounds 12bn market.
Also, the continued threat that bank investors may have to apply a 100 per
cent risk weighting, when capital guidelines come into effect in 1993, has
reduced the most important pool of investors in the UK.
Increasingly wary of credit quality, investors have been demanding higher
yields and tailor-made structures. Although that has kept the market alive,
'attention has been diverted away from the fundamentals of establishing a
homogeneous product, considered both dependable and attractive by the
investment community,' according to Mr Mark Stadler, head of securitisation
at Merrill Lynch in London.
Elsewhere in Europe, long-expected moves to create a more friendly
environment for securitisation are on the way. France, which introduced its
securitisation law in 1988, is set to broaden the types of assets which can
be securitised, though credit card receivables are still not likely to be
allowed due to fears of a credit card boom.
Spain also looks promising, after legislators passed a law allowing the
creation of closed-end funds which will act as issuing vehicles; but tax
treatment still has to be clarified.
In Japan, where banks and other financial institutions short of capital
would clearly benefit from being allowed to securitise assets, a
long-awaited package of reforms has disappointed market participants.
Such restrictions are likely to limit the marketability of such debt in the
domestic market, according to analysts. Also, a forbidding range of
authorisation from various government departments is still required before
companies can proceed, leading Moody's to conclude in a recent report that
the easing of Japan's regulations 'is more a signal of regulatory
willingness to consider asset securitisation than approval to proceed'.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (7): The rest of the
year will be tougher - Prospects for attracting international equity
investors are deteriorating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES HAVE raised a record amount of money through international equity
offerings in the first six months of this year, helped by the buoyant
underlying tone of the world stock markets.
However, investment bankers are doubtful about the ability of companies to
coax as much money from international equity investors in the second half of
this year, given the recent fall in world stock markets.
Already, several equity offerings have been cancelled or postponed as
companies await an improvement in market conditions.
Companies raised a total of Dollars 12.9bn from the international equity
markets in the first half of 1992, using an array of initial public
offerings, primary and secondary issues. This compares with Dollars 8.98bn
in the first half of 1991, Dollars 7.4bn in the second half, according to
data supplied by International Financing Review.
The success of these international offerings - which have ranged from US
companies seeking to reduce their debt/equity (or gearing) ratios to
formerly state-owned Latin American enterprises making their debut in the
international capital markets - is attributable partly to the strong
underlying tone seen in many of the world stock markets at the beginning of
the year.
In terms of geographical breakdown, international investors have three main
areas from which to choose: the US, Europe and the emerging markets, of
which the Latin American countries have proved the most popular in the last
year.
US companies have been a prolific source of new issues in the last six
months, as corporate America has been keen to reduce high gearing levels and
pay back some debt. Altogether, US companies raised Dollars 5.08bn - or
roughly the same as in the whole of 1991 - of which Dollars 1.18bn came from
initial public offerings, Dollars 2.73bn from primary issues and the
remainder from secondary issues. Nearly half of the total was raised by a
single company - General Motors - which drew Dollars 2.14bn from investors
in May in the biggest ever stock offering by a US company.
Western Europe has also provided investors with a steady stream of issues,
raising Dollars 2.19bn altogether. Provided the market conditions are
favourable, Europe could prove the source of several international equity
offerings in the remainder of this year, particularly as countries such as
France and Sweden have embarked on extensive privatisation programmes.
Following the successful partial privatisation of Total, the French oil
group, last month (when the state sold a 19 per cent stake for FFr9.5bn),
the government is expected to push ahead with the sale of shares in the
state-controlled insurance companies. Meanwhile, in Sweden the centre-right
government has already started its disposal of state-controlled assets with
the SKr1.85bn sale of shares in SSAB, the steel group. However, this issue
is small fry compared with the estimated SKr18bn which the sale of the
state's stake in Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group, is expected
to raise this autumn.
The area which is becoming increasingly significant is that of the emerging
markets. The last 12-18 months has seen a regular flow of issues from Latin
American countries, particularly Mexico, which has become such a familiar
feature on the international equities landscape that some overseas investors
now regard it as an 'emerged' rather than an emerging market.
Several partial privatisations and initial public offerings in Mexico have
attracted a strong response from international (particularly US) investors.
Altogether, Latin American companies raised Dollars 4.2bn in new issues,
with Mexico accounting for Dollars 2.76bn of the total. This compares with
Dollars 2.05bn raised by Mexican companies in the first half of 1991, when
Mexico was the only Latin American country to use the international equity
markets.
As some of these markets become more mature, investors seek ever newer and
more exotic emerging markets in the hope of reaping ever-larger rewards.
The most recent novelties have included China (where opportunities for
foreign investors remain very limited with only a dozen or so listed
companies offering shares in which foreigners may invest) and India (where
the government has removed restrictions on Indian companies tapping the
international capital markets).
'If you go back to the early 1980s, people used to giggle if you mentioned
investing in Spain and Italy - now those are acceptable markets,' says Mr
Daniel Smaller, executive director of the emerging markets group at Lehman
Brothers International where research is focusing on some of the newer, less
developed markets.
Despite the upbeat start to 1992, few investment bankers are prepared to bet
on a similarly successful second half. The recent bout of bearishness in
some of the equity markets has hit a handful of new issues already.
GPA, the aircraft leasing group, had to cancel its Dollars 800m global
flotation last month due to lack of investor interest, while in the US, Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up, the soft drink manufacturer, cancelled its Dollars 600m
public offering earlier this month because of unfavourable market
conditions.
Several US flotations have run into problems at the last minute because of
weakness in the market.
While 1992 has witnessed a bumper first half for international equity
offerings, the prospects for the second half remain rather uncertain.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (6): End of the
rapid growth - Global swaps have reached their peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOBAL swaps market, after a number of years of rapid expansion, is
undergoing a period of adjustment.
Fuelled in the early years by new-issue driven business, the market is now
available to a broader range of users for a number of purposes. The market
is also facing increasing pressure from regulators, who have expressed some
concern about the risks involved in the swaps business.
Since the International Swap Dealers Association, the industry's trade body,
started tracking volume, the total amount of swaps outstanding has risen
from Dollars 900bn in 1987, to an estimated Dollars 4,000bn by the end of
1991. Most analysts believe that this period of rapid growth is coming to an
end. 'The rate of growth will slow (in interest rate and cross-currency
swaps). Most significant players are in the market now,' explains Mr Malcolm
Basing, the association's chairman, and global head of swaps at Swiss Bank
Corporation.
The changing nature of global markets has forced important adjustments. At
its inception, the swaps market took advantage of anomalies between markets
to allow borrowers to reduce their funding costs. For example, a UK company
needing to raise funds in dollars might have to pay a premium to tap the US
market, because its credit was unfamiliar to the relevant investor base. The
swaps market allowed such a borrower to tap the most favourable market in
terms of investor demand - in this case the sterling bond market - and then
to swap the proceeds into the required currency. Swaps, however, were always
a smaller portion of the market than interest rate swaps. In earlier years,
because retail investors, then numerous, were unsophisticated in assessing
the value of bonds, borrowers could often issue fixed-rate bonds and swap
the proceeds into floating-rate funds at a level substantially below the
London interbank offered rate.
But the development of global markets has gradually ironed out these
opportunities. The last 10 years have been a period of substantial
deregulation, breaking down the boundaries within and between countries, and
consequently eradicating arbitrage opportunities between markets.
In addition, the growing sophistication of swap dealers themselves means
that any opportunities are swiftly arbitraged. 'By its nature, arbitrage
removes the pricing gap that was its raison d'etre. I don't believe there
will be a return to the sort of arbitrage opportunities available in the
past,' Mr Basing says.
However, tight swap spreads are also a function of current views on interest
rates, and of supply and demand, so changes in market trends should prompt
widening spreads.
But swap spreads - the differential between the yield on the government bond
and on the comparable swap - have now tightened to historically narrow
levels, making it almost impossible for most borrowers to swap fixed-rate
funds, except at margins often well above Libor.
While the proportion of new issue business has waned, other participants
have entered the market, as a broader range of institutions have become
familiar with swap market techniques.
Companies, which used to be concerned merely with finding cheaper ways of
raising primary debt, are much more attuned these days to the ongoing
management of their liabilities, and frequently use the swaps market to
adjust their interest rate.
New techniques have been developed, allowing fund managers to swap assets.
The developing equity swaps market allows a fund manager to change his
exposure without buying or selling assets. For example, a fund manager can
gain exposure to the US stock market without changing his physical portfolio
by entering an agreement with a counterparty to pay, say, three-month Libor,
and to receive the return on the S&amp;P 1000 index.
Similar techniques using commodities now allow oil companies - or transport
companies which need to consume large amounts of oil - to reduce their
exposure to the price changes.
Meanwhile, the swaps market is also fighting a rearguard action against
regulators. In the US, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's
re-authorisation Bill, which is winding its way through Congress, will,
practitioners hope, provide legal clarification on the status of swaps. Swap
market practitioners are keen to have the distinction between swaps and
futures enshrined, as they fear attempts to force their business on to
regulated off-market exchanges. Such a move in the US market is likely to
drive business offshore.
Clarifying an earlier statement on the legislation, Mr Gerald Corrigan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wrote recently to
Congressman Dan Glickman: 'My remarks were not intended to suggest that
swaps are, or should be treated as, futures. It is exceedingly difficult for
me to see how swaps could be traded on organised exchanges, given that so
many swaps are custom-tailored for specific purposes and uses.'
However, he reiterated his view that 'swaps and other off-balance sheet
activities do need a closer degree of managerial and supervisory attention'
and suggested 'more systemic and comprehensive application of official
capital standards to these activities'.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (2): Chill from
Denmark - Gilts dulled by EC doubts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets started the year in bullish mood, after EC
leaders reached agreement on European monetary union at Maastricht last
December. But their enthusiasm was soon dampened by growing concerns about
political risk.
The Danish vote against ratification of the Maastricht treaty in June came
as a bolt from the blue, sending European bond markets into turmoil. While
an uneasy calm has now returned, investors and traders are still reeling.
The uncertainty seems certain to linger over European bond markets at least
until the French referendum on the issue on September 20. By this stage, the
prospects for European monetary union should have been clarified.
But economic conditions for most European markets are still broadly
positive. 'The European environment is fairly friendly to bond markets,'
argues Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg. Real interest
rates are rising, fiscal policy is mostly under control, and inflation is
not only falling, but falling at a surprisingly quick pace.
'The only thing holding European bond markets back is the question of the
timing of interest rate cuts,' argues Mr Juckes. 'When they start to come,
we will see bonds perform well.'
In the meantime, the French referendum could well provide a potent injection
of volatility. Only the German and Dutch bond markets are likely to be
immune, if traders get a renewed attack of the jitters about European
monetary union.
Consequently, Germany and Holland are likely to be the main beneficiaries of
any new money invested in European markets ahead of the referendum.
Meanwhile, the repercussions of the Danish vote are still being felt. In
early July, the Bank of Italy raised the discount rate by a full percentage
point to 13 per cent, in an effort to stabilise the lira and fend off
devaluation rumours, which had triggered heavy speculative selling of the
currency.
Investors are questioning the new Italian government's ability to control
its budget deficit: there is no longer an assumption that targets set by
Maastricht will be met.
Italian bonds are now trading at a yield spread of around 540 basis points
above the German Bund market. That implies a devaluation of the lira
amounting to 25 per cent in the next five years.
The Spanish market, which was also sold off dramatically after the Danish
referendum, has recovered better than the Italian market. 'In the longer
term, the market still has excellent prospects,' argues Mr Major. Investors
still believe in Spain's convergence plan.
Still, he expects Spanish bonds to trade in a spread range of 350 - 380
basis points above the Bund curve, until the French vote. Sterling, which
had been trading in a narrow range, has also come under pressure, damaging
sentiment in the gilt market. Until now, gilts have performed outstandingly,
with a particularly sharp rally following the reelection of the Conservative
government earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, according
to the JP Morgan Government Bond Index, gilts offered returns of close to 8
per cent for sterling-based investors, and of 9.8 per cent for dollar based
investors, outperforming all major markets.
But the recent pressure on sterling has dimmed speculations of an early rate
cut, and the gilts market's advance may also have stalled.
The tone of the French bond market has also been undermined by the prospect
of further setbacks to the Maastricht treaty. The issue has become highly
politicised in France, so that a vote for Maastricht is being touted as a
vote for President Mitterrand. Consequently, the markets are now viewing the
matter as fraught with political as well as economic implications.
The September referendum is likely to remain a focus for investors
throughout the generally quieter summer months.
'If the French say 'no' there will be a major sell-off in the
higher-yielders,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income at Legal General,
the UK insurer. 'We got half of it with Denmark - we would get the other
half with France.'
Meanwhile, the continuing strength of the US Treasury markets continues to
defy expectations. The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession
caused a further cut in the discount rate by half a point to three per cent
in early July. However, fund managers are becoming increasingly hungry for
yield, given the low yields available on government debt. In addition, with
short-term interest rates at historically low levels, investors are
increasingly focusing on the long end of the very positive yield curve.
Despite the problems facing the European bond markets, they nevertheless
outperformed other markets in the first half of the year, for both dollar
and sterling-based investors. According to the JP Morgan index, European
bond markets offered returns of nearly 3 per cent in sterling and 4.7 per
cent in dollars, compared with 1.4 per cent in sterling and 3.2 per cent in
dollars globally.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (3): Directors'
dilemma - Companies widen their search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE search for reliable sources of debt finance is likely to be one of the
central concerns of companies and corporate financiers in the 1990s.
One reason is that the level of corporate borrowing has risen sharply over
the past decade. But there are also concerns that banks - working to restore
profitability and lending margins - will be less willing providers of debt
finance over the next few years.
The growth of corporate indebtedness was a strong feature of the US and UK
economies in the 1980s. In the US, company debt rose from 36 per cent of
gross national product to 49 per cent of GNP over the decade, according to
figures from the Bank for International Settlements. In the UK, the
proportion rose from 41 per cent to 82 per cent in the same period.
The over-hang of corporate debt concerns policy makers. In January, for
example, the US treasury proposed a phased removal of tax relief on debt
service payments. The measure would, it hopes, stop companies over-borrowing
next time around the economic cycle.
From companies' perspective, however, increased dependence on fixed-term
debt finance has led to additional 'funding risk' - since borrowings need to
be refinanced periodically whatever the state of the markets. For example,
this year and next many UK companies must refinance cheap syndicated bank
credits arranged in 1987/1988.
So far, refinancing has taken place with barely a hitch. However, some high
profile cases of corporate distress have convinced many companies that banks
are unreliable sources of finance.
One response by companies has been to reduce the number of banks from which
they borrow. Most big syndicated loans have been refinanced by bi-lateral
lending agreements or smaller, semi-syndicated credits.
For example, last year Grand Metropolitan arranged a Dollars 2.5bn four-year
loan to refinance an expiring three-year facility. The number of banks
involved in the deal was cut to 34 from more than 60.
At 37.5 basis points over Libor, the interest margin was higher than the 25
basis points over Libor Grandmet paid in 1988. However, the company believed
it had more leverage over the lending banks by restricting the number of
banks with which it was prepared to deal.
Other UK corporations look set to follow a similar route. This month Rank
Hovis McDougall, the foods group, is replacing a Pounds 250m multi-option
facility with a smaller, simpler syndicated credit.
Companies are also keen to diversify sources of funding, raising cash from
institutional investors in the bond market to supplement bank lines. By
funding core borrowings in the bond market, bank credit lines are free to
meet short-term financing requirements.
However, by no means all UK companies have access to the public bond
markets. Since 1987, only 31 UK companies - some of them banks and other
financial institutions - have made more than five Eurobond issues. Bankers
estimated that only perhaps the top 50 UK companies have access to the
public bond market.
Others companies must be more subtle. Investment bankers see great potential
in raising institutional funding for 'second tier' UK corporations.
For example, last year four smaller brewery companies clubbed together to
make a bond issue through an innovative joint venture company. The structure
has also been used by investment trust companies and could be applied to
other industrial sectors.
Smaller UK companies have also placed bonds privately with institutional
investors in the US. Even mid-sized companies such as Senior Engineering,
which has a turnover of around Pounds 300m, have raised long-term debt
finance from US institutions.
UK investment institutions generally remain more conservative. The sterling
private placement market is far smaller. Kleinwort Benson, for example,
estimates that it has raised Pounds 500m for UK companies from private
placements over the last year. But investors tend to be other companies
investing surplus liquidity, rather than investment institutions. Hence most
placements are short-term, rarely more than two-years maturity.
UK company treasurers would like to see the development of a more open
sterling bond market. This is unlikely, however, unless UK institutional
investors switch substantial amounts of cash from the equity market and into
fixed-income investment.
Sterling bonds account for just three per cent of the average UK pension
fund portfolio, with the majority of this modest amount devoted to
government securities. There are early signs of change, with some
institutions starting to nudge fixed-interest investment higher. However,
even if this trend continues it will take years for a deep, flexible
sterling bond market to develop.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (4): Painful
reassessment - Japan share price fall ends flow of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP fall in Japanese share prices has choked off the flow of cheap
funds, generated by the bull market of the late 1980s.
The activities of Japanese financial institutions and corporations, which
grew into leading lenders, investors and borrowers in the international
capital markets, have declined sharply.
Japan's leading banks, the big lenders of the 1980s, have shifted their
strategies from expanding internationally in search of overseas projects to
a more conscientious stance.
The financial institutions have also been hit by the increase in bad loans
and investments, especially in the international real estate markets.
'Japanese banks are assessing risks more carefully, setting higher margins,
and curbing international activities by focusing lending to domestic
companies,' says Sakura Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank.
The banks are feeling the effects of the capital adequacy standards set by
the Bank for International Settlements, and many are cutting back on
lending, weeding out unprofitable business, and favouring old-established
blue chip Japanese companies over other customers.
Because banks count a portion of their stock portfolios as capital, the fall
in portfolio values reduced their capital reserves. Losses on securities
portfolios, which amounted to Y828.7bn at the end of last March, were 11
times higher than the previous fiscal year.
Sakura says it has restructured its international corporate lending division
so that it can comprehensively review a company's relationship with the
bank, its profit prospects and the profitability for Sakura.
However, the bank says it has not consciously cut back on corporate lending.
'The number of companies which we could lend to declined due to the setting
of higher standards for lending,' says a Sakura official.
He admits that in the financial boom of the late 1980s, lending habits at
Japanese banks became 'abnormal', and many banks were 'dumping' loans.
'Things are back to normal now.'
The slowdown in the Japanese economy has depressed demand for funds and,
together with the slump in the stock markets, has depressed the financial
activity of Japanese companies in international capital markets. Japanese
companies raised a total of Y5,976bn in the fiscal year to March in
equity-linked issues in domestic and overseas markets, down 68 per cent from
two years ago.
However, demand for funds from companies facing repayments on equity-linked
issues launched in the height of the bull market is expected to rise later
in the year. According to Daiwa Securities, Japanese companies will see a
total of Y6,950bn equity-linked debt mature in the year ending March 1993.
The amount is expected to rise to Y9,000bn in the year ending March 1994.
An alternative means of funding is through straight bonds.
More companies are dipping into the straight bond market, and last fiscal
year, companies raised Y6,303.8bn, which was 3.4 times more than in fiscal
year 1989.
The government has indicated it is ready to ease limits on corporate bond
issuance, allowing a broader range of companies to raise funds. The
dismantling of the barrier between the banking and securities industries
will allow banks to enter the underwriting business, currently dominated by
leading securities houses.
The commission-bank system, in which every issue has a bank that acts as an
agent representing investors, is also set to be abolished. Corporate bonds
with shorter maturities are expected to lead to a larger and more liquid
corporate bond market.
Loans by life insurance companies are also an option for companies. The
monthly outstanding loan balance has continued to grow sharply. According to
the Bank of Japan, the amounts of loans extended by 27 life insurance
companies at the end of February rose by 11.5 per cent to Y51,290bn.
Life assurers are trying to increase their lending activities, and some hope
to allot over a quarter of new money this fiscal year to corporate loans.
Meanwhile, as investors, Japanese institutions have started to take a
cautious stance toward international activity. The sharp falls in the stock
market have eroded gains on portfolios, and new money for investment has
declined due to falls in profits. Last year, Japanese investors bought a net
Dollars 3.6bn in equity investments, down 80 per cent from 1989, while a net
Dollars 68.2bn was purchased in bonds, a 27 per cent fall.
However, Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, points
out that, despite heavy selling of US stocks and bonds by Japanese
institutions, the treasury bond market and stock markets have rallied.
'There's less impact than most foreigners worry about,' he says.

FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (1): Changes of
emphasis - Bank lending last year fell because of the economic slowdown and
the prospect of new rules on capital adequacy. The vacuum has been partly
filled by the bond markets, which grew dramatically during the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FACTS stand out from the shifting patterns of international capital
flows on the financial map: the crumbling of international bank credit, and
the expansion of bond markets.
The fall-off in bank lending reached a critical stage last year. For the
first time since records began, international bank lending actually
contracted. Cross-border lending fell by 1 per cent, or Dollars 102bn. This
was all the more notable, given that it followed six years in which bank
lending had grown by more than 10 per cent a year,
The reasons for retrenchment in the banking industry have been
well-rehearsed. Banks around the world need to bolster their resources ahead
of new rules on capital adequacy, developed by the Basle Committee of
banking supervision, which come into force from the end of this year. That
has involved concentrating on profits and cutting back lending undertaken at
unrealistically tight margins during the 1980s.
At the same time, the worldwide economic slowdown and a near-collapse in
property values in several major economies have hit bank balance sheets
hard.
The effect has been most marked in Japan, where falling share prices, a
property collapse and a slowing economy have combined to deliver a nasty
shock to a banking industry which had grown bloated on cheap deposits.
By the end of 1991, Japanese banks accounted for 31 per cent of outstanding
international bank loans, well down from the peak of 38 per cent in 1988.
In spite of this retrenchment, there are few signs of a credit crunch.
Economic slowdown has so far stunted the demand for new credit. In its
latest annual report, the Bank for International Settlements, the
international bankers' club, blames high debt levels in the private sector
for the retrenchment.
'In most countries the credit slowdown appears to have reflected more a
decline in demand for borrowing than an inordinate reluctance of markets to
grant credit,' it concludes.
Small and medium-sized companies, whose access to credit has been cut off
most sharply, may not agree with this relatively sanguine view of credit
conditions.
Also, fears remain about the extent to which banks would be able and willing
to finance any revival in the world economy.
Part of the vacuum left by banks has been filled by the bond markets. The
growth of the international bond market was one of the most notable
financial phenomena of the 1980s, as private sector borrowers in particular
moved outside the narrow contraints of their domestic capital markets in
search of the cheapest possible borrowing.
By the end of the decade, companies had tapped the international bond market
for the equivalent of more than a fifth of their total bond market
borrowings.
The bond markets paused briefly after 1986, as banks seemingly strove to
outdo each other in financing the dizzying rise in property markets and the
leveraged buy-out craze in the US.
Now, though, bond market lending has returned to its sharp upward course: in
1991, new international bond financing (net of redemptions) jumped to
Dollars 171bn, up from Dollars 132bn the year before. That pace has been
sustained so far this year, with the rate at which new bonds are being
issued slightly above that in the first part of 1991.
The debt overhang of the 1980s overshadows much of this activity.
The bond markets have been pressed into service to help refinance expiring
bond issues, reckoned to amount to some Dollars 190bn this year, with a
further Dollars 270bn due next year.
A quarter of this is accounted for by equity-linked issues, which provided a
steady and cheap source of capital for Japanese companies while the good
times lasted.
High long-term interest rates have helped to attract investors to the bond
markets. US dollar bond rates have stayed high, despite successive
reductions in shorter term interest rates to give a boost to the flagging
economy, while European rates have been held at a high level by the
Bundesbank's attempts to halt the escalation of Germany's money supply.
Those conditions look likely to remain constant for the foreseeable future.
Stock markets, meanwhile, have staged their own side-show as international
equity investment has picked up - though market conditions have deteriorated
rapidly in recent weeks.
Little more than six months ago, international investors still believed that
Japanese share prices had reached rock bottom.
Foreign money poured into the Tokyo stock market - around Dollars 47bn in
all in 1991. Other major stockmarkets also experienced a new wave of foreign
investment, reversing the trend of the previous year, when foreign
participation had shrunk in all areas except the European Community.
As share prices have lifted, US companies have taken the opportunity to
become net sellers of shares for the first time since 1983.
In the intervening years, stock repurchases and leveraged buy-outs had
persistently eaten away at US companies' balance sheets, and they were quick
to come back to the stock market to try to repair some of the damage when
the time was ripe.
Circumstances have now changed. In the first five months of this year
international equity offerings reached Dollars 11bn, higher than the same
period in 1991, as a growing number of US companies added international
tranches to their stock issues.
Latin American issuers also returned in greater numbers both to the
international equity and debt markets. But, led by US fund managers,
investors have since become increasingly wary of current stock market
valuations, and issuing volume has fallen off as a result.
The boom in international securities markets - and the continuing strong
growth in allied derivatives markets - have made it a profitable period for
many bankers and brokers.
However, two factors suggest that the future is likely to get considerably
tougher. One is the over-capacity in the financial sector, which has
persisted well beyond the boom years of the 1980s.
The other is the increasing attention of regulators, concerned to get better
control of fast-moving international markets.
The excess capacity in some parts of the securities industry has been
apparent for half a decade, since the deregulation of national markets cut
off many intermediaries' traditional sources of profit. Japanese securities
firms are under the severest pressure to retrench, having seen commissions
on domestic deals - the fuel that has kept their massive corporate machines
running - dry up. US securities houses, which until recently were enjoying
one of their best-ever periods, also face a difficult time as equity issues
tail off and uncertainty takes hold of the markets.
A consolidation in the securities industry could be hastened by new capital
adequacy rules. Capital regulations have already helped to precipitate a
retrenchment and mergers in the banking industry.
Securities regulators are still in the process of hammering out their own
international framework, but their work looks set to produce tougher rules
for many brokers, forcing many to think again about whether they should stay
in the business.
London, an international centre which has made a virtue of its less arduous
capital regime, could be one of the biggest losers. Regulators are also
trying belatedly to get to grips with the lightly regulated (and little
understood) derivatives markets.
The proliferation of new financial instruments and the sharp escalation in
derivatives trading (in many cases overtaking trading in the underlying
securities) have left the authorities groping for new ways of regulating
financial markets.
They face at least three problems:
Some financial instruments are understood only by a handful of people. That
raises questions about the ability of financial institutions correctly to
assess and manage their risks.
It is difficult to assess sometimes where risks in financial markets
ultimately lie. Many of the instruments created to shift risk from one
institution to another have not been tested in a liquidation, and netting
arrangements for some markets (such as swaps) are open to question.
Much of this new activity is happening in private, as custom-made financial
products increasingly replace exchange-traded instruments.
These problems are well understood by regulators. What is not clear yet,
though, is what they are going to do about it.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The danger zone looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE zones seem to be entering the danger zone. No-one who opened a
newspaper as Olympia &amp; York's flagship development, Canary Wharf, sank into
receivership this spring could fail to be aware that enterprise zone
investment has its problems. But enterprise zone trusts (EZT), the
syndicated deals which allow buildings to be bought by a group of investors,
have been very popular, drawing around Pounds 143m in investors' funds in
1990-91 and Pounds 158m in 1991-92.
The most spectacular casualty has been Greig Middleton EZT2, which bought
the Mansion building in Docklands. It was sponsored by Greig Middleton, the
stockbroker, and managed by Independent Property Securities. No tenant has
been found, and rent on the property was guaranteed by Seifert Ltd, the
property development arm of the Seifert group of architects which also
includes the company responsible for such buildings as the National
Westminster Tower.
Seifert Ltd went into receivership last week, although R. Seifert &amp;
Partners, responsible for designing the well-known London buildings, and
Seifert International Ltd, which has projects in Europe, continue to trade
as before.
A bank guarantee from Sanwa Bank will continue to pay rent to investors
until the autumn, and will then run out. At this point, if no tenant is
found, there will be no income for the trust's investors.
This situation is made all the worse because most funded their investments
with loans. This is very tax-efficient, as extra tax relief is available if
rental income from an EZT is used to pay off a loan, but means that the loss
of income will leave them facing mounting, suddenly tax-inefficient debt.
They also have to pay for the upkeep of the building, including rates and
insurance.
GMEZT2 was put together in a rush to catch the end of the 1990-91 tax year.
Greig Middleton's chairman, Mark Kemp-Gee, admits that with hindsight the
sponsor's due diligence when putting together the trust was 'not enough'. He
adds: 'We feel that we have a great moral duty of care to the investors,
coming out of our sponsorship. But it is not as though the building has
fallen into the Thames.'
GMEZT2 is not the only trust in trouble. Charter Developments is also now
finding it hard to finance obligations to enterprise zone trusts. PET15, an
EZ trust based in Salford, recognises that Charter cannot be relied on to
continue paying rent, and the trustees have asked for extra powers from
investors to borrow funds.
When a trust runs into trouble, the illiquidity of property investment can
make it become a millstone for investors' necks. The trust as a whole can
only escape the investment by selling the entire property - not easy at
present - while there can be conflicts between different trustholders. There
is no market as yet in EZT units.
All of this is bad news for EZ investment. But the zones still offer the
greatest tax reliefs currently allowed by the government for any form of
investment. Relief is available at the investor's top marginal rate, with no
maximum limit, making the incentives even greater than for the Business
Expansion Scheme for which there is an annual maximum of Pounds 40,000.
In return for sweeping tax benefits, it seems fair to shoulder greater
risks. But the recent disaster stories must not be repeated. Do EZTs have a
future?
They do, but it will have to be much less ambitious. Anthony Yadgaroff, of
the Allenbridge Group, says many EZT investors have already borrowed heavily
to fund previous EZTs, and their total liabilities are now so high that
banks will be reluctant to extend much more crdit.
Stephen Bantoft, now of Cannock Investments and previously of Allenbridge,
who recommended against investment in GMEZT2 at the time it was launched,
expects EZTs to continue on a reduced scale.
No trusts will be launched in Docklands, he believes, unless they have
strong bank guarantees, and come with a 'put' option. Investors would have a
legal right to sell the property at a fixed point in the future for a set
price.
Office blocks, in the current market, are also probably off limits. But
industrial property, if it has been pre-let to a financially secure tenant,
and carries a bank guarantee, could still prove popular.
The EZ sector's ills ultimately stem from the state of the office property
market. Once tenants start returning to offices, even the trusts currently
in trouble could become good investments. But for now, investors
contemplating EZ investment should be ultra-cautious. As several EZT holders
now know, there are worse things in life than paying tax.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bull market on the horns of dilemma /
Tracing the up and down fortunes of the UK market since the Crash of 87
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS is a long time to have travelled without getting anywhere, but
investors who put money into equities at this time in 1987 this week have to
face the fact that they have seen a loss on their capital.
The long bull market in UK equities which began in mid-1982 reached its peak
on July 16 1987. The FT-All Share then stood at 1238.5. It was 1190.6 at
Thursday's close this week, after a short-lived push in May this year to
1326.4.
Over the five years the casino characteristics of the stock market have been
glaringly apparent, with smart gains to be had, depending on your timing.
If you waited until after the October 1987 crash to buy stocks, when the
FT-All share index was around 800, and sold in mid-1989 when it rose to over
1200, you would have seen a rise of 50 per cent for the 18 month period and
a real return of 38 per cent, according to Paul Walton, UK equity strategist
at brokers James Capel.
There were even higher real returns - 40 per cent - for speculators who
bought into the market at the end of 1990 and sold in May this year, when
the index exceeded its pre-crash peak. The Conservative victory in the April
election this year pushed the index up but it has since fallen because of
the economy's failure to recover.
For investors who were not able to play the market with such precise timing,
life has been at turns nail-biting and frustrating. Our four portfolios
(story below right) have all shown losses over the first six months of this
year.
The FT-All share has fallen by 31 per cent in real terms over the five years
to Thursday, and even those who bought shares after the crash and held them
will have seen the market barely rise in real terms.
It can be argued that five years is not long enough to be a truly long-term
investment, but the law suggests otherwise. Collective funds are legally
obliged to quote five year performance figures, which are now very
unflattering. They will improve greatly from October when the market at the
time of the Crash becomes the unexacting yardstick.
Over 10 years the picture is very different. BZW's equity price index stood
at 2403.8 at the end of 1981 and rose to 8938.6 at the end of last year. The
annual average real return during that period was 13 per cent (gross income
reinvested) compared with 8.4 per cent for gilts.
The conventional wisdom is that the market was overvalued in 1987 and was
'corrected' by the October crash. Now, according to that same wisdom, the
market is cheap.
But even if the market is cheap, is it worth buying? With inflation now down
to just below 4 per cent and expected to fall further, and with high real
interest rates, fixed-interest investments look an attractive alternative.
These are examined in our Quarterly Review of Personal Finance.
Investment institutions have acted accordingly. Norwich Union switched
Pounds 1bn out of equities and into fixed-interest stocks last September. In
a publication, 'Investment Strategy in the 1990s', it argued that, over the
next couple of years, 'it is possible that fixed interest could outperform
equities as inflationary pressures and yields fall.' In the longer term, it
expected equities to outperform fixed interest investments, although by a
lesser margin than in the 1980s.
Experts are divided on the outlook for the market. Philip Warland,
director-general of the Unit Trust Association, also expects increased
demand for bonds and foresees more bond unit trust launches as a result.
However, he believes that the behaviour of the stock market over the five
years was an aberration caused by the government's tough anti-inflation
policy. He expects a slow but steady rise in the market in the next five
years.
This view is not shared by Jeremy Alford of Whittingdale, a specialist bond
investment company, who thinks that high real interest rates cloud the
outlook for equities. The decision by the Bundesbank to raise its discount
rate will have reinforced this argument.
However, Dick Barfield, of Standard Life, expects returns from gilts to
trail about 2 percentage points behind equities in the next five years. The
gap between the two has narrowed - the yield ratio (the relationship of gilt
to equity yields) peaked on the eve of the Crash at 3.3 times and is now
down to 1.8.
Like NU, Barfield does not expect the high returns of the bull market to be
repeated in the 1990s. He nevertheless expects 'decent real returns' of
about 7 to 8 per cent from equities in the next five years - a figure which
takes in a revaluation of the market because of what he views as its
cheapness today.
Walton takes a contrary view to that of Norwich Union. He expects a 25 per
cent rally in equities, supported by corporate earnings growth, over the
next 18 months. This would push the FT-All share to 1600.
However, after that he sees a flat period with total returns for equities at
9 per cent compared with gross redemption yields of 8 per cent on bonds. He
says: 'When equities and bonds look equally attractive, the old rules apply
 -put your money 50-50 into both.'

FT  18 JUL 92 / Industry backs Major's stance on ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of British industry yesterday backed the UK's continuing membership
of the European exchange rate mechanism but urged the government to seek
early cuts in domestic interest rates.
Senior executives in industrial and commercial companies expressed
widespread support in a straw poll for Mr Major's campaign to restrict
inflation, in spite of concern over the impact of high interest rates on
their businesses.
Many agreed with Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, that there
were no 'short-term fixes'.
But directors in hard-pressed industries such as housebuilding, which is
sensitive to mortgage interest rates, want the chancellor to start shaving
interest rates immediately in order to test the pound's resilience in
foreign exchange markets.
The Confederation of British Industry has been frustrated by recent
ministerial reluctance to pursue a 'step-by-step' reduction in interest
rates. It believes further reductions are essential if the economy is to
revive and that small cuts could be accommodated without jeopardising
sterling's position within the ERM.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder,
said: 'The government's policy of driving down inflation is eminently
sensible but there must be a level of pain beyond which that sensible
objective becomes counter-productive. I feel we are now entering that
phase.'
Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman of housebuilder Barratt Developments, appealed
to Mr Lamont to cut interest rates, abolish stamp duty on house sales and
double the threshold for mortgage tax relief from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
60,000.
Mr John Towers, group managing director of Rover Group, the UK's largest
carmaker with an annual output of nearly 500,000 vehicles, said companies
that would prefer higher inflation to the current lack of demand were
misguided.
He said: 'There are short-term fixes. You could have a significant expansion
of public spending, cut interest rates and revalue the pound. The trouble
with each of them is that, while they would get the economy going, they
would take us back into inflation.'
He compared the difficulty of fine tuning the economy with flying a
helicopter: 'You move the controls and nothing seems to happen for a bit, so
you move them some more and then it overreacts.'
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said concentration
by ministers on the retail price index as a measure of inflation had
underestimated the depth of recession. He said: 'A general realignment of
ERM parities is necessary. The chancellor said last week that this was not
on the agenda but I think it ought to be.'
Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailing group,
said: 'There is no case for coming out of the ERM or for devaluing within
the ERM. It is unthinkable that you can go into the ERM one year and come
out of it another just because the medicine is doing what it is supposed to
do.'
Mr Michael Garner, finance director at specialist engineering company TI,
said: 'We have had two years of pain (within the ERM). But there is little
choice other than to persevere.'
Among those arguing that the government should change its approach was Mr
Edwin Black, sales manager at M and G Cars, a car dealer in Cookstown,
Northern Ireland. He said: 'There's a lot of us not making a living any
more. The government has to listen to people and do something to revive the
economy.'

FT  18 JUL 92 / Nestle is poised to win Perrier: Brussels anxious to avoid
mineral water duopoly in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is set to approve Nestle's FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
bid for Perrier, the French mineral water group, next week in a landmark
decision for EC competition policy.
To preserve competition in France, the Swiss food group will have to give up
control of about 20 per cent of total French mineral water capacity by
selling eight of its springs to a single buyer. But Nestle is likely to keep
all the best-known mineral water brands involved in the takeover, including
Evian, Vittel and Perrier itself.
It will also have to delay the sale of the Volvic brand to BSN, the French
food group, until the Commission has approved the sale of the other brands.
The recommendation of the Brussels competition authorities is aimed at
avoiding the formation of a 'duopoly' in the French market by BSN and
Nestle. It is the first time such considerations have played a part in an EC
merger decision. If commissioners approve the deal at their meeting on
Wednesday, they will at a stroke extend the scope of Brussels' initiative
over mergers far beyond what was envisaged when current EC rules came into
force in 1990.
The deal was agreed after nearly four months of hard bargaining between
Nestle and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, and is
essentially a pragmatic solution to the commercial and political questions
raised by the bid.
The controversial question of whether the Commission can interpret the EC
merger rules in such a way has been saved for Wednesday's political
discussion between commissioners. The Commission's legal service is
understood to have severe misgivings about the decision.
The Commission will also have to consider whether French public opinion will
be affected by Brussels' radical interpretation of the merger rules ahead of
the September referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The Commission has been
heavily criticised for taking on too many powers and competition policy is
one area where the French government is particularly sensitive about
Brussels' influence.
Nestle has the right to challenge the decision in the European Court, even
though it is thought to have agreed the conditions laid down by Sir Leon and
his officials, but after waiting so long for the go-ahead it seems more
likely to press ahead.
By selling Volvic, the Swiss group says it would retain nearly 37 per cent
of the French market for still and fizzy water, before other divestments.
BSN, meanwhile, would increase its share to 30.9 per cent with Volvic.
When the recommendation was put to an advisory committee of national
anti-trust officials last week, competition hard-liners such as Britain and
Germany were said to be concerned that Nestle would still be allowed to sell
Volvic to BSN. Sir Leon appears to have bowed to the argument that it would
have been difficult to unscramble the contract with BSN.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market collapse has been notably severe among UK contractors and
building materials companies, which have underperformed by nearly 20 and 25
per cent respectively in the last two months. The message, it seems, is
finally hitting home that there will be no return for the foreseeable future
to the levels of demand of three to four years ago. Businesses will
therefore soon be forced to cut capacity - not just costs and working
capital - to meet the new economic realities. Depressingly, there may now be
a fresh wave of redundancies and provisions, with all that this implies for
profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and further dividend cuts. In the
process the stock market has become indiscriminate: if sound companies such
as Redland and RMC are now correctly priced, there are further falls in
store elsewhere.

FT  18 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: TI/Cray
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TI's sale of Dowty's information technology business to Cray Electronics was
executed with a speed and at a price which suggests total lack of sentiment.
That was more or less what was promised at the time of the bid and still
looks the right strategy. Dowty's dithering did little to enhance the value
of the business. It has at least now been sold at a price some Pounds 5m
higher than its Pounds 45m book value. Given its operating profits of just
Pounds 1.5m last year, the disposal is hardly dilutive.
By contrast, there was never much chance of finding a buyer for the Cognito
mobile paging business, which has been haemorrhaging cash at a rate of
Pounds 1m a month. The closure will involve writing off the Pounds 21m at
which Cognito was valued in Dowty's books as well as a modest cash outlay on
redundancies. Even if Dowty had been less attached to Cognito, that would
have meant a provision it could ill afford. TI will doubtless be able to
absorb the impact in the general balance sheet adjustments which follow an
acquisition. It certainly will not be charged above the line, though that
may lay the company open to fresh criticism of its accounting policies.
As for Cray, the purchase is a large morsel. But it makes much more
strategic sense than last year's abortive attempt to buy SD-Scicon. Cray has
every chance of improving on the Dowty division's margins without the need
for heavy additional investment. The acquisition is being financed through a
rights issue. After banking the proceeds from its recent sale of Malvern
Instruments, it should moreover be in the happy position of seeing its
gearing fall to zero from 142 per cent at the start of its last financial
year.

FT  18 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Building societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be that yesterday's unexpected mortgage rate rise from the Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester is a one off. But it would be foolish to count on it. The C&amp;G,
after all, is not the genteel provincial institution which its name might
imply. It is the sixth biggest society and a notoriously aggressive bidder
for retail funds.
Comments from Nationwide and the Halifax that they have no immediate plans
to follow suit should therefore be read carefully. Given the dire state of
the housing market - low numbers of transactions, falling prices and an
underlying rise in repossessions - the societies will be loath to choke off
what demand there is. At the same time, however, they are facing fierce
competition for deposits from the new National Savings First Option Bond.
The societies' first-quarter net receipts were just Pounds 266m, against
more than Pounds 2bn in the first three months of 1991. Preliminary
indications are that the second-quarter net intake was even lower than the
first.
The strident allegations of unfair competition now being made, of course,
are nothing new. Similar arguments were rehearsed in the early 1980s when
National Savings was required to make a big contribution to the public
sector deficit. In those days, though, the public sector was moving towards
surplus; notwithstanding the government's aim to balance the books over the
cycle the trend is in the other direction today. Another difference is that
the societies will need to widen their margins to absorb growing bad debts.
Insurance companies have so far picked up most of the tab for the reckless
lending of the late 1980s; as house prices continue to fall and
mortgage-guarantee policies are renegotiated with much tougher conditions
the societies will suffer a bigger share of the pain.

FT  18 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: A fit of global gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a parochial sense, the 300-point fall in the London equity market since
early May has a positively traditional feel to it. First the Tory election
win, then the celebration, then the hangover. But yesterday's 52-point fall
belonged in a wider context. One reason was Wall Street, hit by poor results
from IBM and bad trade figures. But the other European markets were on
average down in line with London. The common theme here is interest rates,
and the Bundesbank in particular.
The worry is not so much that Germany will tighten further - though that
cannot be ruled out - as that it will retain its grip for the foreseeable
future. In the UK, it did not help that the Cheltenham and Gloucester
building society raised its rates yesterday or that the Bank of England
reversed the timid suggestion of lower rates made at the start of the month.
Having been remarkably slow to grasp the realities of the German situation,
the markets are now having to reduce their expectations for economic growth
accordingly.
For the UK market, there is yet another worry in the background. With
sterling at Dollars 1.95, the pressure on dollar earners is becoming
material. It is not helpful to reflect that if sterling were back at its
central rate against the D-Mark, it would also be over Dollars 2.00.
As a result of all this, equities are in conventional terms cheap compared
to gilts. The yield ratio has fallen to 1.8 times, which in normal times
would be a clear buy signal. That may yet prove persuasive. But in one
important respect the times are not normal. The market has discounted a huge
amount of bad news by now. What it has not discounted is the possibility of
a triple-dip recession being caused by a further rise in UK interest rates.
As long as that possibility remains, however slight, it has to be priced as
well.

FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Trade deficit, IBM figures
hit equities

Wall Street
US stock prices fell sharply yesterday on news of disappointing earnings at
IBM and an unexpectedly large monthly trade deficit, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.99 at 3,331.64,
although above its lows for the day when the index had given up more than 40
points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down
1.92 at 415.62, while the Amex composite slipped 1.79 to 386.55 and the
Nasdaq composite fell 5.67 to 570.52. Turnover on the NYSE was 189m shares
and declines outpaced rises by 1040 to 602.
The markets opened weaker, partly unsettled by news of a big lead in the
polls for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, over
President George Bush, but more unsettled by the wider-than-expected Dollars
7.38bn May trade deficit. Particularly worrying was the 2.5 per cent decline
in exports, the third consecutive monthly fall, which provided further
confirmation that economic growth in the second quarter will be weaker than
the 2.7 per cent growth achieved in the first quarter.
Second-quarter corporate earnings again dominated trading. Yesterday it was
the turn of IBM, often regarded as the market's bellwether stock, to
announce its figures. Although IBM unveiled net income of Dollars 1.25 a
share, well up on the meagre 22 cents a share earned a year ago, the results
were below market estimates, which had centred around Dollars 1.33 a share.
Consequently, there was heavy selling of IBM stock, which dropped Dollars 5
1/4 to Dollars 95 in turnover of 5.3m shares.
The rival computer group, Digital Equipment, fared much better, rising
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 3/8 as investors reacted positively to the news
late on Thursday that Mr Kenneth Olsen, the company's founder and president,
will step down in October to make way for a new generation of management.
The Dutch electronics giant, Philips, plunged Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 15
5/8 on reports from the Netherlands that the company is having trouble with
its HDTV project. Philips denied the story.
In the latest of a long line of bank mergers, NationsBank was steady at
Dollars 45 7/8 and MNC Financial down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 10 7/8 on the
news that NationsBank had agreed to invest Dollars 200m in MNC with an
option to buy the company at a price between Dollars 11.75 a share and
Dollars 15 a share.
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 45 after
the company reported fiscal third-quarter profits of Dollars 131.7m, a big
improvement on the Dollars 53m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago
but still below market estimates. The news from Apple triggered selling in
other technology stocks, leaving Microsoft Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 70 1/4
, Intel down Dollars 2 at Dollars 56 and Novell Dollars 1 lower at Dollars
54.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in moderate trading boosted by a large block trade of
3m shares in Barrington Petroleum. The TSE 300 composite index fell 12.58
points to 3463.00 with advances just ahead of declines by 272 to 255.
Trading value was CDollars 268.5m.
All but one of the 14 stock groups closed lower, the gold group bucking the
trend with a rise of 1.24 per cent as the New York spot gold price jumped
Dollars 4.75 to USDollars 357.00.

KELLOGG, the US cereals group, yesterday unveiled second-quarter net
earnings of Dollars 168.1m, or Dollars 70 cents a share compared with
Dollars 152.3m, or 63 cents, a year earlier.
Kellogg said its earnings were lifted by generally favourable currency
exchange rates. Sales in the quarter rose 12 per cent to Dollars 1.58bn from
Dollars 1.41bn.
For the first six months of 1992, net profits advanced about 16 per cent to
Dollars 364.3m, or Dollars 1.52 from Dollars 315.4m, or Dollars 1.31 in the
first half of 1991. The half-year figures were muddied by extraordinary
items which added Dollars 36.1m to the company's pre-tax earnings. Excluding
these items, Kellogg said its underlying net income rose 7 per cent to
Dollars 338.5m, or Dollars 1.41 in the latest six months.
Kellogg's share price fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 in late trading.

FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: German groups to develop
hovertrain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OF Germany's leading engineering groups, Thyssen, AEG and Siemens, are
to join forces to develop and build the 'whispering arrow' magnetic
hovertrain.
The companies said they would hold equal shares in a new company,
Magnetschnellbahn, which intended to present a private or part-private
financing plan to the government in the autumn.
The pact follows a cabinet decision earlier this week to press on with a
DM493bn (Dollars 324.3bn) programme to restructure the national road and
rail network, which included approval for an initial stretch of elevated
track for the 400kmph magnet train between Hamburg and Berlin.
However, the government, which has invested DM1.6bn in research and
development work over the past 24 years, said it would not provide further
funds. The initial stretch of track plus locomotives and rolling stock would
cost more than DM8bn, according to transport ministry estimates.
The project, officially called Transrapid, received the technical all-clear
in January following exhaustive running trials on a test track in north
Germany. Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, proposed then that the first
line could be built by a consortium including industrial groups, banks and
Lufthansa, the state-owned airline.
The new company, which must be approved by the supervisory boards of the
three groups and the federal cartel office before incorporation, will be led
by Thyssen, which has been most closely involved in development.
Mr Heinz Riesenhuber, research minister, and a firm champion of the new
system, said in the longer term the Transrapid service could be extended to
link Bremen and Bonn with Hamburg.
While industry prepares its plans for the commercial launch, the government
is committed to pressing on with legal amendments and changes to the
constitution needed before private participation in the rail network can be
allowed.
Although the transport ministry believes the first stretch could be in
service by the end of the century, delays are almost certain.
The project has raised protests from environmentalists, and strong local
opposition is expected from communities along the proposed route.

FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: IBM shares slide in heavy
trading

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in International Business Machines fell by 5.2 per cent yesterday and
helped drag down the broader US stock market as the world's largest computer
manufacturer reported unexciting second-quarter results and gave a downbeat
view of second-half trading prospects.
IBM, which is in the throes of a shake-up designed to make the company more
entrepreneurial and less bureaucratic, reported net earnings of Dollars
714m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, against earnings of Dollars 126m, or 22 cents
a share, in the same period of last year, when the US was deep in recession.
Its revenues rose almost 10 per cent, from Dollars 14.8bn to Dollars 16.2bn.
The results were towards the low end of analysts' expectations, which ranged
from Dollars 1.20 a share to Dollars 1.40 and the shares closed on the New
York Stock Exchange at Dollars 95, down Dollars 5 1/4 after heavy trading of
5.3m shares.
The company told an analysts' meeting it continued to expect year-on-year
revenue growth in 1992 in the 'mid-single digit range.'
However,it added that second quarter revenues in the US rose 9.4 per cent
from a year ago and 'the tone of business in the US is continuing to
improve.'
The company's strongest revenue grown was in two areas it is anxious to
expand - software, which was up 12.3 per cent to Dollars 2.68bn, and
services, which rose 45 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn - but its key computer
hardware sales rose by just 4.6 per cent to Dollars 8.64bn.
The company said mainframe computers and other top of the range systems had
been strong, but that was offset by weakness in the personal computer
market. The PC field has seen severe price cutting by IBM's competitors and
IBM hinted yesterday it would be taking more aggressive action in the third
quarter.
The company's gross profit was Dollars 7.9bn, against Dollars 7.6bn a year
earlier, while the company's selling, general and business expenses dropped
11 per cent. However, excluding some one-time items in 1991, expenses
dropped by around 5 per cent.
Mr Daniel Benton, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'operating expense
reductions were very impressive, but they have intense gross margin
pressure.' He estimated the margin on hardware at only 46.9 per cent.
An IBM spokesman said the group expected to exceed the upper end of its plan
to cut the workforce by 15,000 to 20,000 in 1992, although a suggestion that
it could reach 40,000 to 60,000 was ' off-base.'
For the six months, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 1.31bn, or
Dollars 2.29 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.58bn, or Dollars
2.77 a share, in 1991 when it took a Dollars 3.96 a share one-time charge
for an accounting change.

FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: Olsen announcement lifts Digital
stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment's stock rose yesterday following the surprise announcement
that Mr Kenneth Olsen, president, chief executive and founder of the
minicomputer manufacturer, will retire in October and the sudden resignation
of Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, president of Digital's European operations.
Digital rose Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 3/8 in late trading.
Mr Olsen, 66, has headed Digital since he founded the company in 1957. His
departure has long been the subject of speculation, but the timing of the
announcement took analysts by surprise. Digital is expected to announce
substantial fourth-quarter losses, following one of the most difficult years
in the company's history.
Mr Olsen had appeared to be unwilling to let go of the reins of the company
that he has headed for over 30 years. There have, however, been signs of
growing discontent among senior executives at Digital over the past year as
its financial performance slumped.
Mr Olsen will be succeeded as president and chief executive by Mr Robert
Palmer, vice-president of manufacturing. Mr Palmer, 51, joined Digital in
1985 to take charge of the company's semiconductor operations. Previously he
was a founder of Mostek, a US semiconductor manufacturer subsequently
acquired by United Technologies.
Mr Palmer has been closely associated with Digital's new 'Alpha' technology
upon which the company plans to base a new range of computer products.
The resignation of Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, 'to pursue other interests' also
came as a shock to industry analysts. Mr Falotti is credited with having
built Digital's European business into one of the most successful segments
of its operations.
The company said Mr John Smith, senior vice-president of operations, to whom
Mr Falotti reported, will assume Mr Falotti's duties in the interim.
In spite of the timing, a senior Digital executive said Mr Falotti's
resignation did not come as a consequence of Mr Olsen's retirement or the
appointment of his successor.
Mr Falotti 'has done a staggering amount for Digital and for Europe and will
be enormously missed,' he said. 'It would be wrong to portray him as
throwing his rattle out of the crib.'

continues

<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
yesterday announced a sharp improvement in second-quarter net income, helped
by a better performance in its semiconductor operations.
The group reported net income of Dollars 72m, or 73 cents a share, compared
with a loss of Dollars 157m, or Dollars 1.99 a share, in the same period of
last year, when the company took a special charge of Dollars 130m for a cost
reduction programme. Sales rose 11 per cent from Dollars 1.69bn to Dollars
1.88bn. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
This was Texas Instruments' second consecutive quarter of profits after six
quarters of losses.
The turnround follows an improving US chip market, extensive cost cutting,
capital investment and a drive to better position the group in the lucrative
custom chip field.
The results were helped by royalty revenues of Dollars 124m, against Dollars
74m last year and Dollars 95m in the first quarter of this year. The period
included one-time payments totalling Dollars 45m.
US resales during the first half were the strongest since the first half of
1984.
Europe was showing moderate expansion. Strong growth was continuing in the
Asia-Pacific market, but the outlook for Japan had deteriorated over the
past few months.
For the six months, net income was Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.10, against a
net loss of Dollars 212m, or Dollars 2.76, while revenues rose from Dollars
3.3bn to Dollars 3.6bn.

FT  18 JUL 92 / To leave, or not to leave / Examining the debate over ERM
and sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the lifebelt turned into a straitjacket? The question is being asked of
the European exchange rate mechanism, in the increasingly emotion-tinged
debate about whether Britain should engineer a sterling devaluation to
promote economic recovery.
The combination of high Bundesbank-induced interest rates and apparently
never-ending recession have prompted discussion about whether the UK's
interests would best be served by a decision to cut the pound loose from the
D-Mark and leave the ERM only 20 months after joining it. Talk about a
possible sterling devaluation has affected the financial markets, which have
marked the pound down heavily in recent weeks. From about DM2.94 at the end
of May, it closed last night in London nearly 1 pfennig down on the day at
DM2.8475.
The leaders in the argument about a devaluation are not just those
economists who have consistently opposed ERM entry for Britain.  When
Britain joined the mechanism, after years of agonising, most economists
supported the move on purely practical grounds. It was thought that by
locking Britain into a long-term link with Europe's most stable currency,
ERM entry opened up the possibility of lasting decline in inflation and
steady long-term growth.
There were, however, substantial pockets of resistance. For example,
monetarist economists such as Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool
University, have consistently argued that locking the pound into a fixed
link with the D-Mark reduces the UK's flexibility over domestic interest
rates. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University has been another
leading dissident.
But in recent weeks, those taking up the cudgels in favour of an exit from
the ERM are economists who previously supported Britain's entry. Mr Paul
Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss
bank, is one of them. He says that because of the unique circumstances of
German reunification and the consequent high level of German rates, Germany
is no longer acting as the anchor of the system in the way intended when the
mechanism was designed in the late 1970s.
This was not apparent in October 1990 on Britain's ERM entry, he says. 'What
is more I thought that German monetary policy would have been relaxed by
now; and that there would have been some UK recovery. On purely practical
grounds, it is time for a rethink,' he says.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers,
the US investment bank, says: 'The discussion (about a devaluation linked to
ERM exit) is becoming more explicit. More people are listening to arguments
that if Britain does not devalue then we won't see much growth over the next
two years.'
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S G Warburg Securities, the London
investment house, adds: 'Devaluation would be a policy of desperation. But
at some stage it may be the only avenue available to the government.'
Leaving the ERM would be a leap into the unknown. Nobody knows what would
happen to sterling or interest rates. But as the implications of membership
of the ERM are becoming increasingly well-known, so its unpopularity rises.
Whether they like it or not, and particularly if further increases in
interest rates are forced upon them, Mr Major and Mr Lamont may have to
examine the alternatives.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Instrument of fear: Competition for the building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in nearly a decade the building societies are facing
strong competition from National Savings for the nest-eggs of mainstream
personal savers.
During the late 1980s the building societies had almost a clear run, pulling
in net new deposits at Pounds 17bn to Pounds 20bn a year, adding back
interest credited. The banks were becoming rather more competitive for
retail savings deposits than earlier in the decade. But National Savings was
in decline, and was actually shrinking in 1989 and for most of 1990 because
the government was at that stage repaying its debts.
Since then, however, the government has swung massively back into budget
deficit. The public sector borrowing requirement is forecast at Pounds 28bn
for the current financial year ending next April 6. Most independent
forecasters expect a big overshoot because of the failure of the economic
recovery to materialise. Public borrowing is likely to be well in excess of
Pounds 30bn this year and possibly more than Pounds 40bn - some even say
Pounds 50bn - in 1993-94.
Most of the deficit will be financed through sales of government bonds, but
National Savings has been ordered to play its part. Its contribution to the
PSBR was a negative Pounds 1.7bn for 1989-90 - that is, there was a net
outflow of funds - but in 1991-92 it raised more than Pounds 3bn and this
year it is thought to be targeting Pounds 6bn. That amounts to an increase
of almost Pounds 8bn in three years.
Not surprisingly this is biting deeply into the resources of the building
societies. In a number of recent months the societies have suffered a net
loss of deposits, and net receipts have been only Pounds 0.65bn for the
first five months of the year.
The particular instrument the building societies fear is the new National
Savings First Option Bond launched last week, with a rumoured initial target
of Pounds 1bn. It offers 7.75 per cent net of standard rate tax (equivalent
to 10.34 per cent gross) on savings of Pounds 1,000 or more, and this rises
to 8.05 per cent on Pounds 20,000 plus.
This beats most building society high interest accounts out of sight. It is
hard to get more than 6.5 to 7 per cent net out of building societies.
This intrusion of National Savings upon private sector savings media, can be
seen as part of the process by which the huge government deficit threatens
to 'crowd out' private sector activity.
In the 1980s the Conservative government under Mrs Margaret Thatcher argued
that the opposite shift was desirable. Low interest rates and low government
borrowing were desired. But now, under the influence of membership of the
European Community's exchange rate mechanism, the government has shifted to
a high interest rate, high government borrowing pattern. There is much less
room for new mortgage lending by building societies and banks, which reached
a peak of Pounds 42bn net in 1988 but has now eased to an annual rate of
only about Pounds 20bn.
Not only is the government becoming a potent competitor for savings but the
depression in the housing market is also making it necessary for lenders to
widen their margins to accommodate bad debt risks which used to be
negligible but have now become serious.
Different but connected factors are therefore interacting to cause an upward
shift in building society deposit rates and mortgage rates at a time when,
officially, interest rates have remained stable.

FT  18 JUL 92 / End-of-term fatigue: The Tories face a rough autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In three short months, elation has given way to foreboding. The Conservative
MPs leaving Westminster this week for the long summer recess looked weary
and bewildered. Anxiety about the economy and arguments over Europe have
long since submerged celebration of the election victory.
Within hours of their departure the Bundesbank - again the bete noire of the
jingoists on the Tory backbenches - had tightened the screw. Any hopes of a
fall in British borrowing costs were dashed by the rise in the German
discount rate. The turbulence on the financial markets underlined the
possibility that yesterday's mortgage rate rise may not be the last.
Prime Minister John Major is adamant he will not change course. He is
convinced personally, as well as politically, that Britain cannot retreat
now from the rigours of the exchange rate mechanism. He is as committed to
the Maastricht treaty as he was last December when he left the conference
table declaring 'game, set and match'.
But as his cabinet colleagues gathered in 10 Downing Street for end-of-term
drinks with the press, they were not pretending it would be easy. 'We'll get
through it, but I'm not sure quite how,' one commented. 'There is no
question of going back but none of us like starting from here,' said
another.
Elsewhere a more junior minister wondered aloud whether there was a parallel
with the 1960s. The then Mr Harold Wilson had been elected in 1966
determined not to devalue the pound. The subsequent U-turn destroyed his
Labour government.
A fourth Tory term should have provided the catalyst for recovery. Ministers
and backbenchers alike were convinced Mr Major's return to Downing Street
would reawaken the confidence needed to haul the economy out of recession.
It did not. Instead Tory MPs left for their holidays clutching an admission
from Mr Norman Lamont that, even when it came, the recovery would be slow
and unspectacular. The chancellor could only exhort them to keep their
nerve.
Then there is Europe. The skilfully crafted compromise negotiated by Mr
Major at Maastricht was meant to bind the party's wounds. The Danish
referendum and the exploitation by Euro-sceptics of the link between the
recession and the ERM have reopened them.
Lady Thatcher long ago decided that her passionate antagonism to Brussels
came before loyalty to her successor. Now ministers fear that she will seek
to upstage his victory celebration at the party conference in October by
launching another tirade from the sidelines.
So Mr Major is bracing himself for a rough autumn. The internal forecasts
circulating in Whitehall suggest that, at best, output will stagnate this
year. Treasury ministers would not be surprised if it fell for the second
year in succession.
The prime minister's judgment is that an upturn in domestic confidence -
prompting consumers to stop saving and start spending - will not be delayed
indefinitely. He has always said that the pace of recovery would be
measured.
But there is acknowledgement also that an array of uncertainties - the US
presidential elections, the German interest rate squeeze and a deadlocked
Gatt trade round among them - provides an inauspicious international
backdrop.
With that comes the tacit admission that the party conference and the return
of parliament will herald a much more serious bout of party unrest. Recent
outbursts owe something to post-election weariness and a realisation among
the old hands that a government majority of 21 rather than 100 means many
more late nights at Westminster. Precocious newcomers to the Commons chamber
have found it hard to adjust to the notion that blind loyalty is more
important than freedom of speech.
A few weeks beside swimming pools in the Tuscan hills or on the beaches of
southern France might provide a partial cure. But the economy and Europe are
issues that do not go away.
Local Tory constituency associations are full of the small business owners
who have borne the brunt of the recession. White-collar unemployment and
falling house prices strike at Conservative self-confidence. Party activists
and MPs alike applaud the principle of lower public spending, but this year
the reality of Treasury cuts in spending on schools, hospitals and roads
will add to the gloom.
The Euro-sceptics have been quick to capitalise on the unease. The ERM and
Maastricht are cast as part of the conspiracy to submerge British
sovereignty: Brussels will run the UK's foreign affairs, the Bundesbank its
economy.
It was a message that the Conservatives flatly rejected two years ago; one
that led directly to the downfall of Lady Thatcher. But the prospect of 3m
unemployed provides more fertile ground.
Mr John Smith will maximise the discomfort. His leadership victory later
today will strengthen rather than weaken Labour's commitment to Britain's
place in Europe. But Mr Smith has already injected flexibility into his
stance on sterling's exchange rate parity.
Opponents should not underestimate the prime minister. Mr Major's sights are
on the medium term - on 1996 rather than October 1992. He has more grit than
many on his own side realise. Not all in his cabinet were enthusiastic
backers of the ERM, but they agree that to retreat now would destroy the
Tory party as well as its leader.
That leader is convinced the prophets of doom predicting a slide from
recession into slump are wrong. If the financial markets test his resolve,
he is willing to put up interest rates to defend sterling. He plans to
deliver on his promise of sustained low inflation.
He calculates also that in spite of all the noise on the backbenches only a
handful of irreconcilables in the end will rebel against his policies. His
followers have nowhere else to go unless they want to risk defeat in another
election.
Mr Major is prime minister because he has proved himself a shrewd judge of
his party's mood. The best guess at Westminster is that he will again be
proved right. But it will be rough - for the Tory party and for the economy.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Would leaving the ERM help Britain? How the economists line
up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE ERM is not working as Britain thought it would. The plan was that low
inflation would bring low interest rates and lead to prosperity. But due to
the special circumstances of German unification we have high interest rates
throughout Europe, which are inappropriate given the weak economies of many
countries.
'With the UK still in recession, most economists would agree that base rates
at 10 per cent are too high. Britain should cut interest rates by 2
percentage points and see what happens. If the pound fell below its ERM
limit, and direct intervention failed to move sterling back within its
bands, then the UK should either devalue or leave the system altogether. In
Britain at the moment, as in other countries such as France and Denmark, all
you get for lower inflation is more pain.'
'I DO NOT accept that a reduction in inflation takes 100 per cent priority
over other objectives. There is an alternative to existing policies. There
is no sign of any recovery in the economy and unemployment is still rising.
I don't believe there will ever be a recovery fast enough to reduce
unemployment if there is not both a devaluation and a reduction in interest
rates.
'I deny that a devaluation, if large enough, would result in higher interest
rates. If the ERM is an obstacle to devaluation, Britain should withdraw.
Experience does not support the view that devaluations are ineffective. The
depreciation of the early 1980s was accompanied by falling inflation and
improved competitiveness. Devaluation would add something to inflation but
perhaps not all that much with unemployment so high and rising.'
'MEMBERSHIP of the ERM has been used to prolong the biggest monetary squeeze
in Britain since the 1930s. Britain needs a cut in interest rates of at
least 3 percentage points. To allow this, Britain should suspend its
agreement to support sterling within the ERM. That would mean allowing
sterling to fall to a value set by the market. We must get away from the
idea that there is a 'correct' value for the pound. Other European countries
would perhaps try to make us feel guilty.
'But Britain has got to be tough and follow its national interests. Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might well
be damaged by a decision to leave the ERM. But they are faced with a tough
choice: either pull out or end up in a nasty situation due to the
deteriorating economy.'
'REALIGNMENT of sterling within the ERM would make things worse. History
shows that currencies realigning downwards in the ERM have higher interest
rates. Floating the pound is a more serious option. But with government
budget and balance of payments deficits and underlying inflation over 4 per
cent at present, the UK would have to take tough measures to gain
credibility for such a policy on the foreign exchange markets.
'So staying where we are is the least worst option. But if the recession
intensifies, while German rates stay high, Britain will need to find a way
of decoupling UK rates from those in Germany. The best way would be to float
the D-Mark until the strains of unification have subsided. If that proves
politically impossible, floating the pound may yet have to be reconsidered.'
'TO ONE side in this debate, floating exchange rates possess magical
qualities: to the other side fixed rates are an absolute imperative. Such
disputes are theological. Policy should depend on the practical
circumstances of the time. It was right for sterling to join the ERM at a
testing exchange rate. Without this we could not have reduced inflation.
'But now it is falling, it is dangerous to stick with this same policy, when
the risk facing Britain is not inflation but slump. The best solution would
be a D-Mark revaluation. Britain should be working for this behind the
scenes. It was dismaying to hear Mr Major apparently ruling this out.
Failing this, if by December the UK economy shows no recovery, German rates
show no sign of coming down and UK inflation is low and falling then we
should devalue.'
'THE LBS remains strongly opposed to a devaluation in itself. But in the
circumstances of the recession, a case can be made for combining devaluation
with a large cut in the public sector borrowing requirement. This package
was ruled out for electoral reasons, but may now be politically feasible.
'Our (economic) model simulations suggest that the benefits of devaluation,
even with the above measures, are far from clear. But devaluation may also
be consistent with low inflation provided that the PSBR cuts are deep enough
and if credibility can be helped by an independent Bank of England. Since
political pressure for devaluation may increase if the ERM comes under
strain, this increases the case for giving priority to an independent Bank
and fiscal consolidation.'
'A FREE float for sterling, which would succeed in getting base rates
markedly lower, would now be such a political setback for the chancellor and
the prime minister that it would only be contemplated in the most extreme
economic circumstances, probably involving a systematic collapse in the
financial sector.
'These dire circumstances have not arrived yet, and are unlikely to do so
until next year at the earliest. The outlook is for continuing political
discontent, but discontent which is not powerful enough to force any of the
possible ERM resolutions in the near term. This is likely to leave the
financial markets permanently fretting that a sterling devaluation or free
float may be just around the corner until there is much firmer evidence of
economic recovery.'
'IF BRITAIN left the ERM, overseas investors would find it difficult to
trust the UK government's word in the future. Without the promise of
government action to support sterling, the pound would lose its friends in
the investor community. The large selling of sterling would force much
higher UK interest rates. Without these, there would be the danger of the
pound falling so low that it became a non-currency.
'Britain must stick with the ERM, taking the French route of gradually
building up credibility in its currency. German interest rates are going to
remain high for some time because of the circumstances of unification.
Britain has had two years of recession. We may have to go through a few more
years of penance to atone for the high borrowing boom conditions of the late
1980s.'

FT  18 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Painful path to zero inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister still does not seem willing to acknowledge what
membership of the ERM means. In this he is in the company of most of the
great and the good. ERM membership guaranteed neither economic growth in the
future nor recovery now. It means being tied to the Bundesbank, an
institution that has never shown more than a passing interest in the UK.
What the Bundesbank does guarantee is a painful, possibly erratic, journey
to low inflation.
The pain is undeniable. Between its trough in April 1990 and June 1992,
unemployment has risen by 1,126,000, from 5.6 per cent of the labour force
to 9.6 per cent. The rate of increase is slowing, but unemployment is still
up by 171,500 this year. At a seasonally adjusted 2.7m, unemployment is back
where it was in August 1987.
In addition, manufacturing output fell by 8.2 per cent between its peak in
April 1990 and May 1992. This year the decline has ceased, though May was an
unexpectedly poor month, registering a fall of 0.6 per cent. Manufacturing
output is now no higher than it was in April 1988.
More happily, the underlying increase in annual earnings was down to 6 1/2
per cent in the year to May 1992. Over the past six months earnings have
risen at an annual rate of only 4.7 per cent, while pay settlements are now
running at below 4 per cent.
Price inflation, too, is falling. The increase in the prices of manufactured
products was 3.6 per cent in the year to June 1992. Meanwhile, unit labour
costs in manufacturing rose by 2.9 per cent in the year to May. With output
per head in manufacturing up 4 per cent over the 12 months to May, lower pay
settlements should mean an end to the squeeze on profits generated by
membership of the ERM.
Has the disinflationary gain been worth the pain? Whether inflation at 0-2
per cent is better for an economy than at 5-6 per cent is not something on
which certainty is possible. But the cost is a certainty: 1.1m jobs have
been lost for a fall of four percentage points in underlying consumer price
inflation. At that rate, zero inflation might mean close to 4m unemployed.
No choice
Whether zero inflation is what the government wants must be doubted. But it
is in no position to choose. So long as the UK is in the ERM, the prime
minister has to accept whatever rate of inflation (or even price deflation)
is produced by the rate of interest that allows sterling to stay within its
band. With the margin between the Bundesbank's Lombard rate and British base
rate only a quarter of a percentage point, what happens depends on Germany.
On Thursday precisely what this means was made still plainer. The Bundesbank
decided to raise the discount rate - its floor rate for lending to
commercial banks - from 8 to 8 3/4 per cent. While this should have little
direct effect on money markets, it has already led to a comparable increase
in the Italian discount rate.
Limping recovery
More important than the increase is what it says about the Bundesbank's
mood. A cut in German interest rates this year looks as likely as a win on
the football pools. A cut of more than one percentage point next year looks
little more probable. As UK inflation falls further, real rates of interest,
both short and long term, will rise. Short-term real interest rates of 7 per
cent by the end of this year are conceivable. Next year's could be higher
still.
Much more than a limping recovery looks more a hope than a reasonable
expectation. But 'low inflation one, recovery nil' is not the end of this
match. If growth does not pick up quite soon, the public sector's finances
will be limping off the field injured.
One city economist who foresaw the prolongation of the recession into this
year, Bill Martin of Phillips and Drew, suggests that the public sector
borrowing requirement may be Pounds 40bn in 1993-94. On current spending
plans and only a limited recovery, the PSBR would be 8-9 per cent of GDP by
1996, the year in which the UK is pledged to reach the Maastricht target of
3 per cent. Something would have to give, certainly public spending,
probably the Maastricht target and possibly even the government's desire not
to increase taxes.
Well before that, long-term interest rates would rise. Moreover, if the
government feels it must offer such attractive terms to those members of the
public who invest in National Savings, increases in mortgage rates beyond
those announced yesterday are also likely. What price recovery in the
housing market then?
This government committed itself to the ERM knowingly, after German
unification. It did so presumably understanding that any policy to lower
inflation was bound to be costly. The real problem is different. It is not
that disinflation has been costly, as that no end is in sight. Long after
inflation has fallen to a level that any reasonable person would think low
enough, the economy may still be stagnant. Low inflation does not guarantee
that there will be a strong recovery. All the government can do is pray
that, despite German unification, it will produce one nevertheless.

FT  18 JUL 92 / EMS: hanging on to Germany's coat tails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER NORMAN looks at the reasons for Mr Norman Lamont's economic strategy.
Q. In 1990, Britain pegged the pound to other currencies in the European
Monetary System to achieve low inflation, low interest rates and steady
growth. What we have is somewhat lower inflation, high interest rates and
virtually no growth. What's gone wrong?
A. German unification. Nobody knew in October 1990 that it would cause such
a surge of inflation in Germany, which the Bundesbank, the independent
German central bank, is fiercely committed to bring down. That has meant
ever higher interest rates in Germany, forcing other EMS members to keep
rates high.
Q. But isn't Germany having such difficulty absorbing east Germany that this
might weaken its economy for years? And doesn't this mean that the idea of
Germany as the anchor of the EMS is no longer valid?
A. Yes and no. The German economy is no longer the powerhouse that it was
and the D-Mark is no longer omnipotent. On the other hand, the D-Mark has
such a formidable reputation that nobody thinks it will be devalued.
Q. But Germany has an inflation rate higher than that of France and, on some
measures, above that of the UK. Why can't we just cut interest rates below
those of Germany?
A. A good question. Financial markets still think Germany will beat
inflation and are happy to invest in the D-Mark. That means the D-Mark
interest rates set a floor for other currencies.
Q. But isn't there a mechanism for dealing with this? It seems crazy to have
a system that forces everybody to follow German rates.
A. The EMS was designed for flexibility. Its rules allow for realignments of
currencies within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. In theory,
sterling could be devalued or the D-Mark revalued.
Q. So why hasn't that happened?
A. Ask the politicians. In recent years, EC finance ministers have become
increasingly determined not to alter parities in the system. The last
significant realignment was early in 1987 - more than five years ago. Since
then, EMS members have held their existing parities, believing that:
Devaluation against the D-Mark would weaken their own battles against
inflation.
It would force them to push interest rates even higher to convince the
financial markets that they haven't softened their stances against
inflation.
It would been seen as a setback on the way to European economic and monetary
union. Also, governments hate devaluing their currencies because it smacks
of weakness.
Q. But surely questions of prestige are secondary when you have an economy
mired in recession and suffering from rising unemployment. Why do we stay in
the EMS?
A. The government says there is no alternative. It might have a point. After
all, the UK stayed out of the EMS throughout the 1980s and experienced a
savage recession and inflationary boom before slamming on the brakes again
in 1988 and 1989. In that period of 'go-it-alone' policies, UK interest
rates were lower than Germany's for only 16 weeks.
Q. What could happen if we left the EMS?
A. It would be uncharted territory. No EMS member state has left since the
system was set up in 1979. Without the protection of the ERM, which enables
Britain to call on its partners to help defend the pound, the currency might
slump, triggering more inflation and forcing interest rates higher.
Q. Are there no conditions under which we could leave the EMS without
triggering a sterling crisis?
A. Anything is possible in theory - but the government would have to
persuade the markets that it had a completely convincing monetary and
counter-inflation policy. That would require even tougher and more unpopular
measures - big cuts in public spending and even lower wage rises to beat
inflation.
Q. Could we change the way the EMS works to allow member states more
flexibility to raise or lower interest rates?
A. Britain already has the advantage of allowing the pound to fluctuate in a
wide band of 6 per cent either side of its central rates in the system. That
compares with 2.25 per cent for most other countries. An even wider band
would offer no discipline and no protection and would gain no support from
other EMS members who already expect Britain to move to the 2.25 per cent
band.
Q. OK. But look at the US, Japan, Australia. Unlike sterling, they have
floating currencies and they have all been able to cut rates.
A. First, it is far from clear that low interest rates are producing a sound
recovery in the US.
Second, floating sterling with the aim of cutting rates would be a leap into
the unknown. Britain's track record for going it alone is not good. Don't
forget that just before we joined the EMS, bank base rates were 15 per cent.
They are now 10 per cent. Germany's Lombard rate was 8 per cent. It is now
9.75 per cent. The narrowing difference is largely due to the the protection
of the EMS.
Britain's trade with the rest of the world might suffer. Any strong
depreciation of sterling would risk higher import prices and a new
inflationary spiral.
Q. But a bit more inflation would not matter, would it?
A. Any policy that has a whiff of being soft on inflation will be punished
cruelly by financial markets, leading to even higher interest rates.
Q. So what can we do?
A. Not a lot. We just have to hope that Germany will get inflation under
control. The difficulty is that there is a weak coalition government in
Bonn. With a German general election in 1994, that situation may well get
worse rather than better.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Building societies: battling for savers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BARCHARD asks Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society, about its mortgage rate rise.
Q. Why have you raised your rates?
A. Essentially the government is stepping into the high street savings
market and we have to retain the money we have from investors and have
already lent out to borrowers. It has to be appreciated that essentially
what we have done is an investment protection movement which forces a
mortgage interest rate move. One might wonder what soundings the government
took about the effects of such a high rate on bank and building society
deposits. I don't know of any such soundings.
Q. Is the demand for savings bonds taking away business from you or are you
just taking preventive action?
A. We have already noticed some withdrawals spread across small and large
accounts but we wanted to make our defensive move before we lost much more
money. Investors don't make out their cheques to National Savings when the
money leaves our accounts, so we don't know exactly where it is all going
but we can see that there is a definite outflow. Somewhere I have seen a
claim that there has been a flow of Pounds 120m into National Savings in six
days and that is quite a lot of money.
If the government is trying to raise very substantial sums of money, and
Pounds 1bn has been quoted as a possible target amount, then inevitably it
must come out of bank and building society deposit accounts.
Q. Why do you need to attract more funds when the property market is on its
knees and the demand for new mortgages is flat?
A. We don't need to attract more funds as such, what we want to do is to
hold on to the funds we have already got. We are simply trying to have a
fair crack at the whip and see that C&amp;G investors get as much for their
money as those who are putting their savings with the government.
Q. Are you just trying to protect market share?
A. Not as such. Our mortgage market share is around 3.5 per cent. As far as
the saving markets go we don't have figures for what the banks are holding,
but we definitely don't think we are losing market share to our usual
competitors.
Q. Are you trying to widen the margin between the rate you lend and the rate
you offer to savers in order to improve profits?
A. The shift is basically the same on both sides and we will end up with the
same margin at the end of this latest move.
Q. Do you expect other lenders to follow suit?
A. I think some will follow us in the short term and others will do later.
Our rates increase will have come as a bit of a surprise to them and they
will take some time to think out their position and respond to it. If they
don't make some moves they can expect to see money flowing away from them
towards National Savings.
Q. Will higher mortgage rates finally kill off any hope of a recovery in the
housing market?
A. The key point here is that we have moved as little as possible and are
talking about only a quarter of 1 per cent. We have got mortgage interest
rates which are lower than they were at the beginning of the year. A
marginal increase of that magnitude will have little impact on the housing
market as a whole.
Q. What would it take for rates to come down again?
A. What we need is the government to lead rates down again. Setting a high
interest rate for savings in the retail market is much more likely to force
rates up.
Q. Won't higher interest rates simply encourage more mortgage defaults?
A. I don't think they will encourage them, but some may happen as a result.
People tend to pay all of their instalment or none of it.
Q. Does ERM membership make matters worse or better?
A. If membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism involves beating inflation
out of the system, it means inevitably that we are not going to see a quick
recovery in the housing market.
Q. What in your view needs to be done to stimulate the housing market?
A. Assuming we can rule out some old-fashioned remedy such as a bout of
1970s-style inflation, we need some new government money to stimulate the
bottom end of the market, for example by higher tax relief for first-time
buyers. Another idea would be for the government to provide a guarantee for
the top 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the loan to a first-time buyer. This
gets over our problem with mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance and would
enable lenders to make 100 per cent loans to first-time buyers again.
Another point is that building societies are not allowed to raise all the
wholesale funding they want from the money markets. The Building Societies
Association has been pressing for some time for this limit to be removed or
increased.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Damages agreed for dioxin claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SETTLEMENT yesterday of the first claim for damages brought by a worker
exposed to the toxic chemical dioxin might provoke further actions,
solicitors said.
Mr George Yates, 43, who worked for Rentokil from 1978 to 1988, received
Pounds 90,000 in agreed damages. He claims to have suffered from cancer as a
result of exposure to dioxin and other chemicals during the course of his
work.
The claim, against Rentokil Group, the environmental services and property
care concern, was settled out of court after action in the High Court.
Mr Alan Care, from solicitors Leigh, Day and Company, acting for Mr Yates,
said lawyers in other countries had been waiting for the result of this
first case involving dioxin and pesticides. It would 'open the doors to
other related claims' worldwide.
Dioxin, the toxic byproduct of many manufacturing processes, is the subject
of controversy, with disagreement on the extent of its alleged link with
cancer.
The settlement contained no admission of liability, but Rentokil is angry
with its insurers, a syndicate at Lloyd's of London, for agreeing the deal.
'We strongly object to the settlement and deplore the fact that it may raise
unjustified fears among our staff,' said Rentokil.
It added that, on the evidence, Mr Yates's claim was unjustified and there
was no connection between his exposure to chemicals and the rare condition
he was suffering from - soft-tissue sarcoma. The decision to settle had been
made 'purely on commercial grounds when the insurers decided it was
uneconomical to defend the action'.
It would have cost at least a further Pounds 200,000 to pursue the case and
because Mr Yates was receiving legal aid there would have been no hope of
recovering costs even if Rentokil had won, the company added.
However, Mr Brian Smith, the syndicate underwriter, defended the decision.
'We have doubts about whether they could win the case,' he said. 'We don't
want to create case law because the next time you've got a case like that
you have no chance of negotiating.'
Mr Yates claimed he sprayed large quantities of pesticides during the course
of his work. He alleged that his cancer was caused by dioxin impurities in
the chemical pesticide Pentacholorophenol, or by the chemical itself.

FT  18 JUL 92 / High Court rejects call for review of Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for a judicial review of Lloyd's of London was yesterday rejected by
the High Court.
Lord Justice Leggatt and Mr Justice Popplewell set aside leave to apply for
the review which had previously been granted to six of the Names, the
individuals whose capital underwrites the insurance market.
The judges also awarded costs to Lloyd's.
The six Names seeking the the judicial review - an action against public or
semi-public bodies alleged to have failed to observe their duties - are
members of syndicates that have suffered heavy losses.
In his conclusion to the judgment, Lord Justice Leggatt said that Mr Justice
Potts, who granted the review in May, would not have done so 'had he been
told what he should have' about the earlier legal proceedings instigated by
the Names.
Lord Justice Leggatt also said that the relationship between Names and their
agents and the insurance market was 'governed by contract and is of an
essentially private nature'.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Change to audit requirement urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry should abolish the statutory
requirement for small, limited liability companies to be audited, the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants said yesterday.
In a submission to the DTI the institute said arguments for retaining the
audit were 'highly suspect'. It called for audits to be replaced with a more
'relevant' certification process.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Teachers' merit pay plan proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL scheme to link teachers' pay to examination results and
truancy rates was floated yesterday by the school teachers' pay review body,
Andrew Adonis writes.
If implemented, all teachers except those in nursery schools would be
eligible for one-off payments to reward annual improvements in school
performances.
The primary school yardstick would be pupil attendance rates and annual
tests for seven-year-olds. In secondary schools it would be performance in
GCSE, A-level and vocational exams, national curriculum tests, truancy
levels and destination of pupils at 16.
The review body was commissioned by the government to devise a scheme for
extending performance-related pay. It admitted the proposed measures were
'crude', but said they would serve as a basis for future refinement.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, welcomed the review body's call for a pilot scheme. 'To launch
into a scheme which is found to be defective would be disastrous,' he said.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers union, said the
plan was 'philistine and market-oriented'.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Tories jump the gun in war on Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH will take up the Labour leadership today against a barrage of
invective from senior Conservatives, a Liberal Democrat appeal for
co-operation and the first questioning of his physical fitness by The Sun.
Mr David Hill, Labour's communications director, expressed mild satisfaction
that Mr Smith had succeeded in provoking attacks even before taking office.
That the Conservatives needed to round on Mr Smith so soon after their
general election victory showed the 'fragile state' of a government under
attack over Europe and the economy.
The confirmation of Mr Smith's accession to the leadership will come shortly
after 2.30pm today at a delegate meeting at London's Royal Horticultural
Halls. It will be followed by the announcement of Mrs Margaret Beckett's
successful bid for the party's deputy leadership.
The 1,500 delegates will hear addresses from both victors, with Mr Smith
scheduled to round off the day with a rallying call to the party. His speech
will stress his intention to open up Labour's agenda and to modernise the
party.
Three cabinet ministers and Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, yesterday
all issued speeches attacking Mr Smith. Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, described him as 'yesterday's man', claiming his views were
'firmly rooted in Labour's past'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, held out an olive branch, calling
on Mr Smith 'to commit Labour to joining in the building of the new
politics'.
Yesterday also saw the first shot against Mr Smith's leadership from the
Tory-supporting tabloid press. Under the headline 'He's fat, he's 53, he's
had a heart attack and he's taking on a stress-loaded job', The Sun claimed
Mr Smith would be lucky to get a life insurance policy.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Settlement close in Pounds 1bn Channel tunnel row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL and contractors building the Channel tunnel are close to settling
their dispute over claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn,
according to both sides.
Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French
contractors, had claimed Pounds 800m at 1985 prices to cover the increased
cost of fitting out the rail tunnels and building passenger terminals at
Folkestone, Kent and Sangatte, northern France.
Eurotunnel has disputed the size of the claim, which it says has still to be
substantiated by TML. The gap between the two sides, however, is understood
to have narrowed from about Pounds 350m to between Pounds 90m and Pounds
120m. One British contractor said last night: 'There are still important
differences to be resolved, but the gap between us has narrowed
considerably. Provided the talks continue to go well, we could have a
settlement within weeks.'
Negotiations which are continuing will also consider how the claim is to be
paid. TML has said it would be prepared to accept a small part of the money
it is owed in the form of Eurotunnel shares or some kind of equity-related
instrument such as convertible loan stock.
Eurotunnel and TML are under pressure to reach an agreement from
international banks which are providing the bulk of the finance for the
project.
The banks have been required to grant a waiver permitting Eurotunnel to draw
down further funds to allow construction to continue because Eurotunnel is
in technical breach of loan covenants. The waiver is due to run out next
month.
The breach has been caused by the increased cost of the project - which
since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn - and lower
revenues expected in the first year of operation because of a delay in
receiving sufficient rolling stock to operate a full service.
The opening date of the project has been put back from June next year to
September or October. To achieve that, Eurotunnel will need the goodwill of
contractors during final construction and commissioning. Contractors take
the view that their strongest bargaining card will disappear once the
project is operating and their co-operation is no longer required.
In an attempt to maintain the pressure on Eurotunnel, TML has separately
asked the independent disputes panel established under the terms of the
contract to set a price for the installation work. Eurotunnel has appealed
against an earlier ruling by the panel that trebled monthly progress
payments to contractors to Pounds 75m.

FT  18 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors lose appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International yesterday failed in its challenge to the compensation package
negotiated between the liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders.
The group's appeal against the High Court's approval of the measures was
rejected by the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Dillon said that Sir Donald
Nicholls, the vice-chancellor who had approved the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds
880m) compensation package last month, was entitled not to follow the wishes
of the creditors' committee.
The committee, which had regarded the package as inadequate, had urged
further talks with Abu Dhabi. The committee itself had decided not to appeal
because of the cost. The appeal was taken over by a group of individual
creditors, led by Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI Depositors Protection
Association.
The group was ordered yesterday to pay its own costs and those of Touche
Ross, the liquidators - estimated at more than Pounds 100,000. It was
refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.
Lord Justice Dillon said the agreement represented the best terms the
liquidators had been able to achieve with the majority shareholders. It
would be impractical to convene creditors' meetings for further
consideration of the proposals.
Mr David Hunt QC, for the group, had argued that the vice-chancellor had
wrongly substituted his own commercial judgment for that of the creditors.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Magic moments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock will always regret that he did not make a bigger splash. But
his long march from the mining valleys of south Wales to the leather and
mahogany of the leader of the Opposition's suite in Westminster - which he
hands over today - has had its memorable moments, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Elected in 1983 on the so-called dream ticket with Mr Roy Hattersley, his
photocall with Glenys, his wife, on Brighton beach ended in a celebrated
dunking.
Some called him a 'Welsh windbag'. But his husky oratory was as much a
hallmark of his nine-year leadership as his celebrated attack in 1986 on the
'grotesque chaos' generated by the Militant-influenced Liverpool City
Council. His speech, punctuated by jabbing his finger in the air and rocking
on his heels, was compared with former leader Hugh Gaitskell's 'fight, fight
and fight again' speech on nuclear disarmament.
Most in the party will thank him for his courage in purging the extremist
fringe. His inimitable personality - sometimes hugely ebullient, sometimes
close to depressive - was as crucial a component of his leadership as his
long crusade to bring Labour back to electability with policy reviews and
party reforms.
Wary of press attacks and the griping of his colleagues, Mr Kinnock's office
became known as the 'bunker', protected by a doggedly loyal private staff.
It was that, perhaps, that helped contribute to the decision to go ahead
with the 1992 Sheffield rally - widely criticised as 'triumphalist' and
deemed, with hindsight, as ill-advised even by party headquarters.
But in the end, his prime ministerial ambitions were larger than life could
deliver.

As well as being chairman of Rank, Sir Patrick was deputy chairman of
Midland Bank and was on the boards of Imperial Chemical Industries, the
property company MEPC, and the building group Tarmac. He was deputy chairman
of the Horserace Betting Levy Board.
Educated at Wimbledon College and the Northern Polytechnic, Sir Patrick

which he had joined 10 years before at the age of 26. He became chief
executive in 1973, a position he held until the company was taken over by
BTR 10 years later. He also served as a director of Cable and Wireless from
1978 to 1984.
Sir Patrick was associated with a wide range of charitable and community
projects, including Business in the Community, the Prince's Youth Business
Trust, Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals, and the Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation.
He leaves a widow and one son.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Summertime, but the living isn't easy for MPs: Suggestions
that the recess is an extended playtime provoke indignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S TOUGH being a member of parliament. Take this week. After debating
proposals to reduce the sitting hours of the Commons and voting themselves a
38 per cent rise in expenses, MPs rose for a 13-week summer recess.
The popular perception is that this is an extended playtime for most
honourable members. But nothing is as likely to provoke self-righteous
indignation as the notion that MPs spend the summer on a beach with buckets
and spades.
Any such suggestion will be met with allusions to bursting mailbags and a
backlog of constituency business.
If they are as good as their word, a fine summer's day in the recess might
find Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman,
touring his vast Scottish constituency of Gordon in a mobile caravanette; or
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, opening a fete in Somerset; or Mr
Ian Bruce, Tory MP for Dorset South, presenting prizes at the East Dorset
Golf Club or firing off tank rounds at a local military range.
Government ministers such as Miss Ann Widdecombe might be engaging in the
sort of ministerial visits to social security offices and the like that the
government's slender majority prevents them from conducting while the
Commons is sitting. After Mr John Smith's anointment as Labour leader,
shadow cabinet members might be 'reading themselves in' to new portfolios.
When pressed, most MPs will admit that the summer pressure does drop in
comparison with the 'loony' 60-to-90-hour weeks they claim to work when the
House is in session. They feel their constituents do not begrudge them the
chance to reacquaint themselves with their families. 'For three months I
actually get to tuck my kids into bed,' says Mr Paul Boateng, a Labour
frontbench Treasury spokesman and father of five.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East and prominent campaigner over the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is one of a handful who
claim that the pressures on their time will preclude any break. 'The
interest is Robin Leigh-Pemberton-hunting,' he says when asked if he will at
least pursue some leisure interest.
When MPs do wind down for a 'real' holiday, it is usually for between two
and four weeks rather than the full three months.
Few of those straw-polled planned to spend this 'real' holiday in Britain.
Experience has taught Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, that 'if you
want a rest with the family you have to go abroad'. Their quest for
tranquillity is taking them to Iceland for a two-week walking holiday.
France, Spain and the US are the most common destinations, although some
have more exotic plans. Mr Alan Duncan, Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, will
spend much of August trout-fishing in north Pakistan. Mr Peter Viggers, Tory
MP for Gosport, alludes mysteriously to a 'Boys' Own-type' helicopter trip.
Contrary to popular belief, MPs are not immune from the recession. Shortage
of cash has prompted Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary,
to engage in a house-swap with a family living north of Biarritz. Mr David
Amess, the celebrated Tory victor of Basildon, has friends in Hawaii but
fears he cannot afford the air fare for his wife and five small children.
Several MPs intend to supplement 'genuine' holidays with work-related, often
part-expenses-paid additional trips. Into that group falls Mr Freeman, who
is visiting Japan 'to see how the railways operate'.
The Republican party convention in Houston, Texas, is a popular destination,
with Mr Charles Hendry, Tory MP for High Peak, Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal
Democrat campaigns chairman, and Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford, all
planning to drop in.
The recess will also provide some spare time for MPs to catch up on other
pursuits. Some are writing books: Mr Amess is engaged on a work entitled The
Road to Basildon, and Mr Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru leader, will be
endeavouring to meet a September 30 deadline for an autobiographical tome he
refers to as 49 Not Out.
Those with new jobs can do some concerted swotting. Mr Kenneth Baker, former
home secretary, will be familiarising himself for his new role as a board
member with Hanson, the acquisitive conglomerate - and 'doing some writing
and cultivating my garden'.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S money supply expanded by a record low of 0.9 per cent in June,
compared to the same month last year, and grew by an average of a meagre 1.2
per cent during the second quarter, the Bank of Japan said yesterday.
The growth was lower than expected by the central bank, which insisted there
were adequate funds available to fuel economic recovery, though industry
representatives called for another cut in official interest rates to boost
the economy.
Bank of Japan officials did admit that the economy appeared to be in its
'most severe' stage of adjustment, and that demand for funds was
unexpectedly weak. The bank prefers to use a broader money supply measure,
M3 plus certificates of deposits, which includes postal savings, an
important influence in Japan.
By that measure, the year-on-year growth in June was 4 per cent, down from
4.3 per cent in May. The previous record low for M2 plus certificates of
deposit was 1.1 per cent in May, while the expansion in the first quarter
was 1.7 per cent, significantly higher than the second quarter figure.
With evidence accumulating that the recovery will not come as expected in
the autumn, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai)
yesterday called for a quick reduction in the official discount rate, which
was lowered by the central bank by 0.75 per cent to 3.75 per cent on April
1.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, last night
named Mr Cyrus Vance, former US secretary of state, as the UN special
representative to South Africa. Mr Vance is expected to fly in to South
Africa next week to begin discussions on ending political violence and
restarting constitutional negotiations.
The mandate contained in Security Council resolution 765, adopted
unanimously on Thursday night after a two-day debate on South Africa, steers
a careful path between the positions of the government and the African
National Congress (ANC). It includes a broad condemnation of the violence,
in particular last month's massacre at Boipatong township, and while
stressing that it is the government's responsibility to protect lives, does
not suggest that Pretoria is involved in the killings.
The resolution calls for the special representative 'to recommend, after
discussions with the parties, measures which would assist in bringing an
effective end to violence and in creating conditions for negotiations
leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic. . . . South Africa.'
President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, differ widely on
what would be appropriate measures. The former indicates he would accept UN
observers taking part in efforts to end the violence; Mr Mandela has
suggested a substantial UN monitoring force will be necessary.
Prospects for resuming the talks have nevertheless improved, although formal
constitutional negotiations are not expected to take place before Mr Vance
has reported back. Mr de Klerk has moved some way towards meeting ANC terms
for restarting talks, while senior figures on both sides are concerned by
the impact of the stalemate on tensions in South Africa.
Discussions are continuing between the business community and trade union
leaders in an effort to avert a general strike due to start on August 3. The
Chamber of Mines' gold mine members and the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) have agreed a 1992 wage review.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Ministers urged to speed CFC phase-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT experts meeting in Geneva have agreed to recommend an accelerated
phase-out of the main ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of 1995 and
reductions in production and use of other known ozone-eaters.
Their recommendations will now go to a ministerial meeting in Copenhagen in
November of the 82 members of the Montreal Protocol, the United
Nations-sponsored accord on protecting the ozone layer.
The protocol currently calls for the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), halons and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000.
Faced with accumulating evidence of rapid and widespread loss of atmospheric
ozone, officials agreed a complete phase-out of production of CFCs, carbon
tetrachloride and methyl chloride in industrialised countries by the end of
1995. These chemicals are used in refrigerants, aerosols and solvents.
They also agreed an end to halon production by January 1 1994, with
essential uses to be met from existing supplies. Halons are used in
firefighting equipment.
Officials will be recommending a timetable for the phase-out of CFC
substitutes, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, if possible in time for the
November ministerial meeting. These substitutes also destroy the ozone
layer, though to a lesser extent than CFCs.
However, to the dismay of environmentalists, the two-week meeting took no
firm decision on methyl bromide, a pesticide widely used as a fumigant,
which is now known to be a highly potent ozone-eater. Tight controls were
strongly resisted by developing countries.
Pending a detailed report due next year, the recommendation to ministers
calls merely for a freeze on production and consumption at 1992 levels by
1995, with a 25 per cent cut by the end of the century.

WESTERN aid donors yesterday pledged Dollars 4.94bn (Pounds 2.58bn) to
Indonesia this year, despite lingering concerns about its human rights
record. The pledges, made at a meeting organised by the World Bank, follow
Indonesia's decision, in March, to disband its Dutch-chaired aid forum.
Jakarta has refused Dutch aid since then, angered by alleged Dutch
interference in its internal affairs.
The Netherlands and other donors have shown concern about the killing of
protesters in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, last November. Reuter
reported yesterday that Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign
minister, warned that his country would block a European Community accord
with the Association of South East Asian Nations, unless Indonesia improved
its human rights.
Economic deregulation plans, tabled earlier this month, also met with
initial disappointment from donors. However, western countries yesterday
praised the government for reducing dependence on oil imports (from two
thirds of foreign earnings a few years ago to one third now), for
stimulating the private sector and curbing poverty.
The aid, for the tax year to the end of March 1993, is a slight increase on
the Dollars 4.75bn pledged last year. About Dollars 1bn will be for balance
of payments support and the rest for development. Japan remains Indonesia's
biggest donor.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday rejected for the time being the use of
aggressive counter-measures to open up non-EC markets to Community banks and
financial institutions.
The Commission praised its biggest partners - the US and Japan - for the
progress they have made in treating Community institutions in the same way
as their own banks and insurance companies, although it said European
Community groups were still hampered by some 'non-discriminatory regulatory
requirements'.
It believes the EC is leading by example in the effort to liberalise global
financial markets.
Brussels officials claimed the moral high ground again yesterday by pointing
out that the Community was about to install 'the most liberal financial
services market in the world'.
In its first report to member states on the treatment of EC financial
institutions by third countries, the Commission says it considers that
existing world trade talks are the correct forum for improving market
access.
Under European Community banking legislation which comes into force in 1993,
the Commission can deny access to banks and insurance companies from third
countries which have not opened their markets.
But a European Community official said yesterday: 'The Commission does not
need to start negotiations with the big stick behind them because all our
objectives are currently being considered in the Uruguay Round talks on
financial services.'
The report does, however, issue a veiled warning to a number of countries -
including, for example, South Korea - which it says 'fall considerably short
of granting national treatment to Community firms'.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Clinton sees a surge in his popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton was yesterday buoyed by a surge in his popularity as
early polls suggested that a sizeable proportion of Mr Ross Perot's
supporters favoured Mr Clinton as their second choice.
Fresh from his coronation on Thursday night as the Democratic party's
presidential candidate, Governor Clinton set out with Senator Al Gore, his
vice-presidential running mate, in search of Mr Ross Perot's supporters, who
have been left disgruntled by the Texas billionaire's sudden withdrawal from
the presidential race.
The bus tour will take the campaign through eight states, from New Jersey to
Missouri. 'This is going to be a real grassroots campaign,' Mr Clinton told
a rally before leaving.
While Clinton campaign officials had expected a 10 to 15 percentage point
boost from this week's Democratic party convention in New York, they have
been surprised by the apparent rush of support from the Perot camp. Early
polls suggested that around half of Mr Perot's supporters favoured Mr
Clinton, with only one-third preferring President George Bush. This would
put Governor Clinton ahead with 56 per cent of the votes to President Bush's
33 per cent, according to a poll conducted on Thursday by Gallup for CNN and
USA Today. Some overnight polls put the gap between Mr Clinton and Mr Bush
even wider.
Mr Clinton yesterday said he did not take polls seriously, either way, and
planned to fight all the way to November.
Few Democrats have forgotten the 17-point lead that Governor Michael Dukakis
held at the same point of his 1988 campaign, before he faded to an
ignominious defeat.
'Dukakis made a mistake in taking a break,' said Congressman Les Aspin.
'Bill Clinton and Al Gore are not going to make that mistake.'
In a closer regional analysis, many pundits said the return to a two-party
race would benefit Mr Bush in the south, and especially in Mr Perot's home
state of Texas. Mr Clinton, however, could now be better placed in western
states, especially California, where Senator Gore's impeccable record as an
environmentalist should help his campaign.
Many Perot supporters, however, feel so bitterly deceived by their
candidate's withdrawal that they might return to the non-voting majority.
Only 13 per cent of those questioned by Gallup believed Mr Perot had
withdrawn from the election for the country's good, as he claimed, and 51
per cent of his supporters said they felt betrayed. 'What a wimp,'
proclaimed the New York Post on its front page. 'All over America there are
ordinary, decent people who believed in this gutless bum,' added Mr Pete
Hamill, the New York tabloid's columnist.
Given this new distaste for Mr Perot, his oblique endorsement of the
'revitalised' Democratic party may not count for much. But in the face of Mr
Perot's pull-out, the reaction to Mr Clinton's repetitive and ill-structured
acceptance speech on Thursday was charitable.
Joking that he had returned to finish the long-winded monologue he began at
the 1988 Democratic convention - so long that the crowd cheered when he
said: 'In closing . . . ' - Mr Clinton took 53 minutes to conclude.
This time, however, his audience was in more forgiving mood, and viewers
elsewhere appeared more inclined to contrast the grit with which he
withstood the assault on his character during the primaries with Mr Perot's
apparent collapse under pressure.

FT  18 JUL 92 / German MPs recalled for emergency debate on military

<TEXT>
GERMAN members of parliament will be summoned back from their summer
holidays next week, at considerable expense, for an emergency debate on the
use of a German destroyer to monitor United Nations sanctions against
Serbia.
The move, inspired by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), seems unlikely,
however, to reverse the government's decision to widen the involvement of
German military forces in international operations.
The SPD has also tabled a formal constitutional charge against the action,
in which the destroyer Bayern (Bavaria) and three reconnaissance aircraft
have joined ships from Nato and Western European Union countries in
monitoring the embargo.
Estimates put the cost of the emergency Bundestag meeting at around
DM300,000 (Pounds 103,450) because of the need to bring parliamentarians
back from holidays or fact-finding trips abroad. They began their summer
recess at the end of June.
However, the opposition regards the issue of involving the Bundeswehr in
international operations as fundamental, while the ruling Christian
Democrat-Free Democrat coalition has been steadily expanding foreign
operations.
Luftwaffe helicopters were involved in relief flights for the Kurds in
northern Iraq; German military medical units are operating with UN forces in
Cambodia; and now the German navy is being included in a strictly limited
monitoring operation in the Adriatic.
The German constitution is ambiguous on the subject, leaving it unclear
whether German troops can operate outside the Nato area.
The SPD has tabled a constitutional amendment which would allow their use in
UN peacekeeping operations, and nothing else. The government regards such a
definition as too restrictive. Germany said yesterday it would start
destroying 10,000 pieces of military equipment next month under agreements
to reduce conventional armaments in Europe, Reuter reports from Bonn. The
first to go would be 1,481 armoured vehicles and 54 battle tanks.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Moscow call for Estonia sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S parliament yesterday demanded sanctions against the Baltic republic
of Estonia if it does not stop discriminating against its large Russian
minority.
The resolution, which included a call to consider suspending the
co-operation treaty between the two states and a threat to raise the issue
at the United Nations, is a sign of the deepening hostility between Russia
and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
It is also a further indication of the hardening of attitudes in Russian
political circles - a trend which is leaving Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the moderate
foreign minister, increasingly isolated.
The latest call for his resignation came yesterday from General Alexander
Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president, who again accused him of malign intent
in predicting a coup organised by military and security circles.
In spite of efforts to improve relations - especially on the parts of Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, his
Lithuanian counterpart - the issues between them continue to drive them
further apart.
The Russian parliament derailed the government's budget yesterday, vetoing a
budget deficit proposed by the acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, and
agreeing extra spending of Rbs100bn, Reuter reports from Moscow.
A new deal, passed by an overwhelming majority, envisages a budget deficit
of Rbs950bn, up from Rbs800bn proposed on Thursday. Mr Gaidar last month put
the deficit at Rbs690bn.
The presidium of the Russian parliament yesterday appointed Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko as acting head of the Russian central bank. Mr Gerashchenko,
the former head of the Soviet State Bank, Gosbank, replaces Mr Georgy
Matyukhin, who resigned on Thursday.
A plan to attract foreign investment of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) a year
over the next three years was yesterday adopted by the Russian cabinet.
The ambitious target - given a total of only Dollars 2bn in foreign
investment over the past five years - would make up 18 per cent of total
investment in the economy, according to Mr Gaidar.
The programme calls for further legislation on investment to be enacted this
year, together with changes in tax and customs duties.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN all-German health survey has shown an 'astonishing' reduction in the
number of people in eastern Germany suffering from complaints often
associated with psychosomatic causes since the two parts of the country were
reunited. However, people in the west have shown an increasing - and
opposite - propensity to suffer from headaches, troubled sleep, nervousness,
giddiness, stomach ache and loss of appetite.
Pollsters from the respected Allensbach Institute recently repeated a health
survey last carried out in the west in 1989 and in the east in 1990, just
after reunification. The results show that the proportion of 'Ossis'
suffering 'occasional or frequent' nervous attacks has fallen from 38 per
cent to 25 per cent.
The figures for 'Wessis' show a rise from 21 per cent to 24 per cent. The
tally for headaches is down five points in the east at 28 per cent, but up
eight in the west at 33 per cent.
Similar results are recorded for all the so-called psychosomatic ills except
loss of appetite. While the proportion of easterners suffering from this
most un-German complaint has fallen by five points to 8 per cent, the figure
for the west is unchanged at 5 per cent.
The institute, recalling similar effects in the west at times of economic
uncertainty, attributes the change in the east to rising optimism 'despite
the bad economic situation, higher unemployment and lack of job security'.
The improvement is due to the general feeling that in spite of problems,
life and prospects have changed for the better.
The signal from the west, the institute says, is that even though the
current situation is stable, people feel that the economy is catching a cold
and that 'personal living standards will deteriorate in future'.
On the subject of sneezes and sniffles, its social scientists offer no clear
explanation of why the proportion of Wessis catching colds has increased
from 30 to 38 per cent, while the incidence among hardy Ossis has fallen one
point to just 28 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina agreed yesterday to a
14-day ceasefire, including the placement of all heavy weapons and artillery
under United Nations supervision.
The agreement came as two French soldiers serving with the UN peace force in
Croatia were killed in a mine blast near the Adriatic port of Zadar. They
were the first UN peace-keeping soldiers to be killed in the Yugoslav
conflict.
The ceasefire is the first to be firmly linked to a plan for
demilitarisation of the former Yugoslav republic under international
control. This offers some hope that the truce could hold - unlike previous
peace attempts.
The ceasefire followed three days of talks by Moslem, Serb and Croat
representatives with Lord Carrington, chairman of the European
Community-sponsored peace conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina, aimed at
starting a process towards a lasting constitutional settlement in the
ethnically mixed republic. Under the deal, all heavy weapons, including
combat aircraft, artillery and rocket launchers, mostly held by the Serb
irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army, will be placed under UN
supervision.
Yesterday the Security Council asked the secretary-general to report on how
many more peacekeepers might be needed to fulfil these additional functions.
The 15-member body also called on all sides to inform the UN peace-keeping
commander immediately about the location and number of heavy weapons to be
put under supervision.
AP adds from Moscow: Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday
froze relations with the rump Yugoslavia and won legislative approval to
despatch up to 400 more peacekeeping troops.

FT  18 JUL 92 / World financial markets tumble: Gloomy economic news
heightens fears of further rises in European interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING FEARS of more European interest rate rises, after Thursday's
discount rate increase in Germany, sent world stock and bond markets
tumbling yesterday.
Against a background of gloomy economic news and fears that Germany may lift
its key Lombard rate before long, European share markets suffered their
worst losses for eight months. The D-Mark rose further against the dollar
and sterling.
Nervousness also spread across the Atlantic, where US Treasury bond prices
came under pressure, while on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
ended down almost 30 points at 3,331.64.
In London the FT-SE 100 fell 51.5 points to close at 2,431.9. Downing Street
officials tried to spread reassurance on the UK economic outlook, insisting
that Britain would maintain its central DM2.95 central rate in the exchange
rate mechanism.
However, as sterling gave up Thursday's hard-won gains against the D-Mark to
close in London at DM2.8475, speculation grew that the UK government may
soon engineer an increase in bank base rates to defend the pound.
On London money markets, the three-month interbank rate rose to 10 5/16 per
cent from 10 1/4 per cent, indicating a possible  1/4 point increase in base
rates from the current 10 per cent.
Market pessimism was deepened by disparate international developments,
ranging from further financial scandal in Italy to a widening in the US
trade deficit for May.
Sentiment on the UK government bond market was depressed by the surprise
announcement of higher mortgage rates by the Cheltenham and Gloucester
building society.
Across the continent, most financial centres showed bond prices slumping,
with nervousness particularly marked in Milan and Madrid. Italian stock and
bond market prices were hit not only by worries about the weak lira, but
also by the arrest of the financier Mr Salvatore Ligresti on alleged
corruption charges.
The Frankfurt stock exchange's DAX index fell 2.2 per cent, the steepest
fall this year, to close at its lowest since the August 1991 Soviet coup.
Conditions on the Frankfurt money market - which in effect sets the interest
rate floor throughout Europe - remained tight. The Bundesbank added funds at
close to the current 9 3/4 per cent Lombard rate.
This strengthened market belief that a rise in the Lombard rate may be only
a matter of time, as the Bundesbank maintains its battle against 4 per cent
German inflation.
The dollar dropped nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs in heavy trading in New York,
falling at one stage to DM1.457, only slightly more than a pfennig up from
its record low, before closing at DM1.459.
There was heavy demand for the Swiss franc and gold, both appearing to
profit from their traditional role as safe investment havens. Gold rose to a
five-month high of Dollars 358.25 an ounce.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
suggested 'a dollar crisis' was brewing after the 4 pfennig fall in the US
currency this week.
In Germany, there was further criticism of the Bundesbank's action, although
it remained low-key. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, said he
wished the Bundesbank had veered 'more towards the promotion of growth'.
Ms Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, told a Norwegian
newspaper that Chancellor Helmut Kohl - who visited Norway this week - had
'personally advised' against the interest rate rise. Bonn officials,
however, could not confirm this.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's IG-Metall metalworkers' union,
said the discount rate rise would lead to higher prices and rents, increase
the number of bankruptcies and exacerbate the unemployment situation.

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest building society, yesterday
raised its mortgage interest rate from 10.75 to 10.99 per cent, bringing
other lenders under pressure to follow suit.
The society blamed the government for the increase, saying it was being
forced to put up rates for both savers and borrowers because of the
introduction last week of a high-interest savings account by National
Savings.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said yesterday that unless other
societies raised their rates to savers, they would see money flowing out to
National Savings.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at the City stockbrokers UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, said he believed most other building societies would have
little option but to follow C&amp;G by raising their rates.
A Treasury spokesman defended the National Savings strategy, saying other
lenders had not followed C&amp;G's lead.
He said the savings rate was not the highest in the market.
C&amp;G's increase means that its 330,000 borrowers will be charged about Pounds
8.50 a month more on a Pounds 50,000 repayment mortgage.
Halifax, the largest UK mortgage lender, said it was not surprised by the
C&amp;G move but that it had no immediate plans to increase its mortgage
interest rates.
Other large mortgage lenders were taken aback by C&amp;G's increase. But they
also said they had no plans to increase their rates at present.
However, all building societies complain that their savings business is
under serious pressure from National Saving's First Option Bond, which
offers basic-rate taxpayers 7.75 per cent interest after tax (10.34 per cent
gross) for one year deposits.
C&amp;G has already launched a savings account which is intended to compete with
the higher rates being offered by National Savings. The C&amp;G London
fixed-rate account will pay 7.8 per cent net (10.4 per cent gross) until
October 1 1993.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Bank of England had early BCCI warning: Inquiry told of
secret meetings to discuss fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BINGHAM report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International will
contain evidence that the Bank of England had, by March 1991, received a
comprehensive account of fraud at BCCI, four months before it was closed
down.
Lord Justice Bingham, who is expected to publish his findings in two weeks,
was appointed by the government to evaluate the role of the Bank of England
in supervising BCCI's UK operations.
His draft report includes evidence from both Price Waterhouse, BCCI's
auditor, and Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI, that mid-level
Bank officials were told of the main areas of fraud at BCCI in a series of
meetings in the first three months of 1991.
The current draft of the Bingham report comments that in view of the Bank's
decision in April 1990 to attempt a rescue of BCCI, it was unfortunate that
senior Bank supervisors did not at that time establish close contact with
high-ranking Abu Dhabi officials.
Price Waterhouse has told Lord Bingham that it had been passing on details
pointing to aspects of fraud at BCCI from the beginning of 1990, far earlier
than previously reported. These early meetings were arranged in the greatest
secrecy and no notes were taken of these meetings by Price Waterhouse.
The frequency of meetings increased throughout 1990 and detailed notes were
taken by Price Waterhouse of the later meetings.
Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England director with responsibility for
supervision, has said that it was not until the Bank received a formal
report on BCCI, under section 41 of the Banking Act, on June 22 1991 that it
judged it correct to close down the bank. 'The section 41 report completely
transformed our view of BCCI,' he told a Commons select committee earlier
this year.
Bank officials most involved in receiving information from Price Waterhouse
were Mr Roger Barnes, head of supervision, and Mr John Bartlett, his deputy.
The Price Waterhouse partner most involved in talking to the Bank was Mr
Christopher Cowan.
Price Waterhouse first became aware of the heart of the BCCI fraud - that
the bank had failed to make a record in its accounts of deposits totalling
Dollars 600m (Pounds 314m) - in late December 1990. At about the same time,
Price Waterhouse also learned that Dollars 600m of loans recorded in BCCI's
books as having been made to wealthy individuals in the Middle East were
false.
Details of this Dollars 1.2bn fraud were discussed on January 4 in a meeting
attended by Mr Cowan, Mr Zafar Iqbal, BCCI's chief executive, and Mr Barnes,
the Bank's head of supervision. Mr Barnes was told about the unrecorded
deposits and the phoney loans.
In the subsequent three months, Price Waterhouse uncovered details of every
other major element of the fraud at BCCI.
Its partners were part of a team set up by BCCI in October 1990 to
investigate fraud at the bank. In January and February 1991, there were more
than 20 meetings between members of the investigating team and BCCI
employees, including more than 15 with Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief
executive of BCCI who was deeply implicated in the fraud.
The team reported to BCCI's investigating committee on February 26 in Abu
Dhabi and outlined every substantial area of fraud at BCCI.
These included:
A cover-up of loss making loan accounts by transferring funds from other
accounts.
Failure to record deposits.
Creation of phoney loan accounts.
The misappropriation of funds managed by ICIC, an offshoot of BCCI.
The purchase by BCCI of its own shares.
The disguised ownership of US banks in contravention of US law.
A huge exposure to Gulf, the shipping group.
The extent of losses incurred by BCCI's Treasury division.
The collusion of customers in providing comfort to auditors that false loans
were genuine.
The creation of fictitious income to hide the extent of BCCI's losses.
The members of the investigation committee were sworn to secrecy by BCCI
about these discoveries, but Price Waterhouse communicated full details to
the Bank of England, an action permitted under the Banking Act.
Mr Cowan, the only member of the committee permitted by BCCI to take
briefing material on the inquiry's conclusions out of Abu Dhabi, had a
meeting at the Bank of England on March 1. On March 4, Price Waterhouse was
appointed by the Bank to carry out its section 41 investigation.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Private View: The message from the mountain top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABBOT of Xuanzhong monastery on the sacred mountain of Wutaishan has an
alert, ageless face and bright eyes. He sat in a Birmingham hotel room,
chatting affably, while the rain poured down on the frantic shoppers
outside.
To describe the abbot as detached would be misleading. It is as if
everything around him but the humans was invisible.
Liao Man inhabits another planet. He has lived 62 of his 70 years as a
Buddhist monk on a barren mountain in northern China, playing 2,000-year-old
music in a 2,000-year-old monastery. Until last week, save for a short visit
to Hong Kong in 1989, he had never been out of China.
What goes on in the head of a man who has been whisked by the Time Machine
from antiquity, half across the globe, into the modern world? How had his
travels impressed him?
'Hong Kong is good,' replied Liao. 'It's like England. It doesn't have a
big, big wind. At Wutaishan it is really, really windy and everywhere is
very dusty, inside and outside the temple, everywhere.'
Are you surprised by what you see here, I asked. Or are you too old to be
surprised by anything?
'People are very kind, very nice. I told my monks I think this country is a
good place.' I leaned forward, waiting for some shaft of spiritual insight
into our corrupt Western ways. He continued: 'Here you really don't have any
dust. The air is very clear, everything is very clear, very nice.'
Had you heard about the West before you came?
'We don't go out so we never hear anything.'
Do you know about Christianity?
'I know about it. We have a Christian church in China.'
What else do you know about the West?
'Normally we don't know much. We don't care too much what happens.'
I motioned to the street outside and asked if he could imagine living in
Birmingham. He agreed that the city was busy, but observed that it was far
less crowded than Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province. 'I think my life
on Wutai mountain is very good also,' he added politely.
What about the things in the shops, the things to buy, the entertainment?
Would you like to live like this?
The abbot was not to be tempted into moral denunciation. 'Mostly I feel that
here the air is really clear. As for other things, I don't feel anything.'
You have no other impression of the place?
'No, I just feel that the air and ground everywhere is so clean.'
Perhaps Liao Man was just being strenuously diplomatic. Yet even in China,
where a foreigner's unsolicited criticism is doubly unwelcome, ordinary
people will beg you to say truthfully what you think of their country.
Or perhaps he was under orders. Early in our meeting a gentleman whom I took
to be the Communist Party minder came in and offered to sit with us. When I
declined his offer he muttered something about there being no restrictions,
provided we didn't 'go over the religious limit' and left.
Or perhaps material things really mean nothing to him. (One of his
colleagues, however, did express an interest in the net curtains on his
bedroom window.)
Liao has come to England with eight other musician monks to demonstrate some
of the world's oldest music (they perform today, Monday and Thursday at
London's South Bank.) The music, like Buddhism itself, percolated from India
before the first century (the Xuanzhong monastery was founded in AD 68),
flowered during the Tang dynasty and greatly influenced native court and
village composers.
Liao entered holy orders as a child of eight and began memorising the
ancient scores and playing the instruments as a teenager. He learned the
guangzi (a deep-throated double-reed pipe) and the sheng (mouth organ). 'But
now my teeth are not strong enough to hold the reeds.' He smiled and showed
a set of even, white teeth. 'Now I play percussion instead.'
I asked if there were any young monks to continue the tradition.
'There are no young people'. He laughed ruefully. 'They don't like playing
it.'
Why not?
'Because it's too difficult for them. You have to read this notation and it
takes a really long time to learn by heart the big thick music books.'
Does that mean that eventually the music will die out?
'Very few people are becoming monks. The times are changing; around the five
or six counties where we live, when we die it won't survive.'
Although the older Chinese peasants still practice their religion, the
Communist authorities have made intermittent attempts to stamp it out as a
reactionary superstition. Buddhism is today tolerated once more, but as a
cultural antique, a tourist attraction. The number of temples and
monasteries on Wutaishan has dwindled from over 300 in its heyday to under
50; but the state is paying for lavish restoration and subsidises the monks
in their role as guardians.
Liao Man's monastery is down to ten old monks, aged 70 to 90, and two
novices, pupils of his brother Chong, a bent and hollow-eyed 73-year-old who
also plays in the band and who sat silently listening to our conversation.
In the summer the monastery has the help of a dozen Buddhist nuns.
Life on Wutaishan, one of four sacred mountains, is not quite as sheltered
as one might imagine. Apart from contact with the stream of summer tourists,
Chinese and foreign, the monks have their own television set. Liao said he
watches drama serials and the broadcasts of Peking opera. He admitted that
he had tried watching British television in his hotel room, but added: 'I
don't like watching television here because when they speak I can't
understand.'
Apart from being a centre of Chinese Buddhism, Wutaishan was a focal point
of the Japanese invasion in the 1930s. Liao said they occupied the mountain
but did not destroy anything 'because they were Buddhists themselves.' In
the early days of the Communist revolution the monks were allowed to
continue practising their faith, though much of their land was taken from
them.
The worst years for the monks came in the mid-1960s when Mao launched his
purge, the Cultural Revolution. 'It was a disaster,' Liao said. Most of the
younger monks fled the monasteries and returned to their villages; he and
his older brethren stayed. The Red Guards, youthful zealots from the cities
charged with tearing down the old to make way for the new, toppled the
Buddhas from their pedestals.
'They were young,' said Liao. 'They didn't understand anything. But they
didn't bully us. Very few people were bad and destroyed things. They didn't
really damage the temples too much because Wutaishan for a long time had
been left unrepaired. It was really broken down. Now they (the authorities)
repair it very beautifully.'
I asked what religious controls were left.
'There is no control. You can have your religion and can believe it as long
as you don't disturb other people's work and stay in your own temple and do
your own things.'
Have you heard Western music?
'I don't like it. I have heard both big orchestra music and popular music,
but I don't like it. I can't take it.'
Why not?
'In my soul I don't like it. It's very noisy, it's not in my thought.
Whereas the music we do is ours. We even made our own instruments.'
Do you enjoy performing in public, or does it make you shy?
'I don't mind. I can play wherever people want me to play. In my mind I am
still playing in my temple.'
Are the others nervous?
'They are not nervous either, because we all learned this music when we were
very, very young. So we know it very well.'
Doesn't it sound primitive to you?
'I think no other Chinese music can be better than our Buddhist music. It's
very beautiful, very gentle, very quiet. If it's noisy it's when the
percussion instruments play too much. Or maybe we are used to it.'
What do you think about as you play?
'When I play I feel as if I am still in Wutaishan,' he said.
I think he never left.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Why we need a 60 ft skinhead: Dominic Lawson prefers a badly
behaved press to badly behaved politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTHONY Burgess, the author, said the experience of being scrutinised by the
British media was like being picked up by a 60 ft high skinhead, examined
roughly, and put down again. He spoke from experience, having suddenly
become notorious when Stanley Kubrick's film of the novelist's Clockwork
Orange burst upon a British public unused to graphic sexual violence.
I have only once experienced something of Burgess's giant skinhead
treatment. It was after I published a controversial interview with Nicholas
Ridley, then trade secretary. Journalists swarmed into The Spectator office
and television crews squatted in the garden, insisting that, while they had
not been invited, they would not go until I spoke to them, or rather the
people they called 'our viewers'. It was not an altogether wonderful
experience. The best way to cope is to pretend all this is not really
happening to you. When it is all over you wonder whether indeed it did
happen. I suppose this is a symptom of what doctors call shock.
We are now told by the political lobby correspondents that this sort of
event might become a thing of the past. John Major, we are 'reliably
informed' is considering bringing in a parliamentary Bill to protect
people's privacy against the intrusions of the media.
The spur to Major's idea is apparently, the publication by The Independent
of a story - true, as it happens - that the Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomly became in 1967 a teenage unmarried mother. (Three months later she
married the child's father, Peter Bottomley). What particularly enraged
Major, and the Bottomleys, was that The Independent revealed the child's
name. For this The Independent has apologised, thus saving itself the
embarrassment of being reported to the Press Complaints Commission. I can
understand Major's eruption. As a man, one can take rough handling from the
press. But when one sees a shy retiring sensitive female colleague being
given the same treatment - well, noblesse oblige. Though what a shy retiring
sensitive female is doing in charge of Britain's most controversial ministry
is another matter.
I am sure that if Major asked his Minister for the Media, David Mellor - who
is thank God, neither shy nor retiring nor sensitive nor female - to bring
in a press privacy Bill, such a Bill will become law. And it will not need
any parliamentary whipping. Members of Parliament tend to be vivid
characters with private lives to match. They know how much more fun they
could have, if only they could be reassured that their constituents would,
by law, be prevented from reading about such escapades.
While it would be the merest cant to pretend that the press, whether the Sun
or the supposedly high-minded Independent, reports scandal out of a sense of
public duty, their efforts do have the effect of ensuring that public
figures behave with a discretion befitting their position. As one such
figure - in the world of finance - said to me: 'The easiest way for me to
know whether I ought morally to peruse a possible course of action is to ask
myself 'how embarrassed would I be if this action was subsequently reported
in Private Eye?''
The public figure is in any case, not without defences, as Private Eye knows
to its considerable financial cost. There are, of course, the laws governing
defamation. There are the laws covering infringement of copyright - under
which the Queen a few years ago instituted proceedings against the Sun, when
the latter published private holiday snaps of the Duchess of York. That cost
the Sun Pounds 100,000. And there are the laws against trespass, perhaps the
closest we have to a law protecting privacy. It is difficult to see that a
story which is not defamatory, does not involve a breach of copyright, and
has not involved any physical act of trespass, is one which an Act of
Parliament should be created to prevent.
But while I do not think that Mrs Bottomley has legitimate grounds for
complaint, there is another politician whose cause I will support: Bill
Clinton, the Democrats' presidential candidate. The diary column which
published the name of the Bottomleys' illegitimate child also chose that
same day to print a telephone number in the US which plays tapes of private
conversations between Clinton and his alleged former mistress, Jennifer
Flowers. Now that's what I call tacky.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Despatches: The beach is the bottom line - Copacabana Beach
/ Christina Lamb dons a dental-floss bikini to celebrate 100 years of
sun-worship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first 25 years of my life I lived under the misguided impression
that beaches were fun but limited places where one went to toast one's body
and unwind with the latest paperback before returning to London the colour
of a walnut, to the envy of one's pallid friends.
Then I moved to Rio de Janeiro and discovered the true meaning of a beach.
More precisely, I discovered Copacabana, perhaps the world's most famous
beach, which this week celebrates its 100th anniversary. The subject of
numerous songs, the name of bars the world over, the birthplace of bossa
nova and even the inspiration for a Walt Disney character, Copacabana may be
a little shabby these days but still remains Exotica Incarnate and the soul
of Brazil.
A sweeping crescent of white sand lashed by the Atlantic and backed by
craggy hills (nowadays scattered with slums) between a military fort and the
Sugarloaf mountain, Copacabana is more than a beach, it is a way of life.
Seething with activity almost 24 hours a day, its 4km of sands act as
Brazil's best singles bar, open-air nursery, sports fields, aerobics studio,
concert venue, the Rio equivalent of housewives' coffee mornings and even
the setting for business deals, as well as home to some of Rio's many
down-and-outs.
My first encounter with the Copacabana phenomenon can only be described as
brutal. I had secured a seafront apartment, thrilled by the realisation of a
lifetime dream of being gently awoken by the sound of crashing waves. Day
One I realised my mistake. Barely had morning broken when I was jolted awake
by the earsplitting twanging of a lorry parked outside my window, stacked
with amplifiers blasting rock music and sending shudders through my
apartment.
Pulling on a few clothes (beachwear in Rio can only be described as
minimalist), I ventured outside. For as far as I could see the beach was
swarming with people - not lying in deckchairs or on towels reading books or
sunworshipping in a normal manner, but all involved in some form of
activity.
These were not tourists. Most foreigners have been frightened off Rio by the
tales of pickpocketing and 'dragnet' operations in which bands of
streetchildren armed with knives and shards of glass sweep the beach clean
of wallets, sunglasses and even sneakers. Instead they were almost all
Cariocas - natives of Rio - at play in the city's largest backyard.
Two years on I remain astounded by the same daily display. In a bustling
scene, a series of bronzed musclemen, surfboards under arm, scatter small
children flying bird kites, as they rush into the waters to 'catch' the next
wave. Curvaceous women in scarlet lipstick and dental floss bikinis strut
along the shore. Everyone is an enviable shade of brown - here skin cancer
are dirty words and telling a Brazilian it is fashionable to be pale these
days could result in an unfortunate incident.
Revelling in air filled with laughter and the aroma of salt and coconut oil,
wrinkled old people lower their sagging bodies into the shallows. Groups of
beer-guzzling and pot-smoking teenagers squat in the sand puzzling over the
meaning of life. Spiritualist groups ceremoniously place small offerings of
quails eggs and empty perfume bottles on mounds of sand or cast roses and
cosmetics to the waves to please the vain goddess of the sea.
Activity reaches a peak at weekends. True Cariocas even have a 'beach
address' where they can always be found on Saturday mornings. In among
everything hawkers wind their way selling natural sandwiches, foam biscuits,
suntan oil and green coconuts. Even the police wear bermuda shorts.
At the top of the beach loud cheers emanate from the vigorous volleyball and
football matches underway. Exercise bars have been fitted from which
grunting athletes practise monkey-like swings. There is so much activity to
fit in that some years ago the authorities had to widen the beach through a
land fill and install floodlights so that play could continue through the
night, when the beach becomes the preserve of prostitutes clad only in
G-strings and open jackets baring all to passing motorists.
Most bizarre of all is the assortment of people standing with one leg in the
air or jerking their arms skywards as they jog in what could be mistaken as
audition time for Monty Python's Ministry for Silly Walks. All this in the
name of beauty. Brazilians are big on body culture - they are obsessed by
the rear end. Not for nothing is Rio's main bikini shop called Bum bum.
All across the city gymnasiums pound morning to night with people preparing
their body for display on the beach - there are more than 40 studios in
Copacabana alone. I tried one for a time with the aim of keeping fit rather
than sculpturing my backside but the teacher was relentless. 'Bottoms are
not for sitting on girls]' she shouted, if we dared let up on the fight for
the perfect buttocks, 'they are for showing off'.
If one is too impatient, or simply a lost cause, there is always plastic
surgery. Rio has 500 registered plastic surgeries and number one favourite
op. is not the nose job but the bottom tuck - perceptible only by
suspiciously firm peach-shaped buttocks with narrow scars in the centre,
often covered by tattoos.
But Copacabana beach is not just for the body beautiful or those who can
afford to cheat. Long gone are the days of black tie balls at the Copacabana
Palace attended by such notaries as John F Kennedy, Eva Peron, Charles de
Gaulle and Gene Kelly, and when Copacabana beach was an essential stop for
Hollywood stars.
Under Brazilian law beaches are public goods which cannot be fenced off and,
since Rio's populist Governor arranged bus routes direct to Copacabana from
the poor northern slums, its beach is no longer the preserve of the middle
class.
It is the one facility accessible to all in the world's most inequitable
society. Today the beach has an important social function and many Brazilian
sociologists believe it explains why, in spite of lurching from crisis to
crisis in which the poor become poorer, the country experiences little
social unrest.

<TEXT>
WINKING in China is rude. Backslapping in Britain, bad form. If they feel
unhappy, the Japanese may laugh. South Americans take offence at a drooping
posture. Narcissism is globally repellent. The weather is always a good ice
breaker. When dealing with a traffic policeman, it is generally wise to
refrain from hitting him. You have trouble remembering names? Try this
simple mnemonic device: if a man's name is Fred, and he is a bore, then
commit him to memory as Dead Fred.
These nuggets come from a new book called Confident Conversation, by Lillian
Glass. Dr Glass is a speech therapist practising in Beverly Hills,
California. Some beneficiaries of her advice are celebrated: Sean Connery,
Dustin Hoffmann, Dolly Parton. However, her book is aimed more at business
executives than Hollywood entertainers.
Even the boldest executives, apparently, are prone to 'turn pale at the
thought of attending a dinner, speaking at a board meeting or just meeting
new people.' Perhaps they have had nasty experiences on the communication
front: been caught drooping in Rio, or signed a deal in Tokyo to roars of
laughter. Or worse, they may simply have been using an outdated handbook.
Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is half a century
old and, as Glass points out, the world has moved on. The tenets of
effective communication enshrined in Carnegie no longer hold for the
Nineties. The Nineties are a new ballpark. 'Be upbeat,' urges Dr Glass,
'Oxygenate yourself.'
The rest of the world may be nodding when it means dissent, or beating about
the bush in all sorts of foxy ways, but in the US, overt friendliness is the
rule. Go in there with bags of eye contact. Crack a few jokes. Be a big
greeter. Kiss or hug if it feels good. But above all, be yourself. Be
straight.
So Carnegie is revised. 'Never tell a man he is wrong,' recommended
Carnegie. Not in the Nineties. Confront that man. Put him in the picture
about his mistakes. Tell him that you hear what he is saying, but tell him
he is wrong all the same. 'Let the other fellow feel the idea is his,'
maintained Carnegie. No way. It is your initiative. Label it with rightful
pride.
'Go for immediate assent,' advised Carnegie. Why the hurry? Sow some ideas.
Bring them on gently. Give your targets the space to come round. Carnegie
again: 'Make your praise lavish and your approbation hearty.' Whoa. Here we
are talking phoney praise, and phoney praise is worse than no praise. Do not
patronise. Think of it this way: a pat on the back is only a few vertebrae
removed from a kick in the pants.
How many copies of Carnegie are still around is anyone's guess, but if the
book is still in use, I like to think of executives handing out hearty
approbation for the blunders of their employees and wondering when this
technique will bring happy results.
The direct, upbeat and oxygenated style of the Nineties sounds frightfully
healthy: it smacks of improvement. But if Carnegie is finally due to be laid
on the shelves of our charity shops, some brief sentiment of farewell must
be recorded.
Civilised life largely rests upon a skein of white lies, pleasantries and
the tolerance of fools. Every day, we shoulder the trials of insincerity:
the onus of finding, as Philip Larkin put it, 'words at once true and kind,
or not untrue and not unkind.'
Carnegie based his counsel on the will to be liked, a will always more
palpable in the US than anywhere else. It can be nauseating - 'Missing you
already]' - but the alternatives are pretty horrific. One recent bestselling
book in Britain was entitled How to be a Complete Bastard. Traffic policemen
in the UK are, I believe, becoming almost inured to daily assaults upon
their persons.
Take off the veneer of niceness and circumlocution from everyday association
and you are left, in most cases, with something not far short of barbarism.
If we were to jettison completely the Carnegie technique, the result is not
hard to imagine. We would all start to sound like the protagonists of
television's Eastenders: speaking our minds for the most part in a tedious
flow of verbal exchanges which are nasty, brutish and short.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Re-tuning the orchestras: Off the Wall - Batons and
bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY the nation's orchestras are generating excitement. Not so much from
their playing - in the recession they are performing safer and safer
programmes - but from their organisation.
In the past, orchestras were dominated by glamorous principal conductors
while invisible general managers did the work behind the scenes.
Now principal conductors seem less relevant - they sell themselves to three
or more orchestras worldwide, often spending less than 10 weeks a year with
any one - while general managers are becoming the key operators.
When Paul Findlay moves from head of opera at Covent Garden to run the RPO
he will almost double his salary to Pounds 96,000. The leader of the LPO,
John Willen, and David Wheldon of the Philharmonia, are scarcely out of the
headlines as they brawl publicly over the respective roles of their
orchestras as residents on London's South Bank.
Meanwhile, Clive Gillinson of the LSO has just won the Pounds 10,000 Garrett
Award for his success in attracting sponsors to the orchestra.
But the dominance of general managers may be curbed as the two big
paymasters of classical music in the UK, the BBC and the Arts Council, both
of whom spend about Pounds 12m a year subsidising symphony orchestras,
finally get together to bring sense to what has become a chaotic scene.
History has given the Liverpool-Manchester conurbation three major
orchestras - the Halle, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the BBC
Philharmonic, while the east of England is musically bereft. London has five
major symphony orchestras, while the south and the west gets by with just
the Bournemouth Symphony.
The inquiry, by such heavyweights as Nicholas Kenyon, the new head of Radio
3, and Kenneth Baird, head of music at the Arts Council, will attempt to
redraw the musical map of the country - and redraw it quickly.
Its findings should be known by the end of the year and will look at
audience needs and local authority commitment as well as the future of the
orchestras.
Since it is well known that the BBC wants to cut the cost of running four
symphony orchestras, a package relocating one or two them to the east and
south, smoothed by Arts Council cash and a generous local authority, seems
likely. The Council might seek savings by reducing further the Pounds
400,000 it gives the RPO. Findlay will certainly earn his salary if he can
find a role for the RPO which is both artistically and commercially
acceptable.
* * * The recession is confronting the auction houses with many problems,
mainly built around fewer buyers for fewer decent lots. To this underlying
misery has been added a pretty problem - what to do about after-sale bids?.
It is an increasingly common scenario. There is an auction of contemporary
art or Old Master drawings with some decent pieces on offer, but the bids do
not quite reach reserve. Then, after the sale, the dealers make an offer for
an unsold lot at a price just below the last unsuccessful bid. It is very
tempting for the auctioneer. He makes a sale and picks up a commission. He
is inclined to advise the seller to accept rather than wait for the next
auction. So the buyer gets a bargain.
The trouble is that in a weak market more and more potential bidders are
waiting for the after-auction clear-out. Dealers see a saleable picture with
a low estimate of Pounds 10,000, perhaps a fair wholesale price in normal
times but with so few buyers around the dealer is reluctant to buy
additional stock. However, if he can obtain the picture for Pounds 8,000,
well, it becomes a fair gamble.
On average, two or three lots changed hands after the auction. Now the
number is increasing. Usually the vendor is contacted. If he or she is
desperate to raise money, a lower offer might be accepted. But auction
houses are equally desperate to make after-sale trading the exception. It
could undermine their business.
That at least is the official line. But last week, Christie's had to
improvise quickly twice on the same day. It was offering Old Master
drawings, until now a strong market. The department saw little need to
reduce reserves. But a drawing of a nude youth by Prud'hon, which provided
the cover illustration of drawings from the Woodner collection, failed to
reach its Pounds 60,000 low estimate. Minutes later bidding for a Guardi
drawing, which graced the cover of the general catalogue, stopped short of
the Pounds 120,000 reserve. When a dealer offered Pounds 100,000 for the
Guardi after the auction the temptation proved too great. Later the Prud'hon
was quietly sold to collector Fred Koch.
A consolation is that the trade is being hammered harder than the salerooms.
This has prevented 'rings' developing in vulnerable areas dominated by
dealers, with dealers sitting on their hands waiting for an after-auction
share-out among the trade.

<DATELINE>
   THE Carl Flesch International Violin Competition
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
billed as the 'most senior' of Britain's international executant
competitions and sponsored this year by British Gas - completed its 1992
course on three evenings of the past week. On Tuesday the six finalists took
their pick of a Mozart concerto (in the Old Library of the Guildhall, with
the Bournemouth Sinfonietta under Tamas Vasary); over Wednesday and Thursday
were spread their choices from the Romantic or 20th-century concerto
repertory (at the Barbican, with the Philharmonia under Andrew Litton).
On the evidence of only the latter two evenings, it would be a rash
commentator who risked any sort of hard-and-fast pronouncement about either
the overall standard or the particular quality of the young violinists
attracted to the Flesch this year. This is not going to stop me from
hazarding a guess that the latest edition of the biennial competition will
not come to be hallowed as the most bounteous promotion of violin talent in
its history; indeed, of the six players whose concerto performances I heard,
at least three raised worries on basic matters of technique.
Also on the evidence of just a single performance, it was easy to pick the
1992 winner: the Viennese Benjamin Schmid (b1968), a dashing figure on the
platform, who gave the Brahms concerto with the enviable assurance of a
seasoned professional. On each movement were lavished tones of succulent
lustre (coloured by a beautifully delicate, never mechanical use of vibrato)
and sturdy, well-tuned solidity even in the highest reaches and trickiest
cadenza flourishes.
Schmid was the only one of the six whose phrasing sounded entirely unflecked
by competition nerves. At no point, however, did I find his Brahms-playing
particularly interesting or individual; the feelings that one hopes to have
aroused on such occasions - the delighted discovery of a new artistic voice
and simultaneous re-discovery through it of the music itself - were missing
from the experience.
In this respect I much preferred the Bartok Second Concerto as delivered by
the American Steven Copes (b1971), with flashing, often exhilarating vigour
and a real sense of how the whole piece works and unfolds, not just its
dazzling effects and grateful passages. I also warmed considerably more to
the Dutchman, Armand Gouder de Beauregard (b1972), who played the
Tchaikovsky Concerto with a radiant singing sweetness (though this tended to
thin out and go spotty in passages of virtuoso knitting).
But Schmid was the judges' choice, not only as overall competition-winner
but for three other smaller prizes; he was also the recipient of the
Audience Prize. Gouder de Beauregard came third and Copes fifth; the ranking
of the second and fourth prize-winners, both disturbingly flawed technicians
and immature musicians, seemed quite incomprehensible on the evidence of
their Brahms and Tchaikovsky concertos.
Disagreement with an eminent competition jury (the 1992 Flesch jury
contained such distinguished names as Ricci, Pauk, Lubotsky, Imai and
Canino) is a time-honoured critical entertainment. In this sense above all,
the finals of the 1992 Flesch competition proved hugely entertaining.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Cervantes on water and a burlesque - Avignon Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE courtyard of the Papal Palace, the next most prestigious venue for
a performance in Avignon during the Summer Festival, now in its 46th year,
is the Cloister of the Carmelites at the other end of the historic city.
It is currently being occupied by a company drawn from many French regional
theatres, the Compagnie des Ours, directed by Robert Cantarella. He has been
given the task of directing the Siege of Numantia by Cervantes, translated
from the Spanish into French verse by Jean-Jacques Preau and Philippe
Minyana. This is another new production in this year's festival tribute to
the Golden Age of Spain.
Because of Don Quixote, we tend to think of Cervantes as essentially a comic
writer and in the eyes of posterity that may be so, but the main theme
throughout all his work is herosim of a most stoical kind, reflecting his
own hard life. Endurance against overwhelming odds is the theme of this
sombre play. In it, he dramatised events in 135 BC, when Scipio, having
destroyed Carthage, turned his attention and his troops on to the Spanish
town of Numantia.
The Roman general's strategy was to dig a trench around the town, completely
cutting it off from food supplies so as to enforce its submission without
losing a single one of his men. The play tells the sad story of how that
plan was frustrated by the valour of the Numantians.
Apart from its relevance as a theatrical model of Resistance - there was a
notable production in Madrid, besieged by Franco's troops, in 1937 - it
presents a modern director with severe problems. It relies largely on
declamation rather than dialogue, and there is no single hero or heroine to
engage the attention. Instead we observe a continual progression of
characters, some of whom are abstractions - War, Spain, Famine - while
others are real people with a brief part to play in the growing famine that
afflicts them all.
Cantarella has taken a stunning gamble with the text. He treats it in a mood
of continual burlesque, playing against its rhetoric, letting the poignancy
of its meaning emerge through a series of turns derived from cabaret,
vaudeville, musical hall, and circus.
The women glide on in low-cut ball dresses, the men appear as acrobats in
clown costumes, and for much of the time they all perform slapstick-style,
ankle-deep in water as the main acting area in front of the cloisters has
been flooded. Jazz group Trois 8 provides musical accompaniment to these
antics and the company takes the plunge, often literally, with style.
Some of the fun and games are hilarious. Sacrifices to the gods are made by
conjurors, and a man brought back from the dead makes a macabre reappearance
upside down.
Everything hinges on whether at the end, when the last few surviving
Numantians make their act of defiance and capture a loaf of bread at the
cost of their lives, Cantarella can pull back from farce to tragedy. Thanks
to a small boy (Antoinin Broutard), the ultimate survivor who jumps from the
top of a tower - a toy one - rather than surrender, the director just about
makes his bid; but it is a damned close run thing.
THE Spanish fever that has gripped this year's Avignon Festival is not just
confined to reviving some of the dramatic works of the era of Philip II. The
Festival has opened its arms to modern Spain and Spanish culture throughout
Latin America, nowhere more so than in the area of dance.
Avignon has always been essentially a festival of drama, but at the same
time has presented programmes of classical ballet, oriental and modern
dance. This year - in a signed statement - the directorate has made a
commitment to give dance the same status from now on as that given to drama.
By August 3, when the festival ends, 10 different dance companies will have
been seen, ensuring at least one choreographic work each evening.
The first was Plein Soleil by Joelle Bouvier and Regis Obadia, a new work
heavily Spanish in tone performed by members of L'Esquisse, the dance
company, based in Normandy and founded in 1980 by these two gifted artists.
At the outset, the entire company of six men and six women is on stage,
utterly still and subdued, staring at the audience. The women in black
dresses sit on wooden chairs while the men in suits stand beside them. The
music by Louis Winsberg sounds a plaintive air on cello and piano. Soft
light filters through the colonnade. The atmosphere is as heavy with grief
as the aftermath of a funeral.
Slowly the mood changes. The beat becomes more emphatic as percussion takes
over from strings, soon to be augmented by flamenco hand-claps. The men turn
to caress their partners; then passionately embrace them; then lift them
high in the air.
Now the sun breaks through and the music incites the dancers to frenzy. The
pairs re-form into groups and there are a series of breathtaking lifts as
women appear to be hurtling through the air before they are caught in the
arms of the men. The erotic charge generated slowly but surely makes the
recent ballet at Covent Garden on a somewhat similar theme, The Judas Tree,
seem as if it had been scripted by Enid Blyton.
Outside the ballet, homage to the Hispanic has been equally widespread. The
85-year-old Nobel prize winner Octavio Paz is here, attending conferences
and giving interviews while his native Mexico has been recreated on stage at
the Luberon village of Les Taillades by the innovative French theatre
director Georges Lavaudant in a strange melange of acting, mime, music and
dance.
Terra Incognita is a mixed media show concocted by Lavaudant and based on
his own Mexican experience as a young man.
He arrives in this country of extremes to attend a conventional ambassador's
cocktail party. The disjointed chatter is soon interrupted by the appearance
of symbolic figures and archetypes from the country's heritage - the
ever-present grinning death's head, the proud conquistadors, the slinky
nightclub hostesses, and last the native Indians. A Mexican trio and a
singer perform from time to time punctuating the rather fragmented scenario.
The whole farrago is acted violently by a talented troupe from the Theatre
National Populaire.
It all seemed a curious throwback to the evasive happy-go-lucky mood of the
1960s.

THE OMENS were not good. On the lawn outside the Business Design Centre in
Islington were 14 zinc baths riveted together in a sad circle (Legion by
Gavin O'Curry). Fresh Art, the second annual show by graduates at UK arts
colleges, looked like being as depressing and imitative as the original
exhibition a year ago.
But inside it is almost brightness and light. The students are in a much
more optimistic and colourful mood this year. Of course, there is still the
dear old-fashioned soul out to shock with an exhibit featuring a condom, but
the armchair composed of tampons is well placed.
The installation art, along with the videos, have been syphoned off into
their own area, which helps the main floor display to blossom.
So visitors need not get apoplectic about the future of British art. They
might also find some good buys. The students are more reasonable in their
pricing. The baths cost Pounds 2,500, but there are attractive wall
decorations for Pounds 350.
The London graduate colleges still stand aloof from the show, but this
display is the equal of anything we have seen at the degree shows in the
capital this summer.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Tirelessly original old master - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELLIOTT CARTER was born the day after Olivier Messiaen, but outlives him now
in the pinkest of health. Going on 84, he is more prolific than ever, not
least because he's laden with commissions: in the serious music world, he is
recognised as a tirelessly original old master. Almost any poll of composers
would vote him a seminal place in mid-century music.
Yet the wider musical public barely knows his name, let alone his works.
Where Messiaen's style - grandiose blocks of sound, oracular formulas,
stylised birdsong, lusciously poignant harmony - is easily parodied (and
many insignificant composers have been doing that straight-faced for years,
with some success), the notion of a Carter caricature hardly gets off the
ground.
Almost any Carter piece is clamorous with 'solo' voices, whether assigned to
a pianist's left hand, a whole viola section or a brass ensemble, and in
linear terms they betray favourite tics that could easily be mimicked. But
Carter's is above all an art of dramatic combination, of striking cogent
sparks from collisions - meticulously calculated - between wildly disparate
voices; missing that out would leave your parody vacuous, and to imitate it
well you would have to be as much a creative musical engineer as him.
All the recorded performances under review here - on Sony, the Juilliard's
conspectus of his quartets, and, on Virgin, the high-middle Concerto for
Orchestra, the serene 1990 Violin Concerto and his latest freehand
orchestral experiments - drive the point home to the hilt. It's a happy
chance that they should appear simultaneously; for between them they trace
Carter's glorious trajectory in an intimate medium (the string quartet, from
his revolutionary First to the Augustan radiance of the Fourth) and on a
grander concert-scale his progressive relaxation into 'accessible'
transparency and grace, without musical compromise.
Like his early mentor Charles Ives, Carter is a self-contained original. His
later musical education - with Nadia Boulanger in France, and afterwards
amid the populist ideals of the New Deal back home - made him a
sophisticated American composer with interesting quirks, when there were
plenty of others. Just before and after he turned 40, he thought hard, even
corrosively, about the formal possibilities of music: which veins were
exhausted, and which others might reward strenuous exploration.
Elliott Carter: String Quartets nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. Duo for Violin and
Piano. Juilliard Quartet, Christopher Oldfather. Sony S2K 47229 (two CDs).
Concerto for Orchestra. Three Occasions. Violin Concerto. Ole Bohn,
Knussen/London Sinfonietta. Virgin Classics VC 7 91503-2.
His 1946 Piano Sonata announced his first bold findings, and then his Cello
Sonata, and some wind-ensemble experiments. Those might be the best
textbook-introductions to this composer. In the late 1950s, however, it was
Carter's string quartet that travelled the world on records, setting
composers' imaginations alight.
The crucial new device, which for a time was called 'metrical modulation,
was this. One voice could match the others beat for beat, and yet - little
by little - come to stress beats at different distances, so as to establish
a new metre of its own. More ingeniously, it might subdivide the common
pulse in asymmetrical proportions (7-to-the-beat, say, against 5 or 4) and
then begin to fix the downbeat in new places, challenging what the other
voices strove to maintain.
As Carter realised, the result could be ambiguous and tantalising, or
equally make a strong, disorienting transition.
At either extreme it can generate fraught musical drama, and also unbridled
solo expression on a loose but still definite rein. His First String Quartet
explored those extremes on a visionary scale. My only reservation about the
new Juilliard account is that they are almost too familiar with it, more
intent upon making smooth sense - and every note translucent - than
enforcing the broader, starkly dramatic effects that first knocked us over.
Since the detail is so rich on its own, one can hardly complain. It is good
to find, nevertheless, that the Juilliard maintains sharper nerve-end
contrasts in the later quartets, where Carter's ordering of his musical
elements is more compacted and violent, though no less cogent. (It is also
rather moving to learn that the current Juilliard Quartet, sterling as ever,
retains only its leader Robert Mann from the teams who gave the first
performances of the Second and Third Quartets.) The Fourth Quartet,
impassioned but stately, blossoms into noble breadth and depth.
It is no accident that it should be a composer, Oliver Knussen, who conducts
the orchestral works on the Virgin CD to such incisive and beautiful effect.
Practical musicians are the people who are better placed than anybody to
appreciate Carter's high-definition writing - and to insist upon performing
him, even when the audience won't extend much beyond some cognoscenti.
In fact the Three Occasions are immediately appealing. First a witty,
intricately clever fanfare, 'A Celebration of some 100x150 Notes' (just what
it claims to be); then an elevated trombone elegy, 'Remembrance, with
chiaroscuro accompaniment; and 'Anniversary, a rigorously taut - but tautly
lyrical - present to his wife upon their golden wedding. As always, Carter
fans his inspiration through self-imposed formal challenges, and finds
brilliantly natural-sounding solutions.
The spare, silvery new Violin Concerto is eloquent, and eloquently delivered
by Ole Bohn. Its three shapely movements seem not to include any unabashed
climax.
In particular, the slow movement - marked 'Tranquillo' for the orchestra,
'Angosciato' (anguished) for the soloist - has the ring of cleanly assured
purpose, inversely proportional to anything like distress or disarray. So
what? The teeming 1969 Concerto for Orchestra also has too much lithe muscle
to register the darker with unambiguous conviction, but it is wonderfully
bracing to hear.
The great thing about Carter-on-records is that you can repeat it until you
know it properly, whereupon its extraordinary strengths become palpable. As
with the impacted Third Quartet: it is a continuous set of overlapping
'movements' for string-duos, each heard at least twice against different
duo-music, and composed on the patrician assumption that you'll listen to it
again and again until you appreciate the identities-in-difference in their
distinct lights. And so you should; the eventual rewards will justify a lot
of dogged attention.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Golden legend in Bond St - Patricia Morison joins the
175th birthday celebrations of Agnew's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGNEW'S celebration of its 175th birthday has been so successful that it is
extending the exhibition which marks the event until August 28.
Important chunks of the birthday cake were snapped up very early by the
likes of the Getty Museum, which bought Sebastiano del Piombo's saturnine
portrait of Pope Clement VII. But you may still be tempted by two panels by
Fra Angelico. The exhibition has been beefed up to significant effect, so
that even if you have already visited, it is worth making a second call on
Agnew's darkly soothing rooms.
Now to be enjoyed are: a lady's portrait by that always intriguing
court-portraitist for Queen Elizabeth I and James I, Robert Peake the Elder;
a Gericault oil of an animated scene at a farrier's yard; two drawings by
Tiepolo; and nine additional and stupendous watercolour landscapes of
England and the Continent by Turner.
One of the Turners, Gosport: the Entrance to Portsmouth harbour, was bought
by Ruskin in 1839 when he was an undergraduate. It is not so hard to believe
the old windbag's claim that during the vacation his 'chief recreation,
after Greek and Trigonometry in the nursery-study was 'to go down and feast
on my Gosport.'
Gainsborough's Cattle on a River Bank with Sailing Boats is one of the new
recruits. Admired by William Hazlitt, it is silvery-toned, almost
bleached-looking, and there is something ever so faintly surreal about it.
The cows on the steeply rising river-bank loom portentously over the rowing
boats, so much so that it seems they might be thinking about a mass
embarkation.
Not that you will necessarily see all these works. Nibbling by buyers
continues. Zoffany's often-exhibited portrait of the Willoughby de Broke
family harmoniously taking tea at Compton Verney was out on approval when I
called last week.
It is sad indeed to think that after more than two centuries with the
original family, this charming example of the English conversation piece
must now find a new home.
Given unlimited funds, it would be an odd buyer who did not prefer Fra
Angelico's beautiful pair of panels of four saints to three hitherto unknown
gold-ground panels by Mariotto di Nardo, one of his Florentine predecessors,
who died in 1424. All the same, I was much taken by the scenes from the life
 -and after-life - of St Stephen the Protomartyr.
The panels were part of the predella section beneath an altarpiece of the
Coronation of the Virgin, painted for the church of Santo Stefano in Pane.
The altarpiece was dismantled in the 1840s and the main panels were bought
by an English collector. Until the First World War or thereabouts, they were
together in a church in London's Hatton Garden. Mariotto's altarpiece is now
widely scattered, the two other panels dealing with St Stephen now residing
in collections in New York and Munich. The Agnew's panels are confident
exercises in story-telling. They show the young deacon preaching before the
Sanhedrin, his lapidation (a pleasant word for a stony death) by the Jews,
and burial. Mariotto then took the story further, using for his source that
medieval best-seller, the Golden Legend by Bishop Jacopo da Varazze.
It would be a service if a publisher would bring out an English-language
selection from the bishop's highly entertaining and indispensable
source-book to countless images of saints. I cannot believe there is no
market for such a book - just think of all the students taking art-history
courses, let alone the more mature church-cum-gallery crawler.
Saint-spotting is a delightful pastime and one which I am sure would spread,
if only there was an English equivalent of the long-standing Livres de Poche
edition. No one-volume dictionary of saints can ever go far enough into the
fantastic undergrowth which, by Bishop Jacopo's day, had sprung up around
saints' legends, teeming with details which may be charming, bizarre, or
even sadistic.
In Mariotto's case, the Golden Legend version led to a sharply different,
and specifically Italian, version of St Stephen's posthumous career.
The version of events documented by contemporaries in the early 4th Century,
is that a priest acting on angelic instructions dug up the Protomartyr's
body in a field outside Jerusalem. The bishop of Jerusalem was ecstatic and
bits of the holy body were then sent to favoured bishops all round the
Christian world.
The arrival of one piece in Majorca incited a pogrom. The piece which
arrived at Hippo in what is today Algeria, aroused immense excitement and
furnished St Augustine with a splendid conclusion to his City of God.
Yet Mariotto's version shows us the whole body of St Stephen being
transported to Rome in a delightful sailing-boat. On the right side, we see
that the thrifty Roman clergy decided to put St Stephen into the same
sarcophagus as St Lawrence (roasted on the grid-iron, you will recall). St
Lawrence's corpse obligingly moved over to make room.

AN unexpected item on Wednesday's Woman's Hour wasbreakfast with seven
female honorary degree holders of St. Andrews University, which is
celebrating the centenary of its admission of women.
They were a historian, a theologian, a novelist, a philosopher, an artist, a
molecular-physicist and a neuropsychologist: Jane Dempsey-Douglass, Louise
Johnson, Fay Weldon, Rosalind Hitchison, Brenda Milner, Wilhelmina
Barns-Graham and Lady Warnock.
They talked about women. Were men's and women's brains different? Philosophy
was gender-free, as were writing and science; but not painting - women go
for detail, men for main forms. Research showed men's and women's brains to
be alike, and here the talk veered into the practice and the ethics of
science.
On Saturday, it was good to hear Robert Louis Stevenson's unfinished Weir of
Hermiston on Radio 4. Robert Forrest's adaptation follows the book as far as
it goes - Archie Weir (Forbes Masson) rows about capital punishment with his
brutal father Adam, a judge. Adam says Archie will not do for the Bar with
his ideas and must stay with the estate. There he falls for Christina (Wendy
Seagar), sister of the wild Elliott brothers; but he resolves to stop seeing
her.
Stevenson's notes suggest that she now be seduced by Archie's friend Innes,
and Archie should kill him. Gaoled but rescued, he and Christina escape to
America. (The date is 1813.) Forrest sticks to this.
In America, Christina admits she is pregnant. This, I think, is Forrest's
insert, natural though it seems, and he leaves it there. It is a good tale,
well played in Scots under Patrick Rayner's direction.
Another effective adaptation, also on Saturday, was Radio 4's Classic
Serial, Guy Meredith's version of Camus's La Peste - a repeat from 1986
(part two is tonight). The outbreak of bubonic plague in Oran is observed
through the lives of familiar people. Dr Rieux, Tarrou, the journalist
Rambert and so on react - not as to a crisis - but as to tiresome daily
events. Those dead rats] Those new infections]
When their meaning is clear, there is no panic, just routine restrictions.
Their effects on different people is what infects the mind with alarm. Under
Cherry Cookson's direction, the atmosphere is magically suggested.
I must not overlook Radio 3 drama, now we know of its imminent reduction;
but Martyn Wade's Burn the Aeneid] on Sunday was no advocate. This is a
farce about Vergil's dying instruction to destroy the script of his great
epic. His executors try every way to avoid it, including the seduction of
Vergil's sister-in-law. The Emperor demands it shall be sent to him, but
Homer, the dog of one of the executor's, has eaten it. Never mind, another
copy has been concealed under Vergil's corpse. Cherry Cookson directed this
too, and got more fun from it than it deserved.
Radio 1's good deeds now include Unsung Heroes, a Saturday series calling
for justice to writers of pop songs. Often there are no credits on labels,
yet the songs are sung by millions, and such names as Albert Hammond and
Mike Chapman should be as well known as Bach or Mozart, though maybe not for
as long.
Writers interviewed last Saturday did not suggest musical genius. Music is
hardly involved, only an instinct for what 'sounds good', developing simple
chords around your title - which may have come up in everyday chat. Easy to
sneer at notes or lyrics; but they are what people want to hear, and to
sing, and deserve that much credit.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Faustus meets Arctic Willy - Youth Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROWDY mob has just staged its annual three day riot at the National
Theatre to enthusiastic applause from relatives and assorted thespian
worthies. Twelve youth theatre productions were chosen from more than 200
which took up the Lloyd's Bank Theatre Challenge for the prize of playing on
a national stage and working with professional actors, directors and
producers.
It is a challenge the actors, aged between 11 and 19, handled with aplomb,
as they threw themselves and their props around the Olivier and Cottesloe
theatres. They would never forget the nights and nor would their
professional mentors. Three productions left images in my mind.
An adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Dr Faustus by Unit 108 of the Orchard
Theatre Company from Devon, uses the original text merely as a starting
point to explore the fate of those who dare to test the truth as laid down
by the powers that be.
A nightmarish chorus opens the play, snaking across the stage to the strains
of sinister Egyptian-esque music. They chant the opening speech with the air
of those party to a vicious joke never shared with the audience and probably
at its expense.
In bizarre and sleazy costumes, with whitened faces made ghastly by garish
make-up, they establish that this is Allegory and we are about to be judged.
The action centres around a pub in 16th century Deptford.
In a series of flashbacks, the audience learns how Faustus found that the
study of philosophy, law, medicine and divinity could not answer his
questions, so he agrees to exchange his soul for 24 years of magical power.
Now, having spent his power on base whims like summoning the ghost of
Marilyn Monroe, time is running out and he is afraid. He pleads with Marlowe
to change the ending of the play and release him from the contract.
The 16th century setting is shot with contemporary references. In the pub, a
writhing stripper competes vainly with a conversation about Startrek.
Marlowe appears in the guise of Raymond Chandler's private detective,
complete with mackintosh and Hollywood theme tune.
The only prop is a versatile wardrobe. As the play opens, it is a gents'
loo, and then variously, a telephone box, a letter box and a coffin. The
wardrobe is the vehicle for symbolism. A stylised silhouette of a man stuck
to the wardrobe door signifies not only the gents' loo but also, when torn
off, the play's main theme - the fall of man.
The Dulwich College Dramatic Society's Arctic Willy, also uses theatre to
examine the human condition. Set on a glacier inside the arctic circle, the
play begins and ends with glaring hard light which subsides to reveal an icy
landscape made out of white sheets.
As the action unfolds, four young men stuck together on a scientific
expedition miles from anyone else discover that even when everything is
different, everything is the same.
For example, authority, in the shape of the Expedition Manual, is hopelessly
out of touch with reality. Addressing the audience, the team explains that
Dan has fallen into every available crevasse. (He worries about frostbite of
the penis - hence the play's title).
They gravely recite the manual's absurd and complicated instructions for
dealing with the situation. What actually happens is the other three have a
good laugh at poor Dan's expense and then haul him out of the latest hole.
It is the characters and the tensions between them which are the
production's real strength. Dan and Nick do not get on because of their
different ways of expressing their shared vulnerability. Dan is the bumbling
anti-hero who confronts his many anxieties and Nick is a bullying oaf who
pretends he is not as scared of polar bears as the others, all the while
fearing his weakness will be exposed.
Martin and Chris are both practical, hearty types engaged in a low-level
struggle for control. And they all jostle for food. Much of the time, the
actors address the audience directly, using cleverly choreographed movement
to engage the eye as well as the brain.
The play ends with Dan railing against the stupid insensitivity of the
others. He alone recognises the beauty of their surroundings. The play
suggests only those who are aware of themselves can hope to understand and
appreciate the beauty of life.
If Only I Had Friends, performed in the Cottesloe theatre, concentrates on a
specific kind of human relationship - friendship. It is a courageous and
compelling production devised by the Jeugdtheaterschool Zuid Holland.
Set on a chess board-like floor to emphasise the epic forces and formalised
rituals latent in the game of friendship, the two-man cast begins by looking
at making friends.
Through the device of recalling their first meeting at school, it becomes
obvious that their perceptions - both of each other and themselves - were
sharply different.
It is a gripping performance which only hints at resolution for the
questions it raises, but keeps the audience involved through the delicate
observation of the improvisation.
Rik was impressed by Hielke, who sported Doctor Marten boots when everyone
else wore Nike trainers. Hielke was flattered by Rik's admiration, but found
it unsettling because of his own self-loathing. The production makes clear
that the sub-text of friendship is the imbalance of power. One party will
always want what the other will not give.
The action is interrupted by scenes of friendship from Kenneth Grahame's
Wind in the Willows (Ratty meets Mole), Dickens' Oliver Twist (Oliver meets
the Artful Dodger), and a charming puppet show in which a butterfly teaches
a swan how to flutter.
These straightforwardly fictional scenes provide a foil for the real-life
relationship between the two boys and also make points about the dangers of
friendship. Friendship is about sharing experiences. This can be something
of a poisoned chalice if your friends are a bit odd.

INDIAN JOURNALS by Allen Ginsberg Penguin Pounds 6.99, 210 pages
POMES ALL SIZES by Jack Kerouac City Lights Books Pounds 6.95, 175 pages
MINDFIELD by Gregory Corso Paladin Pounds 6.99, 268 pages
THERE he goes, in a high ganja reverie, slipping in and out of the alleyways
of Benares in dhoti and lumberjack shirt, bespectacled and already balding
in his mid-30s, though he sports a big, holy man's beard.
On the wall of the dirty little hovel he shares with Peter Orlovsky, his
poet-lover, hangs the death mask of William Blake, prophet, seer, mentor to
the Beat Generation. Allen Ginsberg is dreaming of the spiritual rebirth of
America. The date? 1962. The re-publication of Ginsberg's Indian Journals of
1962-63 in their original form - complete with illustrations, and his own
idiosyncratic approach to grammar, spelling and other dubious orthodoxies -
is only one of a number of new and forthcoming titles from members of the
Beat Generation. Earlier this year, Viking America published a Beat Reader;
next spring we are promised the Kerouac/Ginsberg Correspondence from the
same publisher. For the moment we have, in addition to the Ginsberg
journals, the selected poems of Gregory Corso and, perhaps most interesting
of all, a hitherto unpublished collection of poetry from Jack Kerouac.
The Indian Journals, which consist of dream sequences, sketches, poems,
night reveries, political ravings, accounts of visits to opium dens, many
ganja-induced, crazed scramblings of past and present, and a number of
absorbing reflections upon the state of American poetry at the turn of the
1960s, possess an intellectual coherence and a vein of self-mockery that one
would not have associated with Ginsberg, that assiduous tinkler of the
cow-bell.
What they make clear to us above all perhaps, and setting all the
absurdities aside, is that the Beats genuinely regarded the East and its
philosophies as the best means of combating the wilfully corrosive,
hell-bent materialism of the West: their mission was nothing less than a
serious crusade to save America's soul from damnation.
Jack Kerouac's collection of 'new' poems has been a long time coming.
Written between 1954 and 1965, and taking in drafts of poems written in
Berkeley, Mexico, Tangier and the Bowery, it has been lying in Lawrence
Ferlinghetti's safe in San Francisco since Kerouac died in 1969.
It was not until 1988 that Ferlinghetti, in the course of an uneasy meeting
with Kerouac's widow at the dedication of the Kerouac Memorial Park in
Lowell, Massachusetts, aired the subject of the estate's releasing it for
publication.
There had been hostility between the surviving members of the Beat
Generation and Kerouac's family, who held the Beats responsible for driving
Kerouac into the addiction to drugs and booze that killed him. Now
Ferlinghetti has got his wish - a cheap paperback edition of Pomes All
Sizes, complete with his own portrait of Kerouac on the jacket.
The collection is rough, raw, uneven - and perpetually fascinating. There
are mystical, Buddha-friendly pomes; damp, sad, street pomes; pomes written
in the Quebecois French that Kerouac learnt at his mother's knee; streams of
haiku (that form so beloved of the Beats); slivers of pomes of all shapes
and sizes.
Scarcely a single one of them has been worked up into a state of formal
perfection - though such a notion would have been meaningless to the Beats
anyway, who worshipped above all things the God of spontaneity.
Corso's selected poems, Mindfield, are less engaging for a number of
reasons. Four years younger than Ginsberg, he clearly regarded himself as a
soaring, playful, mythical creature who could banter with words as if they
were a child's hoop and, in the course of pleasing himself by doing so,
delight us all.
Ginsberg over-praises him to the skies in one of several introductions to
the book - but we know that this is simply one more instance of speaking
well of one's friends.
Exclamation marks proliferate throughout Corso's work because life is
essentially Wondrous. Much of the poetry is written in a state of manic
delirium - evidence of a pure spirit throwing off its shackles.
Unfortunately, Corso has the ability to see off big themes - themes that
other, lesser poets, Shakespeare, for example, have shed a lifetime's blood
and craft over - with bravura gestures of a breathtaking platitudinousness:
'Death proved meaningless without Life.
While Ginsberg and Kerouac may have been wedded to the theory of the
importance of spontaneous effusion (or 'un-repressed word slinging' in
Kerouac's own words) as the most effective means of blasting the false
consciousness of America, they manage, at their best, to see reality sharply
and clearly.
Consider Ginsberg's harrowing descriptions of the burning-ghats of Calcutta
in Indian Journals, how the ghee streams down the cheeks of the decomposing
faces of the dead. . .
Though the Beats may have come walking down the mountain in stride with
Whitman and Blake, the scene was not necessarily shrouded in mist. Not all
of the time anyway.

DUNEDIN by Shena Mackay Heinemann, Pounds 14.99, 341 pages
LIFE FORCE by Fay Weldon Harper Collins, Pounds 14.99, 200 pages
BAILEY'S CAFE by Gloria Naylor Heinemann, Pounds 14.99, 234 pages
BODILY HARM by Rachel Billington Macmillan, Pounds 14.99, 399 pages
REAL liveliness is a quality much to be prized in a writer, and Shena Mackay
has it in spades. Her new novel, though sprawling and not immaculately
plotted, sparkles with wit and shimmers with lyricism even though it deals
with darkish matters.
It opens in New Zealand in 1909, whither Jack Mackenzie, more boulevardier
manque than dominee, has been sent to minister to a disapproving flock. His
interests lie in hunting and natural history rather than in preaching and
soon he is more involved with a beauteous mixed-race washerwoman than with
his retiring wife, Louisa. The effect on his children is hinted at. Then
location and time change, and the rest of the novel - apart from a brief
return to New Zealand at the end - deals with his grandchildren: William,
disgraced, repressed ex-headmaster with a child's life on his conscience;
his sister, Olive, independent, lonely, unhappy in love and full of splendid
destructive fantasies and biting assessments of life in Eighties Britain;
and a strange, slightly loony, wandering New Zealand boy, whose connection
with the family is revealed by authorial sleight of hand towards the end of
the book.
In truth, the book does not go anywhere very much: although the sins of the
fathers are much emphasised, there is vague causality and some flurried
tying-up of ends. But none of this seems to matter. Mackay's glowing
treatment of the natural world which refuses to be buried and subdued by the
grimness of modern Britain is in extraordinary counterpoint to her sharp way
with the obscenities of London life.
Mackay is scathingly funny about the tackiness of modern Britain, the
pretensions of literary life and female bonding. But some of her most
telling effects are nostalgic evocations of those long-lost post-war days of
comparative innocence, when Olive and William's father, the camel-coated
bounder, was in his element. These, and passages on suburban loneliness
('solitary walks when the plywood backs of dressing tables in bedroom
windows exuded melancholy and a curtain blowing at an open window was as
sinister as a noose') are of the very highest order.
In Shena Mackay's novel, the life force is everywhere. Flowers, foliage,
birds crowd on to every page, as antidotes to the sere spiritual and social
life of modern London. Fay Weldon, as ever, takes a more skewed and
sceptical view of the same scene. Her life force is Leslie Beck, raffish,
uncultured entrepreneur, whose conversation at his neighbours' dinner tables
in trendy NW1 in the 1960s left much to be desired - unlike his enormous
organ, which was the desire of all the wives.
Now, 25 years later, a story of multiple deceptions among the chattering
classes is told mainly by Nora, apparently the quietest of all but revealed
as as much in thrall to Leslie's influence as all her friends. Leslie is
despicable, but none of the others comes out of it much better, except for
poor dead Anita, his last wife, whose artistic creativity survives as a
reproach to the other women, and Marion, whose single-minded ambition kept
her aloof from the self-justifying disingenuousness of the group.
This is not Fay Weldon at her best, but even in low key she can tease,
tantalise and scandalise better than any other writer today. No one has
written better of those lost Sixties days, when people still had dinner
parties and could kid themselves that all was well, and no one is clearer
sighted about illicit sex. Not recommended for the faint-hearted with
something to hide.
With Gloria Naylor we are into an altogether different order of things.
English women's problems may be all part of the Struggle, but they pale into
insignificance before her passionate account of the lives of black American
women in the earlier part of the century.
In Bailey's semi-mythical cafe, the regulars are mostly the inmates of
'Eve's boarding house' along the street, taking a break from their clients.
Naylor's mode is to hover between fantasy and the hardest of realities to
tell the lives of these women in a mixture of high-blown, incantatory prose
and appalling physical detail.
This kind of exalted, bluesy style is a million miles from the deliberate
understatement of English writing and needs a different kind of approach to
reading. Naylor hammers at you from the depths of her rage at the injustices
meted out to her sisters and, by extension, to all those trodden underfoot.
It is American writing given its freest rein and it moves in the way that
the best jazz moves. A revelatory antidote to the more parochial, though
incisive, English mode of Mackay and Weldon, it is like one of those
Victorian misery books such as Mrs Haliburton's Troubles.
With Bodily Harm we are back on to safe English territory, in spite of the
subject matter, which is serious crime, punishment and redemption through
love.
It starts with an unprovoked crime: Patrick Downes, educated, spiritually
wounded, launches a frenzied stabbing attack on Lydia, a young woman who
visits the shop where he works. She survives, psychologically crippled. He
goes to prison, and, in a profoundly unconvincing turn of the plot, meets
her again after his release. They turn out to be each other's salvation.
For all its apple-pie ending, this is a serious, caring novel about the way
that life is not all about blaming events for one's deficiencies. Even Pat's
appalling experiences in prison, his gradual brutalisation by a flawed
system, are not seen as simple triggers for bad behaviour, and Lydia's
wounds are demonstrated to be part of an original pattern. It is a
respectable, solid, responsible novel which deserves attention.

Seagrave's latest iconoclastic look at recent Asian history

DRAGON LADY: THE LIFE AND LEGEND OF THE LAST EMPRESS OF CHINA by Sterling
Seagrave Macmillan Pounds 20, 384 pages
WHAT Indiana Jones is to archaeology, Sterling Seagrave is rapidly becoming
to contemporary history. The product of four generations of Americans in
Asia, he spent his childhood in the Burma/China border country and his young
manhood as a journalist rattling around the region with an insouciant air,
elastic-sided boots and a whiff of good intelligence contacts.
His years as a journalist have stood him in good stead now he has turned to
the business of biography, for he has an eye for a riveting angle and a
good, iconoclastic story. He destroyed the remaining American myths
surrounding anti-communist Asian allies in The Marcos Dynasty, and in the
swashbuckling Soong Dynasty, biographies of three clever ladies, one of whom
married a Shanghai triad gangster and became Madame Chiang Kai-shek.
But journalistic enthusiasms can tempt the writer into sensationalism and
polemics, even into a refusal to allow facts to interfere with a good story.
The impact of the Marcos book was diluted by too many pages devoted to a
wild goose chase after speculations that the ruling pair had acquired the
rumoured Yamashita gold, and elsewhere a readiness to go beyond the findings
of (admittedly impressive) research has provided plenty of fodder for
critical academics and nit-pickers. In recompense, Seagrave's books boast a
non-academic verve and narrative sweep.
The Dragon Lady is devoted to the thesis that Tsu Hsi, the Dowager Empress
who ruled China for a disastrous 47 years (during which the country fatally
failed to respond to the challenges of the West and of modernisation) was
not, as popularly supposed, a murderous, scheming tyrant who strangled
domestic reform and backed China's chauvinistic 'ironhats' against the
'outer barbarians.' Seagrave would have us believe that Tsu Hsi was a
charming lady, immured within the Forbidden City by destiny, dynastic
pressures, ambitious princes, reactionary mandarins and scheming eunuchs -
'a woman at the mercy of her advisers, swayed first one way, then the
other.'
Seagrave makes an impressive attempt to blame the historic distortions
surrounding her on a mad fantasist and forger, Sir Edmund Backhouse, the
Peking foreign community's guru and co-author of what was thought to be the
most authoritative account of Tsu Hsi's reign. Backhouse's lack of any
credibility, his spite and (in spite of his homosexuality) his pornographic
descriptions of imagined couplings with Tsu Hsi herself, were exposed in
1978 by Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper in his book Hermit of Peking. But
Seagrave claims Trevor-Roper failed to carry his findings to their logical
conclusion and reject Backhouse's verdicts, especially on Tsu Hsi and the
Chinese capital's palace politics.
Seagrave must break many other icons in making his case. The first to go is
the legendary, and non-Chinese-speaking, Dr George Morrison, Peking
correspondent of The Times, who let Backhouse colour or even file many of
his dispatches which shaped public opinion and later research. Another
Backhouse dupe was the same newspaper's man in Shanghai, JOP Bland, who also
bowed to the fraud's claimed access to court sources and imperial documents.
But thereafter Seagrave meets the problem of all polemicists: any voice
dissenting from the theory must be explained away or dismissed as valueless.
Even those on the side of the angels must be cast aside: evidence of China's
reformers, chief among them Kang Yu-wei, the first protagonist of
Neo-Confucianism (which advocated combining China's traditional virtues with
progress and modernisation) is discounted as the bile of disappointed,
largely exiled, victims of court intrigue. The later republicans and
communist revolutionaries had their own good reasons for maligning the
imperial record (did not Mao Zedong himself comment knowingly that China's
experience of female leaders was not a happy one - although he probably had
his own wife in mind?). Seagrave argues that posterity has only listened to
the voices of those who fell under the Backhouse spell; the rest were
shouted down or maintained a hypocritical silence.
It is all possible, and Seagrave makes a good, if sometimes overstated, case
for his picture of a well-meaning, dutiful lady guiltless of the crimes and
errors that littered her reign. But he cannot prove his case: the very
secrecy enclosing the Court which enabled Backhouse to peddle his forgeries
denies Seagrave the evidence for rebuttal. And Seagrave fails to ask the
question basic to all mysteries: cui bono? Who profited from the deaths of
the boy-emperors on whose behalf she was regent? Who was most threatened by
the the barbarians' ideas of democracy?
Looming behind such questions are matters of greater moment which Seagrave
does not probe: Tsu Hsi tragically failed to see beyond the confines of
China's walls and to pierce its illusions of centrality and cultural
self-sufficiency. These nurtured its unwillingness to learn from or respond
to the ideas and inventions convulsing the world outside China's frontiers.
Across the sea, an equally shattering and constrained monarchy had
nevertheless produced the Meiji emperor, and Japan learned the foreign
technologies quickly enough to share in the dismemberment of the Ching
Empire.
Whether she was victim or villain, the Dowager-Empress Tsu Hsi was
symptomatic of China. Today, her dynastic successor Deng Xiaoping occupies
her throne in the Forbidden City, vainly replaying her role as a Chinese
King Canute, ordering back the tides engulfing the outside world.
Marina Warner's 1972 biography, The Dragon Empress, will be re-issued as a
Vintage paperback in October (Pounds 6.99).

KAHLIL GIBRAN: HIS LIFE AND WORLD by Jean Gibran and Kahlil Gibran Canongate
Press Pounds 17.50, 456 pages
IT IS easy to mock: the profits from The Prophet, Kahlil Gibberish, schlock
philosopher. But in the 70 years since it was published, The Prophet, Kahlil
Gibran's prose-poem, has been a constant bestseller. In the US of
prohibition and depression, its mystic counsels were a soothing alternative;
in the 1960s it was a counterculture guidebook; in the '80s the message of
spiritualism overcoming material success was lapped up by disillusioned
Yuppies.
'He sounds like Jesus,' gasped the maid who hid behind a screen to listen to
Gibran's dinner party chit-chat. 'Let's not copy the Bible, but we can bear
it in mind,' he wrote to The Prophet's editor. Who was the man behind the
cult, and why was he so compelling?
Forget critical judgment. It does not matter whether you think, as I do,
that Gibran's mix of rhapsodic aphorisms and everyday devotions is
sentimental mumbo-jumbo, or, like the authors of this new biography, that he
is one of the great poets of the 20th century. This account is an off-beat
personal drama told by authors - Gibran's nephew and his wife - so at ease
with their background that it also grippingly entertains as social history.
Here, as if they had walked out of a Henry James novel on to these pages,
are the Boston Brahmins, socially glittering, inwardly moralising, worrying,
manipulating. Into their charmed circle comes the illiterate Lebanese
immigrant staking out a place in 1900s American art and letters. Love of the
exotic, decadence, puritanism, sex, paternalism - all determine the
subsequent heady relationship that is the story of this book.
It begins near the Cedars of Lebanon, where Gibran was born in 1883 into a
poor Christian family. In the 1890s, minus his ne'er-do-well father, they
emigrated to Boston, where his mother became a peddler on the streets of the
Syrian ghetto. Within a decade, three of the five Gibrans were dead of
cancer and tuberculosis, leaving Kahlil and a sister.
Marked out early as more gifted and beautiful than the rest, Kahlil was
noticed by a schoolteacher who sent him to Boston's philanthropist-decadent,
Fred Holland Day. Day imitated Oscar Wilde and enjoyed plucking immigrant
urchins from the streets, rigging them up in elaborate versions of their
national costumes, and photographing them. Given embroidered Arab burnooses
and a water-pipe, Kahlil posed as a young sheikh, read Maeterlinck, became a
'pagan' nature-worshipper, had some illustrations published and got invited
to Boston drawing rooms.
Boston intellectuals were then flocking to private lectures on 'The Karma
Yogi', spiritual movements from the Christian Scientists to the Society of
Psychical Research were recent Boston inventions and, says his nephew, 'the
young Syrian fitted well into the transcendental atmosphere.'
Patron number one, a glamorous poetess called Josephine Peabody, 'proclaimed
that she would become a Buddha' if she spent much time with him; she was the
first of a string of hostess-lover-editor-muses to be held in his thrall.
When she married, Gibran replaced her with Mary Haskell, a liberal
headmistress whose swashbuckling habits and flirtations with lesbianism were
alarming Boston parents. A Yankee Jean Brodie, she was besotted with him for
20 years and even scavenged from her neighbours' cooks in order to fund him.
Sought out yet misunderstood, feted yet still the outsider, Gibran first
wrote in Arabic. It was the oriental mysticism implicit in the English
parables and poems - The Madman, The Forerunner, then The Prophet - which
brought him fame as a western mage from the east. Writing at a time of
growing disillusion with organised religion he tapped a popular nerve with
foreign-sounding biblical cadences pleading for spirituality yet liberalism,
a sort of soft drug religion for those who could not stomach hard orthodoxy
but wanted mystical highs. But the message seems also to encapsulate
pioneering American optimism: 'The whole Prophet is saying just one thing:
you are far far greater than you know - and All is well,' Gibran said.
Taken up by Knopf, Gibran was relentlessly hyped - one dust cover falsely
quoted Rodin calling him 'the William Blake of the 20th century'. This
biography, as devoid of critical spirit as almost all commentaries on
Gibran, does not attempt to analyse the work; curiously prudish, it ignores,
too, most of the rumours of drinking and womanising that surrounded the
writer. Do not buy it for answers about an elusive personality, but as a
story of survival, assimilation and extraordinary social constellations, and
of the making of a cultural phenomenon, it rattles along splendidly.

THE CREATIVE MOMENT by Joseph Schwartz Jonathan Cape, Pounds 16.99, 252
pages
CURRENT controversies might suggest that among the reasons for science's
equivocal position in contemporary society is its conflict with religion.
But in Joseph Schwartz's view, the main problem with science is its
inaccessibility.
Non-scientists find science difficult to understand and are therefore afraid
of it; but this is a recent phenomenon, Schwartz argues, and there is no
good reason for it. Until a century ago science was - or at least could be -
anyone's business. Now it is as arcane and complicated as the most secret
mystery cult and in consequence has alienated itself from our culture.
Schwartz aims to show that science need not be mysterious. If all of us, or
more of us, were scientifically literate there would be no 'two-cultures'
problem, and the people who walk the corridors of power, most of them arts
graduates, would no longer be strangers to science but brothers to its
practitioners. Among the gains would be a dispelling of fears and false
hopes alike: fears about the harm science might do, and false hopes about
the problems it might solve and miracles it might perform. There would also
be an end to such fruitless enterprises as the quarrel between religion and
science.
Schwartz holds that people misunderstand science chiefly because of the
obscurity in which it cloaks itself. On an old-fashioned view science is the
quest for objective truth. But to Schwartz science is not a search for
truth, and it is not objective. Rather, it is a search for understanding,
and it proceeds by trying to persuade us to a perspective on the world
constructed from interpretative evidence and argument.
In the jargon of the philosophy of science Schwartz is an 'instrumentalist'
as opposed to a 'realist'. Realists hold that science discovers
independently existing facts about the world, and that therefore scientific
theories are objectively true or false. The instrumentalist, by contrast,
regards science as the product of our creative efforts.
It is a narrative devised by ourselves to explain ourselves and the world.
This does not mean that it is arbitrary or fanciful, for it is sharply
constrained by experience. But it is the product of our own creativity
nonetheless.
Accordingly, our theories are to be viewed as instruments used to predict
the course of natural phenomena and (to the extent possible via technology)
to control them. No one asks of an instrument, such as a knife or a garden
spade, whether it is true or false; one asks whether it does the job it was
designed for. Scientific theories are instruments in the same way: they are
not true or false, just more or less useful. Once one has grasped this,
Schwartz says, one sees that our view of science is outdated and
unnecessarily obscurantist.
To demonstrate his thesis Schwartz takes us through some of the central
'creative moments' in the history of modern science: Galileo's discoveries
with the telescope, Newton's work on mechanics, Einstein's relativity
theory, the Manhattan Project, the bizarrely beautiful theories in current
elementary particle physics.
Schwartz's account is fascinating and wonderfully clear. Its chief
contention is simple: without derogating from the individual achievement of
the thinkers concerned, these 'creative moments' have to be understood as
complex social events, and that understanding them reveals the true meaning
of the scientific advances they represent.
Schwartz's concern is that in the course of these developments science has
ceased to be a universal possession and has transformed itself into
impenetrable specialisms, so that there has come to be a division not merely
between scientists and non-scientists but between deciders and doers in the
realms of industry and technology, with many negative consequences. Only if
science can be integrated into a single cultural outlook, Schwartz argues,
will it help us cope with the immense problems - environmental, demographic,
and others - facing the world.
Schwartz makes a good point. The future is a minefield for the peoples of
this dirtied, overburdened planet, so it is imperative that we should all
grasp how to think about nature and the technologies which our view of
nature generates. Science is too important to be left hidden behind the
veils of specialism and technicality.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Books: Peru's twin paths to terror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHINING PATH by Simon Strong HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 274 pages
PERU UNDER FIRE Americas Watch Yale Pounds 12.95, 169 pages
THOSE who believe that the collapse of the Soviet Union means the end of
communism should read Simon Strong's book. A ruthless group of revolutionary
communists at this moment threatens the state in Peru. According to Strong,
its influence will spread, not only to Peru's neighbours but also to rich
countries, where it will fill a vacuum and provide a focus for the
disaffected and violently-inclined political left.
The group is Sendero Luminoso - Shining Path - or, to give it its full name,
'The Communist Party of Peru by the Shining Path of Carlos Mariategui and
Marxism, Leninism, Maoism and the Thoughts of Chairman Gonzalo'. It sounds
like a parody, but Shining Path is deadly serious, responsible for thousands
of killings in Peru since its campaign of terror began in 1980.
It is led by a shadowy former philosophy lecturer, Abimael Guzman, the
Chairman Gonzalo of the group's title. Guzman, a disciple of Mariategui,
founder of the Peruvian socialist party, sees himself as the torch bearer of
the true revolution. He has described Cuba's President Castro as a
'revisionist' and Che Guevara as a 'chorus girl'.
Guzman has succeeded in combining revolutionary rhetoric with an appeal to
the Andean mythical tradition, in which the white man is believed to live
off the Indian's fat and blood. In trying to explain why Shining Path has
proved so durable, Strong does not shy away from the conflict's racial
roots. To many of Peru's upper class, made up of the 15 per cent of the
population that is of European extraction, poverty is seen as the result of
a racial flaw.
These upper income groups dominate the officer classes of the armed forces;
they are deeply alienated from the Indians who populate the zones influenced
by Shining Path. The army acts like an occupying rather than a protective
force, as terrifying to the peasants as Sendero itself. Indeed, one
conclusion from Peru Under Fire, a brave and painstakingly-researched book
by Americas Watch, is that the army is as much the problem as the solution.
It estimates the repressive policy has killed 23,000 and has displaced
200,000.
Sendero is not having it entirely its own way. Peasant self-help groups, the
rondas, armed by the government, often are effective against the guerrillas
 -but are also often used to settle scores and perpetrate further human
rights abuses. According to Strong - who was the Independent's stringer in
Lima - evangelical protestants are also a source of frustration for the
terrorist: 'The dogmatic belief that they will go to heaven if killed
maddens Shining Path.' The growing power of the protestants was demonstrated
when they helped President Alberto Fujimori to power in his surprise victory
over the the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 presidential elections.
Fujimori was to abandon them soon after his victory.
The relevance of these books is enhanced rather than lessened by Fujimori's
suspension of constitutional order in April, even though both were written
before it happened. The president justified his action in part by the
supposed extra freedom it allowed for dealing with Shining Path. But giving
the army an even freer hand is unlikely to prove a solution and risks
further polarisation of society.
As Americas Watch concludes: 'It is difficult to be hopeful about Peru.
Sendero enjoys a mystique of discipline and cruelty, while the state appears
at best a leaky boat, at worst a shipwreck.'

FT  18 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Motorway brings some real countryside
within reach / Finding some attractive property nestling in the pleasant
landscape along the M40 corridor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRIVERS have taken a while to appreciate the attractions of the M40, the
alternative route from London to Birmingham via Oxford, Banbury and Warwick.
When it opened in January 1991 traffic was sparse. But long before then the
road had had an impact on the property market in the 'M40 corridor'. In
1988, prices leapt 5 per cent above the 35-40 per cent general increase in
the South East, as buyers anticipated that the new road would make the
beautiful, little-known country of north Oxfordshire, south Northamptonshire
and south Warwickshire a delightful  - and undervalued - place to live in
and commute from.
Today, the M40 - a less exhausting drive than the M1 - is busy. Even so, it
still offers a fast route for people who live near it. From Banbury it takes
80-90 minutes to reach London's West End and less than an hour to
Birmingham.
Tim Hammond, a pharmaceutical consultant based at Pinner, recently moved
from St Albans to an old farmhouse near Bicester when he found that his
family could live in real country, in a better value house, only a 60-75
minutes' journey from his office.
'Every ten miles out of London along the M40 corridor, you get that much
more house for your money', says relocation agent Patrick Doyne of Stacks
(0608-661594), until you meet the demand pushing down from Birmingham.
Slowly the M40 is transforming the country in a 20 mile radius of Banbury
and, says Ian McConnel of Savills: 'If you have a good house, new on the
market and realistically priced, someone will snap it up'. In Culworth,
eight miles north east, both the Manor House and Wheatsheaf House found
immediate buyers last month, paying the sensible asking prices.
The countryside is packed with places to visit, from Blenheim Palace and
Stowe to the Rollright Stones. There are spired churches set against large
skies and in Lois Weedon graveyard is the monument of the poet Edith Sitwell
with her hands sculpted in bronze by Henry Moore.
Horses rule many lives in the M40 corridor and on the roads are a constant
deterrent from driving too fast. Hunting is with the Heythrop, Warwickshire,
Grafton or Bicester - when you may meet the FT's Robin Lane Fox.
There are drawbacks. There is a dearth of places to eat, the maps in The
Good Food Guide show a large blank round Banbury. The Department of
Transport has renumbered the roads to encourage people on to the M40. This
does not confuse the locals, but it has made all the maps out of date. The
M40 has also encouraged crimes against property, as burglars - like
housebuyers - have spotted how quickly they can drive from Newcastle or
Bristol and do the robbery. They are back on the motorway before the burglar
alarm has been switched off.
Motorway noise is another trouble: 600-700 claims wait with the District
Valuer in Oxford, for reduction in the value of property because of motorway
noise, under part 1 of the Land Compensation Act. Inquire carefully if you
are buying near the road. Ask also if village bypasses are planned - several
are in train in Northamptonshire - and how the land around you is zoned for
development when speculative builders start work again in a few years.
In the mid-80s many villagers sold their kitchen gardens for huge sums as
'infill' building plots. Today realistic prices are 30-40 per cent below the
August 1988 level.
Cottages are always available. Lane Fox in Banbury (0295-273592) has a tiny
essence-of-England thatched cottage in the small village of Thenford at
Pounds 110,000, with the extra attractions that it is four miles from the
motorway, and Michael Heseltine is village squire.
In Weston, near Brackley, Lane Fox is offering the Post Cottage at Pounds
128,000, a Northamptonshire vernacular building in limestone with darker
ironstone banding typical of the local style. In Fritwell, near Bicester it
has a refreshingly un-vernacular Georgian box-shaped, sash-windowed cottage
at Pounds 179,500, and in Adderbury, a smart village outside Banbury with a
noble church often used for concerts, Adkin (0295-277781) is selling the
former village school at Pounds 195,000. Thirty minutes closer to London,
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Oxford (0865-790077) offers Creeper Cottage at
Pounds 215,000 in Great Milton, home of Raymond Blanc's Manoir aux Quat'
Saisons restaurant.
The next price level includes grand houses in larger villages, such as
Deddington, where Savills (0295-263535) offers The Little House, or Priors
Marston near Daventry where Lane Fox has Hillview House, both at Pounds
250,000. In Woodstock, near the gates of Blenheim, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley is
selling the elegant, Georgian Old Town House at Pounds 475,000. Halifax in
Banbury (0295-271199) has Aston Farmhouse, with a Northamptonshire banded
facade, in Aston-le-Walls at Pounds 300,000.
Right at the top of the range are two splendid country houses. Poundon House
near Bicester (Savills, Pounds 1.25m) is grand Queen Anne, and Catesby House
near Daventry is Jacobean, incorporating Tudor linenfold panelling and a
genuine Jacobean staircase (Jackson-Stops in Northampton, 0604-32991, Pounds
725,000). Cluttons offers an estate at Stoke Lyne, two miles from exit 10 on
the M40, at Pounds 1.4m as a whole, or for sale in parts.
The biggest attraction for the better off may be the old Morrell family
house and estate at Broughton Grange west of Banbury, which has been in the
family for 200 years. One owner was Philip Morrell MP, husband of Lady
Ottoline of Bloomsbury Group fame, but he and his wife did not live there.
They were busy entertaining Maynard Keynes, Duncan Grant, DH Lawrence and
the rest at Garsington which is itself near the M40 outside Oxford. Savills
is offering Broughton Grange for Pounds 950,000.

FT  18 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Why Basildon Man turned blue - The
changing complexion of a political bellwether of the housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEX CATALANO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASILDON in Essex is Britain's new political bellwether. All the figures -
10 per cent unemployment, a high level of house repossessions and a
population weighted towards C2s, the upwardly mobile working class that is
being hammered by the recession - pointed to a Labour party victory in the
last UK general election.
Instead, Basildon Man and Essex Woman returned the sitting Conservative MP,
David Amess, with a comfortable majority and then voted out the local Labour
council. The results may have flown in the face of economic indicators, but
Basildon, some 25 miles east of London, is all about aspirations. A former
new town, it is where east Londoners traditionally go to better themselves.
'A lot of people were frightened that if Labour got in they would not be
able to buy their house, or even have their houses taken away from them,'
says Robin Burton, who sells gold jewellery in Basildon's open-air market.
'I know staunch Labour party members who rushed out to buy.' His family
moved into Basildon in 1963 and he bought his first house in 1971 - for
Pounds 5,750. Now he lives outside the town. 'It's great as a stepping
stone, people are able to move on.'
From Romford and Ilford, the town is a short hop over the M25, a planned
sprawl of low-rise housing surrounded by Essex's green belt. In the 1890s
Basildon attracted Eastenders who dreamed of owning a plot in the country;
in the 1990s it caters to first-time home buyers.
The area, originally a group of agricultural hamlets, was opened up by the
new railway linking Fenchurch Street in the City to Southend. Speculators
snapped up the large farms along the line, auctioning off small plots to the
upwardly-mobile workers of east London.
Badly housed and overcrowded in the capital, east Londoners escaped to their
plots on weekends and holidays, building huts and occasionally more
substantial shelters. By the mid-1940s 'plotland' had become a rural slum,
lacking proper roads, sewage or water supply. Short of resources, Essex
County Council and the district petitioned for a new town. Their application
was supported by Newham in East London, which was struggling with a serious
housing shortage after the war. In 1949 Basildon - then a village - was
designated a new town; the first house was completed two years later.
Today, thanks to sell-offs and private building, about 60 per cent of
properties are owner-occupied. According to the Halifax Building Society,
Basildon's typical terraced house was selling for nearly Pounds 67,700 five
years ago; now it is more like Pounds 47,000. 'The market has been going
down gradually in the last two to three years,' says Mark Reardon, the area
manager of agents Bairstow Eves.
Sandra Gurton's experience is typical. A big fan of Basildon ('I love
Basildon; there are a lot of really nice people and things to do'), she
bought her first house last June. A former council property which had been
repossessed, it cost Pounds 37,000. Today it is worth Pounds 32,000.
However, she has not been hit as badly as those who bought at the peak.
'There is a lot of people who are very unhappy. They paid a huge amount and
are now stuck.'
However, according to Mark Reardon, the housing market has improved since
the election. 'The number of repossessed houses coming on to the market has
slowed,' he says. 'Prices are not going up in any shape or form, but we are
certainly selling more houses.
At Woolwich Property Services, Ian Storey also notes a pick up. 'Six months
ago it was mainly first-time buyers moving into empty properties. Now there
are fewer repossessions, more chains coming together.'
Prices are a factor in this recovery. Basildon property is 'cheap', or as
the agents say, 'very, very affordable'. This is particularly true for
first-time buyers, who tend to make up the bulk of the market in Basildon.
The other options - Billericay and Brentwood - are much more expensive. 'The
market there is completely different; for the same house you would pay
Pounds 65,000,' says Mark Reardon.
This price difference reflects what he calls 'snob value'; Basildon has not
shaken off its image as an ex-council town. And indeed, Basildon provides a
potted history of post-war public sector building styles. Older
neighbourhoods reflect the Garden City approach: low density, short brick
terraces and semi-detached houses with generous gardens. The 1960s and '70s
brought timber boxes and the low-rise, yellow brick estate locally nicknamed
Alcatraz, while the 1980s gave way to privately developed enclaves of ersatz
Tudor or Georgian brick houses.
The popular areas of town are Lee Chapel, north and south, and Kingswood,
which skirts Basildon's golf course. Both are within walking distance of the
town centre and the railway station. About half of Basildon works locally -
Ford and GEC are major employers - but with the rail journey only 35
minutes, the town also has its fair share of City commuters.
To move up-market in Basildon requires a literal climb, to Langdon Hills,
the second highest spot in Essex, a leafy neighbourhood of quiet cul-de-sacs
and crisply-kept gardens. The typical Langdon Hills house costs Pounds
130,000 to Pounds 150,000. And there are less expensive options: a three
bedroom terraced house on Nightingales, built five years ago by Countryside
Properties, is on the market via Woolwich Property Services at Pounds
73,500.
After Langdon Hills, the only move is out, to the countryside around
Basildon. There are new developments on the fringes, such as Great Brook
Mead, a 300-house complex built by Countryside Properties. Here a brick
two-bedroom cottage costs Pounds 66,950, while four-bedroom houses are on
offer for Pounds 159,950.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Sport: Watch out for the axemen - Olympic Rowing / The
rowers and oars which will dominate in Banyoles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROWERS often feel they are on the fringe; a restless minority striving for
the recognition on the world's sporting stage. The site for rowing at the
Olympics seems to support that view. The regatta, on a lake at Banyoles,
north-west of Gerona and 124 km from Barcelona, is well away from the heat
of the foot lights.
However, the lake is almost perfect for the athletes because it is a fair
course. Many courses are affected by the weather. On some courses the
outside lanes suffer more from cross winds. At some, such as Holme
Pierrepont in Nottingham, a few crews shelter in the lee of a bank if there
is a cross wind, as others battle their way through white water. There
should be no such problem at Banyoles. Furthermore, to avoid the glare of
the noon sun, racing will start at 8 am and finish by 11.30 am.
The sun may have set on East Germany, but its athletes, especially the
women, are still shining in the unified German team. At the Lucerne regatta
in June, the last international competition before the Olympics, Germany won
six gold medals out of a possible 12 in events that are in the Olympic
programme. German women took three golds out of a possible five with Canada
breaking the clean sweep by winning the coxless pairs and fours.
A test of strength in depth in any squad is the performance of the eights.
Germany won men's and women's eights at Lucerne. The men's eight has been
unbeaten for four years. Its present line up is unbeaten this year and it
has defeated the US, Canada and the China. Unless the New Zealanders or
Australians have been cooking up something special, the gold medal will be
on its way to Germany.
The women's eights event is more open although the Germans are favourites.
The Russians, British, Canadians and Chinese have useful crews but the best
of the rest are the Romanians. Television coverage of women's rowing is
sparse but look out for the slightly smaller but ferocious Romanian eight
and its aggressive attack.
Britain's gold medal hopes rest with Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in
the coxless pair. Redgrave was off colour at Lucerne and the pair did not
race. But under the watchful eye of former East German are fully fit for
Banyoles. Redgrave and Pinsent expect a stiff challenge from the Germans.
The 39-year-old Pertti Karppinen of Finland will be going for a record
fourth gold in the single scull. His first win in 1976 coincided with the
introduction of women's rowing at the Olympics. Karppinnen joined the
three-golds club in 1984 but failed to make the final in Seoul. He showed
some of his old form coming third in Lucerne with a glorious charge for the
finish line. However, he was four seconds behind the winner, the formidable
Thomas Lange of Germany.
Lange has dominated men's sculling since he won the world championships in
1987. Since then he has taken the Olympic crown in Seoul and gold in world
championships in 1989 and 1991. He won the FISA World Cup this year by 11
points from Vaclav Chalupa, from Czechoslovakia, who may well split
Karppinnen and Lange on the medal rostrum.
Lange, a medical student in his mid-20s, is a product of the old East
Germany. His father, a high ranking Stasi officer, committed suicide in the
year the wall came down. Lange is a firm believer in the old East German
system and has stayed in the east.
The main talking point at the games will be the oars. Since March the rowing
world has been in the grips of a blade revolution. It was then that a new
asymmetric blade took to the water in the US. The spoon had been redesigned
and made 20 per cent bigger with a larger area below the shaft. It resembled
a hatchet and looked ugly.
Since then the blade has been surrounded in mystery and controversy. Some
coaches claimed they represented unfair competition. Technology was winning
over technique and the poorer clubs and nations would be left behind.
In the spring, some US colleges called for a ban on the hatchet. Some
mediocre crews were getting good results with them. The blades were not
banned and the crews that had complained opened their cheque books and
bought the hatchets just to keep up with the Joneses.
At Henley Royal Regatta, at the beginning of July, the majority of
successful crews had the mystical hatchet. However, Pangbourne College,
using traditional blades, dealt a notable blow for commonsense when they
defeated Westminster School, using hatchets, in the final of the schools'
event.
Although no test has proved whether the new blades have magic properties
they have prompted a sheep-like rush of orders and they will provide a
useful topic for anxious commentators to fill any awkward silences.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Sport: Adding some polish to Woosnam's game - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS initiation ceremonies go, it didn't match the Freemasons'. There was no
rolled-up trouser leg or bared chest and blood was not drawn. The passing of
this flame took place when Ian Woosnam slowly pulled the gold watch from his
left wrist and handed it over in complete silence.
Woosnam's watch was received with all the reverence due to an object that
might have cost its owner several thousand pounds had he bought it. The
recipient slipped the chunk of gold on his right wrist. This man, who now
wore a watch on each wrist, had been a writer a moment earlier. Now, for
better or worse, and certainly for nothing, I was a caddie.
This had not been anticipated but you do not ignore the opportunity to
caddie for the 1991 US Masters' champion, and a leading contender in this
week's Open. To be allowed to carry Woosnam's bag around Valderrama during
last Sunday's skins' game, and thus run an eye over his game at close
quarters was a bit like being given the chance to ride a favourite in the
Grand National four days before the off.
'Keep up, shut up and clean up,' was one piece of advice that was passed on
to this would-be caddie. Others included: 'stay sober,' and 'speak only when
you're spoken to.' The most ominous, however, was 'watch out for the
bricks'. It was a reference to a practical joke Nick Faldo played on a
hapless writer fulfilling the same role for Faldo as I was for Woosnam. The
journalist took 12 holes before he discovered the extra items in the bag.
Woosnam's bag contained no such hazards. If not quite as spare as a
butcher's pencil, it was lightly laden. It was 80 in the shade there was no
need for an umbrella or rain clothes. Water was provided on each tee so
there was no need for us to carry our own. He had ten new gloves still
crinkling in their Cellophane, dozens of green pencils with rubbers on the
one end and 15 balls some of which I marked with a pencil dot scored into
the balata covering directly above and beneath the number. And a nearly
empty packet of cigarettes, two lighters and some mild pain killers.
The first crisis came early. Our opening drive finished a few inches ahead
of Fred Couples's. Woosnam stared at the green. 'What've we got, John?'. I
reached in to my pocket and pulled out the yardage chart we had been given
on the first tee.
It consisted of a drawing of the hole, on which were arrows. Some pointed to
the green, others to the tee. There were numbers alongside each arrow, 145
and 159. Working that out was straightforward even for someone who did not
trouble the examiners at maths O level. One was the distance in yards, the
other in metres.
'Is that to the flag or the front?' Woosnam asked. At this moment a TV
camera homed in on us, beaming our image to hundreds of thousands of viewers
in South Africa. A microphone was poised to record our conversation.
Suddenly, a sense of panic descended and the life of a journalist seemed to
have regained much of its appeal. 'And where's it from?' continued Woosnam.
I did what any self respecting journalist would have done in the
circumstances. I hummed and hawed. I dithered. Relief was at hand. 'I don't
get this,' said Couples, a frown on his face. He turned to the master of
ceremonies, a quintessential Englishman dressed in shorts, who replied:
'It's in metres to the front of the green.' Woosnam heard this. The pressure
was off.
Thereafter, Woosnam had the measure of his caddie. On each green he would
pick up his ball and toss it to me and I would rub it fiercely in the wet
towel I carried until the ball gleamed brighter than a town hall door knob.
I gave him a new ball every three holes. We tried to co-ordinate our views
about the line of a putt but when I said left lip and he said it was an inch
to the right then it became clear that we were as far apart on the same
issue as John Major and Neil Kinnock.
My main worry was not to get in his way - or anybody else's. I had to clean
Woosnam's ball, place his bag so that it didn't impede the cameras, make
sure I did not walk on any other player's line, keep his clubs in the right
section of his voluminous bag. It was a job to keep up, what with 40 lbs
slung across my shoulder. As I trudged to the fourth tee, I felt a club
being replaced firmly in my bag. 'Better not lose a club, mate' said Greg
Norman cheerfully.
In first round of the Open on Thursday, Woosnam scored an excellent 65. I
knew he was running in to form last Sunday when he accepted my daft advice
to take a driver on the eighth at Valderrama, a hole much more suited to a
one iron. So if success comes his way at Muirfield tomorrow it can be said
we began it last Sunday. If it doesn't, he will have thrown it all away.

<TEXT>
DIESEL cars account for 12 per cent of British registrations and that figure
is climbing. As recently as 1988, it was less than 5 per cent.
A further boost will come from the Citroen ZX Turbo which is quite simply
the best small-medium diesel car yet. Powered by the first turbocharged
version of the 1.9 litre XUD engine, the ZX outperforms some petrol- engined
cars of similar price while offering around 47 mpg (6 l/100 km) diesel
economy.
Both the Pounds 11,370 Avantage and Pounds 11,970 Aura have power steering,
electric sunroof and front windows and remote- control central locking. Aura
buyers get alloy wheels, better upholstery and smarter external trim.
With masses of torque (pulling power), the ZX Turbo's driveability is
unmatched. For a diesel, acceleration through the gears (0-60 mph/0-96 kph
in 10.3 seconds) is unusually vigorous. More impressive still is the way it
pulls up steep hills in the 25.3 mph (40.7 kph) per 1,000 rpm fifth gear
without slackening pace. Ride and handling are best in class.
The engine is quiet at tickover, barely audible at a motorway cruise. Build
quality is up to best German standards. The ZX Turbo is so good that anyone
in the market for a 5-door for under Pounds 12,000 would be perverse to buy
a petrol-engined car without trying it first.
I have just two grouses. Tall drivers will find the front seats too short
and it would be better if the back seat cushion folded forward to provide a
completely flat, load-carrying floor.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Motoring: Learn to drive like a boy racer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGING lane twice in a double swerve at 85 mph (137 kph) is something few
M25 thrusters would think of doing, especially if they were driving Pounds
86,000 worth of V12 engined Mercedes-Benz 600 at the time.
But last week I was encouraged to do just that. No, not on a motorway but on
a coned-off runway of an old airfield. Mercedes-Benz was demonstrating what
it means by intensive driving safety training.
Owning or leasing a Mercedes means you drive one of the world's best cars
but it does not follow that you appreciate how to get the best out of it.
Which is where Guido Moch comes in: his driver training programme does just
that.
Moch's courses are normally available only in Germany. He encourages drivers
to discover the limits of their skill and of their cars' capabilities in
surroundings where no harm is done if both are exceeded. Then they are told
how important it is to stay well below those limits on roads.
'The purpose of driving safety training is not to allow people to drive
faster in future,' he says. 'Its sole purpose is to increase safety, promote
calm and familiarise people with a correct and safe style of driving.
Spectacular driving is always slower and more stressful and therefore
ultimately pointless.'
The training is quite exciting. I spent a giddy 15 minutes driving a 190E
around a water-soaked circle, experiencing the difference between understeer
(the car has to be held into a turn) and oversteer (the back tyres lose grip
and the tail swings out).
Next, the Moch Snake - a course with as many left and right-hand corners as
Hampton Court maze - had to be driven round at increasing speed in a 300SE.
Then it was the double-swerve in the 600SEL, back into a 190E for a smaller,
faster Moch Snake followed by slower, slipperier exercises.
First came a slalom, followed by stopping, spinning the car through 180
degrees in reverse and then back though the slalom again. Second, a low
speed swerve under ABS braking on a surface like black ice. And finally, all
the tests in quick succession against the clock. One ends with various
impressions: the sheer nimbleness of the great V12; the reserves of
roadholding and handling a 190E displays when pushed to the limit of tyre
grip and beyond; the danger in thinking that ABS brakes allow normal speeds
to be used on ice.
They do not. All they can do according to the laws of physics is to make
best use of what tyre grip there is. On ice, the only safe way to drive an
ABS-equipped car with normal tyres is slowly and gently.
Back to Guido Moch. 'Anyone trying to defy these laws is neither an expert
nor a superman but is ignorant . . . tired of living . . . or stupid,' he
says.
Such thoughts never enter the minds of the high-speed, wet weather
tailgaters who make motorway travel less safe and more stressful than it
need be.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Sport: How I took my Vitamins - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE not often served Stilton as a soft cheese. Such was the heat and
humidity on a recent Sunday that I managed to do it at the picnic before the
Intellectuals' annual cricket match. It was about all I did manage, apart
from taking a wicket with my first ball, when it was too late to make a
difference.
The game was in the tradition of Intellectual ineptitude, on display in a
contest as amicable as it was uneven. It really is true to say that it does
not matter who won, because the play provided such sparkling oddities that
the result could not hope to compete with what had gone before it.
Even better, I don't know what the result was. We did not get the 185 we
were set at tea by our opponents, the Vitamins, but we had slightly less
batting time and we only lost seven wickets. We could not have won, we
probably lost, but we may have drawn.
The Red Arrows flew past, over and round the ground, just before the game,
obviously in our honour. I won the toss. After that, things lost a bit of
momentum. We should have batted. It would have been less exhausting. But we
bowled.
I remembered what Derek Underwood, the Kent and England left-arm bowler, had
told me: psychology was the strongest weapon in cricket and I put this
year's psychological weapons on to bowl. At one end: Noel, whose accurate
bowling had taken six for four last year. At the other: Simon, a 6 ft 6 in
researcher into medieval Spain and an unusual bowler. He holds his bowling
arm straight out behind him as he runs in to deliver the ball from a
prodigious height, with prodigious effect.
'Even if you can't think of a good move, make it look as if you've got one
planned,' Underwood had said. 'Look dangerous. Finger the ball. Adjust the
field. Worry the batsman.' Simon's high-flying beamers and upwards wides
looked dangerous. They must, surely, have worried the batsmen but, alas,
only enough to induce one to help the ball on its way for a straight six.
Dramatic stuff, fast bowling.
With the score at 50 for 0, I moved myself in to field at an extremely silly
mid-on, smiling at the batsman, close enough to see the individual hairs in
his eyebrows. The Vitamins' volunteer umpire told me, correctly, that I
could not field so close in if I distracted the batsman. But I reckoned that
was the batsman's problem and sighed, sadly, for our customary umpires, who
both away in Devon, leaving the game bereft of their magisterial silence.
I caught one opener near his knees when he had made 27. The other retired at
65 not out. Nice, but humiliating. Over 100 scored with only two batsmen
gone. The Intellectuals' morale was low and fielding poor as we slipped in
streams of our own sweat. At this point Martin, a university don, changed
the game with his bowling.
It was not bowling to the Underwood prescription, shot through with threats.
Rather, it was of the enigmatic school. It mesmerised rather than alarmed.
His first ball floated in all directions through the warm, sticky breeze,
then drifted softly down towards the stumps. The batsman shouldered arms and
left it, only to suffer the double indignity of seeing the ball remove the
bails and the bowler burst into incredulous laughter. By the time Martin had
removed two more Vitamins for two runs in nine balls, he was almost
hysterical with mirth and ended up lying on the grass, crying with laughter.
Bowling of inconceivable subtlety.
No other Intellectual could hope to compete with it, though I, too, took a
wicket with my first ball. The difference was that mine was a loose ball.
The batsman swiped, the ball found an edge and the catch was taken. The
Vitamins had slid from 121-1 to 145-5.
But the heat interfered with the flight of my bowling and it was hit with
some force. My penultimate ball was not bad and the umpire told me so with
an air of kindly surprise. As I came up to bowl my last ball, I told him
cheerfully that he was a patronising, sexist bastard, which the all-rounder
lawyer on our team considered bad politics; better to be obsequious to
umpires. But it was tea-time; nothing mattered. They were 184-5 declared and
we were only too happy to sit down and drink.
By the time we strode out to bat, there were fewer of us. One member had
left for the hospital, with a daughter injured while watching. Charles
limped to the crease at No 6, injured while watching the earlier batting too
actively with his daughters.
But it is quality, not quantity, that counts. Our brave wicket-keeper opened
well with Noel, who ended the day in triumphant exhaustion, 59 not out. He
looks well schooled.
Noel's father struck a quick series of fiery blows, only one of them not
producing a run. Charles, inspired by his painful leg, always yearned for
the boundary, exquisitely straight driving for four the first ball he
received. Our lawyer batted stoically. I was doing my stint as umpire and
could see it all from close at hand.
Even so, I am ashamed to admit that extras were our second highest scorer,
with 25 out of our total of 170-7. This was partly due to the enterprise of
a round-arm Vitamin called Henderson, who bowled six wides in nine balls,
using something akin to the old-time slinging action.
I must not give the impression that it was a stupid game. It was not. It had
some strange moments but it also contained some high-class cricket and was
played seriously and light-heartedly throughout.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Drink: The baroness and the wine baron - Jancis Robinson
talks to a Dollars 20m double act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Philippine de Rothschild was 30 minutes late for our hour-long
meeting, which is not bad going for her. And she did have a very good
excuse: 'It's so difficult for us women to get dressed in hotels]' she
wailed as she sashayed in to one of the well-upholstered sitting rooms above
London's Gavroche restaurant from her bedroom next door.
Her business partner, 79-year-old Robert Mondavi, the biggest cheese in
California wine, had got up in Paris at 5am to be at the meeting and had
arrived, after checking-in at Claridge's, on the dot.
The two partners were in London to make a noise about their latest joint
spending spree, a luxurious winery for their famous co-production, Opus One,
an ambitious red made in the Napa Valley to the same recipe as first-growth
bordeaux Ch Mouton-Rothschild. So how much did this new winery cost?
'Oooch. That's difficult to say,' said Mondavi politely, before wandering
off down precious minutes' worth of conversational byways, taking in gravity
flow, cement floors, basket presses . . . 'Now,' broke in the Baroness next
to him, impatiently stroking her geometric black and white silk shift. 'You
asked about price and I think we should answer this because otherwise it
sounds as though we don't want to talk about it, which is not the case. I
would say Dollars 15m.'
'How much?' asked Mondavi, whose hearing is less keen than his forehand
nowadays.
'I would say between Dollars 15m and Dollars 20m,' beamed the Baroness.
Mondavi's jaw dropped. 'Okay, it's a little bit less than the real cost,'
said the Baroness patting his knee, 'but I'm sure, Jancis, you'll agree with
me.'
'I don't agree with you,' muttered Mondavi from his corner of the sofa,
before mustering a brave smile.
They make a great double act. Both with their own family-owned wine empires,
each with a solid base of high-volume lines (Mouton-Cadet and Central Valley
bottlings respectively) providing the cashflow for the world-famous,
high-cachet products they concentrate on (Ch Mouton-Rothschild and Mondavi
Napa Valley Reserve wines). They each have a 50 per cent stake in Opus One,
originally devised as California's most expensive wine by the Baroness's
late father.
But, like Mouton-Rothschild, Opus One is finite. The winery has been
lovingly sculpted to produce just 20,000 cases a year (rather less than the
average production of Ch Mouton-Rothschild) which, even though Opus retails
at around Dollars 65 a bottle, does rather obviously raise the question of
when they expect this grandiose transatlantic pipedream to start making any
money.
Much whistling and rueful laughter from both corners of the sofa. 'I would
say that . . .' Mondavi began.
'Can I answer that?' the Baroness asked. 'Our grandchildren's generation,
not before then.'
A mock-horrified Mondavi accused Philippine of spreading such gloom 'just to
make this interesting', but if Opus One does reach profitability within 20
years, as it surely will, it will be faster than any Bordeaux chateau this
century.
Twenty million dollars certainly sounds remarkably modest given the
project's scale. Although Philippine was at pains to point out that, for
reasons of economy, she had nobly renounced having her own quarters
incorporated into the winery.
It was while telling me about all this that Mondavi used the phrase 'we
didn't flinch', repeated several times. He talks as though what he has been
through is an experience that would have had many a lesser man flinching.
And he admits that his financial advisers have done more than their fair
share of flinching.
But, for both parties, Opus One is a big long-term project. Stuart Harrison,
the outfit's sales and marketing director and in pre-winery times its only
employee, surely has one of the world's easier jobs. Nowadays Opus One has
merely to be allocated: three-quarters is snapped up in the first six weeks
after release by America's avid collectors and the rest is carefully shared
around the rest of the globe (just 150 cases for the UK).
After my 30 breathless minutes with the two partners, I found myself sitting
between Messrs Harrison and Mondavi comparing the extremely suave,
definitively world-class 1987 Opus One with the much gawkier current
vintage, 1988. Were these wines priced the same? I asked Mondavi. 'I
certainly hope not,' he said, 'let's ask Stu.' The hapless Stu had to
confess that, if anything, the younger wine was more expensive. Mondavi was
furious. 'Now that's against everything I stood for]'
But Robert Mondavi (who is currently busy 'looking at' Chile) is having to
pay the price of age, and has handed over his business to his two sons, Tim
and Michael. As chief winemaker, Tim makes the winemaking decisions about
Opus One with Patrick Leon of Mouton, one of 90 Rothschild employees and
associates who were flown to California at the end of May.
The 1991 vintage was the first to be made at the new winery, as opposed to
the Mondavi winery across Highway 29, and rumour has it that it will be one
of the greats. For my money - or rather yours since I am so unsophisticated
 -I want a bordeaux first-growth if I am paying a bordeaux first-growth
price; the best Opus vintages have been the 1982, 1985 and 1987. Wine
merchants Adnams, of Southwold, in Suffolk, list the 1985, drinking
spendidly now, at Pounds 46.50 a bottle.

FT  18 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Great ideas for happier holidays - Lucia
van der Post selects nifty gadgets for stylish travelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S holiday time. Time for quick get-aways, time to get wised-up on the
essentials for happy travelling. Here are just a few of the best new travel
ideas.
Homeway &amp; Downpour sells a small range of very useful travelling accessories
 -some, such as the picnic rug and the acrylic picnicware, are widely
available, but a few genuinely useful items are not so easy to track down.
The Pack-a-Bags, for instance, are a series of roll packs with strong,
zipped see-through compartments in which things such as medicines, suncare
products, toiletries and the like can be kept.
They can either be bought empty and filled with whatever you deem to be
essential or, for the lazy or the very busy, there is a series of
ready-filled packs. These hold the usual holiday emergency items - sting
relief creams, insect repellents, plasters, thermometers, paracetamol et al
 -but for those travelling to countries where medical standards may be in
doubt there is a Sterile Medical Pack (Pounds 9.15) which includes syringes,
needles, disposable gloves and other useful things in cases of medical
emergency. Write to Homeway &amp; Downpour, The White House, Littleton,
Winchester, Hampshire SO22 6QS or tel: 0962 - 881526 for a leaflet.
Fun swimming caps - otters, alligators, sharks, frogs, dolphins, turtles or
seals - cost Pounds 12.95 each from The Leading Edge, Harrods,
Knightsbridge, London SW1.
For the climbing, diving, adventurous sort the Minolta Weathermatic is a
completely waterproof and shockproof camera - take it water or snow skiing,
yachting, pot-holing, scuba-diving, parachuting. It costs Pounds 199.95. If
you want a camera with a zoom the Pentax WeatherZoom (Pounds 229.99) has a
38-90 mm power zoom, is compact and though not completely waterproof it is
weather resistant and will not give up on you if it gets splashed.
International beauties swear by Flight Age Cream, a moisturiser to keep the
skin well lubricated while flying in dry aircraft cabins. Pounds 30 from
prescriptives counters.
If you cannot bear to miss the latest from the Olympics, the Oval or
Goodwood, then Casio's palm-sized TV-7 may be just the thing. Small enough
to fit into a large shirt pocket (3 ins by 1 ins by 4 1/2 ins) it has a
built-in aerial and a socket for an external aerial. Pounds 129.99.
Long journeys with small children can be hell - try keeping them quiet with
cassettes from Travellers' Tales. There are more than 1,000 titles ranging
from Black Beauty to The Hobbit, from thrillers (Peter Cheyney, Agatha
Christie, Conan Doyle) to all-time classics. Six tapes can be hired for one
week for Pounds 6, eight for Pounds 8 and after the first week the charge is
6p per tape, per day. Annual membership costs Pounds 20, lifetime
membership, Pounds 100. Useful not just for keeping the kids quiet but also
for those who often have to drive long distances. Write to Travellers'
Tales, Great Weddington, Ash, Canterbury, Kent CT3 2AR (tel: 0304-812531)
for details.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Food: A poor man's picnic of pig tail pie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXTAIL and ox tongue rejoiced in a revival last winter, when menus in smart
places boasted homely dishes such as ox tongue served hot with a spicy
Seville orange sauce, oxtail soup and and old-fashioned oxtail stew with
dumplings.
Now it is the turn of the pig, the humbler cuts are once again finding
favour. Heads, trotters and tails are the bits to go for.
Bath chaps and pigs head brawn, freckled with parsley, gleaming with jelly
and crumb coated, make good eating on a fine summer's day - particularly
when partnered with a mustard sauce or a vinaigrette dressing and
hard-boiled eggs, capers and gherkins.
Even better for a picnic, less hassle for the cook to prepare and less
hassle to eat, is a pig tail pie with its double crust of pastry acting like
bread to sandwich the meaty filling neatly.
Pigs' tails are most easily bought from pork butchers and old family
butchers in Ireland, Wales, Wiltshire and north country pig-keeping
strongholds. The belief lingers on in these areas that every part of the pig
is good for eating except the squeak, and pig tails were a popular treat
after a pig slaughter.
PIG TAIL PIES (makes 2 x 8 inch pies)
The tail of the pig is flavoursome meat and cheap (45p per lb at my butcher
last week), but in its absence the pies can be made with belly of pork
instead.
For poaching: 3lb pigs' tails (ask the butcher to cut them in half); 1
onion; 1 1/2 pt hot water; a slurp of concentrated apple juice or cider
vinegar; half a chicken stock cube.
For the filling: 1 large or 2 small sharp eating apple(s); 4-5 oz
Wensleydale cheese; a bunch of spring onions; about 8 tablespoons chopped
mint; 2-3 tablespoons chopped parsley or coriander.
For the pastry:  1/2 lb each wholemeal and white flour;  1/4 lb each butter
and lard; a generous seasoning of salt and pepper; about 5 tablespoons water
to bind; beaten egg to glaze.
Wash the tails. Quarter the onion but do not peel it, and tie it loosely in
buttermuslin. Put both ingredients into a large pan, pour on the hot water
and bring to the boil.
Skim, add the apple juice or vinegar, the stock cube and half a teaspoon of
salt. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 2 hours.
Remove the onion, and set the pan aside until the contents are cold, or
leave it overnight if more convenient.
Scrape off the surface fat and take the pig tails out of the jellied stock.
Cut away the rind and surplus fat, and strip the meat from the bones: the
net yield should be about 1 1/4 lb.
Peel, core and chop the apple, slice the spring onions and dice the cheese.
Mix them together with the chopped pork and herbs. Season with plenty of
salt and pepper. The filling should be well flavoured, not insipid.
Make the pastry and use half of it to line two metal pie plates measuring
about 6 1/2 inches across the bottom and 8 1/2 inches across the top. Divide
the filling between the tins, mounding it up well in the centre.
Cover with the rest of the pastry, sealing the edges well. Glaze, make a
steam hole in the centre of each pie and hold it open by inserting a piece
of rolled card.
Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 190'-200'C (375'F-400'F) gas mark 5-6
for 35-40 minutes.
Let the pies rest for 5-10 minutes when they emerge from the oven. Meanwhile
barely melt the jellied stock over a low flame and adjust seasoning to
taste.
Using a funnel, spoon the warm jellied stock into the pies to plug the gaps
and hold the filling together neatly.
Leave until the pies are cold and the jelly is set before slicing and
eating.

A hardy herbaceous perennial with delightful flower heads, each like a tiny
Victorian posy made for a doll's house. It is composed of a central domed
cluster of very small white flowers surrounded by a flat collar of pointed
white bracts. In a slightly moist soil and a sunnyor partly shaded
place it will spread rapidly by self-sown seedlings. There is a fine
purplish red form named Rubra which needs to be increased by division as
seedlings are likely to prove variable in colour. Where it is grown among
white astrantias many seedlings are likely to appear more or less pink.
There is also a variety named Sunningdale Variegated in which the
deeply-divided leaves are heavily splashed with cream.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Travel: Bird's eye view of Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS when we visited the Roman Catholic church that the rumours began and
the Vietnamese security men stepped up their vigil. Rumour had it that we
had given the priest gold or hundreds of dollars; that one of our group
spoke fluent Vietnamese; that our mission was more than our stated aim of
bird conservation.
Thirteen of us had gathered, from the US and England, to help 'save the
cranes of Vietnam.' The project, organised by Earthwatch, the environmental
charity, was a working holiday that we paid to take part in.
Our job was to help the world expert on cranes, Dr George Archibald, compile
data on the birds' habits and to proselytise to the locals - the Sarus crane
was feared lost to Vietnam until recently and its future remains precarious.
The church visit, on a rare afternoon off, probably gave the highest
possible profile to the bird project.
Home for 10 days was Tam Nong, a dusty town on the junction of five canals
of the Mekong river system, just 12 miles south of Cambodia in Vietnam's
south-west. Accommodation was the local communist party headquarters: a
nondescript cement block with resident mice, cockroaches and armies of red
ants, no hot water, often no electricity.
Tam Nong did not exist a decade ago; now it serves as a frontier town for
the thousands of impoverished farmers relocated to the area by the
government. The farmers need all the help they can get to eke a living from
the land: last year their rice fields and homes were completely flooded in
the wet season.
From the bridge that spans the main canal you can see river life in all its
glory. Ripe mangoes, coconuts and bags of rice travel to market aboard barge
boats, whose motors sound uncannily like wartime helicopters. Women wash
their hair by the banks in the same water that washes their vegetables - the
same water that serves as their outdoor toilet. Pigs and dogs and children
scramble on the canal sides, providing an endless cacophony of noise.
The noise level rises further still when a westerner comes to town. Mobs of
curious giggling children follow Pied Piper-style, trying out their limited
English, wanting to hold or shake hands.
Kent Converse, a Kansas farmer, and Noel Bell, an electronic technician from
California, had visited Vietnam before, to fight the communists in 1967.
This time, they wanted to do something constructive for the country, to make
amends for the war. And here they were, just 30 miles from where Kent was
wounded in his helicopter, hugging their former Viet Cong enemies after an
emotional introduction. Like us, they encountered nothing but friendliness
from the Vietnamese. Nevertheless, we were watched.
Tam Nong is nowhere near the tourist track, requiring a day-long journey
from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, by road and water. We were
definitely disrupting day-to-day life in the region, causing at least
temporary inflation in a town where the staple diet of noodle soup and
coconut milk costs about 10p and a French baguette - the ubiquitous legacy
of French rule - 2p.
After the church visit - catholicism has been tolerated locally only in
recent years - a popular pastime was guessing which of our Vietnamese
companions were the security men. One simply gave the game away. His
Vietnamese-American phrase book contained such telling phrases as 'I am
willing to do it for my lieutenant' and 'The enemies are outnumbered. They
use human wave tactics.'
An inkling of wartime horrors came on the day we walked across a wetland
field for five hours in search of the Bengal florican, an unobliging bustard
that did not show its face. The former battlefield was like a natural booby
trap, scratchy thigh-high grass giving way to deep muddy bogs that held on
to our legs as the midday sun scorched. The guidebook had warned: 'When
fighting stopped, US estimates put quantities of unexploded ordnance at
150,000 tonnes. Only small areas were cleared.'
We did not see the florican and we did not get as close to the cranes as we
might have liked, but the bird-watching was still a treat. We spotted almost
100 species in the wetlands and the few remaining woodlands. Beware, though:
while the Vietnamese like their birds, they also seem to prefer them in
cages or stuffed, or even on the dinner table.
Vietnam's poverty means that its tourist infrastructure is underdeveloped.
Road travel takes time. You need government permission to travel about, and
you have to pay for it. You are meant to travel with a guide, although this
is not always strictly enforced.
But if tourism was not so underdeveloped, it is unlikely we would have found
ourselves at the wedding of a village doctor. Or sipping Russian champagne
with the barefoot tourism minister and his wife. Or crying at Ho Chi Minh's
father's grave, as the keeper told us - tears running down his cheeks - that
Uncle Ho was a good man who was not to blame for wartime atrocities.
Nor, almost certainly, would we have had an audience with a Vietnamese
priest after a Roman Catholic mass in one of the few remaining communist
countries.

Minh City with Thai Airways. Earthwatch Europe is at Belsyre Court, 57

FT  18 JUL 92 / Gardening: Sow your seed in other beds - Artful gardeners
can farm out second crops so that flowers can be at their best in autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EVERY gardener knows about bedding out: hot bedding is another matter. It
does not rely on rows of orange-flowered marigolds or bright fiesta pansies:
it works on that sound hospital principle: pack them in, never leave a bed
sitting empty, move a newcomer into a space as soon as somebody else has
died in it.
Hot bedding is my answer to this extraordinary season. Almost everything is
still three weeks ahead of schedule and by late July there will be very
little to anticipate. I have pink flowers on the schizostylis, whose normal
season is September; blue plumbago is opening its buds and the roses' first
season ended two weeks ago.
The first round of bedding plants are the one touch of normality. The early
dry weather slowed them up and the recent rain has only now set them racing
ahead. Soon, they will need positive reinforcement, best found in plants for
the gaps where early flowers have faded.
Here, hot bedding comes into play. It is time to cut down the campanulas and
verbascums: during this weekend my second round of white tobacco plants and
the admirable white cosmos daisies will drop into place, young enough to
last until late October. If the season is lop-sided, distort it in your
favour.
It is too late to sow fresh annuals for autumn flowering but there are still
some strips and boxes of unsold bedding on display which are worth buying
and untangling. Meanwhile, remember to arrange for your own next summer.
Hot bedding may sound laborious but I recommend the second principle of
modern self-care: farm the problem out; privatise it and let outside
suppliers take up the strain during the peak season.
It rather suits them. All over Britain, villages now have smallholders who
grow petunias and fluffy daisies in varying shades of municipal beastliness
for purchase in early June. When their main crop has sold out, the plastic
tunnels in which they raise all these plants are left sitting idle. There is
usually a six-week gap between the last of the orange tagetes and the start
of the family holiday. Approach a local smallholder with your own choice of
seeds in late May; avoid the wretched dwarf tobacco plants; ask them to sow
what you want to use as secondary bedding and return to pick it up at a
reasonable height in mid-July.
In the past, grand French ladies would farm out their young children to be
reared in the village; nowadays, artful English gardeners can farm out their
second crop of flowering children and bring them back from somebody else's
plastic tunnel in July, expecting them to be at their best in the autumn.
Hot bedders need not confine themselves to annuals. Ambitious gardeners have
even been known to hot-bed their Michaelmas daisies. These plants are
usually dull until their late flowers appear: if you water them well they
can be grown in deep pots until late July and then dropped into gaps in a
border just before flowering. Keepers of large public borders often use the
same trick with late-flowering lilies.
On a small scale, it works wonderfully in town gardens which only need two
or three sunken pots of spotted pink and white speciosum lilies to bring
sudden life to a border of passe paeonies or early camellias. Out goes one
performer, in comes another. The neat trick here is to exploit the defences
of a sunken pot and to grow lime-hating plants in a lime-free potting
compost, sunk into gardens with a more alkaline soil. For a few months these
sunken introductions change the range of your flowers.
The simplest trick of all is to hot-bed bulbs. The godsends here are the
autumn crocus and its tall relation, the colchicum. Both of them should be
ordered now for delivery and planting within the next two or three weeks. I
think that they are invaluable but far too few gardeners exploit them. The
easy blue crocus speciosus is still an extraordinarily cheap plant and it
will fill any gaps at ground level, not least the bare spaces at the front
of a rosebed which is probably developing black spot.
The flowers appear in early September without the leaves: you have to put up
with leaves only during the following spring but you only need a few groups
and you can lose them next year among the other spring-flowering forms. This
autumn crocus grows happily in Mediterranean weather but expatriate
gardeners seem to ignore it and think only of wild cyclamen as the autumn
advances.
As a contrast, I recommend a very few clumps of the white-flowered
colchicum. The white variety is not the cheapest but two or three groups of
five go much further than the less impressive forms. Like the autumn crocus,
the flowers appear naked, in too much of a hurry to remember their green
pyjamas. Perhaps you have a circle of bare earth round a young tree:
colchicums flourish in this space, as you can see in the autumn at Wisley,
where they flower freely in bone-dry soil round established trees. Again,
they love life in the Mediterranean.
This accelerated season is beginning to make gardeners moan, as if the
summer is already over in a month. It is much better to use your wits than
to go on complaining. If a border has peaked too early, move in some new
inmates, hot bed it and have two seasons in one. Gardening is a perpetual
game against a cussed opponent called Nature. If her moves were always kind
and predictable it would soon lose some of its fascination.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Travel: Old descriptions still fit Saigon - Mark Hodson
still finds elegance and vigour in the 'Paris of the East'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the roof terrace of the Rex Hotel in Saigon, you can see the twin
spires of Notre Dame. The red-brick cathedral is almost an identical twin of
its sister in Paris except that it stands in the centre of a huge
roundabout.
Hundreds of bicycles, mopeds and trishaws swarm around it and down Dong Khoi
Street towards the Hotel de Ville, a grand reminder of the city's colonial
past with its ornate, pastel yellow facade and green shutters.
Saigon seems to have changed little in the last 40 years. The elegance and
vigour described in Graham Greene's 1950s novel, The Quiet American, are
still there. Two wars, a US trade embargo and 17 years of failed communism
have left it almost untouched by the horrors of modern city life.
The old descriptions - Paris of the East, Vienna of the Orient - still ring
true: women cycle to work in white hats and elbow-length lace gloves; old
men with slicked-back hair, three-button suits and berets drink gritty
coffee at makeshift pavement cafes.
Young girls wash dishes in the gutters while their mothers sell Russian
vodka and American cigarettes under the shade of old parachutes. Overcrowded
buses, some built in the 1940s and converted to run on charcoal-burning
stoves, clatter down wide boulevards past faded French courtyards.
Ironically, it is the very lack of western investment that has made Saigon
such a delight for tourists fed up with the pollution and filth of many
Asian cities.
In spite of a population of 4m, Saigon does not have Bangkok's fumes or
Manila's street crime. Nor is it piled high with ugly office buildings like
Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur.
When the French film director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, was searching for
locations for The Lover, he wanted to recreate the Saigon of the 1920s. He
could find only one city that still retained the atmosphere of that era -
Saigon itself.
Now, as foreign investors move in, the socialist republic is opening its
doors to a new wave of tourists. For several years, westerners have been
allowed to visit Vietnam only in well-organised parties chaperoned by
heavy-handed guides and translators.
Last November, it was announced that with a 28-day visa they could explore
the country virtually at will. Most who paid the Pounds 40 for a visa passed
through Saigon.
In spite of Hanoi's position as the political capital, Saigon is the
undisputed centre of commerce and tourism. Although the north is cold and
austere, Saigon is colourful, full of enterprise and vitality. Its people
are too busy for dogma, refusing even to call it by its official name, Ho
Chi Minh City.
Outside the Museum of American War Crimes, a man in faded denims peddles
Viet Cong medals and battered Zippo lighters engraved by homesick GIs. Every
few yards along the streets, women have set up tiny stalls selling litre
bottles of petrol siphoned from government cars. Each vehicle is piled high
with passengers. Three to a bicycle is typical; I once spotted a 90cc Honda
groaning under the weight of six people: mum, dad and four children.
There are almost no cars in Saigon except for a row of ancient Renault taxis
painted pastel blue and, it seems, parked permanently outside the Rex. The
Saigonese are charming and exuberant, and they are everywhere: laughing,
shouting, waving, hustling, buying and selling.
Many will invite tourists into their homes to share bowls of pho, the meat
and noodle soup eaten at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Vietnam is said to have hundreds of different dishes, many of which are
served with a French accent. On the streets it is possible to dine on fresh
baguettes filled with chicken pate and vegetables for less than 20p.
All of Vietnam is cheap. Change a US dollar and you walk away with
10,000-12,000 dong, depending on the fluctuating exchange rate. Change
Dollars 100 and you need a small rucksack to carry the notes.
Two hours' drive from Saigon, at Cu Chi, a one-armed war veteran guided me,
for a small fee, along a stretch of the Viet Cong tunnels, an unforgettable
experience but not for the claustrophobic.
Cu Chi can be combined with a trip to the Holy See of the Cao Dai at Tay
Ninh, a magnificently garish church whose pillars are entwined with huge
painted snakes and where men and women enter through different doors and
walk up and down the aisles in opposite directions.
At noon, hundreds of priests in white smocks and black skullcaps file into
the great temple to sing prayers. Visitors can watch from a balcony where a
group of musicians scratch out haunting harmonies on ancient two-string
instruments clenched between their feet.
Caodaism, founded in the 1920s, is a colourful fusion of buddhism,
catholicism and confucianism but its members also worship Victor Hugo,
Shakespeare and Lenin.
At one point, Graham Greene was so enchanted with it that he considered
joining. But then maybe he went back to the Rex, sat on the roof terrace
with a g&amp;t, and had second thoughts.
There are no direct flights from the UK to Saigon. Air France, Thai and
Vietnam Airlines fly from Bangkok where travel agents can arrange a 28-day
visa in about three days. Air France also flies direct from Paris.
The best time to visit is December-April, although spring can be very hot.
Ideally, go during Tet (Chinese New Year) in early February.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Country View: The Ministry hedges its bets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL STOURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of miles of hedges in Britain have been grubbed up in the last 25
years - and what sticks in the gullet of those who deplore their removal is
that much of it was done with the aid of taxpayers' money.
Under the Farm Improvement Scheme, operated by the Ministry of Agriculture
in the 1960s and 1970s, high levels of grant aid were available for this.
Ministry advisers were all for 'rationalisation' of fields. The aim was to
create enclosures big enough to enable fullest use of heavy machinery - in
other words, to permit straight-line driving over long distances.
It always seemed strange to me that hedge removal under the Farm Improvement
Scheme was classified as 'land drainage,' never as hedge removal.
Often, hedge removal did involve an element of land drainage, because many
hedges were associated with open drainage ditches. The removal of a hedge by
bulldozer nearly always entailed destruction of the open ditch. In any case,
if the ditch been left it would have defeated the objective of long,
uninterrupted runs for modern arable machinery.
With ironic timing, in 1969, the Ministry of Agriculture revised its superb
pamphlet, 'Farm and Estate Hedges.' This, now out of print, was directed not
towards the removal of hedges, but towards their establishment and
maintenance. It lists the advantages of hedges: an effective barrier against
livestock; shelter and shade for livestock; shelter to crops; amelioration
of soil erosion; improvement and preservation of the amenities of the
countryside; the encouragement of wild life, and improvement of sporting
value.
The pamphlet also gives the comparative merits of the various varieties of
hedging plants: hawthorn, blackthorn, beech, hornbeam and so on. It
describes - admirably clearly and helpfully - the planting, trimming and
laying of hedges. It commends the practice of allowing promising young
shoots (or tellers) to grow up through the hedge into trees, to give shelter
for livestock.
Now that straw burning - the cause of so much haphazard hedge destruction -
has been brought under control, and conservationists are mindful of the need
to look after our remaining hedges, it would be a fitting moment for the
Ministry of Agriculture to reprint this admirable publication.
Some of the more senior officials may smile wryly to find themselves doing
the opposite of what was required of them not so many years ago. Instead of
processing grants for hedge removal, they are now administering grants for
the planting of new hedges and the reconditioning of existing ones.
It is the Department of the Environment, however, which is now making the
running, turning attention to the protection of existing hedgerows.
By 1990 some 24,238 miles - 10 per cent of hedgerows - had been removed (not
counting losses from building development). Corresponding figures for Wales
show a broadly similar pattern.
Commendably, the Department of the Environment has come up with a
two-pronged approach: a hedgerow notification scheme and, separately
administered and funded, a hedgerow management grant scheme.
The first of these would be administered by local planning authorities,
while the grant scheme would be operated by the government. Those wishing to
remove hedges would be required to notify the local planning authority,
which would consider the application, as required of planners for any
'development.'
Grants are proposed, to encourage landowners and farmers to bring existing
hedgerows into positive management. (Eligible operations would include hedge
laying, a craft requiring great skill; farmworkers competent to lay hedges
are pretty thin on the ground these days.) Regional instruction courses
would be required. And there would certainly be a need for re-publication of
that admirable pamphlet, 'Farm and Estate Hedges.'

FT  18 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Railway run on private lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STROLLING through the Wyre forest any day in summer you can hear a regular,
insistent 'hoot' breezing on the wind through the larch and sycamore trees.
It is not a tawny owl or wood pigeon. In fact, the hoot is more of a 'toot',
a deep-throated whistle from the steam locomotives chugging along the nearby
line of the Severn Valley Railway.
The SVR is Britain's largest privately-owned railway company measured by
turnover and assets. On Tuesday, the UK Government outlined plans to
partially privatise British Rail, but, unlike the SVR, none of the private
train operators would run a complete railway.
As general manager, Michael Draper has run this small company for 16 years.
On his shoulders and those of his colleagues rests the task of balancing a
culture of profit-making with those of preserving a chunk of British history
Draper calls a 'Grade 2 listed business'. It also allows him to judge the
plans for BR. Even for the limited franchising-off of routes, Draper is
deeply sceptical, believing it will erode Britain's rail service.
The 16-mile stretch of track between Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and
Bridgnorth, Shropshire, was axed by Beeching in the 1960s. It was re-opened
in two stages by the SVR and the first train ran in 1970. The company owns
27 steam and six diesel locomotives, 70 carriages and a range of freight
waggons, steam cranes, brake vans and other rolling stock. The track, for
which it owns the freehold, is dotted with six pretty brick stations.
Festooned in hanging flower baskets, the stations display old advertising
hoardings redolent of an era of black- and-white movies and day trips to the
seaside. New Hudson Cycles (Pounds 8.10s. 0d), Park Drive cigarettes (10 for
2d), John Bull - the long service tyre, Quibell's Sheep Dip.
That is all fun for day-trippers but the SVR is a proper transport business,
running regular daily services between the two towns for six months of the
year and weekend operations for 10 months. On Sundays, up to ten timetabled
services, as well as a host of specials, clank through the wooded valley of
the Severn.
The company employs 50 full-time staff and generated a turnover of Pounds
2.4m last year, on which it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 35,000. That is
not a sign that the SVR is heading for the buffers. This was its first loss
for 15 years, reflecting the recession which cut passengers by 16,000 to
198,000. The SVR says this is still the second largest volume among
Britain's 15 or so steam railways after the North Yorkshire Moors.
Of its turnover, about Pounds 1m comes from traffic receipts. Bars make
Pounds 400,000, gift shops Pounds 360,000 and catering Pounds 240,000. A
directors' board of 12, chaired by David Owen, of the Rubery Owen motor
components group, oversees the SVR. A bank overdraft and a bank loan of
Pounds 250,000 - to be paid off next year - help keep the SVR on the rails.
But its main outside funding derives from three share issues in the 1970s
and 1980s, which raised over Pounds 1m. Some 15,000, people hold shares, the
dividend is paid solely in SVR tickets.
When Draper, who once worked for his family's plastics business, lists the
'upsides' of the SVR, this support is first. 'We have several hundred people
physically involved on the railway as volunteers. We are proud to say that
every guard, inspector, driver, fireman and booking-office clerk is an
unpaid volunteer.'
The SVR displays an almost exaggerated ethic of staff motivation in which
the lure is purely the living of childhood fantasies, even if the task of
the day is sweeping carriages.
No-cost labour is a big advantage. The SVR needs it because of the many
disadvantages of the business. One is its seasonal nature. Some 70 per cent
of receipts come in during the summer and Christmas seasons. The close
season is when money is vacuumed out of the business for repair work to
engines, stations and track.
The railway's infrastructure, mostly built in the 1860s, and with some
ancient rolling stock, drains revenue at a rapid rate. 'It devours cash like
a croc devours fish,' says Draper. 'In a year we will spend Pounds 30,000 on
small building work, Pounds 50,000 on materials alone for the permanent way,
Pounds 100,000 on locos and Pounds 70,000 on coaches. There is a mis-match
between what we should charge to cover this and a gut feeling of what we can
charge.' A round-trip ticket is quite expensive, though, at Pounds 8.90.
Draper's instincts are that of a capitalist, tempered by running what is, in
part, a preservation society. 'We do not want to delude ourselves that we do
not need to make a return. I don't want to forget all normal financial
considerations. But if the operation was starved while a lot of money was
paid out to large shareholders there would be a culture clash. The minute
volunteers thought I was taking them for a corporate ride we would have
mayhem. They all identify now with us making a profit but I've also become
subverted by the system. I've become a lover of railways.'
That brings Draper back to the privatising of BR. 'I've believed in private
enterprise all my life,' he says. 'Yet I make a clear distinction between
what perhaps should be the private sector and what should be the public
sector. The management of BR has been improving on a quantum basis. It
already has competition from the airplane and the coach. Private operators
will simply cherry-pick routes. Richard Branson might want the 10am service
from London to Newcastle but he won't want the 12 o'clock or the 2pm. You
will dilute BR and then how can it generate enough energy and resources to
compete with services already competing against it?'

FT  18 JUL 92 / Moscow's racecourse bets on the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HORSE RACING is for poor people,' declared the young Russian businessman.
'What's the point in betting if you can only win roubles? What can you buy
here with roubles? We just came for a laugh.' And off he strode with his
friends, cutting through the crowd of middle-aged men, engrossed in their
race programmes at the Moscow racetrack.
But he had missed the point. Muscovites do not come to the city's only race
track to make money. They attend because betting is about the only thing in
their lives which is inflation-free. And they come because they are
fanatics.
Igor and his friends, all pensioners, spend every Sunday perched high above
the course at the back of the grandstand. On winter evenings they watch by
floodlight as the horses trot around the snow-bound track, their hooves
studded for extra grip. Now the summer trotting season is in full swing, and
flat racing too, which started in June.
Four races gone, and Igor's first vodka bottle already lies empty. 'We come
here to escape. Not just from our wives, but from the reality and hardships
of life in Moscow,' he says, before wandering off to one of the cavernous
halls beneath the grandstand to place a small bet - 'No more than twenty
roubles.'
Instead of bookies, rows of elderly women sit in glass booths tapping each
bet into a system of antiquated computers. Vladimir Butenko, the man in
charge of the house tote, says the current economic crisis has changed very
little. 'Under the Tzars people bet their whole fortune. The psychology of
the gamblers hasn't changed, just their financial ability.'
Most of the regular crowd of some 10,000 became hooked just after the Second
World War, when horse racing enjoyed a brief spring of official tolerance,
not seen since pre-revolutionary days. Stalin's son, Vassily, was a regular
at the luxurious Begat (Races) restaurant attached to the grandstand. His
patronage helped to keep the sport alive. But since then the races, and
particularly the bourgeois compulsion to bet, have been frowned on. The
hippodrome became the only place in the Soviet Union where gambling was
still tolerated, and then only because the state took 25 per cent.
In spite of official disapproval, it is easy to see how Moscow's course has
remained popular. Built in 1835, it is the oldest track in Europe - a calm
oasis in a city of grime and hassle. The classical grandstand, with its
ornate ceilings, has burned down three times and been rebuilt, unaltered,
after every fire. Advertising hoardings, which cover most racecourses like
wallpaper, are nowhere to be seen. On the far side of the three-lane track
more than 1,000 horses live in a small town of meandering, rickety stables.
However, an old-world feel and a dedicated following are no longer enough to
keep the hippodrome alive, even if betting is now politically correct. On a
good day the track may take more than 500,000 roubles, but even so, soaring
inflation means the that cost of straw, salaries and sugar lumps is
beginning to get out of hand. For the last few years the hippodrome has been
surviving on little else but enthusiasm. Trainers, grooms and drivers alike
all receive a meagre state salary of less than 1500 roubles (about Pounds 8)
a month.
But riding to the rescue is a creature that has not been seen in Russia for
almost 75 years, a bourgeois relic from pre-revolutionary days: the private
horse owner.
Timur Oumerov started, or rather restarted, it all. Two years ago he bought
Seriose, a Russian trotter, for 150,000 roubles. Since then he has bought
another two, and next month he is going to the US to pick up a couple more.
It is, he admits, a financial gamble. But then, for one of Russia's first
private businessmen, the risk of being Russia's first private horse-owner is
hardly a novelty. Nor is it simply a question of profit and publicity, for
in spite of a life-long allergy to them, Oumerov is a fanatical horse lover.
He has plenty of schemes to drag Russian racing back to its 19th century
heyday - needless to say, most of them begin with the word 'privatise.'
While the hippodrome management drags its heels with talk of 'preserving the
status quo,' Oumerov is making plans to buy his own stable, his own stud
farm, even a share in the track if the state will let him. He also wants the
hippodrome to set up a hard currency tote, alongside the rouble one, to lure
the sort of people who shun the track in favour of the opulent Casino, which
has taken over Vassily Stalin's favourite restaurant.
Oumerov's hobby is catching on, albeit slowly. His fellow horse-owners might
be pushed to fill an executive box at the moment, but in a country trying to
reinvent the concept of social prestige (without a Communist Party card),
one's own horse is not a bad status symbol.
On the other hand, any nouveau riche businessman thinking he can turn the
hippodrome into a playboy's plaything is on the wrong track. Alla Polsunova
will take care of that - she has already turned down a handful of offers to
buy her stable from people who, she decided, 'loved money more than horses.'
A broad, boisterous woman, adored by all at the racetrack, Alla is one of
the leading experts on trotters in Russia. She is also a champion driver, a
trainer, and vice-president of the new Russian Trotting Association.
Sitting in her stable kitchen, surrounded by her grooms, stableboys and
drivers, she talks about the need to promote Russian racing abroad, to
return to the days when Moscow was considered part of Europe. From the
kitchen, which presently doubles as the Trotting Association's office, she
phones and faxes the praises of Russian horses, and horsemen and women, to
anyone who will listen. One team from her stable has recently competed in
the Netherlands. This month the hippodrome holds an international trotting
competition, sponsored by Oumerov's firm, and (more surprisingly) by a
Ukrainian sugar factory.
At the stables next door to Alla, Anton Taraboyev is planning his move to
the private sector with almost childish enthusiasm. He wants to charge
people to drive round the track in his troika - the old Russian carriage
pulled by three trotters. For Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,140) he will even sell
the carriage. He also wants to set up a small business selling horses' milk,
Koumis, which is a traditional anti-tuberculosis remedy.
In its hurry to erase all traces of the last 70 years, Russia sometimes
appears to be losing its own identity in a flood of Western culture. Among
the MacDonalds, Pizza Huts and Coke, the Moscow hippodrome is a rare example
of a Russian industry looking for salvation in its own history.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Job market blues hinder recovery -
Investing in   ..the United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'GROWTH recession' may sound like a label economists apply to a situation
they cannot understand, but it is the best anyone can think of to describe
the US economy.
A growth recession describes an economy which is growing but not robustly
enough to have a positive impact on the unemployment rate. This is the US
today. The economy is growing, (output climbed 2.7 per cent in the first
quarter and should grow between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent in the second),
but unemployment has also been rising, to an eight-year high in June of 7.8
per cent.
The explanation is simple. Instead of increasing payrolls in response to
improved demand, normal in a recovery, companies have been stabilising
payrolls or, worse, shedding jobs, while getting more production from
remaining employees. Jobs market problems have hindered the recovery
severely, keeping a lid on demand growth.
Against this background, it is not surprising that US stock markets have
been subdued, in price terms at least. Trading volume has been strong,
because of a large influx of individual investors' money, which switched out
of low-yielding short-term instruments and into equities. Investors have
been searching for higher returns since US interest rates fell sharply at
the end of last year.
Stock performance, however, has been disappointing. The Dow Jones industrial
average has gained just 4 per cent since the start of this year and
languishes more than 100 points below its year's high. The broader market
indices have fared even worse, with Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq
composite index both showing net declines for the year so far.
The Dow has done relatively well because it is packed with cyclical stocks.
Companies such as Alcoa, International Paper, General Electric and Du Pont,
the fortunes of which are most closely tied to the economic cycle, are thus
expected to do well during a recovery.
Investors have been buying cyclicals over the past six months in
anticipation of a solid economic recovery. Cyclicals were favoured over big
growth stocks that did so well throughout most of the post-1987 crash bull
market. Companies such as Pepsico, Merck and Coca-Cola, consistently beat
market averages on sales and earnings.
Now it is clear that recovery will be much weaker than expected, cyclicals
are out of favour. Analysts are recommending that investors should refocus
on earnings, meaning growth stocks are back in fashion.
Over the near-term, Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chair of the investment policy
committee at Goldman, Sachs in New York, recommends such growth stocks as
Merck, Pfizer, Gap Stores and General Mills.
Michael Sherman, market strategist at Shearson Lehman, has warmed to capital
goods and big technology stocks, such as IBM, Sun Microsystems and Black &amp;
Decker, while shying away from consumer stocks, especially retailers and
drug/pharmaceutical companies.
Most seem keen on financial stocks, which took a hammering in 1990 and early
last year but which have performed best this year among the main stock
groups. Low interest rates and low inflation favours banks. Well-capitalised
regional banks, which are fast growers and have much tidier balance sheets
than their counterparts among the big trading banks such as Chase Manhattan
and Bank of America, are especially recommended.
Since this is election year, foreign investors should be aware that there is
considerable political risk in the market. A Bush victory was priced into
equities after the Gulf war, and, although some of that discount has since
been given back, there is still room for more losses if the President looks
likely to lose, or loses, in November.
A Clinton victory would not be welcome - he plans increases in spending and
Wall Street is sceptical about how he would tackle the budget deficit. A
large uncertainty factor has now been dissipated with Ross Perot's withdrwal
from the race.
The dollar has been falling steadily this year. Michael Duff, of Lehman
Brothers in London, thinks British investors should focus on the strength of
sterling vis-a-vis the dollar. Lehman will buy American stocks in dollars
and its cheapness in sterling terms means a greater number of stocks can be
purchased. He, like many others, believes that sterling is near its high
against the dollar, which suggests the possibility of a currency gain for
the UK investor.
In international terms, US equities still look expensive. Using the S &amp; P
500 as a guideline, US stocks are trading at 15 times expected 1992
earnings, more than the UK (12.8 times), France (10.3 ) and Hong Kong
(14.1). Only Japan (34.7) and Germany (16) are more expensive. Goldman's
Cohen, however, believes US stocks are about 5 per cent undervalued based on
her own in-house models, and are considerably more undervalued based on 1993
earnings.
For the smaller investor, risk is spread by going into the US market through
a collective fund such as a unit or investment trust. There are a large
number of unit trusts investing in North American stocks, which may also
include some Canadian stocks. Some of the unit trusts which have performed
well include Perpetual's American growth fund, the US smaller company funds
of Schroder, Thornton and Foreign &amp; Colonial, Cannon North American and
Fidelity American. The minimum investment in most of these funds is Pounds
1,000 with initial charges around 5.25 per cent and an annual charge of
approximately 1.5 per cent.
Many US banks now offer accounts which allow investors with a minimum of
Dollars 10,000 to invest in a portfolio of mostly blue-chip US stocks.
Alternatively, high net worth individuals can go through the large American
brokerage houses in London, such as Lehman Brothers, Citibank, or Merrill
Lynch which provide complete portfolio management.
Merrill Lynch estimates that to gain diversification through American mutual
funds (similar to unit trusts) you would need at least Dollars 50,000.
Citibank has a discretionary and advisory service, both for a minimum
investment of Dollars 1m. At Lehman brothers, the minimum account size
ranges from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000 for its managed portfolios.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I PROPOSE to give a member of my family an interest-free loan to enable her
to purchase a flat. Will this have any tax repercussions for either me or
the recipient?
On the bare facts, the practical answer is no. You should write offering her
the loan, repayable on demand, with a copy for her to sign and return to
you. You may wish to consider (or to discuss with your solicitor) the
situation which might arise if you were to die before the loan is repaid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I NOTE in the prospectus for various National Savings products that there is
provision for trust holding. Can I become a holder acting as a trustee for
my wife as beneficiary, and will she be able to receive the income from such
trust holdings up to the personal allowance level without liability for tax?
I do not wish such income to be regarded as mine by the Inland Revenue. My
reasons for wanting to act as trustee is to invest and administer capital on
her behalf to generate income and to minimise tax and administrative
involvement for her. She will have no taxable earnings apart from the
proposed investment income.
We recommend that your wife's investments be held by her in her own name.
The arrangement which you have in mind would be likely to provoke an attack
by the Inland Revenue under section 674a of the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988, under which the income could be deemed to be yours.

<TEXT>
IN ANOTHER dismal week for the market, the level of boardroom buying
remained very subdued.
In December last year we recorded purchases in Leigh Interests by three
directors at around 240p. Since then the shares have performed well,
reaching 328p before slipping back to the current level of 250p. Robert
Merrick, a non-executive director, has now sold 150,000 shares at 261p. He
still retains more than 2.9m. Leigh's final results in June revealed
virtually static profits.
Directors of Securiguard, the business services group, were buying stock in
November 1990 at prices as low as 52p. One of those directors was Terence
Pritchard, who sold 500,000 shares in 1989 at around 287p per share. Having
shown deft timing before, he is now selling 340,000 shares at 150p, together
with his chairman, who sold 60,000 at the same price.
John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, has picked up a further 100,000
shares at 179p. Readers will recall how he paid 183p for 250,000 shares just
prior to the company's close period. Final results announced in June
revealed another year of earnings growth in a difficult property market.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Flawed - but necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW booklet from the Occupational Pensions Board for pension fund trustees
 -Pension Trust Principles - falls far short of being the practical guide
needed if a repeat of the Maxwell affair is to be avoided.
It tells trustees what they should and should not do, but not how to fulfil
their role, particularly when the going gets tough.
It does not give any practical advice on where trustees can seek help and
make complaints other than to consult their legal advisers or go to court.
In dealing with the relationships between employer and trustee, the booklet
can only leave trustees more confused. To start with, it points out that the
employer may be one of the beneficiaries of the scheme (Maxwell certainly
thought he was).
But then it states that while the trustees must consider the interests of
all classes of beneficiary, it does not mean that trustees should consider
the employer's interests when dealing with his obligations.
This is certainly the case with self-investment in the form of loans to the
company or buying and leasing back company occupied property.
It warns trustees that they should not loan money to an employer simply to
prop up an ailing business - easy advice to give but much more difficult for
trustees to apply when it could well mean the company going under and
leaving themselves and their colleagues out of a job.
The booklet serves one useful purpose. It spotlights the complete inadequacy
of operating pension schemes under trust law, especially when conditions are
tough.
Trustees cannot ignore this booklet, in spite of its shortcomings.
The Commons Social Services Select Committee envisages the Occupational
Pensions Board being overall watchdog with sweeping supervisory powers. But
on this showing, the board would need to tighten up considerably before it
could undertake this role.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news company, is expected to
report an increase in pre-tax profits of about 10 per cent to Pounds 187m
for the six months to June 30.
Most interest will focus on the group's two newest financial products. The
second phase of Dealing 2000, the group's automated foreign exchange trading
system, started in April, while last month saw the launch of Globex, its
screen trading system for futures and options.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, reports its
second quarter results on Tuesday. After weeks of focusing on Wellcome and
its share offer, analysts have been dusting off their SB files. Their
estimates for pre-tax profits range from about Pounds 246m to Pounds 258m.
That compares with Pounds 230m for the same period last year.
They will be looking particularly at the rate of growth of Relafen, SB's
arthritis drug, and how Kytril, its anti-nausea medicine is competing with
Glaxo's Zofran. Few signs of growth in the consumer businesses are expected.
John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retailer and newspaper wholesaler, is
expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 23m for the year-ended
April, little changed from the previous year's Pounds 21.5m after Pounds 4m
of exceptional charges.
Wholesaling has held up well but retailing has failed to show concrete
improvement. Problems persist with its Early Learning Centre business in the
US. Further provisions are expected and its sale is likely.
Greycoat, the property developer, is likely to turn in on Thursday a
full-year loss of about Pounds 7m, a big improvement on the previous year's
Pounds 38.5m after Pounds 64m of provisions.
First Technology, the maker of sensors and crash dummies, appears to have
survived a nasty financial mishap. From a loss of Pounds 3m in the previous
year, it is likely to have done better than breakeven for the latest year
when it reports on Thursday.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage gloom grows - C &amp; G's move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of home owners received an unexpected shock yesterday with the
news that Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society,
pushed up its standard mortgage from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent.
In the week when the German Bundesbank raised its discount rate by a 3/4
percentage point to 8.75 per cent, borrowers in the UK waited nervously to
see whether the Bank of England would decide to follow suit.
This has not happened so far, yet the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which prides
itself on having by far the lowest costs of any society, has put up its
mortgage rates.
'Our move is a defensive one, designed to retain existing investors' funds
which are committed to homebuyers,' said Andrew Longhurst, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester chief executive.
'By choice we would always prefer lower mortgage rates but the government is
making us play according to their rules on a playing field which is not
level.'
This is a response to the newly launched National Savings First Option Bond,
which can offer basic rate taxpayers a fixed rate of 7.75 per cent net
(10.34 per cent gross) on their money, if they are prepared to tie it up for
one year.
C&amp;G is raising interest rates on its variable savings account by 0.2 per
cent, apart from on the London Share account, which pays 10.4 per cent gross
on a minimum of Pounds 2,500.
It also launches today a new account designed to compete with National
Savings. The London fixed rate account will pay 7.8 per cent net (10.4 per
cent gross) until 1 October 1993. But the minimum investment of Pounds 2,500
is higher than the Pounds 1,000 for the National Savings bond.
For the time being, the largest societies, Halifax, Nationwide and the
Woolwich, as well as Abbey National, which is now a bank, have said that
they do not plan to put their rates up.
But Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest building society hinted
yesterday that it too might follow C &amp; G. Its variable mortgage rate is
10.75 per cent.
'We have been considering a move ourselves in the light of the very poor
savings results by the building societies, ' said Andrew Boyce, marketing
controller.
'The government has not helped us by its aggressive use of National Savings
to underpin PSBR.'
As the building societies see it, they are being squeezed by the government
on both sides of their business. To finance its budget, the government is
undercutting the building societies in the savings market, while it does not
allow them to raise more than part of their funds in the wholesale money
markets.
So mortage interest rates may have to go up. Halifax is in a strong position
to go on holding them down, at least for a while but some other societies
may start putting up their rates soon.
Those most likely to do so are the societies which, like Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, have already raised quite a lot of money in the wholesale money
markets and so will have to boost their savings inflows by making their
retail savings accounts more attractive.
Along with Alliance &amp; Leicester, these include National &amp; Provincial, and
Bristol &amp; West.
However, Bristol &amp; West said yesterday that it has 'no intention of
following suit' in putting up mortgage rates. Unlike C &amp; G, it did not drop
its mortgage rate in May, when bank base rates were cut and its variable
rate remains at 10.99 per cent.
National &amp; Provincial, with a variable mortgage rate of 10.7 per cent said
it had increased its share of building society savings but if other
societies put up mortgage rates, it too would follow.
John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phiilips and Drew,
expects other building societies to follow C &amp; G's move in due course.
However, he thinks the societies will move on an individual basis. With the
banks' base rate at 10 per cent, a mortgage interest rate of around 11 per
cent is fairly normal by past standards.
Even if mortgage rates do not go up across the board, the drop in mortgage
rates that many borrowers were hoping for, will not be on the cards for
longer than expected.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A bite from the watchdog - John
Authers thinks consumers should give Lautro a pat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WATCHDOG finally bit into pension transfers this week. Lautro, the life
assurance regulator, produced new rules which said members of occupational
pension schemes should under almost no circumstances be encouraged by sales
agents to switch to personal pensions.
This will make no change to the practices of reputable companies. But the
Weekend FT has details of several worrying cases where pension scheme
members appear to have been enticed out of their schemes by
commission-hungry salesmen. For example, retired miners have been lured out
of index-linked pensions.
Lautro admits to 'concern that adequate care was not always being taken by
company representatives in establishing whether or not it was bona fide in
the interests of members of occupational pension schemes to transfer to
personal pension plans'.
It adds that the new rules have been provoked by a sharp rise in public
complaints about the selling tactics used for pension transfers.
However, the field is complex. There are problems with occupational schemes,
which the Maxwell affair revealed, and this is now being used as a 'selling
opportunity' by some salesmen.
Company schemes also offer many benefits which personal pensions cannot.
Lautro insists that these should be pointed out. The advantages of company
pensions which should be pointed out to you, according to Lautro, include:
The guarantees which are often offered;
Pensions for spouses and children;
Options for early retirement, or retirement on grounds of ill health;
Indexation, which is often offered in some form by company schemes;
Ancillary benefits, such as life cover, and;
Leaving service benefits.
Frequently, company pensions do not offer anything like as big a pension as
employees assume but this battery of factors can only make personal pensions
seem less attractive.
Lautro's document goes on to suggest extra additional factors, such as the
financial security of the occupational scheme (a very difficult area for
laymen to assess where improved disclosure rules will be vital), and
'transfer club' facilities, which are often offered to allow easy transfer
between company schemes.
A transfer will also seem less sensible if the employer would not contribute
to a personal pension, or if eligibility for permanent health insurance
(used to cover sick pay) would be affected.
It also requires the initial charges payable on any new personal pension
plan to be considered.
These rules are meant to be applied retrospectively - companies receiving
complaints from those who have transferred out should consider whether the
new guidelines were followed when the original sale was made.
They are also supposed to review all past cases, and contact any people who
appear not to have received adequate advice under the new guidelines.
This offers some hope of compensation for victims of bad advice.
The rules also aim to limit the amount of commission that can be charged to
clients up front.
Life insurance companies typically deduct up to two years premiums to pay
sales costs on long-term insurance contracts.
The new rules will limit commissions on personal pensions to a percentage of
each year's premium - usually four to five percent.
Many companies already have a flat prohibition on any of their sales agents
encouraging clients to opt out of a company pension scheme altogether, which
is encouraging.
But it can only be good news for consumers that companies will now have no
choice in the matter.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Waking up a moribund boardroom - Diary
of a Private Investor / Private companies need watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE, there was a small, sleepy, private company with ten shareholders, most
of whom appeared to have inherited their holdings. The company owned a
well-known product in a growing market, but it seemed that it had failed to
develop it to ensure a profitable future. The company's profits were poor.
No single shareholder had voting control so I decided to see if I could buy
control. I would then inject further funds - and ideas - into the company,
and, transform it, I hoped. I instructed solicitors to make a friendly
approach to shareholders. The solicitors made clear that I was only
interested in acquiring some or all of their shares if I could be sure of
gaining voting control.
Three responded positively. However, it soon became clear that insufficient
shares would be available to gain control, so I turned my attention to other
matters.
I had wanted to be sure of gaining voting control before buying shares
because I had researched the law in England concerning minority
shareholders. Although there are a number of remedies available to
'oppressed minorities,' a trek through the courts would be costly, with no
guarantee of success.
Two attempts by large minority investors to bring about changes in two fully
quoted companies have reminded me of my earlier experience with that private
company.
In an article in the Weekend FT on April 6 last year I described how my wife
and I had invested in Liberty, the fabrics and stores group, because we felt
it had undervalued assets and was a 'quality company selling quality goods
in interesting stores.' We also felt that increasing Japanese investment in
companies with strong brand names might help to make Liberty a takeover
target.
In September last year it was announced that Brian Myerson, who helped bring
about the Japanese bid for Aquascutum, had acquired a shareholding in
Liberty. In February it was announced that Concerto, which represented
Myerson's interests, had requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to
try to give votes to holders of Liberty's non-voting shares, with a
compensatory bonus issue of shares to the holders of the existing voting
shares.
While I agreed with Concerto that Liberty's board needed strengthening - and
I felt its main London store could do with improvements - compared with most
store groups Liberty's performance has been impressive. I felt that
Concerto's proposals were unlikely to meet with success at the egm, even
although it owned 15.03 per cent of the voting shares and 7.60 per cent of
the non-voters. The Liberty family's holding in the company was considerably
larger, and they were unlikely to vote in favour of Concerto's proposals. I
also thought the share price was unlikely, in the short term, to increase
further. I was concerned that, if Concerto decided to sell its shareholding,
the share price would suffer.
My wife, therefore, disposed of Liberty shares in her personal equity plan
on June 15, receiving 666p per share; although for my personal pension
scheme I took a longer-term view and decided to retain its Liberty holding.
Although more than 100 shareholders attended the Liberty egm, I was not one
of them. Concerto's proposals received the backing of only 19.7 per cent of
the voting shares and 24 per cent of the non-voting shares, so I await
further Concerto developments with interest. Liberty shares are now around
613p for the voters and 435p non-voting.
Another company that was recently the subject of circulars from a large
minority shareholder is British &amp; American Film Holdings. I first bought
shares in this in July, 1985, paying 183p per share, because I was impressed
with Sir John Woolf's investment expertise as chairman and managing
director. My faith was rewarded. By August 1990 the shares had reached 610p.
I viewed the company as a long-term investment, and my personal pension
scheme has also bought shares.
When Sir John Woolf first acquired a majority shareholding in British &amp;
American almost 25 years ago, another company acquired a 20 per cent
holding. It disposed of that holding in September 1989 and it was bought by
Allied Entertainments, a successful private company involved in popular and
classical concert promotions and film and television production.
Allied was concerned about British &amp; American's dividend policy and wanted
the company to increase the level of dividend payments. Sir John said his
company had always followed 'a consistent investment and dividend policy,'
and the company's growth in net assets had regularly outperformed both the
FT All-share and investment trust indices. Since Sir John had taken
management control, the net asset value of the shares had increased 44
times. Excluding film rights in productions such as Oliver and The Day of
the Jackal, the company's net asset value at May 8 had reached 903.6p.
This, however, must be rather disappointing to any shareholder wishing to
sell the shares, as recent deals have only been done in the 550p-to-700p
range. It comes back to my old saying: 'A share is only worth what someone
is prepared to pay for it.'
I am happy with British &amp; American's dividend policy, with the company using
a reasonable proportion of its generated cash to increase its investments
and capital growth.
It was clear that Allied was not happy. It was also clear that companies
associated with Sir John Woolf could easily outvote any opposition. I
attended British &amp; American's annual general meeting on June 30 and
supported the management's position in their defeat of Allied's proposals.
But then, I was not 'locked in' to a large minority shareholding which might
prove difficult to sell, as dealings in British &amp; American's shares have,
until recently, always been limited.
Investors seeking 10 per cent, or more, of a small company should always
ask: do I like the company's record and policies? If not, what chances have
I of gaining sufficient support to change them? If the answer to these
questions is negative, it is probably best to find another - perhaps larger
 -company in which to invest.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Experts falter over stock selections /
Review of the FT portfolios one year on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST. Proof positive that the 'experts' do not know it all. This time
last year the Weekend FT started an experiment. Four portfolios, each
holding ten stocks were established. The starting value in every case was
almost Pounds 10,000.
For one, we asked a selection of ten experts to choose ten stocks each, and
bought a portfolio of the ten most popular selections. Against them we
pitted three portfolios to model popular theories of investing - one bought
shares in companies where directors had recently been buyers, one bought
stocks with a high yield (dividend in relation to share price) and one was
selected by throwing darts at the FT share price listings.
A year on (prices are quoted as of Wednesday's close), the experts are in
last place. However, the exercise has also proved that beating the market,
or indeed making a profit at all, is a difficult business - all our
portfolios lost money, and none of them beat the FT-All Share index. The
dartboard portfolio, which almost all neutrals must secretly have wanted to
win, finished third, only losing Pounds 112.70 less than the experts did
over the year.
Bear in mind that prices are quoted mid-price to mid-price and do not
include commission - you would not be able to sell these portfolios for the
current values shown. So if you want to take on the stock market unaided, it
will take a lot of work - simple theories, as this exercise has shown,
cannot be guaranteed to work.
The results repay examination in closer detail:
The Experts' Portfolio
How did it happen? The experts can point a finger of blame at the
non-executive directors of British Petroleum. Their portfolio lost almost
Pounds 400 on BP, one of the bluest of blue chip stocks, and Pounds 95.88 of
this went on the day after the news that Robert Horton, the chairman, had
been ousted in a boardroom coup.
Hindsight also shows why Land Securities, Britain's most powerful property
company, was not the best of buys. The property market has underperformed
over the last year. Similar factors hit the construction company Tarmac,
which has started a disposal programme and in June issued a profits warning.
However, Racal Electronics, which split into two companies during the year
when Vodafone was floated as a separate entity, repaid faith, as did the
unfashionable investment in Associated British Ports. The experts were the
only selectors who managed to find ten stocks which all paid out some income
during the year.
The Directors' Portfolio
This bought shares in any company where it was announced that at least three
directors had themselves bought shares. This is a crude way to assess
directors' activity, and Directus, which produces the Weekend FT's list of
directors' share transactions, suggests that the raw data needs to be
carefully interpreted.
For example, Directus would not have bought Hunterprint, where three
directors bought a small amount between them while a fourth disposed of a
much larger holding, or ADT, where small purchases followed earlier much
larger disposals. But the portfolio still models the idea that directors of
a company should know even more about it than City 'experts', and, as the
figures show, it has come out in first place.
Most of the directors whom the portfolio followed are now sitting on losses,
so the system is far from infallible.
However, it found some good performers in Barry Wehmiller, the packaging and
process machinery manufacturer which reported a Pounds 2.25m pre-tax profit
after a loss in the previous year, Manweb one of the newly privatised breed
of regional electricity distribution companies and MY Holdings, another
packaging company which moved from losses into profit.
The High Yield Portfolio
Here, performance came closest to what the theory might have predicted. High
yielding companies tend to be small, and regarded by marketmakers as risky -
hence the need for a high yield before they will buy. A particularly high
yield can be corrected either by stopping the dividend, or by raising the
share price. So theory would suggest that these stocks will be volatile. If
they survive at all, they will outperform. Otherwise they may take a dive.
This is exactly what happened. There are very few mediocre performances in
this portfolio. Some, like Anglia TV, Bullough, Davis Service, and FKI,
maintained their dividends and saw the share price surge. Others, such as
Lep Group, Ratners and TVS, cut dividends while the share price dropped.
The reasons behind these were well-documented. Ratners, marketing cheap
jewellery, was always going to be jeopardised by a consumer recession, and
the outspoken comments of its chairman did not help. TVS lost the
independent television franchise for south east England in spite of
out-bidding its rivals.
Meanwhile Bullough is the best-performing stock in all four portfolios,
despite announcing a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. The company makes
refrigeration and office products, so was vulnerable to the recession, but
did not do as badly as the City had feared, or interfere with its dividend -
hence the favourable reaction in the share price. Investors throughout the
year regarded it as a strong recovery prospect. Overall, the portfolio
finished second, and did manage to raise the most income.
The Dart Board Portfolio
This was the rag-bag which might have been expected. One constituent, the
Precious Metals investment trust, was wound up during the year, and replaced
by EMAP, which went on to have a good year. TVS, we already know, was not
the greatest of picks.
Two performances of note came from Morgan Crucible, which rose on the back
of increased pre-tax profits (they were up 3 per cent but that was better
than many companies managed) and strong sentiment that their exposure to the
US market would allow them to benefit from the expected American economic
recovery. The share price of Densitron International, the electronics
components group, suffered after it reported a 1991 loss of Pounds 377,000.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHO WILL regulate the regulators? The question of responsibility remains
open after last week's breast-beating about the failure of any regulator to
stop Robert Maxwell from raiding the pension funds of companies under his
control.
Neither Imro, the investment managers' self-regulating organisation, nor the
Securities and Investments Board, the overall supervisory body proved
effective against him.
Last week Imro criticised itself, the SIB criticised Imro, and the
government criticised the SIB. The SIB confirmed that there had been
'inadequacies' in Imro's regulation of the two Maxwell fund management
companies. But its proposals for more experienced regulators and
improvements to IMRO's admission procedures and practices hardly suggest a
strong enough response.
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the SIB's review of Imro showed there
had been grave deficiencies which were of 'serious concern' to the
government. However, he showed no inclination to tackle the inadequacies of
trust law which allowed Maxwell to siphon off pension funds.
Both the government and the SIB have admitted that self-regulation failed.
Significantly, SIB's chairman, Andrew Large, announced a review of the way
the watchdog oversees the four self-regulatory organisations. But Lamont's
description of the Maxwell case as 'wholly exceptional' suggests the
government will not be doing much about it.
However, there are no any easy solutions. For consumers, the issue of
security is paramount but the complexity of the regulatory system, which has
developed piecemeal, leaves many unsure as to which organisation is meant to
be safeguarding their interests.
In its recent report, the Office of Fair Trading said: 'A consumer may
suffer under the ill-founded belief that protection applies equally across
the various products and services he is considering.'
Indeed, the regulations are extremely complex. Although the Financial
Services Act in 1986 was a welcome bill of rights for consumers it does not
cover all investments. Occupational pension schemes are covered instead by
trust law, deposit-based investments fall under the Banking Act of 1987 and
the Building Societies Act of 1986.
So, if you walk into a bank that still retains an independent financial
adviser and are sold a home income plan, your investment will fall under
several different regulators.
'As far as investors are concerned, it is not reasonable to expect them to
be aware of and understand the distinction between investments covered by
the FSA and those which fall outside its remit,' wrote Helena Wiesner,
consultant to the OFT report.
'Indeed as a member of the Board of the Investors Compensation Scheme, I
find that such a distinction is often not clear to us or to our advisers and
extremely expensive legal advice must be taken to establish whether the
investment involved does indeed fall within the remit of the scheme.'
The complexities of the regulatory system are reflected in the compensation
schemes available to consumers should the worst happen.
The Investors Compensation Scheme, which started in 1988 covers FSA-type
investments (for example, personal pensions) and pays out 100 per cent
compensation of the first Pounds 30,000 lost, then 90 per cent of the next
Pounds 20,000 to a maximum of Pounds 48,000. The scheme has an overall limit
in any one year of Pounds 100m, which sounds reassuringly high - until you
hear that more than this was lost through Barlow Clowes alone.
Investors holding insurance policies are better off. They are entitled to 90
per cent of the amount guaranteed under the policy with no limit (unless the
guaranteed amount is judged as 'excessive') thanks to the Policyholders
Protection Act.
The Banking Act limits compensation to 75 per cent of the first Pounds
20,000 deposited. The Building Societies Act is a little more generous,
guaranteeing 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
But as the Maxwell pensioners now know too well, there is no compensation
scheme at all for occupational pensions.
The OFT found it 'inequitable' that the extent to which investors are
compensated should be dependent on the type of investment involved.
In addition, some bodies are less able to compensate victims than others.
Claims against members of Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for
investment advisers, have been so great that it has been pushed to the brink
of bankruptcy.
This situation has precipitated the present merger discussions with Lautro,
the self regulatory organisation for life companies, which has been bailing
Fimbra out.
A merger is in principle a good idea so long as it is structured in a way
that benefits consumers. A reduction in the number of SROs would simplify
the regulatory system and make it less expensive.
The OFT report endorses the recommendations of Sir Kenneth Clucas to set up
a single watchdog to regulate investments offered to private investors. A
body of this type, streamlining the regulatory system and providing
consistency in compensation would certainly be a welcome improvement.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: At a glance - Gartmore cuts Pep charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore this week followed the lead set last month by Fidelity by cutting
the start-up charges on its personal equity plans and introducing charges
payable on exit for those who close their plans within three years. The idea
is to offer cheaper initial investment and encourage long-termism. Initial
charges will drop from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. Withdrawal charges will be
3 per cent plus VAT up to the end of the first complete year, 2 per cent
plus VAT in the second, and 1 per cent plus VAT in the third. After that
there will be no withdrawal charges.

Shareholders of regional electricity companies have until next Friday July
24 to sell their Number 4 certificates if they want to avoid the final call
for payments for the shares, according to the Share Centre. Making the final
call, of 70p per share, is a complicated process which will affect more than
3m shareholders over the next two months. It is not payable until September
15. Meanwhile new Number 5 certificates will be sent to shareholders on
August 18, and they will have until September 4 to avoid paying the call.

Equity &amp; Law has withdrawn its with-profits bond, which has attracted about
Pounds 300m since February 1991. Norwich Union withdrew its bond at the
beginning of the year, having taken Pounds 700m, citing capital strain, and
other offices have since followed suit. Equity &amp; Law said it had already
taken more than its target for the whole of this year, and was 'very keen to
keep a balance between the types of business which we write'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates of one kind or another have come in for a lot of attention
this week, but the trend for Guaranteed Income Bonds seems to be fixed
downwards. However, the graph of GIB best rates, provided by Baronworth,
shows that the actuaries who set the rates sometimes assume that base rates
will rise, and take that into account in the rate they offer - note how
rates rose before the general election. The latest moves suggest the
actuaries are confident that a base rate rise can be avoided.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: At a glance - Fund launch fillip for smaller
companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glasgow Investment Managers this week made a vote of confidence in the
smaller companies sector by launching the Shires Higher-Yielding Smaller
Companies investment trust. It will buy shares in companies with a market
capitalisation between Pounds 25m and Pounds 250m, with a minimum dividend
yield of 120 per cent of the FT-All Share index. Its projected initial gross
yield will be 7 per cent and the trust's managers expect dividends to grow
faster than inflation.
David Williams, managing director of GIM, said: 'We are confident we are at
the bottom of the cycle and the current weakness of the market offers very
real opportunities for growth over the longer term.' The market is certainly
weak at present - the Hoare Govett smaller companies index dropped 1.22 per
cent to 1134.17 over the seven days to Thursday July 16, while the County
NatWest index fell 1.56 per cent to 901 over the same period.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: The predator grows leaner and sleeker - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the more familiar claims made by chief executives of acquisitive
conglomerates is: 'We don't need an acquisition'. On cue this week it was
the turn of Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins as he announced an 18
per cent increase in profits in the year to May and a 15 per cent dividend
rise.
'We don't need an acquisition to outperform,' Hutchings said. 'If we can get
cream on the coffee from an acquisition, then great.'
But as the group, whose interests span Smith &amp; Wesson handguns, bathroom
fittings and mechanical valves, enters its first full year in the FT-SE 100
index - only 11 years after Hutchings started on the acquisition trail - the
claim is increasingly questioned.
The growing urgency stems, ironically, from the fierce pursuit of return on
assets and cash flow which have underpinned the group's success during the
recession. Managers of the operating companies are rewarded on their ability
to meet targets for the return on the capital they control in their
businesses, a strategy that has generated a strong cash flow and profits.
Last year Tomkins' cash balances rose from Pounds 46m to Pounds 110m.
If a business is facing a bad patch and sales volume is falling, managers
are not encouraged to maintain market share but to cut the assets utilised
and return cash to the Tomkins corporate centre.
Not for Tomkins the approach adopted by Williams Holdings, the main rival
conglomerate to emerge in the 1980s, which puts much greater store on
investments which maintain market share and can take longer to pay back.
As a result of these tight return-on-capital criteria, Tomkins has opened
itself to the charge that it is under-investing. Last year Tomkins' capital
expenditure was lower than its depreciation charge, not what one would
expect from a group encouraging organic growth from its businesses.
Hutchings says Tomkins always ensures operating managers have access to
funds if they can justify the investment. 'All our 45 companies would say we
are not under-invested to produce organic growth,' Hutchings says. Once the
recession ends, he says, high operational gearing will fuel rapid organic
growth.
Tomkins has never promised more than 'above average growth'. Nevertheless,
the City has got used to more. Some analysts question whether Tomkins can
continue to out perform the market to the extent it has grown to expect
unless it makes another acquisition.
Not that this is a bad thing. The acquisition of Philips Industries of the
US in 1990 - only the seventh in 11 years - contributed Pounds 50m to
operating profits of Pounds 116.7m last year and was an essential ingredient
of Tomkins' 5 per cent earnings-per-share rise. This acquisition helped
Tomkins shares outperform the market last year by 40 per cent.
However, if an acquisition is in the offing, this alone may provide a cap to
further share price outperformance. Large acquisitions - and Tomkins tends
not to bother with small bolt-ons - means a sizeable rights issue.
As for targets? It will probably be in the UK as Tomkins is approaching the
time when it wil not pay pay enough mainstream tax to offset against advance
corporation tax.
And timing? This year's interim results reporting season, which peaks in
September, could be the last straw for bombed out companies whose hopes for
a second quarter upturn were not justified.
Slashed dividends and profits forecasts may accompany a gloomy season and
lead to a fall in asset prices that Tomkins now says are too expensive.
Hawker Siddeley fell prey to BTR after a dismal interim statement last year;
others may go the same way this year. Tomkins will be among the circling
predators.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: Second-hand share-swap - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEITHER Wellcome Trust nor BZW are turkeys, but for a glorious moment on
Thursday the City wondered if they were offering themselves up for stuffing.
The Trust, which is selling Pounds 3bn-worth of its Wellcome shares, has
decided to invest at least Pounds 500m of the proceeds in an index fund -
one designed to track very closely the performance of the FT-Actuaries
All-Share index. BZW Investment Management will run the fund.
To make setting up the fund smoother, BZW Securities is offering to buy
stakes in companies directly from institutions, at the closing price on the
day the Wellcome offer closes. Many institutions will, in effect, swap
shares they don't want for Wellcome shares they do.
So far, so neat. It was the wider possibilities that made the City sit up.
Many UK stocks are surprisingly illiquid; it is hard to deal in size in the
shares of quite large companies without moving the price against you. The
liquidity of some of the companies at the bottom end of the FT-SE 100 index,
for example, leaves something to be desired. And by the time you've got down
to the 200s, it's quite common to find stocks where the price is easily
swayed by a relatively small buy or sell order.
Hence the Wellcome Trust/BZW offer, which in principle allows institutions
to sell blocks of shares without pushing the price down; and, contrariwise,
allows the Trust to buy without pushing prices up.
On the face of it, that seems a neat meshing of interests. But look at the
possibilities. Suppose you own a chunk of stock in a a company everyone -
including you - is worried about. Normally, you couldn't sell without
driving the price down. Now the Wellcome Trust index fund is offering to buy
 -at next week's closing price. If the shares are indeed illiquid, a little
discreet buying of shares over the next week might push the price up
healthily. When the time comes to sell to the Trust's fund, you'll have
killed two birds with one stone: dumped a line of stock you've been having
nightmares about; and made a nice little profit on it into the bargain.
No wonder the City was leaping about its dealing rooms with excitement on
Thursday, when Wellcome Trust announced its offer. 'Every single
market-maker will be trying to find a way to take advantage of this,' said
one cheerful cynic.
BZW Securities, of course, says it wasn't born yesterday. It has complete
discretion over which stocks it will take and which ones it will refuse; and
it won't stand for any hanky-panky. That may not stop someone trying it on,
however: so the City will be keeping a keen eye out for unexpected moves in
dodgy stocks in the days left before the Wellcome Trust tender closes.
At least, by indicating that someone is interested in holding equities, the
offer helped the market through a difficult patch on Thursday, as everyone
waited for the news on German interest rates.
When the news came, it was not so bad - but it wasn't so good, either. The
rise in Germany's discount rate had no immediate effect on UK interest
rates, and hence no Thursday impact on equities. German market rates have
been well above the discount rate floor, so on the face of it the official
rate was merely moving into line with reality.
The not-so-good aspect of the decision had started to seep through to the
market's consciousness by Friday. In the past, a rise in the German discount
rate has often been the prelude to a more substantial tightening of policy a
month or so later on. On top of that thought came one of those
almost-imperceptible Bank of England moves in the money market - the
reversal of the very slight downward adjustment of interest rates a couple
of weeks ago.
The Bank of England made it clear then that the downward adjustment was
purely technical, and that no desire to ease rates generally should be read
into it. That didn't stop some people interpreting it as a way of testing
the waters for a cut in base rates. Whatever the motivation, the move has
now been reversed. It coincided with the announcement that Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society was raising its mortgage rate by a
quarter-point, because of competition for deposits from National Savings.
These two developments were accompanied by a poor performance in the
Japanese stock market, and a slide in continental bourses. When Wall Street
started falling too, the market's unhappiness came to a head. The FT-SE
index closed on Friday 51.5 points down on the day, at 24.31.9, a 58.9-point
drop on the week.
The economic news in the background was also depressing: the decline in
manufacturing output, which had been slowing down ever since early 1991,
suddenly speeded up again in May, in figures announced on Tuesday. It may
just be a blip - but until the economic statistics make it clear that the
economy is not heading back towards the trough of recession, equity
investors are likely to be jumpy.
Indeed, jumpiness is so pervasive that there are almost no bulls left among
the equity analysts. One of the last fairly bullish people in the City is
Paul Walton, strategist at James Capel, who thinks that the market is now
looking cheap, when you compare the yield on shares with that on government
bonds. In recent years, he says, whenever the ratio between the two has
reached current levels - with bond yields about 1.8 times the dividend on
the All-Share - it has bounced back sharply, through a rise in share prices.
That's what will happen now, he says.
But, it turns out, even he is only fairly bullish: there'll be a rally
taking the FT-SE back towards 2,800, he thinks, and after that the market
will go sideways for quite some time. And that sort of optimism would have
seemed like rank pessimism a year or so ago.

This week we have had to contend with the Democratic convention in New York,
Ross Perot's stunning withdrawal from the US presidential election race, an
unwelcome increase in German interest rates, another set of bad trade
figures, the shock resignation of the chairman of one of the country's
biggest computer groups, a mixed batch of second quarter corporate earnings
announcements . . . and the All-Star baseball game to boot.
It was no surprise, therefore, that the Dow Jones index behaved like a
demented chicken during the week. Up six points on Monday, then up 21, then
down 13, then up 16, then (by noon yesterday) down 35 points. The net result
was slightly lower stock prices and a lot of confused investors.
Taking things one at a time, the Democratic convention did what it was
supposed to do. It presented a (nearly) united party and, as party managers
had hoped, gave Bill Clinton's poll ratings a quick boost. Given Wall
Street's preference for a Bush victory in November, the success of the
Democrats' jamboree left the stocks markets feeling a little unsettled.
At least the departure of Ross Perot provided some cheer. The the 12-point
gain on Thursday was not so much a gleeful celebration of the Texan
billionaire's demise - Perot had his supporters on Wall Street - but more a
reflection of the relief that the presidential race had reverted to a
traditional head-to-head contest and that a large element of uncertainty had
been removed from the domestic political scene.
The market's greatest fear had not been a Perot presidency, but an undecided
election being sent to the House of Representatives for settlement - a
politically confusing and ambiguous outcome that would probably have sent
financial markets in the US and worldwide into a mild panic.
The jump in shares on the Perot news also suggested that the market believed
that the Texan's camp was made up of more discontented Republicans than
unhappy Democrats, deserters who may return, however grudgingly, to the fold
by polling day. The collapse of the independent ticket, therefore, was seen
as a fillip to President Bush's chances of winning re-election on November
3.
Thursday's advance in stock prices would have been bigger had it not been
for the rise in German interest rates. Although the Bundesbank's rate cut
could have been worse - it chose to lower the discount rate, not the more
markets-sensitive Lombard rate - it still spelt trouble for the already
vulnerable US dollar, which is now flirting with record lows against the
German currency.
Some analysts on Wall Street said that the German rate cut meant that the US
Federal Reserve has less room to cut domestic interest rates again. With the
dollar so weak, the Fed may be reluctant to ease monetary policy further for
fear of triggering a fresh depreciation in the dollar's value.
At least a weak dollar makes it easier for US exporters to sell their goods
abroad, and judging by yesterday's news of a wider-than-expected Dollars
7.38bn May trade deficit, they need all the help they can get. The trade
report revealed a 2.5 per cent decline in export sales during May, the third
consecutive monthly fall, a worrying trend for those who had hoped that the
export sector would be a big contributor to the economic recovery this year.
It must be galling to a corporate executive to see his company's share price
jump on the news of his resignation, but that is what happened this week to
Kenneth Olsen, the founder and president of Digital Equipment, the big
computer maker.
Shares in Digital climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 42 3/4 in busy trading
yesterday as investors welcomed the departure of the 66-year-old Olsen, who
had been under pressure from his board to improve performance in the wake of
big losses. Analysts said that with Olsen gone, it would be easier for
Digital to accelerate its cost-cutting programme, including shedding more
jobs from the 112,000 workforce.
Digital's gains stood in contrast to IBM's fortunes yesterday. Like many
other companies reporting second quarter earnings, IBM announced an increase
in profits, but still disappointed investors who had expected better.
Consequently, shares in the country's biggest computer maker fell Dollars 4-
1/4 to Dollars 96, a decline that contributed to the Dow's 35-point loss by
midday yesterday.
Monday       3337.31  +  6.75
Tuesday      3358.39  + 21.08
Wednesday    3345.42  - 12.97

FT  18 JUL 92 / The Long View: Hurdles after the holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO Westminster's politicians have gone off early on their holidays, which
puts the panorama of rising unemployment, sliding production and upwardly-
mobile interest rates into its true political perspective. It is apparently
not very serious.
The Bundesbank council has departed on holiday too, but only after giving
the rest of Europe a fright. It is still not absolutely clear that the UK
will be able to avoid supporting sterling with higher interest rates. The
important point, perhaps, is that rates certainly will not be coming down
for many months, and a really substantial decline may be years off. And if
nominal rates stay unchanged while inflation is falling the real rate will
be going up.
Meanwhile, John Major and Norman Lamont have delivered their end-of-term
sermons on economic policy. There is, they say, no alternative to sweating
it out within the exchange rate mechanism, inflation should be brought down
to zero, interest rates are not all that high really. And by the way, the
economic recovery is about to start - although why business should pick up
in the autumn if it failed to respond to the post-election euphoria in May
is not at all clear.
True, the increasingly troublesome backbench Tory MPs are naive in the
extreme if they believe there is any easy way out. High short-term interest
rates may seem like tough medicine, but on the other hand it is only
membership of the ERM that has made it possible to fund the fiscal deficit
so easily and (relatively) cheaply thus far. In June the monthly public
sector borrowing requirement topped Pounds 4bn, or Pounds 75 per capita;
without the protection of the ERM umbrella the present fiscal policy would
soon prove untenable.
However, there is a dark suspicion that the government is primarily
following a party political agenda. After a couple of grim years the
pressure will slowly be released and there will be two years of accelerating
boom up to the next election. Nigel Lawson's post-election over-eagerness in
1987 and 1988 will certainly not be repeated. Celebrate your victory in the
Labour leadership election, John Smith, but then eat your heart out.
It might indeed look like a good scheme to political strategists at
Conservative Central Office, but there are grave doubts that the government
has any great understanding of what is really going on out there in the
economy. Already its policies have destroyed the wealth of hundreds of
thousands of young home-buyers and small businessmen who were conditioned to
assume that inflationary trends would continue. Just five years ago, for
instance, youngsters were being encouraged to beat a deadline for multiple
mortgage interest tax allowances on shared homes, and will have subsequently
lost a great deal of money because of falls in house prices. Small
entrepreneurs routinely pledged the equity in their homes to obtain bank
finance for their businesses, and many are now ruined.
The government has never apologised for this, and maybe it is all water
under the bridge. But the future is another matter. If John Major is serious
about reducing inflation to zero he should stop making nonsensical claims
about economic recovery and he should warn people to repay their debts and
avoid taking on new mortgage commitments or business obligations in what
could be a very dangerous period ahead. After all, the UK is trapped
vulnerably between beggar-my-neighbour US and beggar-my-partner Germany.
Ahead the hurdles loom, one after another. To begin with, we have the public
spending problem. If the economy undershoots its growth targets by a
percentage point this year and maybe twice as much next year the already
daunting borrowing projections will have to be ratcheted much higher.
In the past, similarly large deficits have only been financed at the cost of
lurches from one crisis to the next. So far it has been easy for the
government to sell gilts. You can argue that it has been at the expense of
the private sector as the big investment institutions have begun to switch
towards gilts and away from equities, with the result that new flotations
have flopped and companies have been discouraged from coming to the market
with rights issues. Again, that kind of crowding out does not make it any
easier to believe in an economic recovery. The building societies, too, are
suffering from the competition for deposits from National Savings, as
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester made clear yesterday.
And although the financing of the public sector deficit has been smooth, it
is already noticeable that the foreigners who were such keen buyers of gilts
last autumn and winter have lost their appetite: fortunately the domestic
buyers have more than compensated during the past few months.
Another hurdle could appear in the shape of a balance of payments
deterioration. Sterling is now a good 20 per cent overvalued in terms of the
dollar, while economic growth rates - and thus export prospects  - are
slowing elsewhere within the European Community. The trade deficit seems to
be on a worsening trend. However, this problem may only become acute if we
have a significant economic recovery, which does not seem very likely.
Then there is the banking system. Could this prove the government's Achilles
heel? Bankers are starting to worry about a renewed dip in the economy, with
serious implications for bad debts and a further wave of bankruptcies. The
last thing that bankers with long lists of tottering clients want is a high
level of interest rates. In these conditions asset prices will drift
further, whereas financiers desperately need some inflation in property and
share values so that security can be realised at good prices and in buoyant
market conditions. Has Norman Lamont thought about this? He should, even on
holiday.

FT  18 JUL 92 / The terrible price of a joke against Islam: Alaa Hamed wrote
a poor novel about Islam that hardly anyone read. Now he lives in the shadow
of the assassin / A report on the other Salman Rudshies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX RODENBECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAA HAMED, a balding, middle-aged tax inspector, seems an unlikely
candidate for persecution. But his hobby - dabbling in fiction - has turned
his shabby Cairo flat into a prison. Anonymous callers threaten him with
death. Outside his flat, a 24-hour armed guard protects him from assassins.
Soon the guards may arrest Hamed: temporarily free on appeal, he faces a
maximum eight-year prison sentence for blasphemy against Islam. His crime:
to have written a fantasy novel that pokes gentle fun at the prophets of
revealed religion.
Hamed is not alone among Moslem writers. The death sentance hanging over
Salman Rushdie has drawn worldwide publicity, but the growing politicisation
of Islam is exposing liberal Moslems to the wrath of their radical
co-religionists. These are a few recent cases:
Pakistani fundamentalists are demanding that 73-year-old Akhtar Mohammed
Khan be beheaded for 'insulting the prophet' in a now banned collection of
nursery rhymes.
In May, Kuwaiti journalist Fouad al Hashem was sentenced to three months in
jail for 'inciting debauchery.' Ridiculing fundamentalist claims, he had
written a column denying that the Iraqi invasion was God's punishment for
Kuwait's sins. If this was so, he demanded sarcastically, why were Londoners
spared heavenly anger even though they openly kissed each other?
In June, religious radicals murdered Dr Farag Foda, Egypt's most outspoken
secularist, whose biting criticism of fundamentalist excesses had led some
clerics to label him an enemy of the state.
Egypt, with its century-old secularist tradition, was long considered a
haven of relative tolerance in the Arab and Islamic worlds. But even before
Islam became a political tool governments found it wise to be seen as
defenders of the faith. Successive rulers have made pacts with the
institutions of Islam - most prominently, in Egypt, with the 1,000-year-old
theological university of Al Azhar. In exchange for Al Azhar's support
against radicals, the state has wielded its power to preserve the
university's rigid interpretation of Islam.
Thus, in 1926, Egyptian courts banned one of the first critical essays into
pre-Islamic Arabia by an Arab author, Dr Taha Hussein. In the 1920s Sheikh
Ali Abdul Razeq, an Azharite scholar, was stripped of his post for arguing
that Islam does not provide a clear-cut model for government. In 1959, Al
Azhar banned a novel for using thinly disguised allegory to fictionalise
various prophets. The author, Naguib Mahfouz, later won the Nobel Prize for
Literature.
Rare though these incidents were, their memory helped restrain historians,
religious scholars and novelists from testing the limits set by Al Azhar.
Now, Egyptian intellectuals feel these limits are shrinking. 'In terms of
freedom of opinion we are going backwards,' says Hamed's lawyer, Niguad al
Boraie. 'In the 1930s or '50s you could mostly say what you wanted, but now
we have ideological terrorism to contend with.
The pressure to adhere to Islamic orthodoxy takes many forms. In Hamed's
case, a spiteful colleague told Al Azhar's Islamic Research Academy, which
is responsible for authenticating Islamic texts, that Hamed's book, A
Distance in a Man's Mind, was blasphemous. A study committee from the
Academy then notified the Public Prosecutor that the book 'committed
aggression against the Holy Koran, claiming that it is man's (not God's)
work, mocking the prophet Mohammed and other Islamic symbols and treating
them contemptuously.'
On the basis of the committee's report police also detained Hamed's
publisher and his distributor. The book - only 89 copies of which were sold
 -was confiscated. Following the trial, which his lawyer denounces as a
travesty, Hamed and his 'accomplices' were sentenced to eight years
imprisonment under Egypt's anti-sedition laws.
Because it was imposed by a special state security court, Hamed's sentence
cannot be implemented without the signature of Egypt's prime minister. This
has not been forthcoming, probably due to adverse publicity abroad about the
case. Still, the writer has spent six months since his trial in agonising
suspense.
Hamed, virtually unknown before his trial, offended the clerics by using
bawdy language to spoof religion. A Distance in a Man's Mind, says one
critic, is a metaphorical book about the future. 'Its basic thrust is that
nothing, including religion, should be free from human inquiry.' But, like
other readers, the critic disparaged Hamed's work on literary grounds. 'The
vehicle is weak and his sarcasm about the prophets seems frivolous.'
While the book was considered blasphemous, other works faced banning orders
for challenging orthodoxy. At the Cairo International Book Fair in January,
raiders from the Islamic Research Academy confiscated five works by Said
Ashmawi, one of Egypt's most prominent judges and Islamic scholars.
Like Sheikh Ali Abdul Razeq some 70 years ago, Ashmawi argued against the
fundamentalist claim that Islam offers a firm base for statehood. In an
unprecedented personal intervention, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
ordered that the books be returned to the fair. Egyptian intellectuals
applauded the move, but saw it is a futile gesture given the government's
policy of appeasing a 'mainstream' Islam that is moving towards radicalism.
This was exemplified by the treatment of the Hamed case, which was viewed by
many of Egypt's increasingly beleaguered secularists as an example of the
government, abetted by Al Azhar, throwing a sacrifice to the fundamentalist
wolves.
To Islamic radicals, Hamed's punishment was not enough - indeed, it was
another sign that the state has failed in its primary duty to defend the
faith. In the outspoken Islamicist press there were calls for Hamed's
execution, in line with the strictest punishment for heresy and in emulation
of Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie. 'The imposition of the
highest penalty is an Islamic duty against any who dares attack the religion
or prophet of God, so as not to leave our beliefs in the hands of deranged
groups that call for apostasy under the cover of creativity,' thundered
Islamic Banner, a religious weekly.
While disturbed by such calls, Hamed and his supporters did not take them
seriously - at least not until last month, when gunmen from the extremist
Islamic Leagues shot Dr Farag Foda, a prominent opponent of political Islam
who testified in Hamed's favour at his trial.
Alarmed by the assassination, Egyptian liberals have begun to see a
dangerous convergence between the 'radical' and 'moderate' Islamicist
trends. As they see it, just as the government has accommodated Al Azhar and
its orthodoxy, the orthodox have begun adopting political ideas from the
radicals.
There are many reasons for this. Because of their political motivation,
Moslem radicals have come to dominate the Islamic press. Questions of
religious identity have given way to impassioned discussion of threats which
radicals claim are challenging the faith. One is the incompleteness, as they
see it, of Islam as practiced - incomplete in that religion has not extended
its sway over the procedures of government in most Moslem countries.
More important, radical publicists have successfully pervayed a vision of an
Islam under siege from its enemies. Accordingly, for example, the tragedy in
Bosnia-Herzogovina is explained as a modern crusade against the Moslems of
what was Yugoslavia. The Kashmir crisis, the Sudanese civil war, the
conflict in Nagorno Karabakh: all are portrayed as pitting Islam against
forces of Christianity, atheism and heathenism.
Islamic institutions, which traditionally avoided meddling in politics, have
found it difficult to resist the role thrust on them by the clamour of the
radicals, particularly when they are backed by the financial muscle of Saudi
Arabia and Iran. Inevitably, this submission has expressed itself in moves
to limit freedom of expression.
Does Islam forbid art or permit it? asks Egyptian Islamicist Mohammed Abdul
Quddous in the rhetorical manner of a traditional Moslem sheikh. 'The
correct answer is that art is a two-bladed weapon,' he answers. 'It can be
in the service of heavenly teaching . . . or it an be a tool of Satan]'
Quddous, son of a well-known writer, is considered relatively mild in his
opinions. The Azharite scholars charged with imposing Islamic censorship
declined to be interviewed, but presumably they agree with him.
In Saudi Arabia, his view is already enshrined in law. According to Middle
East Watch, a New York-based human rights group, the Saudi Law of
Publication No. 17 of 1982 lists 18 subjects which cannot be addressed in
any publication. In Pakistan, a recent law has made insulting the prophet a
capital offence.
Increasingly, it appears, other Moslem countries are adopting the Saudi view
that there is no meeting ground between secularism and Islam. Dr Abdul Qader
Tash, an editor of the Saudi Islamic weekly Al Moslemoon, expressed this
idea bleakly. Rejecting the suggestion of liberal Moslem thinkers such as
Egyptian philosopher Fouad Zakariya and Iraqi writer Shibli al Isami, who
believe that there is no contradiction between humanism and enlightened
Islam, Tash says that Moslems cannot accept western notions that religion
and science, or religion and the state, are opposed.
'Some say that Islam will win in any case, and so there is no need to
confront (its opponents),' Tash writes. 'But we cannot be cowards in this
battle of ideas. The Word is the strongest weapon man has known throughout
his history.'
Moslems who think otherwise feel increasingly isolated. But judge Said
Ashmawi, for one, is not intimidated. As he sees it the Islamicist
programme, if it aims to compete with secular humanism, is doomed to
failure. What is missing from the fundamentalist approach, he says, is the
tool of finding answers through debate. 'We (Moslems) are developing a
materialistic civilisation, but without the method of producing technology,
which is based on the technique of criticism.'
Alaa Hamed's wife, a middle-class Egyptian mother of three, agrees. 'The
reason the west has progressed is that you respect reality, the truth,' she
says. 'Why can't I be a Moslem and benefit from progress? They can't force
you to deny your beliefs. Your beliefs are like your name, like your own
mother.'
In their cramped apartment her husband awaits his fate. 'My only crime,' he
says, 'is that I failed to understand the space of freedom in Egypt. It is
like this.' He draws a small circle with a finger.
But even now Hamed has not lost his sense of humour. A recent poem, roughly
translated, goes like this:
They ordered my thoughts to be captured,
Stuffed them in a sack
And tied it to the back of a donkey.
They opened it in court.
It was empty.
They asked why.
Because the donkey got hungry and ate them.

FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotrack has worst fall since
November 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 2 per cent fall in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index by the London close
yesterday was the worst since November 18 last year, when it dropped 2.3 per
cent after a pronounced drop on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
A higher German discount rate, a weaker dollar and domestic disasters in
Amsterdam and Milan all contributed to the malaise.
FRANKFURT extended Thursday's post bourse declines with a 8.02, or 1.2 per
cent fall to 679.88 in the FAZ index at midsession stretching to a drop of
37.87, or 2.2 per cent to 1,702.66 in the DAX at the close. Falls on the
week were 2.0, and 3.0 per cent respectively.
This was the biggest one-day fall since August 19, 1991, when the then
Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, was briefly ousted in a coup and
German equities fell by 9.3 per cent.
A 'triple-witching' day for the DTB, which saw the expiry of share options,
options on DAX futures and DAX options added to the volatility and
contributed to a late sell-off. Allianz, the insurer, the heaviest share by
far in the DAX index, fell DM66 to DM2,150.
Turnover rose from DM4.1bn to DM6.9bn. Banks were weaker than most, and
dealers said that a sudden weakening in the bund contract in London
yesterday may have contributed to their decline.
AMSTERDAM sold Philips heavily on rumours that its HDTV programme might be
in difficulty following the redeployment of a key executive. The group,
which also announced that another executive involved with CD-I had left, saw
its shares fall to a year's low of Fl 24.00 before recovering to end down Fl
3.20, or 11 per cent at Fl 25.60. The CBS Tendency index closed down 2.8 at
119.0, off 2.4 per cent on the week.
The expiry of July contracts on the options and futures exchange also
contributed to the market's weakness.
Analysts felt that the steep fall in Philips, with many US and UK investors
selling, was overdone. However, there is generally negative feeling about
the group and widespread concern that the European HDTV programme is in
doubt.
MILAN's domestic concerns included the Bank of Italy's discount rate rise
and the arrest of the prominent industrialist, Mr Salvatore Ligresti, in
connection with the Milan corruption probe.
The Comit index closed 8.87 lower at 437.78, down 2 per cent on the day and
1 per cent on the week. Banks were heavily sold, Credito Italiano plunging
L104, or more than 6 per cent to L1,506 and several blue chips, including
Montedison and Olivetti, slid through key resistance levels. In the Ligresti
group, the worst performance came from Autostrada Torino-Milano, down L950,
or 12.5 per cent at L6,650.
PARIS was buffeted by a sharp drop in bond futures and the CAC-40 index fell
49.45 to 1,801.78, 3 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was estimated at
FFr3.1bn.
Weakness in New York contributed to the unease, while Axa's disappointing
public offering there of shares in Equitable Life saw its own shares in
Paris lose FFr34 to FFr771. Other notable losers included banks and
financial services with Suez down FFr17 at FFr255 and Societe Generale off
FFr27 at FFr457.
Radiotechnique, a subsidiary of Philips, was affected by its Dutch parents'
fall, losing FFr24 or 5 per cent to FFr453.
ZURICH saw a late wave of Wall Street-inspired selling, and the SMI index
fell 33.5, or 1.8 per cent to 1,805.2, down 2.7 per cent on the week. Bourse
activity centred on industrials, although a bank share, UBS bearers, topped
the active list. They fell SFr12 to SFr687.
MADRID fell sharply with foreign institutions seen selling heavily. The
general index closed down 5.34 at 223.54, a 5 per cent fall on the week.
Volume was some Pta12.5bn.
Banks were weak with Popular down Pta500 or 4.6 per cent at Pta10,250.

FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 2.6% on new
probe rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS of an investigation by the new securities watchdog commission into
loss compensation and share price manipulation contributed to a 2.6 per cent
fall in the Nikkei average yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei lost 439.59 to 16,548.07, the intra-day low, for a 1.4 per cent
fall on the week. The index opened at the day's high of 16,969.29, but later
fell on index-related selling and arbitrage unwinding.
Volume remained flat at 180m shares. Declines led advances by 794 to 131
with 143 isses unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell
19.44 to 1,271.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 5.84 to
992.17.
Some investors cited money supply figures, announced after the market
closed, as an excuse for the inactivity. Reports of banks' large outstanding
loans to housing loan companies also shook investors.
Housing loan companies were set up in the 1960s to provide individuals with
low rate housing loans.
However, in the late 1980s, many of the housing loan companies increased
exposure to small and medium sized real estate companies through cheap
funding by banks.
Nippon Housing Loan, the sector leader, fell Y20 to Y255, a new low for the
year. Banks and real estate companies were also affected, with Industrial
Bank of Japan falling Y50 to Y1,730 and Mitsubishi Estate down Y16 to Y804.
Daito Trust Construction, which plunged on Thursday on rumours of its
connections with Watakyu Kensetsu, a Tokyo-based real estate developer
missing two payment deadlines, fell a further Y120 to Y3,700. In spite of
denials by Daito, investors continued selling the stock.
Dealers closed their positions on short-term speculative issues ahead of the
weekend. Meiji Milk Products lost Y34 to Y945 and Sumitomo Chemical declined
Y15 to Y436.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 357.52 to 19,093.39 in volume of 7.9m shares.
Roundup
SENIOR markets were fairly subdued in the Pacific Basin yesterday, but there
was life in New Zealand and Thailand. South Korea was closed for a public
holiday.
HONG KONG offered its equivalent of a sideways move after yet another new
record on Thursday, the Hang Seng index breaking a five-day winning streak
as it shed 34.47 to 6,128.06, still 2.5 per cent higher on the week.
Turnover shrank from HKDollars 4.2bn to HKDollars 2.8bn.
SYDNEY fell as Thursday's support for resource stocks waned, industrials
continued to lose ground and a slight fall in the price of bullion bruised
gold shares. The All Ordinaries index lost 9.7 to 1,629.5, 0.9 per cent
lower on the week, in turnover up from ADollars 120m to ADollars 192m.
SINGAPORE recovered from steep falls to close just above a technical support
line, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 11.47 lower at 1,451.14,
down 2.4 per cent on the week, as volume remained thin at an estimated 37m
shares.
NEW ZEALAND closed at its highest level since September, 1990, as recent
falls in domestic interest rates encouraged investors to chase high-yielding
stocks. The NZSE-40 index reached an intraday high of 1,604.08 before
drifting back to close at 1,597.45, up 8.22 on the day and 1.9 per cent on
the week.
BANGKOK traded heavily in property and finance shares, which led the market
higher in strong turnover. The SET index rose 8.33 points or 1.1 per cent to
758.71 in turnover of Bt10.43bn, the biggest business since June 11 when
Anand Panyarachun was appointed interim prime minister.
Bangkok Land was the second most active stock in turnover of Bt713.4m as it
gained Bt4 to Bt151. The company said that it was interested in applying to
build a mass transit system in Bangkok.

FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Perot's sudden departure helps to calm
US nerves - But equities are likely to remain in a narrow range until after
November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ross Perot has really put the cat among the pigeons now. The US stock
markets had only just got used to the idea of a three-horse race for the
presidency, and of the possibility of a maverick Texan billionaire occupying
the White House and pulling the economic strings, when Mr Perot suddenly
pulled out of the race on Thursday.
Mr Perot's withdrawal certainly shocked the markets, although the previous
night's resignation of a senior adviser had hinted heavily at major fissures
within the campaign.
The share price reaction to the news would probably have been greater were
it not for the day's other big story, the rise in German interest rates,
which commanded more of investors' attention given the decline in the dollar
triggered by the Bundesbank's move and the implications it had for global
economic growth.
But the initial reaction of investors to the Perot news revealed the gut
thinking on Wall Street. The Dow jumped more than 15 points after the Texan
pulled out of the race because the markets interpreted the development as
improving Mr Bush's chances of winning re-election.
The thinking was simple: most of the recent polls had showed that Mr Perot
was winning over more Republicans to his cause than Democrats. His
departure, therefore, gives Mr Bush the chance to win back those lost
voters.
The reaction also revealed how concerned markets had been about Mr Perot.
His opposition to the North American Free Trade Treaty between the US,
Canada and Mexico, and his hawkish view of economic relations between the US
and Japan, had deeply unsettled not just US, but world markets (especially
in Mexico) during June, when the world's major bourses all took a tumble.
Now that Mr Perot is gone, trade returns to the back burner (Mr Bill
Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Mr Bush have many policy
differences but trade is not a notable one), and markets have one less
political issue to worry about.
Mr Perot's mere presence in the election race also added to the uncertainty
surrounding the outcome in November, and stock markets like nothing less
than uncertainty. The reversion to a traditional, straight two-party fight
eliminates some, but of course not all, of the political uncertainty.
The downside for the markets of the Perot withdrawal, however, is that
investors will have to take a harder look at Mr Clinton and what he intends
to do with the economy. The bond markets have already passed judgment on the
Democratic contender. Long-term bond rates have remained high partly because
Treasury investors are fearful that a President Clinton would boost
government spending, and with it, the already monstrous federal budget
deficit.
As Mr David Ader, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston,
said on Thursday: 'While the Democrats scream 'Jobs] Jobs] Jobs]' the Street
only hears 'Spend] Spend] Spend]' and backs off.'
The stock markets appear to have taken a similar view of the Democratic
platform. The big institutional investors, the real power in the market
these days, are worried that higher government spending under a President
Clinton would increase the deficit, which would trigger a rise in interest
rates, which would then threaten the vulnerable US economy.
There is little doubt that the best result would be a clear Bush victory.
The problems the president seems to be having, however, and the likelihood
that the economy will not turnaround swiftly enough to sweep him back into
power, means that in the second half of the year political risk in equities
is considerable.
The recent declines in stock prices were seen by analysts as a case of
investors giving back the discount on a Bush triumph that they had taken out
last year in the euphoria following the Gulf war.
That cushion has now gone, so any further signs of weakness in the
president's chances of re-election could lead stock prices into another
negative reaction. Similarly, if Mr Clinton continues his recent advance in
the polls (inspired by the successes of an upbeat New York convention) and
builds up a wide lead on the president by the autumn, the market could give
up even further ground over the coming months.
At least with the Democratic convention now out of the way, the markets can
look forward to the Republican convention in Houston next month, which will
train the spotlight back on Mr Bush and, the markets hope, energise his
supporters across the US and boost his poll standings.
In the meantime, however, and probably for most of the summer, stock prices
are likely to remain cramped by the gathering speed of the election race.
The Dow has moved in an tight trading range between 3,300 and 3,400 for the
last four months, and more of the same is likely to be on the menu for the
next four months, barring any unexpected political earthquakes.

FT  18 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy falls on interest rate worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND THOUGHTS on the implications of the rise in German discount rate,
concentrated by falls in other European bourses and by an increase in
mortage lending rates by Britain's sixth largest building society, sent
share prices plunging in London yesterday. The FT-SE Index fell by 51.5
points to 2,431.9 in the largest daily setback since March 11, the day when
the UK election date was confirmed.
Equities opened calmly, still buttressed by the Bundesbank's decision to
keep Lombard Rate unchanged. But the first check to domestic confidence came
when the Bank of England acted in the London money market to restore the
slight reduction in rates which had surprised the market earlier this month.
A second, and keener, blow came when the chief economist of one of the
largest UK home lenders was reported to have warned that mortgage rates
might rise, even if base rates stayed at the current level of 10 per cent.
Within moments, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society raised its rate
from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent.
With forward sterling rates also signalling upward pressure on UK interest
rates, shares began to fall sharply. Mortgage rates have a more than
symbolic effect in the equity market since the collapse of the domestic
housing market is regarded as a significant restraint on confidence among
domestic investors and on prospects for economic recovery.
For the rest of the session, it was a picture of increasing gloom which took
the Footsie to a loss of 52.5 at the day's low, just before the close.
Weakness in stock index futures and a bearish view on UK economy from Mr
Bill Martin, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, completed the market's day of
woe; Mr Martin said that the UK government's ERM commitment is on 'collison
course with the real economy.'
Trading volume as measured by the Seaq network, was not heavy. The day's
Seaq total of 487.2m shares compared with 525.5m on Thursday when retail
business moved just above the Pounds 1bn mark for only the second time in
the past fortnight.
A fall of 36 Dow points in early trading on Wall Street completed London's
dismay, bringing further losses in US and dollar-orientated stocks.
Interest-related sectors, such as builders and properties suffered heavily.
Retail, or customer, business in equities has drifted lower again this week
as interest rate worries have resurfaced in the stock market.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Producers
suspected over zinc squeeze Producers suspected over zinc squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSPICIONS THAT Zinc producers might be mounting a concerted price support
operation emerged this week as prices of the metal staged a sharp rally in
defiance of the continuing rise in exchange warehouse stocks and the
unpromising short-term economic outlook. As the LME stocks figure grew by
another 875 tonnes to record 336,175 tonnes the cash price reversed an early
decline to Dollars 1,287 a tonne to end the week Dollars 36.50 ahead at
Dollars 1,338.50 a tonne.
The upturn coincided with the ending on Wednesday of the LME's temporary
limitation on the one-day backwardation (cash premium) - which represents
the cost of carrying over short positions falling due for delivery. A
descending ceiling for the one-day premium was imposed at an LME board
meeting on June 25 in an effort to end an options-related technical squeeze
focused on contracts becoming operable in the middle of this week. The
squeeze had driven the backwardation against the three months delivery
position out to Dollars 189 tonne.
The backwardation was gradually eliminated and early last week the market
moved into the normal situation of 'contango' - where forward prices carry a
premium over cash, representing the avoidance of the costs of holding
physical metal: storage, insurance, lost interest on capital employed etc.
But concern has been growing recently about tightness appearing once again
on forward dates, particularly October and November, and this has been
linked by some observers to possible producer activity. 'Producers have
become increasingly prominent in the options market, accounting at times for
up to 40 per cent of turnover,' explained Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr
Kitcat and Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. 'Because of this
activity some believe that concerted producer support operations are behind
the technical squeeze and, therefore, the price rise.'
The LME copper market was also stronger, recouping last week's Pounds 18
setback and moving on the an 18-month high of Pounds 1,359 a tonne for three
months metal. By yesterday's close the price had been trimmed to Pounds
1,338.50 a tonne, but that was still Pounds 30.25 up on the week.
In view of the widespread economic gloom some analysts questioned whether
the copper market's recent strength was justified. But Mr Ted Arnold,
analyst at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that supply and demand were finely
balanced and that demand was widely expected to grow next year.
By comparison the aluminium market was having a quiet week until it was
boosted yesterday by talk of production cuts. The cash price moved up
Dollars 12.50 on the day to Dollars 1,309.50 a tonne, Dollars 11.50 higher
on the week. The talk of output reductions was highlighted by reports that a
Spanish producer had been given government permission to shut down some
capacity and lay off workers and news that the Italian government had put
Efim, a state-owned industrial holding company, into liquidation. The poor
performance of the company's Alumix aluminium unit has been largely
responsible for its losses, traders said.
The LME's weakest market was tin, which suffered a substantial reaction
against the recent sustained rise. As dealers responded to increasingly
bearish technical signals, Chinese and Brazilian selling and a rise in LME
stocks the cash price declined by Dollars 244.50 to Dollars 6,817.50 a
tonne. The long term uptrend was still intact, but support in the Dollars
6,700 to Dollars 6,750-a-tonne band (for three months metal) would have to
hold if things were to remain that way, dealers warned. The three months
price closed yesterday at Dollars 6,855 a tonne.
At the London Bullion Market an uptrend in gold, which lifted the price to a
5-month high, was maintained despite yesterday's news that South Africa's
National Union of Mineworkers had reached agreement with the Chamber of
Mines on a framework for the settlement of 1992 talks on gold mine wages and
employment conditions. The gold price closed in London yesterday at Dollars
358.25 a tonne, up Dollars 5.70 on the day on dollar weakness and Dollars
9.80 ahead on the week.
The recent advance in cocoa prices at the London Futures and Options
Exchange peaked on Monday when the September delivery price rose by Pounds
18 in early dealings to a 2 1/2 -month high of Pounds 632 a tonne.
Speculator and investment fund selling later that day wiped out all but
Pounds 2 of the rise, however, and by the end of the week September cocoa
was down to Pounds 576 a tonne, showing a net loss of Pounds 38 on the week.

FT  18 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL loss of confidence that hit the London market yesterday led to a
sharp retreat in stock index futures, breaking through the 2,480 support
level and leading the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,502, but after a
brief rally September came under pressure as a wave of negative news hit the
market leading to a loss of confidence and pulling the underlying cash
market down.
By 11am, the contract had fallen to 2,475, below the recent support level of
2,480 and trading at a discount to fair value of 18. After a bout of
sideways trading around lunchtime, September continued downward, and the
poor Wall Street opening added to a further bout of selling. The contract
closed at 2,438, down 66 on the previous close and some 13 points below its
estimated fair value premium to cash. Turnover reached 9,589.
In traded options, the day was dominated by the mid-morning expiry of the
July index options. Total volume reached 42,613 lots with the FT-SE 100
option trading a total of 19,922 contracts.

FT  18 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Active return for MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspaper (MGN) shares, suspended last December at 125p
following the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, the chairman and chief executive
and ahead of subsequent revelations of a massive fraud, were requoted
yesterday. The relisting took place amid hints that a stakebuilder had been
quietly picking up stock being offered into the market.
There has been considerable speculation recently that Mirror shares could
well attract the attentions of a predator. On Thursday night there were
rumours that a dawn raid on Mirror shares was being prepared. Mr Tony
O'Reilly, chief executive of Heinz, the US food group, was one of a number
of names mentioned as a potential bidder.
The shares were initially quoted at 50p and gradually edged up to 54p before
easing back late in the session to close at 52 3/4 p. turnover reached 20m
shares. Dealers, on the alert for signs of a stake-building exercise, noted
the appearance of a persistent buyer whenever shares were offered in size.
MFI wanted
Furnishing specialist MFI returned to the market in sparkling form, adding a
premium of 2 to its flotation price at 117p and turning over 37.2m shares,
making it the top-traded stock of the day.
Traders had expected the shares to trade at a slight premium following the
price being pegged back after several recent issues either flopped or were
withdrawn. However, one analyst said: 'While the institutions recognised the
realistic strike price as good value, in the last the three weeks since the
price was set, the rest of the stores sector has been drfiting down towards
its rating.'
But not enough it seemed to prevent some buyers switching out of more
expensive stocks and into MFI. Dixons, off 8 at 191p and Argos, down 9 at
219p, were among the causalties.
Banks weak
Barclays and NatWest were significant underperformers in a weak banking
sector after BZW lowered its earnings estimates for both banks. The forecast
reductions were made because of increases in provisions for bad debts, it
was said.
For Barclays, BZW reduced its current year forecast from Pounds 395m to
Pounds 320m and that for next year from Pounds 975m to Pounds 785m. The
broker shifted its 1992 figure for NatWest from Pounds 500m to Pounds 400m.
Although unsettled by the downgraded profits forecasts the market was
relieved that BZW expected Barclays to maintain the dividend. Barclays
shares settled 12 off at 315p on turnover of 3.7m. NatWest lost 17 to 317p.
The recent slide in Lasmo shares gathered pace yesterday with the shares
dropping 19 more to 125p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 7m, amid stories
that analysts had begun to chop their net asset valuations for the company.
Over the week the shares have dropped 38p and many analysts expect further
weakness, possibly to as low as 100p, a level last seen in 1986a
Lasmo shares have underperformed in an oil sector that has been badly
affected by a combination of a falling dollar and weak oil prices.
A number of analysts were said to have reduced their asset valuations for
Lasmo yesterday from levels of around 160p a share to as low as 130p.
Dealers said there had been two big sellers of Lasmo stock in the market
yesterday. One specialist said there was little or no support for the shares
in the market.
Stores group Marks and Spencer burnished its already well polished City
image with a bullish agm statement indicating that first half profits were
ahead of the same period last year. 'With the well-documented tough retail
trading conditions being experienced at the moment, it is a remarkable
performance,' said one analyst. The shares, ahead 6 at one stage, fell back
to close a penny off at 306p.
The move to lift its basic mortgage rate by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society was seen as only the latest in a series of damaging blows
to a housebuilding sector already on its knees.
Taylor Woodrow dropped 3 more to 63p, Tarmac, despite news of the sale of
Briggs Oil, eased 2 1/2 to 78 1/2 p, Barratt lost 5 to 51p and Costain 5 to
25 1/2 p.
RMC, Europe's largest aggregates group, suffered from a broker downgrade,
closing a further 20 off at 498p.
The falls on Wall Street and weakness in the dollar, caused a retreat in
leading international stocks. Among those to suffer most was BAT, which gave
up 25 to 749p in turnover of 3.1m. Elsewhere, RTZ lost 17 to 542p.
The steep falls in the equity market and their impact on solvency margins
caused considerable unease in the composite insurance area. Sun Alliance
dropped 16 1/2 to 253 1/2 p, General Accident 11 to 404p and Royal 7 to
193p. The sliding dollar prompted a sharp sell off in insurance brokers
where Willis Corroon retreated 12 to 200p and Sedgwick 6 to 172p.
Another bout of serious weakness in BP saw the shares dropping below the
200p mark to close a net 7 1/2 off at 199 1/2 p on good turnover of 7.4m.
The steep decline in the dollar was said to have been instrumental in
triggering the slide, as was a loss of confidence by recent US buyers of the
shares. The market is split over whether the group, which reports second
quarter results on August 6, will cut its dividend and if so, by how much,
Shell lost 8 to 473p on 4.9m. Among other exploration and production stocks
Enterprise was roughly handled, closing a hefty 17 lower at 341p, and Hardy
9 down at 87p, the latter despite a strong recommendation from one of the
leading UK broking firms.
A downgrade in Tate and Lyle left the food manufacturing outfit 16 down at
339p. BZW lopped Pounds 9m to Pounds 226m for the current year.
A bout of profit-taking took the wind out of Northern Food's sails, the
shares crumbling 18 to 603p.
Hoare Govett decided that declining milk volumes would affect Unigate and
moved to an overvalued stance. The stock slipped 9 to 292p.
Property worries returned to haunt Ladbroke as Nomura downgraded the leisure
group. The shares tumbled 12 to 183p in hectic tading of 4.5m.
A glum trading outlook from Thorn EMI left the shares 15 adrift at 769p.
Profit taking and a lack of confidence in the company's UK earnings left
conglomerate Tomkins 22 lighter at 456p.
The news that Ford Motor was to cut UK car production at Halewood cast a
shadow over motor stocks. T&amp;N fell 9 to 148p and GKN 12 to 281p. Lucas
Industries retreated 4 to 115p and BBA eased 9 to 126p. In aerospace, Smiths
Industries was further weakened by a profits downgrading by agency broker
Carr Kitcat and the shares ended down 5 at 273p.
Carlton Communications ended 21 down at 593p after a bond issue.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar closer to all-time low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar dropped nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in heavy trading
yesterday, undermined by fears that the US economy remains weak and that
German monetary tightening has not yet run its course, writes James Blitz.
The dollar's fall to a low of DM1.4570 in the European afternoon was
triggered by poor US trade figures, which showed a May deficit of Dollars
7.2bn when one of around Dollars 6.5bn had been expected. The currency's
decline was also part of a spiral of uncertainty that hit world markets
yesterday as fears grew that the Bundesbank might raise the emergency
Lombard rate in a further attempt to curb the M3 money supply. 'When the
dollar's collapsing, stocks are sliding and gold is in demand, you've got to
wonder if things aren't unravelling,' said Mr Ian Amstad, an economist at
Banker's Trust in London.
The dollar finally closed at DM1.4610, down from a previous close of
DM1.4745. In late American trading it was softer again at DM1.4590. Sterling
also dropped back on fears over German rates, closing at DM2.847 from a
previous close of DM2.855. It only managed to ward off further losses
because of a firming of rates in the sterling money markets, and perhaps a
decision by one of the biggest UK building societies to raise its mortgage
lending rate. By contrast, there was heavy investment in the Swiss franc, a
traditional safe haven at times of difficulty, which closed at SFr0.896
against the D-Mark from a previous close of SFr0.898.
The potential scale of dollar/D-Mark weakness is now the fundamental issue
in the market after a fall of nearly four pfennigs for the dollar in the
last five days. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS
Phillips and Drew in London, says: 'There is potential here for a dollar
crisis.' He believes that if the dollar is allowed to drop through its all
time low of DM1.4450 without any intervention by the US authorities, it
could have a downside as dramatic as the upside was in early 1985. 'If we
get to the all-time low and there is no sign of anyone stopping the decline,
there will be significant dollar losses.'
Dealers will also be looking for signs of German intervention next week,
above all in the Bundesbank's weekly money market operation on Wednesday.
Although the Bundesbank pumped additional liquidity into the market
yesterday to allay fears of another rate rise, dollar holders will not want
to see call money rise any closer to the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent.
Otherwise they will assume that an emergency rate rise is imminent. The
second important indicator will be the M3 money supply figure, the pole star
of German monetary policy.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Fears over Lombard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS experienced one of the most bearish sessions this year on both the
sterling cash and futures markets, with many operators fearing that the
Bundesbank will move the emergency Lombard rate up in the autumn.
Cash rates in the sterling money market firmed to the highest levels that
they have been at since the  1/2 percentage point base rate cut on May 5.
Three-month and 6-month sterling cash were offered at 10 5/16 per cent from
10 1/4 per cent the night before, and 1 year LIBOR ended at 10 1/4 per cent
from 10 3/16 per cent. Sterling futures were also bearish, with the
September contract dropping 23 basis points to close at 89.68. That figure
reflects the view that the next base rate move could be upwards, and that
3-month sterling cash in September will be in the region of 10 1/3 per cent.
The fall was partly triggered by another poor performance from sterling on
the foreign exchanges. It dropped nearly a pfennig to close at DM2.855.
One trader said that he feared the Bundesbank has a 'hidden agenda' to raise
the Lombard rate next month in an attempt to curb the growth in M3 money
supply. Traders are now waiting to see whether the Bundesbank allows call
money to firm towards the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate on Wednesday.
The Bank of England's decision to deal in bands 3 and 4 at the rates of 9
21/32 per cent and 9 19/32 per cent - which applied prior to its decision to
shave rates on July 3 - had no impact omn cash rates. The fact that the Bank
was again dealing in the longer-dated bands might have been expected to
soften cash rates from the highs that they had attained over the last week,
but failed to do so. 'The Bank has lost the initiative for the moment,' said
one trader.
The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn, dealt in Bands 1 and 2 at the
established rate of 9 7/8 per cent and bought repurchase agreement at 9
15/16 per cent. The Bank purchased Pounds 15m in Band 3, Pounds 8m in Band
4, and Pounds 200m in a repo repayable on 6 and 7 August. Later, it
purchased Pounds 80m in Band 1, Pounds 162m in Band 3, Pounds 4m of Band 4
Local Authority bills, Pounds 132m in Band 4, and Pounds 39m in the repo. In
the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 629m in Band 1, Pounds 220m in Band 2,
Pounds 84m in Band 3 and Pounds 21m in Band 4. Late assistance was Pounds
140m.

<TEXT>
SANYO Electric, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported an 82.5
per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y3.34bn (Dollars 267m) in
the half year to May.
Sanyo blamed the sharp drop in its financial performance on weak economic
conditions as well as on increased operating costs, rising research and
development expenses and an increase in depreciation charges following a
period of high capital investment.
Consolidated sales fell by 1.7 per cent to Y737.9bn. Domestic fell by 0.2
per cent to Y448.7bn, while overseas were off by 4 per cent to Y289.2bn.
Domestic sales of telephones and colour televisions rose, but those of
camcorders, microwave ovens, refrigerators and vending machines declined.
Sales of notebook computers in the US fell, while video recorder and
camcorder sales in Europe were down.
Net after-tax profits fell by 93.2 per cent to Y452m, amounting to 0.1 per
cent of sales.
Sanyo has said it would reduce its 30,000 workforce by 2,000 people in the
next three years through attrition.
On a parent company basis, Sanyo's performance was even more difficult.
Sales dropped by 3.9 per cent to Y546.9bn, while the company lost Y6.1bn at
the operating level, compared with a profit of similar magnitude last year.
In spite of Sanyo's declining profitability, the company's balance sheet
remained relatively strong. Net borrowing increased from Y185.2bn to
Y239.3bn, or 32.6 per cent of equity. However, the unrealised profits from
Sanyo's portfolio of securities declined from Y314bn to Y172bn.

FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: Philips's shares fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS yesterday saw its share price fall sharply for the second time in
two months, as concern spread among investors that two of the Dutch
electronics group's business products might be facing difficulties.
The shares lost 11 per cent to Fl 25.60 on news of the departure of Mr
Gaston Bastiaens, director of the consumer electronics division to join
Apple Computer of the US and the move of Mr Peter Groenenboom, who had been
an influential figure in Philips's high definition TV programme, to an
advisory position within the group.
Mr Bastiaens has led the business in compact disk interactive (CD-I), a new
medium which combines video, text, data and sound and which Philips hopes
will be its next consumer electronics hit product.
Mr Groenenboom's move to a job not directly related to the TV business
follows a decision by Philips to split its TV division into conventional TV
products and advanced TV products, such as HDTV and digital television.
The market interpreted the changes as a sign that all was not well with
Philips's business in CD-I and HDTV.
Investors reacted nervously to the departure this month of Mr Jacques
Caumartin from Thomson CSF, the French industrial group, and his comment
that the European HDTV programme, based on satellite transmission, was
flawed since most European TV viewers receive terrestrial broadcasts.
Mr Caumartin was formerly general manager of business development at Thomson
SA and senior vice-president of the professional broadcasting systems
division. As such he was involved in the HDTV programme, but Thomson
Consumer Electronics said: 'Mr Caumartin does not speak for Thomson Consumer
Electronics, especially after he has left the group. As far as Europe is
concerned we have developed the entire chain for HDTV.'
The combination of events triggered nervousness because success or failure
in these products could mean for Philips the difference between recovering
its stature as a leader in the industry and falling further into the
doldrums.
Philips said its strategies would not be affected by these announcements.

FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO to negotiate interim rescue
package for Ercros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE, DAVID OWEN and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALI Rashaid al-Bader, president of the London-based Kuwait Investment
Office (KIO), will travel to Spain next week to negotiate an interim rescue
package for Ercros, the troubled chemicals group in which the KIO has a
controlling 39 per cent stake.
The package, which is designed to give Ercros a 90-day breathing space while
a comprehensive restructuring is worked out, is likely to include
participation from the KIO, the company's lenders and the Spanish
government.
Talks between the three parties are understood to be well-advanced with
officials indicating that progress has been 'very positive'.
KIO is understood to be willing to provide approximately half of the support
needed in a package which would include rescheduling some loan payments by
Ercros's creditor banks and a degree of Spanish government support.
Analysts estimate that assistance of between Dollars 60m and Dollars 80m
would be needed to keep the company ticking over for the desired three
months.
Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, and his aides, have all hinted
in the last two days that KIO has agreed to help Ercros.
While the government is trying to portray this as a change of opinion by
KIO, agreement on shared financing of a package would be a reversal of the
government's refusal to make funds over to Ercros.
It remains unclear where Madrid, which has said it cannot legally subsidise
Ercros, will find the money to match the offer KIO seems likely to make.
It does have emergency industrial funds available and Ercros's main creditor
is the state-controlled Banco Exterior, which might be persuaded by the
government to relax pressure on the group for immediate repayment of its
loans.
KIO's participation in an interim rescue package would help to allay growing
concern in Spain about the strength of its commitment to its Spanish
investment portfolio, which has been valued at between Dollars 2.9bn and
Dollars 4.4bn.
KIO is the largest foreign investor in Spain but has run into a political
storm since Ercros, which has debts of Dollars 2.15bn, filed for protection
from its creditors earlier this month after KIO refused to rescue it.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MGN shares dive as trading resumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARES of Mirror Group Newspapers slumped to 50p yesterday when trading
resumed after a seven-month suspension with no sign of 'dawn raids' by
potential future owners.
When the shares were suspended in December, just before the start of the
revelations of the serious losses that both the newspaper group and its
pension funds had suffered, the price had crept back to 125p - the flotation
price.
Trading volumes in the shares were low yesterday with most shareholders
deciding to hold on in the hope of better things in future.
The price moved up to 54p before slipping back to 52 3/4 p at the close.
With most of the financial uncertainties about the popular newspaper group
out in the open the main block on the share price, at least in the short
term, could be that 54 per cent of the company is effectively controlled by
the banks.
Neither the banks nor the administrator, Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen,
have given any clear indication on when they plan to sell.
The low share price is a further indication that the banks may have to wait
to get their money back and that a sale is more likely next year than this.
Mr Talbot is administrator to the private Maxwell companies that held a
majority stake in MGN, whose major titles include the Daily Mirror, the
Sunday Mirror, The People, the Scottish Daily Record and the Sunday Mail.
The Maxwell shares are pledged as collateral for bank loans.
MGN had pre-tax profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 50.9m last year.
The company is likely to be markedly more profitable in two years after a
Pounds 70m investment in its Scottish printing operations is complete.
New colour presses are already stored in Glasgow but Mr Robert Maxwell
refused to authorise the money needed to install them.
Mr Vic Horwood, chief executive of MGN, said on Thursday that the plans for
the modernisation would have to be reviewed. Because of the delays he did
not expect the new plant to come on stream until June 1994.
At the moment the Sunday Mail is turning away advertising because the
existing presses can only print 48-page papers.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, has made it clear he will stay on as
chairman as long as he is wanted, although additional non-executive
directors are expected to be appointed.

DESPITE more difficult trading conditions, pre-tax losses at the British
Bloodstock Agency were reduced from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds 55,000 for the
year ended March 31 1992, after a small trading profit was made in the
second half.
The pre-tax result however, was after including an exceptional property
profit of Pounds 353,000 arising mainly from the sale of the Thormanby Stud.
Also there was a Pounds 213,000 charge for further writing down the value of
the stallion shares and increasing the provision for doubtful debts.
Mr Michael Wates, chairman, said there were some positive signs that the
industry may be approaching better times. He cited the reduction in betting
tax which had allowed the Horserace Betting Levy Board to budget for an
increase in prize money - the most important single factor needed to
encourage owners back into racing.
Mr Wates will be retiring after the annual meeting and will be succeeded by
Mr Christo Philipson. At the same time, Mr Johnnie Lewis will become
vice-chairman.
Turnover for the year dipped from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 5.13m, while losses
per share came at 3p (10.4p).

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Bank unveils second stage of its
integration plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG BANK yesterday disclosed the second stage of plans to integrate its
operations with those of Midland Bank following last month's takeover.
Mr Stephen Green, an assistant general manager at Hongkong Bank, is to head
a combined group treasury from August 1.
The treasury operations of the two banks are to be reorganised in London,
New York and Tokyo, and the dealing operations of the two banks will be
merged, including the capital market activities of Midland and the fixed
income business of its subsidiary Greenwell Montagu.
Over the last five years Mr Green has helped build up the group's treasury
virtually from scratch. Mr Guy Heald, 47, one of a team of treasurers
recruited by Mr Green from Chemical Bank in January 1989, is to become
number two in the combined treasury operation with responsibility for global
markets.
Mr Heald currently heads Hongkong Bank's European and Middle East treasury
operations, where he is regarded as the driving force in the group treasury.
Mr David Clark, who currently runs Midland's treasury, will become Treasurer
for Europe. Hongkong Bank hopes that the new group will be able to expand
its share of treasury products in mainland European markets by marketing
more European corporate products out of London.
Other treasury operations in South East Asia will be run by Mr Chris Pavlou.
47, who has been with Hongkong Bank since 1987 when he joined from Barclays
and currently handles its treasury operations in Hongkong.
The combined treasuries of Hongkong and Midland Banks and James Capel,
Hongkong Bank's stockbroking arm, employ around 1000 people including 505
dealers.
The merger is not expected to lead to any job losses.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henlys forecasts significantly reduced
losses after cost cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS Group, the motor trading, coach and bus conglomerate facing a Pounds
26.5m hostile bid from rival T Cowie, promised shareholders a maintained 1p
interim dividend in its defence document yesterday.
It forecast a first half pre-tax loss of not more than Pounds 900,000,
compared to a deficit of Pounds 3.6m in the first half of 1991 when the
interim dividend was cut from 3p.
Henlys told shareholders to reject the bid, saying that its new management
team had a strategy to turn round the group's problematic bus and coach
manufacturing business, while the rest of the business was performing well.
It had already cut costs which would save Pounds 2.5m in a full year and had
identified more savings of a similar size, which should be achieved by early
1993.
Cowie said it thought the defence was 'weak' and it would write to Henlys'
shareholders again early next week.
Cowie's offer is of one new share for every two Henlys shares, and there is
no cash alternative. Cowie's shares closed at 140p, making the offer worth
70p a share, and Henlys ended 1p above the offer value at 71p. One analyst
said 'the offer on the table just is not good enough'.
Henlys also went on the attack saying that Cowie lacked experience in bus
and coach building and had not succeeded with its own bus and coach
distribution subsidiary.
It said that Cowie's balance sheet was heavily geared, and suggested that
the offer was a way of strengthening Cowie's balance sheet by buying Henlys'
assets at a discount to book value.
Henlys said Cowie's profits growth was dependent on falling interest rates;
it questioned whether Cowie's share price was sustainable. It said the Cowie
pension fund had sold 1m Cowie shares in the past three months which it said
was 'hardly a vote of confidence'.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: M and S promises a better first-half
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RICHARD Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, promised shareholders
an improved first half performance in spite of low consumer confidence and a
'very difficult' past three months.
Speaking yesterday at a packed annual meeting, he said the company had
maintained growth through the most severe recession since the war and would
be able to take advantage of the recovery the moment it arrived - even
though, he suggested, this would still take some time.
He vowed that Marks would sharpen prices but would not be sucked into a
discount war. 'The vast majority of selling prices this autumn will be the
same as and, in many cases, lower than last year,' he said.
Sir Richard sadly conceded that the company's range of dresses was indeed
below par this year and that one of its stores was 'abysmal' but he
vigorously defended the decision not to open on Sundays.
'We will not be party to breaking the law of the land,' he said, although
adding it would not be in the company's commercial interest to open anyway.
Sir Richard also deplored the growing threat of violence. The company had
prosecuted 15,000 people for theft last year and had increased its security
budget from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m.
Much of this money was spent on security guards. 'They're six foot four
ex-marines. I can tell you I wouldn't take them on,' he said.
But he nearly found an alternative use for them after one shareholder
provoked his ire.
Losing patience after a string of highly critical questions, Sir Richard
threatened to throw the persistent shareholder out of the meeting. But he
sharply desisted  .. just as a burly security guard strode into view.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Property and land writedowns wipe out Goode
Durrant profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODE DURRANT, the mini-conglomerate involved in vehicle hire, motor
distribution and housebuilding, has wiped out its pre-tax profits by heavily
writing down the value of the group's property assets and land bank.
Exceptional provisions of Pounds 6.27m helped produce a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 2.98m for the year to April 30, against a profit of Pounds 5.2m last
time. Turnover fell from Pounds 241.2m to Pounds 178.16m.
Mr Derek Kingsbury, who became group chairman in June, said the board had
decided before he joined that it would be imprudent to carry any asset,
particularly property assets, at other than the most conservative valuation
 -what price they could fetch in the current market.
The land bank belonging to the group's housebuilder Rawlings had been
reduced in value to Pounds 6.4m after an exceptional provision of Pounds
3.81m. The group's fixed property assets were written down from Pounds 15.6m
to Pounds 10.6m. Of this amount, Pounds 2.46m was shown as an exceptional
item, and Pounds 2.54m treated as movement in reserves.
Mr Kingsbury said the group did not have to take such a cautious view
because its surveyor, Jones Lang Wootton, had written to say it did not
believe there had been any permanent diminution in the value of the group's
property since it valued the portfolio in April, 1990, increasing its value
by Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 15.6m.
He added: 'We believe the market for property - particularly in the
south-east - has changed permanently since the late eighties. We are ahead
of other companies in this, but believe they will have to follow.'
The final dividend was held at 3.25p, giving a maintained total of 5.4p. Mr
Kingsbury said the writedown in assets did not affect the group's strong
cashflow of Pounds 19.7m, which was seven times the dividend payment.
He said the profit figure before tax and exceptionals of Pounds 5.14m
(Pounds 7.37m) was very commendable, given the market conditions facing
group companies.
A reorganisation at Northgate, the group's vehicle hire subsidiary, tripled
operating profits from Pounds 748,000 to Pounds 2.52m.
Equipment hire had a mixed year, with the success of Tam, the cabin and
portable accommodation hire business, being more than offset by a very poor
year for Ravenstock, which hires containers to the commercial and industrial
market. Operating profits dropped from Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 300,000.
Laidlaw, the group's motor distributor, saw profits drop from Pounds 1.96m
to Pounds 1.31m, a performance which Mr Kingsbury said compared favourably
with that of many other distributors.
Rawlings saw profits fall from Pounds 862,000 to Pounds 362,000. Economic
conditions further depressed house sales, selling prices and profit margins
during the year.
The shares closed 2p lower at 73p.
Winnedael, the family company of the South African Nash family, said it was
disappointed in the results.  It holds a 25 per cent stake in Goode Durrant
and has been a long-standing critic of its performance. Mr Graham Perrins, a
Winnedael director, said he was worried by the prospects for Ravenstock,
which was dependent on the construction market. However, he did not wish to
comment further until he had met the group's chief executive and new
chairman.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: European lifeline for MMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL MUTUAL Insurance, the stricken insurer owned by UK local
authorities, has reached agreement in principle to transfer its business to
a group of European mutual companies headed by France's Groupe Mutuelle des
Fonctionnaires.
No details of the financing have been made available, but MMI's net assets
had declined to only Pounds 4.9m at the end of last year, compared with
Pounds 287.9m at the end of 1990.
MMI, the ninth biggest insurer in the UK which underwrote premium income of
Pounds 784.9m in 1991, expanded aggressively in the late 1980s but has been
overwhelmed by heavy losses.
Underwriting losses at its two operating subsidiaries, Municipal General and
Muncipal Mutual, amounted to Pounds 225.6m in 1991.
Municipal Mutual, which insures over 80 per cent of UK local authorities,
was forced to increase its reserves for future claims on employers'
liability and public liability policies.
Mr Brian Wright, the former group executive director of Sun Alliance, and
UBS Phillips and Drew have been helping MMI find a buyer since early May.
A number of UK companies, including Sun Alliance and Eagle Star, examined
the company's books but opted to take their interest no further.
GMF is among France's ten largest general insurers and also has extensive
interests in retail, communications, vineyards, travel and tourism. Its
premium income amounted to Fr9.8bn.
It is part of the Eurosafe group of European public service insurers, which
also includes HUK Coburg of Germany and SMAP of Belgium.

Shares in MFI Furniture Group ended their first day's dealings at 117p, a
premium of 2p to the issue price.
The flotation, which valued the company at Pounds 669m, saw applications for
only 44 per cent of its public offer, which comprised 137m shares. However,
another 410m shares were placed.
Mr David Barclay, of County NatWest, the bank sponsoring the issue, said the
lack of retail interest in flotations at present meant that issues were
effectively placings with aclawback facility for non-institutional
investors. The Stock Exchange insists that at least 25 per cent of the
shares sold in a flotation above a certain size be offered to the public.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac to get Pounds 60m on sale of Briggs
Oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, the UK construction and building materials group, yesterday
announced the sale for Pounds 70m of Briggs Oil, its bitumen producing oil
refinery business, of which it will receive Pounds 60m.
The deal marks the latest in a series of disposals by troubled British
construction companies, seeking to reduce large borrowings raised to finance
the purchase of housing and commercial property development land during the
late 1980s.
Briggs is to be bought by AB Nynas Petroleum, based in Sweden. Tarmac will
receive about Pounds 60m after payments to Shell which operates a refinery
at Eastham, in a joint venture with Briggs.
The sale follows the disposal last month for Dollars 42.5m (Pounds 22.9m) of
Tarmac's Californian contracting and aggregate operations to Granite
Construction of the US.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, wants to raise Pounds
200m-Pounds 250m from sales of non-core businesses. He said yesterday the
group had raised almost Pounds 100m from sales since he took over earlier
this year.
At the end of last year Tarmac had net borrowings of Pounds 456.9m,
representing gearing of 51 per cent - Mr Simms wants to reduce this to 25
per cent. The group cut its final dividend from 8.25p to 2.5p last year
after profits collapsed from Pounds 190.7m to Pounds 21m.
Tarmac last month also put up for sale its UK waste disposal business,
Econowaste, which it expects to fetch Pounds 80m- Pounds 100m.
Waste Management International, which was floated on the London stock market
in April and is 80 per cent owned by Waste Management of Chicago, is one of
several groups interested in purchasing Econowaste.
In joint venture with Wessex Water of the UK it paid Pounds 105m to acquire
the waste management business of George Wimpey, another recession-hit
British construction company which has raised more than Pounds 300m during
the past 12 months from disposals.
Costain, the UK construction, property and mining group, las month announced
plans to float off part of its profitable Australian coal mining subsidiary
in a bid to raise cash to reduce borrowings.

FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cray rights to finance Dowty information
technology deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAY Electronics, the Berkshire-based high technology group, yesterday
confirmed that it had conditionally agreed to buy most of Dowty's
information technology interests, Dowty IT, for a total of Pounds 50m.
To finance the purchase it intended to raise Pounds 39m net of expenses via
a one-for-two rights issue of 67.4m new shares at 61p each. Cray also
announced a 36 per cent growth in profits and a return to dividend for the
year ended April 30 1992.
Cray said that Pounds 40m would be paid in cash together with a deferred
Pounds 10m which, at its own discretion, it would pay in cash or as a medium
term loan note.
As well as increasing its profits in 1991-92, Cray halved gearing to 71 per
cent - it had stood at over 200 per cent in earlier years.
Turnover came to Pounds 84.8m, and was well down on the previous Pounds
107.3m because of disposals, but pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 4.79m,
against Pounds 3.51m. Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 3.2p (2.5p) and
the dividend is the forecast 0.5p - the first payment since 1988.
Sir Peter Michael, chairman, said following receipt of the Pounds 20m
proceeds on the sale of Malvern Instruments, the group would be in a net
cash position.
Cray currently had divisions specialising in software, telecommunications
and instrumentation. Its trading performance had steadily improved since Sir
Peter and his team took over in 1990 to manage what had become a sprawling,
badly co-ordinated group.
Cray's intention was to merge its own communications arm, Craycom, with
Dowty IT, to form a communications company with Pounds 180m in annual sales
and a modern product line.
Cray Communications, the new company, would represent 90 per cent of the
Cray Group. The intention was to retain the instrumentation companies for
the time being.
The deal excludes Cognito, a loss making public messaging services which
went into operation last year and which TI is now closing down.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: All the ingredients for a very lethal economic
cocktail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON MCILROY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Major, in his wisdom, has said that he would like the British public
to spend, not save, now that inflation is at present around 4 per cent.
Where is the incentive? High interest rates encourage saving and if we all
know that in a year's time any goods we may wish to buy will only be 4 per
cent more expensive, why bring forward purchases?
The high pound is devastating our competitiveness in export markets. Watch
the record keepers issuing ever worse balance of payments figures and watch
further sectors of the economy disappear as a result of these economic
policies. Throw in a massive public sector borrowing requirement (at high
interest rates) to pay for the transfer payments within the economy and you
have a very lethal cocktail.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: There must be no secrets in household of believers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From The REV'D NICHOLAS RICHARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read the article about the Church Commissioners
('Unholy Saga of the Church's missing millions', July 11). The Anglican
Church has been lulled into a sense of unreal expectations: every year, we
clergy are given a massive pay rise, but suddenly all hell is being let
loose in the Diocese with panic-stricken requests for every parish to
increase its giving.
I am quite happy that congregations should be asked to give more cash, but I
am very unhappy about the mis-match in information between the Church
Commissioners' annual reports and publicity leaflets and the article which
you published. Who is telling the truth? The commissioners seem to be
telling parishes that the fall in income is wholly due to the recession, in
the way which it has affected property values and rents. Your article
implies a degree of culpability and incompetence.
How are ordinary parishes like mine to judge the truth of the matter? I
would be glad if you could extract further information from that very
secretive body the Church Commissioners, who are, after all, servants of the
Church. There should be no secrets in the household of the believers.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: Production ratio a better economic instrument than
money factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord CALDECOTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You reported on the National Institute for Economic and Social Research's
critical report relating to economic forecasts ('Lamont warned of flawed
forecasts', July 8), and its comment that this 'could mean that we do not
know how the economy responds to instruments of monetary policy'.
I am not surprised, for the evidence is clear - in an economic performance
with wild swings between boom and recession - that successive chancellors of
the exchequer have been badly let down overall by their economic advisers'
excessive concentration on money factors; though the reduction in inflation
to less than 5 per cent is certainly a welcome achievement.
I suggest to the chancellor that he should in future concentrate far more
attention on a simple ratio, a production ratio, of the total output value
of products manufactured in the UK compared to the value of UK purchases of
manufactured products. For the fact is that, if we are to have a prosperous
and stable economy, industry must produce far more competitive products
saleable at a profit than at present.
It matters little whether they are sold in the UK or overseas, provided the
production ratio is brought closer to unity than it is now. We have many top
companies making a full contribution to improving this ratio, but we need
many more.
If the chancellor will support such a policy and direct his advisers'
attention to the ways of improving the production ratio, he will have less
need to take their forecasts with so much salt, and we shall all the sooner
get back on the road to sustainable growth. It is high time to let the
wealth creators have a go.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: A dangerous line of argument when assessing the
seriousness of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID DAMANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader concerning the outcome of the Blue Arrow Affair ('From
fraud to farce', July 18), you comment that 'the more important question is
whether crimes in which there are no immediate victims with quantifiable
losses merit a jail sentence at all'. Without commenting on any particular
case, I would argue that your line of thought is exceptionally dangerous.
You seem to suggest that the seriousness of a crime, or indeed its
existence, depends on whether or not there are 'immediate victims'. But if
certain operations in the market mis-price capital then there are certainly
victims: many thousands of shareholders and, in sum, society as a whole.
Although these victims are not 'immediate', the amounts of money are
enormous - far more than is lost if a fund management operation runs off
with the savings of a relatively restricted number of retired people, even
though the plight of these people is obvious and attracts sympathy.
Many more such people, and others, will be harmed if the country is poorer
through the misuse of capital, whether through the misallocation of
resources through mis-pricing or even if a takeover battle is won by the
wrong party, when industrial activity will be seriously distorted.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Man in the news: Millionaire with a peace mission - Milan
Panic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Milan Panic, who left Belgrade with a bicycle and Dollars 20, and ended
up owning a pharmaceuticals company in California, appears to be enjoying
his latest venture as prime minister of the unrecognised Yugoslavia.
He has pledged to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'The first step is to
concentrate the heavy artillery of all three sides under the supervision of
the United Nations,' said Mr Panic, chairman of International Chemicals and
Nuclear Pharmaceuticals Inc.
'I will deliver the first Serbian tank in Bosnia to the UN,' he vowed. He
sees his drive to demilitarise Bosnia as a crucial step towards the lifting
of UN sanctions on Yugoslavia, now comprising only Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr Panic took the premier's job out of patriotism and a seemingly
unshakeable belief that he can succeed in a monumental task. But the odds
are against him. A Serb immigrant who has lived the quintessential American
dream, he built a pharmaceuticals empire which some observers say has shaky
foundations.
Ebullient and impulsive, Mr Panic joined Tito's Communist partisans at 14,
and in 1956 defected to West Germany while competing in a bicycle
championship. From there he went to the US. His US passport/dual citizenship
should help as he travels abroad in a bid to pull Yugoslavia out of its
international isolation. Despite UN sanctions, Mr Panic has received
assurances from his lawyers that he can retain his US status. He often says:
'I am an American . . . and the prime minister of Yugoslavia.'
His relationship with part of the political establishment in Washington is
confirmed by his contributions to the Democratic party - he held a Dollars
1,000-plate dinner at his mansion in Pasadena to drum up support for Michael
Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign.
Back in his native Yugoslavia, now a land of intrigue and destruction, Mr
Panic is determined to spread his vision of peaceful coexistence. 'Maybe I
am naive, but I know that people are for peace. Maybe I am naive but I know
that fathers don't like their kids killed,' he said in an interview with the
FT.
He explains that he has Moslems and Serbs in his family who get along
together well. Mr Panic insists that Serbs and Croats do not hate each
other. He says the same for all other ethnic groups in the region.
His vision of inter-ethnic coexistence includes all the neighbours of the
former Yugoslav federation except Italy. 'We need to build economic power so
that together we can bargain for a better position internationally.'
His solutions are primarily economic. For instance, he thinks the painful
problem of Serbian-controlled Kosovo, the mostly ethnic Albanian province in
southern Serbia, can be resolved by increased economic co-operation with
neighbouring Albania.
'I want to make peace with Albanians. If the relationship, not just
political, but economic, is improved with Albania, than Kosovo becomes much
less of a problem.'
Despite his message of peace, Mr Panic revealed only a vague idea of who is
attacking whom and where. When informed of the ongoing Serbian assault on
Gorazde, he said: 'Let's call them immediately,' ordering his aides to
telephone the town in eastern Bosnia which has been under a Serbian siege
for three months. It has no telephone or road contact with the outside
world. Undeterred, he finally reached the town via short-wave radio.
Mr Panic appeared unaware that he cannot stop the war until Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic resigns. Mr Milosevic still commands enormous
popular support and controls parts of the Yugoslav army and Serb irregular
forces. The relationship between the two men is unclear. He was nominated
for his present position by Mr Milosevic.
But in the murky world of Serbian politics, the role of Yugoslav President
Dobrica Cosic, a well-known writer, is not to be underestimated. Seen as the
spiritual father of all Serbs, Mr Cosic is reported to believe that Mr
Milosevic is ballast that must be shed for the sake of peace. Without the
support of Mr Cosic, Mr Panic has no power base other than the Serbian lobby
in the US.
The prime minister earlier warned Mr Milosevic to keep a low profile. 'God
help him if he gets in my way,' he said. Now he has toned down his message,
saying 'Milosevic is expected to act as if he were the governor of
California'. But Mr Milosevic is not likely to devolve his powers willingly
to anyone, especially to a millionaire who speaks rusty Serbo-Croat and
heavily-accented English.
In an attempt to thwart resistance from Milosevic's ruling Socialist party,
Mr Panic has tempered his privatisation plans with the promise to introduce
'socially responsible capitalism'. However, the chances of gaining support
for an economic stabilisation programme are unrealistic given the war and
sanctions.
Western diplomats have described Mr Panic as a 'loose cannon'. US federal
regulators appear to agree. ICN has been investigated twice by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The US justice department also brought a
civil action in the late 1980s against ICN for overstating the potential of
Virazole, a medicine approved in 1985 for the treatment of a rare
respiratory disease. In 1987, ICN, based in Costa Mesa, disclosed reports
that Virazole was effective in delaying the onset of AIDS in HIV patients.
ICN gave up the fight for AIDS approval and paid a goodwill fine of Dollars
57m and wrote off a loss of Dollars 82m. In addition, Mr Panic paid a
Dollars 600,000 fine to the Food and Drug Administration last year over the
Virazole episode.
Most diplomats in Belgrade give the prime minister no more than three months
before he quits and returns to the US. Mr Panic, 62, dismisses this grim
prognosis: 'I have not learned to fail . . . as a good American, we give all
of our presidents 100 days to prove themselves.'
Laughing, he asks: 'Do I seem like someone they can roll over easily?'

FT  18 JUL 92 / And then there were two: Bill Clinton and George Bush are
alone in the presidential race, but both have changed since it began
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The American political wheel has come full circle in a little over six
months. Barring the unpredictable, the November presidential election will
as usual be fought between a Republican and a Democrat, with no serious
outside interference.
Back in January, the general expectation was that President George Bush
would probably win re-election against one of a gaggle of second-string
Democrats, of whom the likeliest prospect appeared at the time to be
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
This could still be the outcome. But only a Rip van Winkle, unaware that so
much water has flowed in so many torrents under the political bridges since
then, would confidently predict it.
Unless it is all an illusion, neither the country nor the candidates are
quite what they were. It was known before the year began that Americans were
in a sour mood with the political establishment but the depth of their
discontent was not fully apparent.
Their temporary embrace of such improbable protest candidates as Pat
Buchanan, only a rightwing polemicist, Jerry Brown, the arch exponent of
political cynicism and self-indulgence, Paul Tsongas, worthy but duller even
than Michael Dukakis, and, above all, of Ross Perot, revealed at last as
just another self-centred autocratic Texas billionaire, showed a hunger for
something different, even fraudulently different.
But they have all gone. Left standing, as in the beginning, are George Bush
and Bill Clinton and they surely are not the same.
Some find the first evidence of President Bush's frailty in the Pennsylvania
Senate by-election last November, when his man, Dick Thornburgh, was upset
by a liberal Democrat, Harris Wofford. Others ascribe it to the unfortunate
incident in the lap of the Japanese prime minister in Tokyo in January.
Since then it has been open season on Mr Bush and not only for Democrats.
Pat Buchanan cut him up, Ross Perot bludgeoned him, the media turned against
him, even his own party treated him with disdain. His ace-in-the-hole, an
improving economy, has so far let him down.
In the face of all this, the president has seemed paralysed at worst,
indecisive at best, with no clue how to get out of his present troubles and
no idea what he would do with his second term. If the astronomical peak of
his popularity after the Gulf war was always illusory, he had better hope
that the depths to which he has now plunged, as low as any incumbent
president in an election year, are equally false.
But Mr Bush's travails are nothing compared with Mr Clinton's, which makes
his emergence this week as the unchallenged leader of a party united beyond
its wildest dreams and soaring away to 20-point plus leads in the overnight
polls all the more remarkable. Of course, July polls mean nothing in
November, as Mr Dukakis discovered four years ago, but they meant enough for
Mr Clinton in New York for him reasonably to claim the title of 'the
comeback kid'.
The list of his early tribulations is well known: pot-smoking, draft
dodging, free love - the trinity of excesses for anyone who grew up in the
1960s. His sometimes evasive responses raised doubts about his honesty, and
Americans have been taught to believe, in spite of manifold evidence to the
contrary, that their presidents, like George Washington, never dissemble.
Jimmy Carter was not the first, nor will he be the last, to run for the
office proclaiming: 'I'll never lie to you.'
But perhaps the greatest test of Clinton's endurance was about a month ago,
when he seemed to have fallen well behind Bush and Perot. One compilation of
polls taken in every state showed him leading in only two, evoking memories
of the disastrous Democratic campaigns of 1972, 1984 and 1988. At that time
his party had no realistic alternative and he looked a loser.
But he is tough and smart and had some answers. The first approach was to go
back to what he is best at, policy-oriented proposals. The economic
blueprint was reworked, borrowing a bit from Mr Tsongas on the investment
side, backing off earlier promises of a middle-class tax cut. Perfect it is
not, but it began to look good in comparison with the complete lack of
substance from Mr Perot and the broken-record utterances of Mr Bush.
The second was to acknowledge that the picture that the country had of the
man Clinton himself was sketchy. He has always maintained - citing the New
Hampshire primary, when he might well have been knocked out, and his own
popularity in Arkansas - that the more people got to know him the more they
accepted him.
But any candidate can meet half the populations of New Hampshire and
Arkansas in a couple of weeks. Extending that to the national level is a
different proposition. So, borrowing a bit from Mr Perot, he took to the
talk and celebrity shows, played his saxophone on late-night television and,
above all at this week's convention, began to talk more about himself and
the modest circumstances of his upbringing, long before Georgetown, Oxford
and Yale brought out his intellectual sophistication.
Yet still Mr Clinton could not have recovered to his present state of
relative grace without Ross Perot. Initially it was the acerbic Bush-Perot
war which made him look sober and responsible in comparison. But the real
current boost has come from the sudden unravelling of the Perot phenomenon.
Mr Clinton's surge is directly attributable to mass desertion from the
would-be-and-now-no-longer independent candidate.
The selection last week of Senator Al Gore as a running mate has proved a
temporary plus beyond expectations. He stands up well against Vice-President
Dan Quayle and provides Washington experience. The 'baby boomer' ticket
emphasises youth and compatibility, thus sustaining the case for the sort of
serious but non-radical change explicitly tailored to the tastes of
middle-class suburban America.
That both are border southerners has not attracted the criticism it might
from haughty yankees, nor from blacks, now comfortable with progressive
southern politicians. The Rev Jesse Jackson has endorsed the ticket, less
grudgingly than he might have. So, with the predictable exception of Jerry
Brown, have leaders of almost all the liberal Democratic constituencies.
Mario Cuomo, New York's quixotic governor and, along with the Rev Jackson,
guardian of the liberal flame, did Mr Clinton more than proud with a
roof-raising nominating speech.
One other ingredient matters. This is touted, with some justification, as
the year of the woman in US politics. Women have been mobilised by the
threat to reproductive choice, which seven out of 10 of them want to
preserve, and by outrage at the treatment of Anita Hill in the Clarence
Thomas hearings. On both scores Mr Clinton is with the majority and Mr Bush,
whose opposition to abortion is challenged inside his own party, is not. The
only doubt is whether, as in the past, women's rights fade as a major
determinant in the election itself.
So Mr Clinton, Mr Gore and the party, under the able leadership of Ron
Brown, came out of New York this week actually believing they can win in
November. Some might have liked Mr Perot to stick around for a while but
there is a genuine hunger for the battle and there will be no relaxation in
the campaign, as Mr Dukakis fatally did when he came out of Atlanta four
years ago with a comparable lead.
But this hopefulness, too, might be just another illusion in a political
year of mirrors. The convention was a confection like no other seen in
recent Democratic party history, efficiently run, flag-waving, nearly free
of dissent, a Busby Berkeley production. But it cannot disguise the fact
that, outside the converted in Madison Square Garden, Mr Clinton has a way
to go before he generates real enthusiasm in the land.
Moreover the Republicans lie in wait with a recent record of knowing how to
win elections, by fair means or foul. They will attack his lack of formal
foreign-policy experience, they will pick holes in his record as governor of
a still backward state and they will hammer away that he is, whatever his
cloak of fiscal pragmatism, in reality a traditional 'tax and spend'
Democrat. 'Bill Clinton is just another Fritz Mondale,' said one Republican
strategist this week.
They will seek to turn the generational argument on its head, contrasting
not only Mr Bush's experience with Mr Clinton's newness but also not sparing
the distaff side. The nation's grandmother, Barbara Bush, will be deployed
as the real embodiment of traditional family values as opposed to Hillary
Clinton, who is going to be labelled even more sharply as an overambitious
career woman contemptuous of the homemaker.
In this, and in other matters, it could get very dirty. Bill and Hillary
Clinton may have their defence mechanisms in order after all they have been
through so far, but the expectation is that they have seen nothing yet.
Now that this is a two-horse race again, standard electoral calculations may
be reapplied, and some benefit Mr Bush. His southern base looks more secure,
unless Mr Clinton and Mr Gore catch fire on their near home turf. Florida
and Texas should remain his with Mr Perot out of the way, though California
still looks shaky. In many other states west of the Mississippi, a plurality
of votes was achievable for Mr Clinton, but a majority is a much tougher
target.
The Bush campaign team needs reshuffling. It is not clear if the president,
after going fishing with James Baker this week, can lure his secretary of
state all the way back, as he did from the Treasury four years ago, but a
greater Baker input is inevitable. If he is as good as he was in 1988, it
will make a difference.
Finally, if Mr Clinton got a big bounce out of New York, Mr Bush can expect
something equivalent out of Houston next month. Mr Clinton did not give a
great acceptance speech, and Mr Bush is no Demosthenes either. The country
has flirted with a desire for change this year, Mr Clinton preaches the need
for it, and Mr Bush, though he talks of it, represents the status quo. It
all depends on how restless Americans are  - and there are still more than
100 days to go.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Vance tipped to lead UN mission to end South African
violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN special representative on South Africa is expected to fly in soon to
begin discussions aimed at ending political violence and restarting
constitutional negotiations. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary
general, has not yet named the envoy, but he has mentioned Mr Cyrus Vance,
the former US secretary of state, as a possibility.
The mandate contained in Security Council resolution 765, adopted
unanimously on Thursday night after a two day debate on South Africa, steers
a careful path between the positions of the government and the African
National Congress (ANC). It includes a broad condemnation of the violence,
in particular last month's massacre at Boipatong township, and while
stressing that it is the government's responsibility to protect lives, does
not suggest that Pretoria is involved in the killings.
The resolution calls for the special representative 'to recommend, after
discussions with the parties, measures which would assist in bringing an
effective end to violence and in creating conditions for negotiations
leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic  .. South Africa.'
President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, differ widely
on what would be appropriate measures, with the former indicating that he
would accept UN observers taking part in efforts to end the violence, while
Mr Mandela has suggested that a substantial UN monitoring force will be
necessary.
Prospects for a resumption of talks have nevertheless improved, although
formal constitutional negotiations are not expected to take place before the
UN envoy has reported back.
Mr de Klerk has moved some way towards meeting the ANC terms for the
resumption of talks, while senior figures on both sides are concerned by the
impact of the stalemate on tensions in South Africa.
Discussions are continuing between the business community and trade union
leaders in an effort to avert a general strike due to start on August 3.
Meanwhile South African police announced yesterday that 78 people held over
the Boipatong massacre will appear in court on Monday, charged with public
violence.
The Chamber of Mines' gold mine members and the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM) have agreed a 1992 wage review. However the NUM has
declared a dispute in the coal mining sector after failing to reach a
settlement with the chambers' collieries.
The gold mining houses, with the exception of Goldfields of South Africa and
Anglovaal, have also agreed to introduce a profit-sharing scheme which will
distribute 20 per cent of profits to employees.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Pol Pot's quiet wait for power: The Khmer Rouge has a
stranglehold on the UN peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS it was not surprising that the birds released this week at a
ceremony to disarm 2,000 Cambodian guerrillas were not pure white doves of
peace but a motley collection of black and white pigeons reluctant to fly
more than a few yards from their cage.
The ceremony in northern Cambodia to disarm fighters of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Armed Forces was overshadowed - like the entire
Cambodian peace process - by the continuing refusal of the leftist Khmer
Rouge to co-operate with the UN peace plan agreed by the four Cambodian
factions and the superpowers last year.
According to the Dollars 1.7bn plan, 450,000 troops and militiamen from all
the factions should have been regrouped by July 11, but the Khmer Rouge has
not begun the cantonment process and has not even allowed soldiers of the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) access to its territory.
The Khmer Rouge has also repeatedly broken the ceasefire which was supposed
to begin after the signing of the peace agreement in Paris last October:
this week Khmer Rouge guerrillas launched a series of attacks in the north
and captured six villages from the existing administration installed by the
Vietnamese after they invaded in 1978 and overthrew the Khmer Rouge.
UN officials have also learned that the Khmer Rouge leadership is offering
bounty payments for guerrillas who shoot down UN aircraft. Seven have been
hit already.
UN officers were therefore not surprised to see that most of the weapons
surrendered by the KPNLAF were rusty and unusable rifles, or to hear KPNLAF
generals declare that they needed to keep their best equipment for
self-defence.
One UN official said there was 'a lot of monkey business' in the limited
cantonment and disarmament which has so far occurred.
The UN suspects the various guerrilla armies of hiding equipment in arms
caches, sending untrained teenagers with old weapons to cantonment areas and
keeping their best soldiers in the field.
Repeated warnings by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of Untac, and other UN
officials that 'time is running out' for the Khmer Rouge are beginning to
wear thin. Untac's inability to enforce Khmer Rouge compliance is not only
playing havoc with a timetable which should lead to elections in the first
half of next year but also undermining the credibility of the most expensive
and ambitious peacekeeping operation in UN history.
The next step to increase the pressure on the Khmer Rouge is likely to be a
UN Security Council resolution condemning the organisation for failing to
abide by the terms of the peace plan. But China, one of the principal
backers of the Khmer Rouge, may use its status as a permanent member of the
council to soften the resolution.
More important are Mr Akashi's negotiations with the government of
neighbouring Thailand to try to bring economic pressure to bear on the
guerrillas. He is expected to visit Bangkok this weekend. The weakness of
this approach is that the Khmer Rouge's lucrative exports of tropical timber
and gems across the Thai frontier - and its imports of supplies - are
controlled not by the civilian government but by the Thai army.
By necessity rather than design, Untac is engaged in a waiting game which
its critics say plays into the hands of the Khmer Rouge.
Despite its grim record in power - an estimated one million Cambodians died
under its reign of terror between 1975 and 1978 - the Khmer Rouge has
recently struck a popular chord with the two conditions it has set for
co-operating with the peace plan.
First, the Khmer Rouge is demanding UN verification that no Vietnamese
troops remain in the country, and secondly, it insists that the
Vietnamese-installed government be dismantled and real power be transferred
to the Supreme National Council (SNC) - the body including all four factions
which is charged with implementing the peace plan in association with Untac.
Although there is no proof of a continuing Vietnamese military presence,
Vietnam is Cambodia's traditional enemy, and Cambodians resent the arrival
of thousands of Vietnamese builders and other artisans taking advantage of
the reconstruction boom to find work in Cambodia.
As for the status of the SNC, diplomats acknowledge that Untac and the SNC
have been slow in imposing a neutral civilian administration: foreign
dignitaries, for example, are still greeted by the old government instead of
the SNC.
The longer it takes the UN to impose its will on the Khmer Rouge, the more
money the Khmer Rouge will earn for its war chests from the gem mines and
forests in its territory and the more chance it will have of regaining some
sort of political legitimacy in Cambodia.
Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader known as Brother Number One, is waiting
quietly in the wilderness. 'They have money, they have arms, they have men,
and they have China and Thailand,' says Mr Ek Sereywath of Funcinpec, the
royalist faction. 'The Khmer Rouge dream of returning to power.'

Mr Narasimha Rao's government yesterday survived the no-confidence vote by a
comfortable margin of 52 votes. However, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, president
of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accused the government
of adopting a 'confrontational attitude' and announced that Monday would be
observed nation-wide as 'Ayodhya Day', to agitate for the completion of the

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US merchandise trade deficit widened to Dollars 7.4bn in May, as falling
exports raised new doubts over whether foreign sales would provide the drive
needed for a US recovery.
May was the third straight month of widening trade deficits and the highest
deficit in 18 months. Exports declined during the month by 2.5 per cent to
Dollars 35.49bn, while imports also fell, dropping 1.4 per cent to Dollars
42.87bn.
A large part of the decline was attributable to volatile aircraft sales, but
the bigger than expected trade gap also provided new evidence of a weak
second quarter.
The US Commerce Department put the best interpretation possible on the news,
noting the 'solid trend' in export growth and continued strength in sales of
advanced technology products.
'Our exports to developing nations are booming, accounting for 91 per cent
of export growth this year,' said Mrs Barbara Franklin, the US Commerce
Department, in a statement. 'US exports to Mexico are up over 30 per cent so
far.'
Mr Dick Hoey, chief economist of the Dreyfus Corporation, said the
substantial export growth in Latin America provided some counterbalance to
the weakening demand in the industrialised nations.
He said the US was moving toward 'a hyper-competitive' trade position with
the lower dollar, the restructuring of industry and good unit labour costs.
The April to May change in the trade deficit reflected falling foreign sales
of foods, feeds and beverages, capital goods, and vehicle products. Exports
of industrial supplies and materials and consumer goods rose.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S parliament yesterday demanded sanctions against the Baltic republic
of Estonia if it does not stop discriminating against its large Russian
minority.
The resolution, which included a call to consider suspending the
co-operation treaty between the two states and a threat to raise the issue
at the United Nations, is a sign of the deepening hostility between Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania and Russia.
It is also a further indication of the hardening of attitudes in Russian
political circles - a trend which is leaving Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the moderate
foreign minister, increasingly isolated. The latest call for his resignation
came yesterday from General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president -
who again accused him of malign intent in predicting a coup organised by
military and security circles.
In spite of efforts to improve relations - especially on the parts of Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the
Lithuanian president - the issues between them continue to drive them
further apart. This week, members of an Estonian paramilitary force fired on
Russian trucks and temporarily captured a detachment of Russian soldiers.
The Baltic states say there has been no progress in talks to remove the
130,000-strong army based in the area. Mr Yeltsin promised at the Munich
summit this month that it would be withdrawn next year - but he later hedged
his pronouncements and the Baltics remain sceptical.
A plan to attract foreign investment of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) a year
over the next three years was yesterday adopted by the Russian cabinet.
The ambitious target - given a total of only Dollars 2bn in foreign
investment over the past five years - would make up 18 per cent of total
investment in the economy, according to Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime
minister.
The programme calls for further legislation on investment to be enacted this
year, together with changes in tax and customs duties.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic
relations and one of the more experienced of the young ministerial team,
will head a foreign investment committee, co-ordinating the work of
different ministries and departments.
Goldman Sachs, the US merchant bank charged by the government to attract
investment, believes that it is likely to pick up next year as the larger
companies are put up for sale and foreign companies find ways to invest in
them.

<TEXT>
THE ARREST of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, financier and king of Milan
construction, on alleged corruption charges on Thursday caused a sharp drop
yesterday in shares under his control.
Mr Ligresti, responsible for building many large developments in Milan
during the past decade as well being a shareholder in Mediobanca, Italy's
most prestigious private financial institution, was arrested in connection
with the corruption scandal involving rigged construction contracts and
political kick-backs.
He is the most prominent business figure so far to be linked by Milan
magistrates to an affair which has involved almost 70 local and national
politicians, as well as members of the city's leading construction
companies.
Shares in Premafin, one of Mr Ligresti's financial concerns, fell by more
than 7 per cent and anxieties about the future of his group following his
arrest also served to depress prices generally on the bourse by 2 per cent
yesterday. The market also reacted negatively to Thursday's raising of
interest rates by the Bank of Italy in response to the move by the
Bundesbank. Again yesterday, the Bank of Italy lifted its short term rates
by almost one point to 16 per cent.
Meanwhile, the government confirmed it was winding up Efim, the debt-ridden
industrial state holding company which has 37,000 employees and debts of
L8,500bn (Pounds 3.87bn). The move had been foreshadowed on Thursday when
the board resigned.
A statement said Efim, which controls more than 100 companies with
activities ranging from aluminium, defence and transport to glass and health
spas, would be wound up in five stages:
valuation of the group;
transfers, incorporation and sales of assets;
loss-making operations with debts will be administered according to the
practice of a voluntary liquidation;
issue of Treasury backed paper to cover outstanding debts at interest rates
to be agreed by the Treasury;
a freeze on debt for at least a year.
The holding company was founded in 1947 to finance the development of
private and public sector industry but has ended up as a hospital for
loss-making businesses. Banks, mainly foreign, are owed some L2,000bn by
Efim's helicopter subsidiary, Agusta.

<TEXT>
MR VACLAV HAVEL said yesterday he would resign as president of
Czechoslovakia on Monday. This will leave the federation without a head of
state and accelerate the process towards the creation of two independent
Czech and Slovak republics.
He had been expected to stay in office until October 5, despite his failure
to be re-elected by the federal parliament this month, when a handful of
Slovak deputies vetoed his candidacy.
Mr Havel will now be free to run for the Czech presidency, a post being
prepared by the new Czech parliament, which is drafting a constitution.
Slovakia has said it will also adopt its own constitution, with a Slovak
president, possibly as early as late August.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, supports the candidacy of the
internationally respected playwright-turned-president. But Mr Havel this
week said he would accept the post only if he was elected directly and if
'the position was not solely honorific'. Czech deputies in Mr Klaus's party
favour giving strong powers to the prime minister instead.
The resignation of Mr Havel coincided with the overwhelming approval by the
Slovak parliament of a declaration of Slovak sovereignty.
It does not challenge the current 1968 federal constitution, but it is
perceived as the first step towards an independent Slovakia.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Czech premier, told the Slovak deputies: 'This
declaration tells all European nations that we are now ready to negotiate as
equals.'
The declaration, which was approved by the parliament 'according to
constitutional principles', proclaims that 'the thousand years' striving of
the Slovak nation for self-realisation has been accomplished'.
Mr Jozef Prokes, leader of the pro-independence National Slovak Party and
Slovak deputy prime minister, read the document to a handful of enthusiastic
demonstrators in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, while the rest of the
republic appeared to pay little attention to this symbolic gesture.

FT  18 JUL 92 / Bosnia's warring factions agree to 14-day ceasefire
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday agreed to a
14-day ceasefire which will include placing all heavy weapons and artillery
in the area under the supervision of the United Nations.
The ceasefire is the first to be firmly linked to a plan for
demilitarisation of the former Yugoslav republic under international
control, offering some hope that it could hold - unlike scores of previous
peace attempts.
The agreement followed three days of talks by Moslem, Serb and Croat
representatives with Lord Carrington, chairman of the European
Community-sponsored peace conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina. It is intended
to begin a process towards a constitutional settlement in the
ethnically-mixed independent republic.
Lord Carrington and Mr Jose Cutileiro, the Portuguese ambassador, who
conducted most of the detailed negotiations, warned that many earlier
ceasefires had been broken.
'But the thing which is encouraging . . . is that the atmosphere was much
more realistic than it had been in previous talks in Lisbon', said Lord
Carrington. 'This (agreement) is different . . . because of what they have
agreed to on heavy weapons,' he added.
Under the deal, all heavy weapons, including combat aircraft, artillery and
rocket launchers, mostly held by the Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy
Bosnian army, will be placed under UN supervision. Lord Carrington has
already spoken to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, who is
expected to ask the Security Council to take measures to implement this part
of the ceasefire agreement.
All three sides have also committed themselves not to return fire under any
provocation.
He added that the 14-day ceasefire period had been designed to give time for
the orders to filter through to all units throughout the republic.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, said he had already asked
General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army in Bosnia, to stop
bombarding the eastern city of Gorazde, which Serb irregulars have cut off
from the outside world for three months.
Mr Mate Boban, leader of Bosnia's Croats, who control large parts of the
west of the republic, said: 'We will do everything in our means to ensure
that the ceasefire lasts.'
Mr Haris Silajdzic, representative of the Bosnian government and of the
Moslem community, welcomed the agreement, particularly if it could bring an
end to the killing and deportations.
'I still want a unitary state. I hope that those forced to flee will now
return to this homes,' he added.
Moslem, Serb, and Croat representatives also agreed to allow refugees who
have fled the area to return, and to enable citizens to move freely
throughout the republic.
More than 2m people have been made homeless or forced to flee the war, which
has left at least 7,500 dead since April.
All sides have agreed to reconvene in London on July 27. In the meantime,
Lord Carrington plans to hold talks with Mr Ibrahim Rugova, head of the
ethnic Albanians in the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo in what
appears to be the first concrete step in efforts to contain the war.

Borsumij Wehry of the Netherlands has agreed to acquire the Ceteco Holding
trading and consumer durables subsidiary of Van Ommeren in stages over the
next two years, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
Hague-based Borsumij, a big trading group, will initially buy 51 per cent of
Ceteco from Van Ommeren, which is based in Rotterdam and specialises in tank
storage and transport activities.
Van Ommeren wants to move out of trading and concentrate on core activities.
*****
Maerz, the brewery group, will take a 33 per cent stake in A. Moksel before
seeking a majority stake in the German meat processor, Reuter reports from
Munich.
Maerz said it signed transaction agreements with Moksel's biggest
shareholder, Alexander Moksel. The deal requires the final approval of
Germany's Federal Cartel Office.

venture

<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, and Peugeot, its private sector
rival, have agreed to join forces in car recycling.
The pair are to co-operate in what will be France's largest car recycling
plant at Athis Mons, south of Paris, based at an existing scrap metal
crushing plant owned by Compagnie Francaise des Ferrailles, a federation of
metal crushing and treatment groups.
The plant will recover recyclable materials from 200 cars per day and
produce a mixture of re-usable components - fluids such as oil and brake
fluid, plastic and rubber granulates for the construction industry and
plastic foam for insulation of buildings. However, this will be a small
proportion of the 2m cars scrapped in France annually.
Renault and Peugeot have agreed to share research into recycling methods and
to study a joint waste collection scheme to collect recyclable materials
such as used plastic bumpers from their dealer networks.
Both groups have operated separate pilot recycling plants, where they have
researched the most efficient ways of dismantling old cars to make the best
use of materials.
Peugeot claims to be able to recycle 95 per cent of the content of disused
cars at a pilot plant near Lyons, operated with Compagnies Francaise des
Ferrailles and Ciments Vicat, the Paris-based cement group. However, the
plant capacity is 16 vehicles per day.
Renault has a test recycling centre at its Flins assembly plant near Paris.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Mirror Group directors face
angry shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Mirror Group Newspapers was yesterday accused of trying to
whitewash the Robert Maxwell affair.
The accusations were made at the first annual meeting of MGN since last
year's flotation. It was held against a background of overall losses of
nearly Pounds 500m (Dollars 955m), and what was described as probably the
largest fraud this century.
The claim that 'buckets of whitewash' had been thrown over the role of the
MGN board came from Mr Joseph Grizzard, a shareholder and former MGN
director in the pre-Maxwell days. He said the board had made it all look
like an unfortunate accident which had been beyond the control of all the
directors.
Mr Trevor Davis, a Daily Mirror journalist, warned that members of the board
would continue to be hounded by questions about what they knew. 'In the
public eye they are tainted and they should go,' he said.
However, in spite of tough questions - more than 80 per cent from employee
shareholders - the three-hour meeting was generally low-key. Card votes were
forced on accepting the financial accounts and reappointing Mr Roger Eastoe
and Mr Bernard Tominey as directors, but the outcome was never in doubt.
The board was supported by Mr John Talbot, administrator to the private
Maxwell companies, who holds 54 per cent of MGN and most of the proxy votes.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman, said: 'You may as shareholders hang whom you
like but the group still has to be managed and run.'
He also admitted the board had been advised that there could be claims
against the company because of circumstances surrounding the flotation and
subsequent events.
Sir Robert said he expected the shares, suspended at 125p since December,
would be relisted today. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel,
said the share price could fall today to between 50p and 55p.
Sir Robert confirmed that Mr Alan Stephens, company secretary, and Mr Robert
Gregory, director of human resources, were subject to internal disciplinary
proceedings.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Ukraine opposition seeks referendum on new poll
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE's leading opposition politicians yesterday called for a referendum
to bring about new parliamentary elections and remove the
communist-dominated government.
Mr Vycheslav Chornovil, leader of Rukh, the democratic nationalist movement
which led the struggle for Ukrainian independence, attacked the government
of Mr Vitold Fokin. The recent appointment of Mr Valentin Simonenko as the
government's economics supremo was a victory for 'the old communist mafia,'
he said.
For early elections to take place the law requires the collection of at
least 3m votes in a referendum. Setting the referendum machinery in motion
would put pressure on the government and force the opposition to become more
effective even if it failed to win the required 3m votes, Mr Chornovil
added.
Mr Simonenko, a former construction manager, Communist party first secretary
and mayor of Odessa, Ukraine's biggest port on the Black Sea, was appointed
to replace Mr Vladimir Lanovoi, a young economist who has worked closely
with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other foreign advisers.
The change, made by President Leonid Kravchuk only hours after parliament
adjourned for the summer holidays last week, has called into question the
government's commitment to rapid privatisation and other market-oriented
economic reforms.
It reinforces the ranks of former communists surrounding Mr Kravchuk,
himself a former party ideology secretary.
Mr Simonenko said he would unify financial, economic and monetary policy
under his control. 'I am completely against the idea of aid from the west
but fully support mutually beneficial foreign investment and co-operation,'
he said.
Critics say the government, headed by Mr Vitold Fokin, another veteran
communist, has hardly changed the old communist bureaucratic structures, but
merely wrapped them in the Ukrainian national flag. However, an expected
vote of no confidence has been postponed until parliament reassembles in the
autumn.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Post script
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUN YOUR eye over the five-year performance figures. They are terrible.
Many people claim that the problems of the unit trust industry are
attributable to poor marketing. There may be something in this, but its
current success in selling unit trust Peps suggests otherwise.
Unit trusts' biggest problem, judging by these figures, is the underlying
performance of their product. If any performance figures are quoted in
marketing material these must, under Lautro rules, include five-year
performance.
Over the past year, this has become a heavy millstone around the industry's
neck. This is because a bull market peaked in July 1987, to be followed by a
precipitate share price collapse on Black Monday in October. Five years is
now the least flattering period which could possibly be chosen.
The scepticism of financial laymen towards the stock market is
understandable. It seems like sophistry indeed to argue that one should put
money into unit trusts when the average UK General unit trust can manage
only 7.9 per cent growth over five years - with income reinvested.
To cap that, the UK Growth sector seems ironically named, as it shows an
average loss of 3 per cent. Income funds, helped by the assumption that they
reinvest yields generally in excess of 5 per cent, still only averaged a 7
per cent increase.
A current account could beat these figures. And investment trusts are
scarcely any better. Over five years, the average UK General trust has
increased by only 10.5 per cent, while UK Capital Growth trusts logged a
decline of almost 10 per cent.
In both sets of tables, the 10-year figures (available for investment trusts
for the first time in this Review) tell a different story.
These figures exceed anything a building society could offer.
While the averages are quite adequate, some performances are astonishing -
for example, Pounds 1,000 invested in Capability Special Situations unit
trust in 1982 would have grown to Pounds 8,397.
No past performance was in any way a perfect guide to the future - but
which, out of the five- and ten-year figures, does a better job?
The circumstances of the 1985 bull market and the ensuing crash seem wholly
exceptional - if five-year equity market figures were ever as bad as this
again, the world economy would be in dire trouble.
But can the outperformance of the early 1980s be repeated? Many now believe
that the exchange rate mechanism will ensure lower yields and interest rates
for the next decade. This does not mean abandoning equities altogether, but
it helps to explain the concentration, in this issue of Review, on
fixed-interest investments.
The real challenge for unit trust managers will come in October, when Black
Monday passes out of the five-year figures. Then, at last, their marketeers
will have a product the public may want to buy.

top-performing collective funds over five years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tables show the value, as at July 1st , of a Pounds 1,000 investment over
different periods. Unit trusts are given on an offer-to-bid basis with net
income reinvested. Investment trusts are on a mid-market basis with net
income reinvested. The order in which trusts are listed is based on
performance over five years, so that funds with less than five years'
performance are omitted.
All of the figures on these pages are provided by Finstat, the Financial
Times Statistics Service.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders believe producers
behind zinc price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS SUGGESTED yesterday that a producer-inspired market support
operation was behind the steep rise in the London Metal Exchange price of
zinc, which yesterday touched Dollars 1,365 a tonne at one stage - the
highest level for 21 months.
Since the latest attempt by the LME executive to keep the market orderly
ended on Wednesday this week, zinc has risen by nearly 4 per cent. The
three-month price closed at Dollars 1,359.50 a tonne last night, up Dollars
23 following a Dollars 27.5 a tonne rise on Wednesday.
The LME's zinc market has been in the grip of technical tightness almost
continuously since April last year. The exchange's executive issued two
warnings and managed to nip a squeeze in the bud in January.
But the LME had to take action on June 15 in order to maintain an orderly
market after the premium being paid for cash zinc over three-month metal
reached nearly Dollars 200 a tonne. The LME placed a limit on the daily
backwardation (premium for cash metal over future dates). This limitation
ended on Wednesday.
Consumers maintain that during the first six months of this year the zinc
market fundamentally deteriorated and that physical metal is in plentiful
supply - as indicated by the record LME stock levels.
Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque
Indosuez Group, said in his latest Metals Markets Insight: 'Producers have
become increasingly prominent in the options market, accounting at times for
up to 40 per cent of turnover. Because of this activity some believe that
concerted producer support operations are behind the technical squeeze and,
therefore, the price rise.'
Traders said the latest concern was about October delivery dates and that
the backwardation for October was now Dollars 65 a tonne.
After its most-recent meeting the LME board said it had noted concern about
tightness appearing once again on further forward dates, particularly
October and November and said it would 'closely monitor' the market.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out yesterday that zinc supply outpaced
demand last year and probably would do so again in 1992. Fundamentally, the
price for three-month zinc should be about Dollars 1,100 a tonne. However,
consumers still needed metal and they were buying whenever the price dipped
to Dollars 1,200. He added: 'It is difficult to see what the LME can do
about the squeeze. But we are in for an interesting summer for zinc.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gains lost after Bundesbank news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market reacted with guarded relief yesterday to the increase in
German discount rate to a record 8.75 per cent, thankful that the key
Lombard rate had been left unchanged and that the UK Treasury had reiterated
commitment to sterling's entry into the narrow bands of Europe's exchange
rate mechanism in due course. However, UK shares closed lower after
abandoning a sharp rise achieved in early trading.
Equity strategists see narrow band entry as the best hope for reducing UK
base rates before the end of the year. Ahead of the announcement from the
Bundesbank, UK equities had risen steadily in moderate trading, climbing 20
points on the Footsie scale to clear the 2,507 mark in a favourable response
to the latest data on the domestic economy.
Unemployment figures for June, with the seasonally adjusted rise of 7,000
barely one-third of market expectations, were regarded as a sign that the
domestic economy is rallying. May's average earnings gain of 6.5 per cent,
below City estimates, suggested some easing of inflationary pressure.
London equities responded positively as the first news on German rates
flashed across the trading screens; and the focus on the discount rate,
together with a rise in the sterling/D-Mark rate, soothed fears that UK
rates might be forced higher. Share buyers, however, backed off as the
foreign exchange markets digested news of higher rates elsewhere in Europe,
and equity prices began to retreat.
The 20-point gain on the Footsie was replaced by an eight-point loss.
However, investor-based selling was moderate and an increased Seaq volume of
525.5m shares represented hasty re-shuffling by marketmakers. On Wednesday,
Seaq turnover of 404m shares represented customer business worth Pounds
831m. At least two trading programmes, weighted towards the sell side, were
identified yesterday, and there was a drop in the Footsie futures contract
before it steadied late in the day.
By the close, the FT-SE Index had shown some recovery and the final reading
of 2,483.4 left a net loss of three points - no great reaction, in view of
London's evident apprehension ahead of the Bundesbank's rate decision.
The weakening US dollar restrained most of the overseas earnings stocks, but
ICI, a beneficiary of a firm D-Mark, enjoyed a successful trading session.
There was a handful of casualties in the building sector, where several UK
companies have extensive exposure in Germany.
Across the broader range, London share prices were content to follow the
modest downward move in other European bourses. Mr Ian Harnett, strategist
at Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm of Societe Generale, said the
outcome of the Bundesbank's deliberations was 'positive for London'. Strauss
is holding its year-end forecast for the FT-SE Index at 2,800.
However, London strategists still see the economy vulnerable to a rise in
base rates until at least the end of the year, with economic recovery
evidently arriving even more slowly than expected.

FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Volatile Dow finishes firmly
on late buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended higher on late buying yesterday after the rise in
German discount rate, the withdrawal of Mr Ross Perot from the presidential
race and a bigger than expected fall in weekly jobless claims had earlier
caused stock markets to fluctuate, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, having moved back and forth all day, was
up a net 16.21 at 3,361.63. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.44 at
417.54, the American SE composite was up 1.47 at 388.34 and the Nasdaq
composite put on 0.72 to 576.19. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly
heavy at 207m shares.
Prices fell in early trading following the rise in German discount rate,
which prompted a sell-off in the dollar and raised concern about how tighter
German monetary policy would affect global economic growth. Investors were
also worried that a weak dollar, while helping US exporters, could add to
domestic inflation.
There was some good news, however, in the form of a 15,000 decline in early
July weekly jobless claims and Mr Perot's departure from the presidential
election campaign.
The latter provoked a brief rush of buying on the belief that President
Bush's chances of staying in the White House had been boosted by Mr Perot's
withdrawal. Although the Perot-inspired gains were quickly lost, a late
round of buying pushed prices firmly into positive territory.
Second quarter earnings figures again dominated trading, although investors
seemed in a mood to take profits after companies announced their results.
One of the most actively traded stocks was Blockbuster, off Dollars 3/8 to
Dollars 12 1/2 in volume of 3m shares after the video chain store group said
it expected to report second quarter profits of around 16 to 17 cents a
share early next week.
Telefonos de Mexico moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 5/8 in turnover
of 7.1m shares on the withdrawal of Mr Perot from the election race. Mexican
stocks had fallen dramatically last month, partly on fears that if Mr Perot
won the presidency he would scupper the US-Mexican free trade agreement.
Bank shares lost ground as investors sold in the wake of the sector's good
recent gains. Citicorp slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 3/4 and Chemical
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 .
The market was aided by substantial rises in Digital Equipment, up Dollars 2
1/2 at Dollars 40 3/4 , IBM, Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 100 1/4 , and
Minnesota Mining, Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 99 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed with a slightly firmer tendency following moderately
active trading. The TSE 300 index put on 3.5 to 3,475.6, while advances led
declines by 287 to 233 after volume of 30.6m shares.
Canadian steel industry executives told a news conference that they have
initiated anti-dumping actions against US steel makers, in retaliation for
similar charges filed last month by US steel makers against Canada and other
countries.
Among Canadian steel concerns, Dofasco was unchanged at CDollars 13 7/8 ,
Stelco 'A' was up 30 cents at CDollars 3.90 and Ipsco gained CDollars  1/8
at CDollars 18 5/8 .

FT  17 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Worries not over
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK'S lifting of its discount rate by  3/4 point to 8.75 per cent
caused no immediate tension in the sterling cash market, and the Bank of
England continued to deal at the established intervention rates after the
German announcement.
Traders, however, said that the pound's performance on the foreign exchanges
over the next week will decide whether period rates, or even the Bank of
England's intervention policy, need to be firmer. Nor have fears disappeared
about a rise in the Bundesbank's emergency Lombard rate, the most important
determinant of short term rates.
'The possibility of further tightening by the Bundesbank cannot be ruled
out,' said one analyst yesterday. 'The difference between the Lombard rate
and the discount rate is now down to the lows of the early 1980s and, in
those days, a discount rate rise was always followed by one in the Lombard.'
Dealers said the possibility that Germany would tighten monetary policy
yesterday had already been priced into the market, leaving the 3-month cash
rate at 10 3/16 per cent by Wednesday night.
By yesterday evening, the rate had softened to 10 1/8 per cent, reflecting
relief in the market that the Lombard was unchanged. The 1-month rate for
sterling cash remained at 10 1/8 per cent and the 1-year rate at 10 1/16 per
cent.
Sterling futures traders had a more turbulent day. Shortly before the news
from the Bundesbank came through, the September contract traded up 10 basis
points to 89.90, on rumours that Germany was leaving policy unchanged. The
contract then sank back to around 89.82 as the real news arrived, but ended
at 89.93, propelled by sterling's strong performance in the afternoon.
The Bank of England's operations followed a morning forecast of Pounds 800m,
and the Bank dealt at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1
and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreements (repos).
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 150m of Band 2 bank bills,
and Pounds 166m in a repo repayable on August 5 and 6. In the afternoon, the
Bank purchased Pounds 132m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 50m of Band 2
bank bills. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 195m.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Currencies shrug off rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCIES in the European Monetary System managed to shrug off the
Bundesbank's  3/4 percentage-point rise in its discount rate yesterday, but
some operators expressed fears that Germany will tighten monetary policy
further, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision to raise its discount rate to 8.75 per cent did
not cause the feared run on EMS currencies, partly because the expected
tightening of German monetary policy had been priced into the market in the
earlier part of this week.
However, the Bank of Italy was forced to raise its discount rate yet again
to protect the lira in the aftermath of the Bundesbank's move. The lira had
dropped to L761 to the D-Mark at the start of the day but finished stronger
at L758.7, after the discount rate went up to 13.75 per cent. A more modest
policy tightening by the Dutch and Belgian authorities was due to the
traditionally close ties both countries have with Bundesbank policy.
Sterling ended one pfennig higher at DM2.8550, in spite of the Bank of
England's determination not to tighten policy. Relief that the Lombard rate
was untouched was the cause for bullishness, but scepticism remains as to
whether the pound can hold at these levels.
Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London,
said: 'The markets are still looking for proof that the British government
will defend the pound if the going gets tough.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, of
Yamaichi International, agreed: 'Sterling will be under pressure in the next
few days. The Bank of Italy has raised rates by 1.75 percentage points in
the last 10 days, and the markets want to see whether the Bank of England
will defend its place in the ERM with that kind of action.'
There are also fears that the Bundesbank will raise the more
market-sensitive Lombard rate soon. Arguably, the more important news
yesterday was not the rate rise but the Bundesbank's decision to leave the
criteria by which it judges M3 money supply unchanged.
As the OECD stated recently, German reunification has brought in its train
certain phenomena that make the M3 targets misleading. This year's 3 1/2 to
5 1/2 per cent M3 growth target may be impossible to meet in any event.
The US dollar quickly lost two pfennigs after the rate rise, plagued by the
6.75 percentage points differential in German and US short-term interest
rates. Yesterday's discount rate rise may not have widened the gap, but
shows that an easing in the differential is a long way off. The US unit
rallied later after Mr Ross Perot withdrew from the US presidential race,
closing at DM1.4745, down from DM1.4775. It ended firmer in New York at
DM1.4787.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: European markets rally as rise is confined
to discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets rose sharply yesterday following the
Bundesbank's decision to raise the discount rate by 0.75 percentage points
to 8.75 per cent, but fell back later in the day as dealers sold into the
rally.
Most markets were braced for a rise in the Lombard rate, which sets German
money market interest rates and would have increased tensions within the
European monetary system.
Although the rise in the discount rate was more vigorous than expected, the
move was seen as unlikely to lead to higher interest rates throughout the
community.
German government paper showed strong gains immediately after the rate rise
was announced. On the London International Financial Futures Exchange, the
September bund future rose from 87.74 at the opening to hit a high of 88.01
before falling back.
During late afternoon the market slid as dealers sold paper into the rally.
The September contract closed at 87.63, down on the day. Volume was strong
at 65,000 contracts.
There was hectic trading at the shorter end of the yield curve as investors
re-assessed the outlook for German interest rates. Bundesbank officials said
the discount rate was unlikely to fall below 8 per cent this year.
Liffe saw record trading volume in its three-month D-Mark interest rate
future.
The Italian Treasury responded to the Bundesbank action by raising its
discount rate. The Belgian authorities also tightened monetary conditions.
Italian government bonds closed slightly higher on the day, with the
benchmark 10-year fixed-rate bond closing on a yield of 13.47 per cent.
The biggest losses were seen in the French market, which rallied in the
morning session as traders speculated that the Bundesbank would leave
monetary conditions unchanged. The benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT maturing 2002
closed down around  1/4 of a point, for a yield of 8.85 per cent.
THE UK government bond market was one of only a few European markets to
retain the best of the day's gains and long-dated gilts closed around 1/3 of
a point higher.
During the morning, the market was encouraged by average earnings statistics
which showed wages growing at an annualised rate of 6.5 per cent during May,
from 7 per cent in April. Analysts said the data suggested soft labour
market conditions were slowing wage growth and suggested an improving
inflation outlook.
The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2008 closed up  9/32 of a point on the day at
96.31, for a yield of 8.86 per cent. However, with shorter maturities the
gains were smaller. The benchmark 10-year stock, the 9 per cent gilt
maturing 2002, closed up  5/32 of a point for a yield of 9.05 per cent.
Short dated stocks were held back by lingering concerns that the UK
government may still be forced to raise interest rates. Interbank money was
last night trading over 10 per cent, the level of base lending rates, from
one month to one year.
However, government officials moved to support sterling in the foreign
exchange markets by repeating the commitment to enter a narrow band within
the European exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of DM2.95.
AFTER posting losses in the morning on news of the rise in German interest
rates and a sharp fall in weekly jobless claims, US Treasury prices bounced
amid short covering and strong demand for longer-dated issues.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104
15/32 , yielding 7.610 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  1/32
at 101 7/16 to carry a yield of 4.208 per cent.
Treasury prices fell early on after the Bundesbank raised its discount rate.
Although the German central bank kept the more important Lombard rate
unchanged, the increase in the discount rate was larger than expected, and
investors sold Treasuries in the wake of a further widening in the
differential between German and US rates and fresh declines in the already
weak dollar.
News of a 15,000 decline in weekly jobless claims added to the gloom, but
during the afternoon dealers covering short positions and buying of
30-years, which have lagged the market recently, brought prices back into
positive territory.
JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly higher overnight in Tokyo,
supported by a stronger yen on the foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark government bond issue No 129 closed the day on a yield of 5.17
per cent, from 5.195 at the opening.
