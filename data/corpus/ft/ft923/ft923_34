FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Kirin forecasts earnings
decrease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, yesterday blamed appraisal losses on
its securities holdings for an unexpectedly poor pre-tax profit forecast of
Y32bn (Dollars 256m) for the first half to end June, down from Y36.9bn last
year.
Sales for the six months are estimated to have risen by 5 per cent to
Y610bn, with beer sales about 4 per cent higher by volume, and demand strong
for its growing range of pharmaceutical products.
However, like many Japanese companies, Kirin has traditionally bolstered
profits through stock sales, and the collapse of Tokyo stock prices has
forced it to book appraisal losses on its short-term holdings of stocks.
Kirin has regained market share over the past year, after having suffered in
a Japanese beer market flooded with new products. The company faces steep
marketing costs for its own new products, and is concerned about the impact
of a mild Japanese summer.
For the full year, Kirin is forecasting sales of Y1,380bn, up from Y1,315bn
last year, and a pre-tax profit of Y87bn, compared with last year's Y86.4bn,
although a downward revision is likely if Tokyo stock prices remain weak.

LOCKHEED, the US defence group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in
second-quarter net earnings, from Dollars 70m to Dollars 77m.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, attributed the gain mainly to higher profits
from programmes in the aeronautical and electronic sectors.
The earnings figure worked through at Dollars 1.24 a share, compared with
Dollars 1.11 last time, on sales which rose from Dollars 2.43bn to Dollars
2.48bn.
For the six months, Lockheed reported net earnings of Dollars 143m, or
Dollars 2.30 a share, compared with Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.96.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hewlett chief retires after 14
years

<TEXT>
MR JOHN YOUNG, president and chief executive of Hewlett- Packard, is to
retire after 14 years at the helm of the US computer and electronics
company. He will be replaced by Mr Lewis Platt, currently HP's executive
vice-president and head of the computer systems division.
Mr Young is leaving HP on a high note. His departure comes as the company is
enjoying an earnings surge that has defied the computer industry slowdown.
For the first half of its fiscal year, HP reported a 44 per cent increase in
earnings on revenues of Dollars 8bn.
Although sooner than expected, Mr Young's retirement had been planned; a
succession committee was formed two years ago to choose the company's third
chief executive. Mr Young succeeded co-founder, Mr David Packard, as
president in 1977 and chief executive in 1978.
'Fifteen years as a chief executive at a Fortune 50 company is a long time.
I believe that organisations can benefit from fresh leadership,' Mr Young
said yesterday.
'It is time to move on. During my tenure, HP has gone from a Dollars 1.3bn
company that was mostly in measurement and test instruments and hand held
calculators, to become what will this year probably be more than Dollars
16bn in revenues, with 70 per cent in computers and almost 60 per cent
outside the United States.'
Mr Young's successor, Mr Lewis Platt, had been seen as one of two favourites
for the position. The other, Mr Richard Hackborn, remains executive
vice-president in charge of HP's computer products organisation.
Mr Platt, 51, has been at HP for 26 years in a variety of positions. Most
recently, he headed HP's computer systems group. In recent years he has
played a key role in HP's growth in the workstation and multi-user computer
markets.
Also announcing his retirement plans yesterday was Mr Dean Morton, HP chief
operating officer. No successor was named to this position. Mr Young and Mr
Morton are retiring under the company's officer early retirement policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS from the gold operations of Anglo American, the world's largest
producer, dropped by 18 per cent during the June quarter following lower
contributions from Freegold and Western Deep Levels.
Although gold production rose fractionally to 63,799kg from 63,490kg the
previous quarter, total working costs were 2.6 per cent higher at R1.72bn
(Dollars 628m) compared with R1.67bn last year. The average rand gold price
received was 2.2 per cent lower at R32,749 per kg compared with R33,483 per
kg. Profit after capital expenditure fell 17.7 per cent to R137.4m from
R167m last year.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division, said the main
issue facing the group was to deal with problems at Western Deep Levels
where a string of mine accidents claimed 46 lives this year, disrupting
production and sapping the morale of the workforce.
Available profits at the mine dropped by 35 per cent to R10.9m from R16.8m
last quarter and R30.1m in the June quarter last year.
Although monthly gold production improved steadily - quarterly production
was 1.1 per cent up at 9,096kg over the March figure - the catalogue of
accidents meant the mine was still some way off good health. Gold production
in the June quarter last year was 10,430kg.
The other mine to suffer a significant fall in profits was Freegold where
available profits dropped to R61.8m from R81.7m.
Available profits at Vaal Reefs were unchanged at R48.6m. Elandsrand lifted
production by 11.6 per cent to 4,852kg from 4,104kg while profits at Ergo
dropped to R5.1m from R7.5m.

<TEXT>
WATAKYU Kensetsu, a Tokyo-based builder of apartments and office buildings
with outstanding debts of Y145bn (Dollars 1.16bn), admitted yesterday to
missing two payment deadlines, but still hoped to avoid collapse.
The company blamed the non-payment on unsuccessful dealings with a non-bank
financial institution.
However, Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research agency, said that Watakyu's
banks had cut credit lines and that the company was virtually insolvent.
Watakyu admitted that a sluggish property market and heavy interest burdens
had weakened the company, which has a Y140bn condominium complex under
construction in Niigata, central Japan.
The company, founded in 1973, said the Niigata project would go ahead if its
banks and other creditors provided the necessary finance.
Watakyu's difficulties are typical of those facing small and medium size
developers which have expanded from traditional niche markets in apartments
to building large resorts or apartment complexes.
A glut of apartments has forced prices down by 50 per cent over the past two
years in some areas, and developers complain they are under pressure because
purchasers have failed to meet their payment deadlines.

THE US subsidiary of Daiwa Securities, the Japanese broking house, confirmed
yesterday that it was negotiating a settlement with US government regulators
investigating the firm's role in attempts by Salomon Brothers to rig
Treasury bond auctions between 1989 and 1991.
Daiwa revealed that it was co-operating with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), the securities industry watchdog, in a separate
investigation into whether US subsidiaries of Japanese broking houses were
involved in reimbursing favoured customers for trading losses.
Last year, regulators in Japan temporarily suspended Daiwa for its loss
reimbursement practices.
The talks between the SEC and Daiwa revolve around the Japanese firm's
involvement in helping Salomon exceed government limits in a 1989 auction of
Treasury bills.
The complaint against Salomon filed by the SEC earlier this year described
how a dealer at another firm - now known to be Daiwa - handed over to
Salomon Dollars 3bn in Treasury bills that he had secretly bought at the
request of the US firm's chief bond trader.

MACMILLAN BLOEDEL, 49 per cent owned by Noranda Forest, Canada's biggest
forest products group, warned that British Columbia's five-week-old
pulp-and-paper strike could curtail its sawmill and logging operations.
This would have a heavy financial impact on Macmillan's third quarter, said
Mr Robert Findlay, president. Macmillan is a large timber exporter to the
US, Asia and Europe.
'The impact of the strike was not significant in the second quarter, but the
short-term outlook depends directly on the length of the strike,' he said.
Two unions representing 13,000 pulp-and-paper mill workers have shut down 19
British Columbia mills, including most of Macmillan's operations. Chips are
piling up at sawmills across British Columbia, threatening timber production
cuts.
Macmillan reported a first-half loss of CDollars 18.1m (USDollars 15m), or
20 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.5m, or 13 cents, a year
earlier. Sales were CDollars 1.49bn against Dollars 1.4bn. Second-quarter
loss equalled 8 cents a share, against a loss of 13 cents a year earlier, on
sales of CDollars 775m against CDollars 728m.
Pulp prices improved but newsprint remained weak.

THE New York Times nearly trebled second-quarter net earnings to Dollars
15.2m, on increased advertising revenues and lower newsprint costs, writes
Alan Friedman.
Earnings per share were 19 cents, against 6 cents in the second quarter of
last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 448m, against Dollars
440.4m in the same period of 1991.
For the first six months of 1992 the newspaper group's net income was
Dollars 29.2m, against Dollars 10.5m in the first half of last year.
Revenues for the six-month period were Dollars 888.5m against Dollars 857.3m
in the first half of 1991.
The second-quarter results were affected by an Dollars 11m pre-tax charge
relating to labour disruptions. But the second quarter of last year was
affected by a Dollars 20m pre-tax charge from a voluntary early retirement
programme.
With the special charges stripped out of the 1991 and 1992 second quarters
the earnings per share would be 27 cents in the period ended last month,
against 21 cents a year ago.

GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products company, saw after-tax
profits rise by almost one fifth in the second quarter of 1992, to Dollars
120.5m. A year earlier, the company had reported Dollars 101.8m, writes

The net profits total was scored on sales of Dollars 1.2bn, against Dollars

Dollars 249.9m, compared with Dollars 209m.
Gillette said its main blades and razors business made significant sales and
profits gains year-on-year, largely due to the success of the company's
Sensor shaving system.
In toiletries and cosmetics, second-quarter sales increased slightly, but
profits were well below last year's levels.

APPLE Computer, the personal computer manufacturer, yesterday reported
third-quarter net income of Dollars 132m and claimed strong sales momentum,
despite the fierce competition wracking the PC sector.
The income figure, which worked through at Dollars 1.07 a share, compared
with a net loss of Dollars 53m or 44 cents a share, in the third quarter of
last year when the group took a Dollars 224m pre-tax charge for
restructuring.
Sales in the latest quarter rose 13.8 per cent to Dollars 1.74bn, against
Dollars 1.52bn a year ago.
The gross margin was 44.3 per cent of sales, down from the 45.8 per cent of
a year ago, but an improvement over the second quarter of this year, thanks
to a better product mix.
Mr John Sculley, the chairman, said the company's new PowerBook laptop had
sold over 300,000 units in the last three quarters and Apple expected to
reach its Dollars 1bn sale target in the computer's first year of
introduction.
For the nine months the company reported net income of Dollars 432m, or
Dollars 3.52 a share, against Dollars 228.6m, or Dollars 1.91 a share, in
the same period of 1991, with revenues rising from Dollars 4.8bn to Dollars
5.32bn.

GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that was acquired in
1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday said its second-quarter net
earnings slumped by 70 per cent, to Dollars 3.4m.
Earnings per share were 3 cents, against 10 cents a year ago. Revenues at
Genentech rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 136m.
Mr Kirk Raab, chief executive, said the earnings decrease stemmed primarily
from the company's heavy research and development spending. R &amp; D
expenditures in the second quarter were Dollars 73.3m, more than half of the
company's quarterly revenues. R &amp; D spending totalled Dollars 52.9m in the
same period of 1991.
Genentech said its sales of Protropin, a human growth hormone, increased by
8 per cent to Dollars 50.4m year-on-year.
Sales of Activase, a genetically engineered heart attack drug, declined from
Dollars 50.4m to Dollars 44.6m because there were no bulk sales to
Genentech's Japanese licensees in the second quarter.
On Wall Street, Genentech's stock price closed Dollars 1 higher at Dollars

TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday showed
a solid advance in its second-quarter operating earnings, but incurred a
Dollars 147m loss after the payment of dividends on preferred stock. The
stock was issued at the time of the 1989 merger of Time and Warner.
The Dollars 147m after-dividend loss was down from a Dollars 179m deficit a
year ago. The loss per share was reduced to Dollars 1.59 from Dollars 3.10 a
year ago.
Group revenues in the quarter rose 8.6 per cent year-on-year, to Dollars
3.1bn.
The board declared a four-for-one common stock split and a quarterly
dividend increased by 12 per cent.
After the split, the company will have about 370m shares outstanding and the
post-split dividend will be 28 cents a share annually or 7 cents per
quarter.
Time Warner's operating income before depreciation and amortisation was
Dollars 612m, against Dollars 551m a year ago.
The strongest divisional performers were the cable business, with a record
Dollars 244m against Dollars 220m last time, and music, which earned Dollars
126m, against Dollars 116m a year ago.
The group's Hollywood studio also turned in a record Dollars 101m operating
profit, up from Dollars 85m. This was attributable to heavy box office
receipts from films such a Batman Returns and Lethal Weapon III.
Advertising and circulation gains at Time and People magazines helped the
publishing division to earn Dollars 88m, compared with Dollars 79m a year
ago.
The Home Box Office cable programming business made Dollars 53m, up slightly
from Dollars 51m in the same period of 1991.
Time Warner said its net income for the second quarter was Dollars 9m,
compared with a Dollars 32m loss in the second quarter of last year. Some
analysts, however, say this is a misleading figure because the group's real
bottom line is its performance after dividend payments.
On Wall Street, the Time Warner share price was down by 1 3/8 at Dollars 116
1/4 .
McGraw-Hill, the media group that owns Business Week magazine, disclosed a
10.7 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 38.6m.
Earnings per share were 79 cents against 71 cents a year ago.
Revenues for the three months to June 30 grew 6 per cent to Dollars 484.3m.

WASTE Management, the US waste disposal group, yesterday reported an 11 per
cent improvement in underlying second-quarter net income, to Dollars 213.8m,
or 43 cents a share, from Dollars 193m, or 39 cents, a year earlier.
Earnings in both years were distorted by special items which brought
reported 1992 second-quarter net income to Dollars 329.5m, or 66 cents,
compared with Dollars 206.9m, or 42 cents, last year.
The latest quarter included an extraordinary gain of 23 cents a share. A
year earlier, net earnings included one-time gains of about 3 cents a share.
Revenues rose to Dollars 2.18bn from Dollars 1.88bn.
For the first half, Waste Management had net income of Dollars 450m, or 91
cents, on revenues of Dollars 4.2bn, compared with earnings of Dollars
372.6m, or 76 cents, on revenues of Dollars 3.63bn in the first six months
of 1991.
Stripping out one-time items, the company said its first-half net earnings
rose 13 per cent to Dollars 405.9m, or 82 cents, from Dollars 358.6m or 73
cents.
A subsidiary of Waste Management, the large US waste disposal group, was
indicted yesterday by a grand jury in Santa Clara country in California on
grand theft charges.
The company, whose disposal methods have been attacked by the Greenpeace
environmental group, could be fined up to Dollars 20,000 in addition to
other penalties. The indictment centres on a contract with the city of San
Jose. It alleges the subsidiary dumped waste, which did not originate in San
Jose, in a competitor's landfill and later charged the city for the
disposal.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has again reported record
quarterly earnings thanks to rising output at its flagship Goldstrike mine
in Nevada, lower costs, and an active hedging policy.
Net second-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 36.8m, or 26 cents a share,
from Dollars 24.6m, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose to Dollars 115.5m from Dollars 90.2m.
Half-year earnings jumped to Dollars 59.9m, or 42 cents a share, from
Dollars 40.2m, or 30 cents.
Second-quarter output from Barrick's five mines in the US and Canada climbed
by 45 per cent to 292,700 ounces. Goldstrike's production jumped by 68 per
cent to 238,300 ounces. Output at three of the four other mines dropped, but
Mr Robert Smith, president, said the company is in 'an excellent position'
to meet its 1992 production target of 1.2m ounces.
Cash costs dropped to Dollars 229 per ounce from Dollars 277 per ounce,
thanks largely to the higher production at Goldstrike.
Barrick's practice of hedging a large chunk of its output resulted in an
average gold price for the quarter of Dollars 422 per ounce, compared with
the average Comex price of Dollars 345.

red

<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, suffered a
second-quarter loss of Dollars 53m, or 52 cents per share. The group was hit
by a drop in sales and the effects of a prolonged strike.
The poor results for the period ending June 30 were the company's sixth
consecutive quarterly loss. In the same period last year, it lost Dollars
17m, or 16 cents per share.
Total sales fell to Dollars 2.6bn, a drop of Dollars 91m, or 3 per cent,
from last year.
Slightly higher prices were only able to partly offset a 9 per cent decline
in sales volume. Non-US sales plummeted 13 per cent and the bulk of the fall
was in recession-hit Europe.
The company said that the five-month strike by 12,600 members of the United
Auto Workers Union had resulted in many sales being delayed beyond the
second quarter.
In addition, when workers returned in April after their strike was broken,
there were 'some inefficiencies' as production restarted, according to Mr
Len Kuchan, company treasurer.
The UAW, which is still negotiating a contract agreement with the company,
is waging its battle with management by encouraging members to do no more
than required on their jobs.
Before the strike, Caterpillar workers had frequently participated in
co-operation schemes to improve production and cut costs.
For the first six months, losses were Dollars 185m, or Dollars 1.83 per
share, compared with losses of Dollars 49m, or 48 cents per share, last
year.
Sales and revenues were Dollars 4.61bn, Dollars 582m lower than the same
period last year.
But the company believes it can return to profitability during the second
half.
While markets in Europe and Japan are very weak, it said that mild economic
growth in North America will help sales and that sales delayed by the strike
will be completed.
In addition, the company said it expected to raise prices 1.5 per cent and
2.5 per cent on parts and machinery, respectively.
Price rises, however, had to be implemented 'very gingerly, very
cautiously,' said Mr Kuchan, because 'markets are still weak'.
Europe is the company's main concern regarding its foreign sales, which
represented just 54 per cent of total sales during the second quarter,
compared with 59 per cent a year ago.
'We don't know when (European) markets will come back,' Mr Kuchan said.
Brazilian operations also continue to be unprofitable because of economic
conditions in that country.
Redundancy programmes to reduce its European workforce were being
implemented and the company said that it still intended to proceed with an
overall reduction in US jobs by some 1,300.
That was the number it discovered that could be pared from its US workforce
during the strike. It said that it is making the cuts through attrition.
Caterpillar's new joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to design,
produce and distribute lift trucks is also absorbing some excess management
employees.
The joint venture, known as Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift, began
operations July 1. It is 80 per cent held by MHI and 20 per cent by
Caterpillar.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Battle for Germany's domestic
skies - Lufthansa's challenge to BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways' efforts to stay in the lucrative German domestic airline
market are being challenged by Lufthansa, which is set to launch a budget
rival airline.
At the centre of the battle is the custom of high-spending business
passengers in Europe's biggest country.
BA ran air services between Berlin and west Germany throughout the cold war
following the allies' occupation.
German reunification in 1989 ended this special status. As a foreign-owned
airline, it is being forced to close its international service by 1994.
However, last month's agreement in Brussels to deregulate European air
travel may eventually allow foreign carriers to operate within Germany.
BA has determined to keep a strong presence in Germany. It found financial
backing from a consortium of German banks for its plan to form a German
airline, Deutsche BA. The banks hold 51 per cent of Deutsche BA so that it
qualifies as a German airline.
The consortium bought Delta Air, a regional airline in Friedrichshafen which
was fully absorbed into Deutsche BA. Through the takeover, BA and its new
partners gained control of one of the lowest-cost German carriers. It breaks
even with only half its seats filled.
Last month it inaugurated its Berlin-Munich and Berlin-Stuttgart routes
using three new leased Boeing 737/300s. Delta's old fleet of Saab 340s
serves 19 other European destinations.
Berlin-Dusseldorf and Berlin-Cologne/Bonn will be added this autumn when BA
winds down its old German service, well ahead of schedule.
Mr Gerd Leidinger, Deutsche BA's spokesman, said that by next year London,
Paris, Zurich, Spain and Italy would be served. Once long-range aircraft
were available, the new airline would also fly to North America and the Far
East from Munich and Berlin. By the end of March 1993, the first trading
year, the new airline plans DM200m (Dollars 131.5m) in ticket sales.
Mr Leidinger said that while Deutsche BA was a low-cost carrier it was not a
'low-price' one and would charge the same fares as Lufthansa. 'Our
difference will be in product and service,' he said. Meals would be served
for the first time on all routes.
Since cutting costs was a priority, it was made clear from the start that
personnel would not be hired directly from BA's high-cost internal German
service.
Advertisements were run in German newspapers and out of 180 BA cabin staff
only five stewardesses applied and were hired by Deutsche BA.
Some 240 of BA's staff in Berlin were made redundant, although BA will
continue to employ more than 700 people in Germany because of a passenger
handling contract it signed with Deutsche BA.
Wages of Deutsche BA's pilots and stewardesses are a notch below those paid
even by Sudflug, a low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa's Condor charter
airline, according to Mr Leidinger.
Lufthansa, the German loss-making state-controlled carrier, is responding by
putting its domestic services into a new airline, Lufthansa Express, from
November. Lufthansa Express will be a separate profit centre and may
eventually be formed into a separate company.
At first, it will take over the most heavily used Lufthansa routes and then
the parent airline's entire domestic service by next April, using 65 to 70
aircraft.
Lufthansa said that the airline hoped to achieve significant cost savings to
eliminate the DM350m loss last year on the German domestic service.
Staff costs are to be cut by offering Lufthansa personnel, who face a wave
of redundancies in the near future, jobs for less pay with the new airline.
Aircraft and crews will always return to their home base at the end of the
day, cutting out accommodation costs.
And quick check-in procedures, tight controls on costly delays and the use
of flexible pricing are all being tried to help make Lufthansa Express a
lean and hungry division of its still-lumbering parent.

charge of 32.9 per cent (34.5 per cent). The final dividend is 4.5p and
lifts the total by 20 per cent to 6p (5p).

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 7% annual rise puts Druck at Pounds 4.69m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Druck Holdings, the manufacturer of electronic pressure measuring devices,
showed a 7 per cent increase in annual profits, although it suffered a
slowdown in the second half.
For the year to March 31 pre-tax profit came to Pounds 4.69m. Last time the
trading period covered nine months and produced Pounds 3.03m; the annualised
figure was Pounds 4.39m.
On a similar basis turnover was Pounds 27.3m, Pounds 17.1m and Pounds 22.4m.
Earnings worked through at 46.5p, 29.6p and 42.5p, while the final dividend
is 6p for a total of 9.4p, compared with 6.6p actual and 8.8p annual.
Invoiced sales in the UK rose by 39 per cent and exports, accounting for 68
per cent of turnover, showed a 15 per cent increase. After a good first half
orders in the second six months slowed down, and the forward order book
showed a slight decrease.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brasway benefiting from cost reductions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consolidating the recovery shown at the interim stage, Brasway produced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m for the 53 weeks to May 2.
That compared to Pounds 513,000 reported last time, although that has been
restated to a loss of Pounds 892,000 after moving reorganisation costs to
trading, rather than extraordinary, charges.
Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, said the encouraging performance reflected
concentration on cost reduction programmes, efficiency improvements and
gains in market share during a period of weak demand.
Turnover decreased by only 1 per cent to Pounds 33.9m. That generated an
operating profit of Pounds 1.81m against Pounds 1.21m, or a restated loss of
Pounds 194,000.
Mr Swaby believed there was growth potential in existing businesses and
instead of looking for new operational legs to enhance profitability they
would be developed.
Earnings per share were 1.15p (losses 0.73p restated). The final dividend is
0.34p for a total of 0.58p (0.51p).

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Norbain Electronics advances by 11%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having completed its restructuring, Norbain Electronics is benefiting from
its clear focus on the security sector, said Mr John Nicol, chairman.
That market continued to offer substantial opportunities for growth in the
UK and Europe, he added.
Reporting for the year to April 30, the first in which sales had been solely
in security, he said turnover from that business rose 5 per cent to Pounds
12.8m, while last year's Pounds 14.5m included the disposed technology
division.
Pre-tax profit was up 11 per cent to Pounds 502,000 (Pounds 451,000) and in
the current year trading was ahead of the comparable period in 1991, said Mr
Nicol.
The group had further improved its position as the leading distributor of
industrial CCTV and access control equipment in the UK by the recent
addition of new products.
Gross profit margin fell following the disposal, but the margin for the
security business was maintained.
Earnings per share were 4.95p (4.1p). The dividend is raised from 0.7p to
1p.

<TEXT>
Against a background of 'the most severe recession for over 60 years'
Christie Group, the specialist business agency, reported reduced pre-tax
losses of Pounds 889,000 for the year to March 31.
The result, which compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.61m last time, was
achieved on turnover down from Pounds 19.4m to Pounds 17.3m and was struck
after a depreciation charge increased fromPounds 876,000 to Pounds 891,000.
Directors said the company's strategy continued to be one of supporting its
core businesses, while a close watch had been kept on the balance sheet and
cash position.
After an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.62m, representing the loss on
disposal of the US subsidiary, the attributable loss was Pounds 3.47m
(Pounds 1.85m).
Losses per share were reduced to 3.64p (7.94p).

PRE-TAX profits of Jones Stroud (Holdings), the manufacturer of accessories
and materials for the textiles and electrical industries, advanced by Pounds
341,000 to Pounds 4.83m in the year to March 31.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 60.4m to Pounds 65.4m
and after a net interest charge of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 23,000) and
exceptional costs of Pounds 609,000 arising from factory closures.
Directors said the reorganisation necessitated by the continuing recession
had been completed and further factory closures were not expected.
There were few signs of any improvement in trading conditions, they added,
but action to contain costs should enable profits to be maintained at
current levels.
The final dividend is again 5p, maintaining the total at 8p, more than twice
covered by earnings per share of 18.05p (16.42p).

BUTTE MINING is to pass the preference dividend due at the end of July.
The company said payment 'would not at the present time be prudent' in light
of circumstances surrounding its litigation against more than 70 former

However, these operations were now progressing well, the company said.
The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into Butte and

Butte said yesterday it welcomed the inquiry into 'matters which are the

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: National Home Loans reports losses of
Pounds 85.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans, the mortgage lender that restructured Pounds 540m of
debt with its banks last month, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
85.9m, much higher than expected.
The loss included a Pounds 79.4m loss provision, Pounds 52m of which related
to National Mortgage Bank, its banking subsidiary which is being run down
and is now held in NHL's books at nil value.
As expected, no dividend has been declared on ordinary shares and payment of
the convertible preference shares has been passed. The shares are priced at
2 1/4 p.
Mr Jonathan Perry, the executive chairman who took over in February, said
the group was now focused entirely on housing finance. Any chance of
recovering value for shareholders remained dependent on an improvement in
the housing market and in particular on cutting the number of accounts in
arrears. 'If we deal with the arrears problem successfully then we can see
the possibility of stemming losses and getting back into profits,' Mr Perry
said.
Some Pounds 20m of provisions reflected non-payment of current interest on
mortgages in arrears to National Home Loans Corporation. Staff are making
more than 30,000 telephone calls a month to try to reduce these arrears,
apparently with some success.
While many home owners were falling further behind in payments, the number
of hard-core accounts in arrears for more than three months has fallen by 10
per cent to 7,461 since its peak in February. Another Pounds 28m of
provisions covered additional specific and general provisions stemming from
continued deterioration in the housing market. There may be a need for
another increase in the general provision because of a further
deterioration.
The group also suffered a sharp fall in net interest income, from Pounds
25.7m to Pounds 6.4m.

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Pilkington, the glass group, fell 11p to 96p yesterday, following
a 6p fall on Wednesday, as stockbrokers anticipated a gloomy statement from
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, at next week's annual meeting.
One said: 'We are looking for a grim statement, life is extremely tough for
Pilkington.' The group cut its dividend in June when it reported profits of
Pounds 77m for the year to end-March, after exceptional costs of Pounds 37m,
down from Pounds 151.6m the previous year.
The shares have not been this low since the end of 1985, before BTR bid for
the group in 1986 at a price equivalent to 180.6p. Pilkington's shares have
fallen from a peak this year of 164p in May.
A number of analysts have downgraded forecasts for the company's
current-year results.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kewill Systems falls to Pounds 2.42m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KEWILL SYSTEMS, the USM-quoted computing services company, yesterday
reported reduced full-year profits and announced plans to raise some Pounds
2.7m via a subscription for shares by a Guernsey-based unit trust.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March fell from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds
2.42m, on increased turnover of Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 31.3m). Profits were
struck after higher administrative expenses of Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 16.8m)
and a net interest charge up from Pounds 358,000 to Pounds 700,000.
Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said that trading losses of Weigang had forced
the company to make full provision in the balance sheet against the carrying
value of its investment, leaving a negative balance on distributable
reserves and meaning a dividend could not be paid. Last year there was a 5p
pay-out.
The board intends to apply to the courts for a reduction of capital to help
eliminate this deficit, enabling a distribution in the current year.
To strengthen the balance sheet and reduce gearing Kewill plans to raise a
net Pounds 2.7m through a subscription for 2.42m shares by The Causeway
Smaller Quoted Companies Fund, at 125p a share.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hampson shows 20% fall to Pounds 4m but
holds pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMPSON INDUSTRIES, the precision engineering, aluminium refining and home
products group, saw annual profits drop nearly 20 per cent but had reached
the 'nadir of its fortunes' according to Mr John Wardle, chairman.
On turnover of Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 78.5m), pre-tax profits for the year to
end-March were Pounds 4.06m (Pounds 5.04m) - higher than market expectations
and helped by a seasonally favourable second half. At halfway the West
Midlands-based group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.62m.
Mr Wardle said profits would not decline further in the current year and the
dividend, maintained at 2.373p via a same-again final of 1.773p, would not
be cut. Earnings per share were 3.65p, against 4.55p last time.
Trading conditions in the current year have not improved and Mr Wardle made
clear 'the recession is very firmly with us.' The experience of April, when
pressure on margins was relieved, has not been repeated.
Mr Wardle's expectation that current year profits will increase is partially
based on the fact that in 1991-92 loss-making subsidiaries in the printing,
printing machinery and packaging sectors have either been eliminated or
sold.
With the exception of the carrying cost of some residual borrowings of the
Kenmart operation, consequent charges have been absorbed in the latest
figures.

QUALITY CARE Homes, a north-east England-based company which owns and
operates nursing homes for the elderly, yesterday placed 3.6m shares at 136p
raising Pounds 4.05m.
Most of the shares were taken up by institutions.
The company, until now entirely owned by founder and managing director Mr
Duncan Bannatyne and his family, has applied to join the main market.
Dealings are due to start on Thursday.
The placing comprises 27.2 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital and
gives the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 18m.
It is forecasting pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 1.75m in the year
to end-October. In the first six months turnover was Pounds 2.77m, against
Pounds 3.32m in the full year to end-October 1991.
The company has has 11 freehold nursing homes.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Digital Equipment founder to hand over presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Olsen, the founder of Digital Equipment, the US computer maker,
is to retire at the end of October. He is to be replaced as president and
chief executive at Digital by Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's vice-president of
manufacturing and logistics.
A pioneer of the computer industry, Mr Olsen, aged 66, played a large role
in the emergence of the minicomputer revolution of the 1970s. 'I've had a
long and satisfying career at Digital and it's time for the next generation
of management to assume leadership,' he said.
Mr Olsen's departure marks the end of an era in the computer industry. He is
the last of a generation of founders of minicomputer companies, which had an
impact in the computer industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the past few
years, however, Digital and other minicomputer companies, have taken the
full brunt of wide-scale changes in the computer industry brought on by the
introduction of low-cost personal computers and workstations.
Industry analysts have viewed Mr Olsen's departure as overdue. There has
also been broad discontent among senior executives at Digital who believe
the company missed its chances in workstations and open systems. Many felt
that this was in large measure because of Mr Olsen's reluctance to accept
fundamental changes in the industry.
However, Mr Olsen's achievements have won him great respect and a key place
in the history of the computer industry. He was one of the first in the
industry to recognise the potential of semiconductor integrated circuits
which could carry out many of the functions of a mainframe computer at a
fraction of the cost.
Mr Olsen founded Digital in 1957 and has been its only chief executive
officer.
His successor, Mr Palmer, said yesterday that Mr Olsen was a computer
industry pioneer and an architect of innovation. 'His vision of interactive
and distributed computing has been revolutionary.'
Mr Palmer joined Digital in 1985. Previously he was one of the founders of
Mostek, a semiconductor maker acquired by United Technologies in 1980.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Israel and Egypt set to hold first summit for six years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and Egypt appear set to hold their first summit in six years
following the announcement in Tel Aviv yesterday that the newly elected
Labour government was temporarily freezing funds for settlements in the
occupied Arab territories.
The government yesterday blocked the signing of any new building contracts
for Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, prompting an immediate
response from Egypt, which said it cleared the way for a summit meeting
between president Hosni Mubarak and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Officials said the two leaders may meet in Cairo next week, after Mr James
Baker, the US secretary of state, visits Israel at the start of a
five-nation regional trip to relaunch Middle East peace talks.
Egyptian and Israeli leaders last met in Alexandria in 1986 when Mr Mubarak
received Israeli prime minister Mr Shimon Peres to discuss faltering steps
towards Middle East peace.
Mr Mubarak refused to meet Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Mr Rabin's predecessor,
because he believed the Likud party leader was not seriously committed to
the peace process.
Mr Shamir rejected Arab and US demands for a freeze on settlements. Mr
Rabin, whose Labour party defeated Likud in last month's general election,
has refused to freeze all settlements, but is committed to significant curbs
on their expansion in the hope of winning US government loan guarantees and
facilitating peace negotiations.
Although warmly greeted by Egypt, yesterday's move was in effect an interim
step which will curry favour with the US ahead of Mr Baker's visit, but
which does not have the status of final policy. It will help buy time for Mr
Rabin to sound out how far Washington expects him to go as a condition for
the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) loan guarantee request blocked because of Mr
Shamir's stance.
Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the new housing minister, said he had frozen for a
week all pending contracts for new buildings while he and Mr Avraham
Shochat, the finance minister, reviewed overall housing policy and,
specifically, government spending in the occupied territories.
Mr Ben-Eliezer said the legal implications of stopping state-backed
settlement building already under way would also be examined, adding that
those who believed settlers' plans to double their numbers to 200,000 would
be allowed to occur 'do not understand the issue'.
Furious settlers accused Mr Ben-Eliezer of declaring war on the settlements.
'I am certainly not their enemy,' the former general responded. 'However, if
war is declared then I am good at it too.'
King Hussein of Jordan meanwhile travelled to Damascus yesterday for talks
with President Hafez al-Assad ahead of Mr Baker's arrival in the region.
Syria has expressed scepticism over Mr Rabin's peace overtures and is
concerned about his plans to concentrate on negotiations over the West Bank
and Gaza, ahead of Syria's demand to reclaim the Golan Heights it lost to
Israel in the 1967 Six Day war.
The Israeli army yesterday continued to lay siege to 3,000 Palestinians who
refused to leave an-Najah university campus in the West Bank town of Nablus
unless the troops dropped plans to vet the students for alleged gunmen. The
US called on both sides to resolve the three-day-old incident peacefully.

FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many good ideas, the share swap proposed for the Wellcome sale is so
obvious that one wonders why it was not thought of before. By taking
something over Pounds 500m of stock for Wellcome shares, the Trust will
reduce its dealing costs and will instantly acquire a UK equity portfolio
without carrying the market risk of being in cash while building it up. At
the same time, other fund managers will be galvanised by the prospect of
unloading awkward bundles of stock at mid-market prices, although it will
doubtless be the job of BZW on the Trust's behalf to frustrate them.
The effect on market stability should be minor, if positive. The UK part of
the sale was always likely to be an intra-market affair, with institutions
selling equities to buy Wellcome and the Trust then buying equities with the
proceeds. The main losers are BZW's rivals, who will see none of the
business. But that is competitive broking for you.

FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group's re-emergence this morning as a quoted company will take
careful watching. On the one hand, there will doubtless be something of a
scramble as trapped punters head for the exit. On the other, it should be
recalled that the Mirror is worth a good deal less to the portfolio investor
than it would be to an industrial owner. For the investor, the prospect is
of zero income for at least two more years and an uncertain dividend stream
thereafter. For the owner, the promise is of direct access to a torrent of
cash flow by the mid-decade.
Much depends, of course, on interested parties having a clear picture by now
of the Mirror's liabilities, or convincing their bankers they have. But
anyone aiming to bid the administrator for his 54 per cent controlling stake
will already have a price ready on the back of an envelope. If the shares
drop well below that in early dealings, what could be more sensible than to
pick up a few?
Certainly, if Mirror shareholders had to fall back on conventional
yardsticks such as earnings multiples and yield they would have little to
hope for. Current year earnings per share might be 4p at best. Even a price
of 50p would thus represent a multiple of 12.5 times, which in combination
with a prospective yield of zero is scarcely compelling. The Telegraph, for
instance, was trading yesterday on a historic multiple of 11.6 times and a
historic yield of 4.1 per cent.
But the alternative view is neatly illustrated by a sum from the Mirror's
new broker, Warburg. At 50p, the Mirror would be selling on a multiple of
last year's net cash flow - adjusted for extra pension costs - of 1.8 times.
The corresponding figure for The Telegraph is 10.8 times. For an industrial
buyer, the appeal is obvious. For the Mirror shareholder, the implication is
obvious as well: if the shares fall to 50p, do not sell.

FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilts market could afford to shrug off June's initially forbidding PSBR
figure of Pounds 4.2bn. Though the small print reveals a large jump in
government spending, this may well have to do with the timing of payments to
local authorities. There are no immediate grounds for further upward
revision of expectations for the PSBR over 1992-93 as a whole. Besides, the
market is between auctions, so it is free to concentrate on the better news
on inflation.
The latest such item is May's half-point fall to an annual rate of 6.5 per
cent in average earnings growth. At long last, the high settlements of early
1991 seem to be dropping out of the equation, so earnings growth should
continue to fall significantly between now and the end of the year. The 2.8
per cent annual rise in manufacturing unit labour costs over the three
months to May is even more positive evidence of an ability to keep up with
other European countries.
In other circumstances that might be grounds for expecting lower interest
rates. While ERM membership makes this impossible, the UK economy seems
condemned to suffer disinflation without enjoying the benefits of growth.
That is a combination which continues to bode badly for equities as much as
it is an encouragement to gilts.

FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: In the Bundesbunker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's mid-year review of its monetary targets was always going to
be tense. With money supply growth more than 3 percentage points above its
target ceiling, it urgently needed to reassert its credibility. Insofar as
the council members care about the ERM at all, this had to be done without
blowing it apart, along with hopes for European monetary union. The 0.75
point rise in the discount rate to 8.75 per cent serves both purposes for
the time being. All the same, there should be little premature rejoicing
from those in the UK who had been worrying about a move requiring base rates
to rise in sympathy.
Since the German banking system has only limited entitlement to borrow under
the Bundesbank's discount facility, yesterday's rate increase will have a
correspondingly small impact on the money market. Interest differentials
with other European currencies remain largely unaffected. The move is more
intended as an unequivocal signal of the Bundesbank's determination to curb
credit expansion, however long it takes. That may explain why European
equity markets registered the greatest disappointment. They have been slow
to accept the economic implications for national economies of German rates
staying high for the balance of the year.
The UK looks particularly boxed in, especially after yesterday's bold rate
increase by Italy. The risk is that sterling will remain weak while the
recovery fails to materialise and political pressures mount, particularly
around the party conference season in September. More worrying still is the
thought that the Bundesbank can hardly have been making an idle threat. It
has long established a pattern for discount rate rises to be followed fairly
shortly by an increase in the more important Lombard rate. The differential
between the two rates is also unusually narrow at 1 percentage point. The
Bundesbank may simply be battening down the hatches for the long haul. But
if credit demand does not slow reasonably soon, the markets will have
grounds for worry that its next move may not be so innocuous.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Canary Wharf tenants warn Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTIVE tenants of Canary Wharf are warning Mr John Major that unless
the Jubilee underground railway line is extended into east London they will
reconsider their decision to move to Docklands.
In letters to the prime minister, present and prospective tenants of the
east London development, which is in administration under UK insolvency
procedures, urge Mr Major to take action in helping to finance the extension
of the Jubilee line.
The tenants want the government to take advantage of the offer from the
Canary Wharf administrators to finance a private sector contribution for the
line by selling a building to the government.
In the Commons yesterday, Steven Norris, minister for transport in the
capital, said construction could not start until the eventual owners of
Canary Wharf pledged to pay their contribution. 'We see no prospect of
authorising the start of construction unless, and until, that contribution
is assured,' he told MPs.
The tenants, including the US oil company Texaco and investment banks Credit
Suisse First Boston and Bear Stearns, said they opted for Canary Wharf on
the understanding that the government was committed to regenerating London's
Docklands, but now feared the area was trapped in a downward spiral.
Before signing up for Canary Wharf, they had each been shown a letter from
the chief executive of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the
official body in charge of redeveloping the area, promising that Docklands
would 'become the most accessible location in the central London area by
1992'.
Docklands is now perceived as completely inaccessible, they said.
Additional pressure to build the Jubilee extension come from a coalition of
Docklands businesses and community representatives who sent Mr Major a
petition backing the line.
On Wednesday, government ministers and advisers - including Mr John Wakeham,
lord privy seal, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury - are
due to meet to evaluate the Canary Wharf offer.
The environment department needs 350,000 sq ft to relocate the bulk of its
civil servants and is considering three Docklands sites, including Canary
Wharf.
The proposal to sell the government a Canary Wharf building has broad
ministerial support, although the Treasury is sceptical. An official there
said the development had to demonstrate that it offered value for money.
The administrators have told the government that if it wants to rent rather
than buy, Canary Wharf could still contribute to the Jubilee line extension
by raising new loan finance on any government-rented building.
The 11 banks which have lent Pounds 576m to finance the development of
Canary Wharf met yesterday to evaluate this rescue strategy.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: Location of ECB less relevant than who wins the
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD O'BRIEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Marsh's discussion of the battle over the site of the ECB ('No
place for bank to call home', July 14) provides an excellent summary of the
tale of four (or more) cities but it is clear that he also feels that the
subject is given more attention than it really deserves. May I suggest that
the real competition among Europe's cities is not for the ECB but for the
markets themselves - a far more important prize. Does the location of the
ECB affect the location of markets?
The answer is probably not: indeed, if there is any correlation between the
presence of a reputable central authority and extensive markets it stems
from the role of that authority as supervisor and regulator, not as monetary
controller. Hence London has developed well supervised markets over the
years and its future strength depends upon restoring that reputation after
recent problems. Equally, Frankfurt has been well behind in market
development; hence the finance ministry's efforts to enhance Finanzplatz
Deutschland while the Bundesbank has no supervisory role. At present it is
undecided as to whether the ECB will play a supervisory role, so that its
relevance to markets may be even less than that of many existing central
banks.
More important, over time the location of the ECB will become even less
relevant as the very location of markets becomes more diffuse as markets
increasingly switch from physical trading places to computer and telephone
networks. Each city in Europe is likely to see the level of market trading
increase as cities are able to link with each other; it is not a matter of
the markets being in one place or another. The ECB, likewise, will in effect
be located in all centres through the constituent central banks. Of course,
just how many operating powers remain with each central bank remains to be
seen; hence London's tactic of trying to be the operating arm a la New York
Fed, if the ECB, as a policy making body, is located elsewhere.
Meanwhile, in Edinburgh I suggest that the EC take the logical step of
recognising that it is far too early to be siting an institution with an
uncertain role and leave central bankers to continue their research, through
the new European Monetary Institute, in Basle.
By the time the ECB comes along, that central bankers' haven may well be
located in the Community - if anyone still thinks location matters that
much.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Observer: Orthodox move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Department of Trade and Industry needs a chief economic adviser,
Walter Eltis is probably as good a choice as any. It is not the first time
that the DTI has had a top economic guru. After all, Hans Liesner did the
job for 13 years until he left to become deputy chairman of the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission in 1989; and the Foreign Office and the Department of
Transport, among others, have similar boffins.
Even so, Eltis's appointment is bound to raise eyebrows. Is President
Heseltine just finding a job for an out-of-work director general of the axed
National Economic Devel-
opment Office, or is he putting in place his own powerful team to challenge
established Treasury thinking?
On the surface at least,
HM Treasury seemed relaxed enough when Observer check-
ed out the possible deeper significance of Eltis's move. It noted that Alan
Budd, the Treasury's own chief economic adviser, also heads the government
economic service, and is several rungs above Eltis. In addition, Eltis's
record as an economist suggests he is much more supportive of the government
than a doom-
and-gloom merchant like Wynne Godley. Surprisingly, he is not an
interventionist. So if Hezza is after alternative thinkers, Eltis isn't one.
Indeed, perhaps the people who ought to feel most miffed about the
appointment are Eltis's old colleagues at Nedo. To date he is the only one
who has been given a job.

The Scots are forever complaining that, when it comes to catching the
attention of London-based journalists, they might as well be on the moon.
But some bright spark at Scottish Life has had a good go at it - as witness
yesterday's media announcement of the company's new business results for the
first half of the year.
'Another Boring Bombastic Press Release from Scottish Life', it starts, and
continues: 'The only possible item of interest is that most of the growth is
in the single premium area, single premium personal pensions and executive
pensions in particular (up 160 per cent to Pounds 89m).'
Then it adds: 'Just in case anyone is remotely interested, the detailed
figures are attached'.
The acid test, of course, is whether the result is widespread coverage in
the press at large. But, whatever the pay-off, Observer and colleagues are
grateful. It makes such a change.

<TEXT>
Hush] Cabinet ministers' movements are of course top secret.
Then again, however, John Major is committed to more open government. So
here is what Observer has gleaned as to where Britain's political leaders
will be seeking to forget the recession during their holiday.
The prime minister's plans are under especially thick wraps. But it would
scarcely be astonishing if he turned up in Spain, not just for the Olympic
Games, but to stay at the house of foreign office minister and
arch-Europhile Tristan Garel-Jones. Indeed, the likelihood that Major will
come back yet more wedded to the perfidious Maastricht treaty is already
being lamented by Tory Euro-sceptics.
Meanwhile, one of their deep-dyed members, Peter Lilley, is nonetheless off
to France - although cabinet colleagues may be wrong in expecting him to
fare forth from his Normandy cottage to campaign for a 'No' in the French
referendum. He's more likely to pop down to Provence where he might bump
into not only William Waldegrave, but Michael Howard replete with wife and
mother-in-law.
Chief whip Richard Ryder, recuperating from putting down putative backbench
rebellions, is ranging farther afield: the US certainly, and mayhap a Greek
island.
By contrast Norman Lamont's fondness for his new grace-and-favour house in
Dorneywood is keeping him there much of the summer (if he invites a few
economists down, the taxpayer will pick up the tab). For a break, he'll
probably go to Tuscany where - if he's wanted by Douglas Hurd, who'll also
be there - he might well be found in the garden of a trattoria near Lucca.
As for the other Treasury member of the cabinet, Michael Portillo is said to
be determined to belie his reputation as Whitehall's Scrooge. So he'll be
slashing his colleagues' budgets from a beachside villa in Barbados.
Perhaps in hope of mollifying him, big ministerial spender Virginia
Bottomley is sojourning frugally with family on the Isle of Wight, while
David Hunt and John Gummer are sailing together off Norfolk. Lord Wakeham,
cabinet chief-fixer, is setting a more ambitious course from the south coast
to Brittany.
Even that, however, is too tame for Michael Heseltine. Hezza the Prezza, as
he is now affectionately known, will be sketching his blueprint for
Britain's industrial revival on an exotic island somewhere in the South
Pacific.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Heat is on in the monetary kitchen: The Bundesbank is simply
doing the job that other European countries joined the ERM for it to do
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On Monday, at the meeting of the European Community's finance ministers, Mr
Norman Lamont of the UK and Mr Michel Sapin of France gave the Germans a
lesson in how independent they think a central bank ought to be. The
Bundesbank has replied.
'My deep conviction,' argued Mr Sapin, 'is that the Bundesbank is not
outside reality, and that the reality is that interest rates are too high.'
Where Mr Sapin blustered, Mr Lamont merely hoped. But the behaviour of both
was absurd. The Bundesbank is simply doing the job that other European
countries joined the exchange rate mechanism for it to do.
The Bundesbank has a consolation for its unpopularity. German unification
has given the institution, threatened as it is by extinction before the end
of the decade, an excuse for shaking the European monetary tree to see who
falls off. By raising its floor rate of interest, the discount rate, from 8
per cent to 8.75 per cent, while retaining the 3 1/2 -5 1/2 per cent target
for growth of broad money, the Bundesbank did a little more shaking
yesterday.
The fears of the ministers were understandable. Economic growth in Europe,
excluding Germany, was only half a per cent last year. This year it is
forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) to be a mere 1 1/2 per cent.
Unfortunately, the consequences of German unification cannot be readily
evaded. As the OECD's recent report on Germany notes, 'since unification,
all aspects of economic policy - fiscal, monetary and structural - have been
under increasingly intensive pressure'. The questions to be asked are not
just how the pressure is making itself felt externally, but how long it will
last and what, if anything, can be done to relieve it.
In 1991 west Germany's gross national product per head was DM41,900 (Pounds
13,900), while east German GNP per head in 1991 was only DM12,100, less than
30 per cent of the west German level. Initially, the inequality had not
appeared so huge. East German gross domestic product per head was measured
at some 60 per cent of the west German level in 1989. But eastern Germany
lost 45 per cent of its GDP between 1989 and 1991 (see chart), perhaps the
biggest slump to befall an economy in peacetime. Over the same period west
German GDP rose by 8 per cent.
To those who had it was given. But then an effort had to be made to take
some of it away. East German private consumption alone was as big as its
total GNP in 1991. Total expenditure - public and private consumption plus
investment - was nearly 90 per cent larger than its GNP. The difference was
made up by west Germany, this inflow of resources being equal to 6 1/2 per
cent of west German GNP.
A little over two-thirds of the resources transferred to east Germany have,
in fact, come out of west Germany's external surplus. This shift was at the
expense of the rest of the world, and mainly of western Europe. Given their
complaints about Germany's trade surpluses, however, it is difficult for
these countries also to moan about their disappearance.
Contrary to what one might suspect, there has been no reduction in the
overall west German standard of living. On the contrary, it has risen almost
as fast as west German GNP, as has west German real disposable income, by
6.3 per cent in 1990 and then 2.2 per cent in 1991.
The domestic conduit for the resource transfer from the external account to
east Germany has been the fiscal deficit (see chart). That deficit, in turn,
has helped to generate higher long-term interest rates, which have served as
a floor for European rates. At their peak, German long-term interest rates
were almost 3 percentage points higher than in 1985 and 2 percentage points
higher than in 1989.
Short-term rates of interest are higher still. The unification-induced
expansion of the west German economy, combined with the large fiscal
deficits, has created both inflationary pressure in the labour market -
between 1990 and 1991 wage costs per employee rose by more than 6 per cent -
and rapid monetary expansion (see chart).
The monetary policy stance can best be captured by whether short-term rates
of interest are above, or below, long-term ones. By this criterion, German
monetary policy is tight, as is that of France and the UK. In other leading
industrial countries short-term interest rates are below long-term ones.
Europe is stepping on the monetary brake; the rest of the developed world is
pressing on the accelerator.
The UK government currently pats itself on the back for getting its
short-term rates of interest a quarter of a percentage point above the
German. But Canadian and Australian short-term rates are more than 4
percentage points below. Japanese and US short-term rates are lower still.
If challenged, the Bundesbank will argue that the remaining countries of
western Europe have no right to complain. Combined with the high level of
long-term interest rates, German monetary policy is driving down European
inflation. And so, asserts the Bundesbank, it should. Not a single European
country has, after all, had a rate of consumer price inflation below 2 per
cent over the last year.
Unfortunately, the leading European countries other than Germany have either
managed only modest improvements in inflation performance since the end of
1989, or paid a high price for their gains. In terms of the relationship
between inflation and unemployment, Italy, the UK, Spain and even France are
in a far worse state than the other top industrial countries, including west
Germany. The ERM may work, but it has been no panacea for Europe's economic
ills.
How long might this squeeze last?
German monetary policy will remain tight until German inflation falls back
to what the Bundesbank sees as tolerable levels. Wage increases in 1992 are
likely to be about 5 3/4 per cent, says the OECD. While better than last
year's figure, this is still considerably higher than the 4-5 per cent that
the Bundesbank would want.
Furthermore, the OECD argues that inflation will fall only slowly to the
Bundesbank's desired level. Thus it forecasts consumer price inflation at 3
1/2 per cent in western Germany, even in 1993. The continued buoyancy of the
west German economy, plus the recovery that is slowly beginning in the east
are likely to make the Bundesbank extremely cautious, with the money supply
numbers giving it the excuse to do what it wants anyway. Consequently,
significant reductions in German short-term interest rates may not occur
even in 1993.
Quite apart from its determination to maintain credibility, the Bundesbank
has yet another reason for its caution: fiscal prospects. Continued
substantial fiscal deficits will also ensure that German unification will
play an important role in keeping long-term interest rates high, not only in
Europe, but worldwide.
It is true that the general government deficit last year was only 3 per cent
of all-German GNP. It is true also, that the federal government has put
forward a stringent budget, with nominal outlays rising by a mere 9 1/2 per
cent between 1992 and 1996. But there is less to this stringency than meets
the eye: first, because net borrowing by the west German post office, the
railway, the Treuhandanstalt (the agency charged with east German
privatisation) and social security is very large; and second because the
government is unlikely to meet its targets, in any case.
Deutsche Bank, for example, forecasts the total public sector borrowing
requirement at 6 per cent this year, 5 1/2 per cent in 1993 and 4 1/2 per
cent in 1994. The result would be a ratio of total public sector debt to GNP
of 57.5 per cent by the end of 1994, an increase of 8 percentage points in
three years.
East Germany is, in any case, bound to remain a large drain on the German
capital markets. This will be so whether it be through fiscal forecasts
transfers or through private investment, should growth take off. If east
German growth were to be as much as 8 per cent a year and west Germany's
only 2 per cent, it would still take some 20 years for GDP per head to
converge. For much of that period resources will be transferred, one way or
the other, from the west to the east.
Prospects for the rest of Europe are bleak. High interest rates and slow
growth may help to lower inflation, but they will also tend to raise fiscal
deficits. Convergence on the way to Emu looks a hard road, with no certainty
that Germany will even be there to greet the travellers at the end of their
journey.
Can anything be done beyond travelling on? There are fewer choices than many
hope.
High long-term rates of interest cannot be evaded. If anything, depreciation
is likely to raise the long-term rates of interest of the depreciating
countries.
A German realignment would not lower European short-term rates of interest
unless the Bundesbank takes the opportunity to lower its own rates. Given
the domestic pressures, there can be no guarantee it will.
The D-Mark could float. But this would probably be the end of the march to
Emu, on which the French have put so much store. What is more, there is no
reason for France, which has a far better-adjusted economy than the other
large European countries, to make that choice.
Realignments of weak currencies within the ERM are unlikely to lower either
their short or long-term rates of interest.
What is left is leaving the ERM altogether, a choice that would be seen as a
decisive defeat.
German unification has merely meant that what was already bound to be a
tough journey to Emu has become tougher still. But the Germans would argue,
quite rightly, that all that is now being demanded is the achievement of the
sort of macro-economic performance that they have long taken for granted. If
other countries do not like the heat, they should perhaps get out of the
Bundesbank's kitchen. Unfortunately for them, anywhere else is likely to be
quite as hot.

Any assessment of plans for the future role, shape and ownership of British
Rail must start from where we are:
Today's railway is a complex, intricate, live operation involving the
movement of 16,000 trains every day, over 740m passenger journeys each year.
Half a million London commuters are carried every working day.
The 136m tonnes of freight carried annually keep thousands of lorry-loads
off overcrowded roads.
Compared with the beginning of the last decade, British Rail is now carrying
more passengers and has opened more than 100 new stations. At the same time
it operates with one-third less support in grants from government and 20 per
cent fewer staff.
My first priority is to see that today's railway continues to operate
effectively and safely - and to improve its service. Whatever other
priorities we have, our managerial eye must be kept on that ball.
To make that happen, the railway must first and foremost be safe. There must
be clear responsibilities and authority to discharge them.
The investment programme is and should be substantial. We have foreseen
expenditure annually in excess of Pounds 1bn. The refurbishment backlog is
great and it is important this momentum is maintained.
Of this year's investment programme of about Pounds 1.6bn, one-third will be
used to keep Victorian assets secure and serviceable and to maintain more
than 40,000 bridges and viaducts.
Better services are provided by electrifying lines, and by replacing old
signalling and trains with modern equipment, which is more efficient and
cheaper to maintain. Preparations for the Channel tunnel opening take up
most of the rest.
The people operating the system must be competent. The programme of
implementing a clear vocational qualification structure is vital in an
industry where demographic unevenness means that up to 70 per cent of our
drivers will retire by 2000 - in practically each case with service in
excess of 40 years.
In simple terms these are the imperatives for maintaining and developing a
railway which will tackle the problems of road congestion, pollution and
energy conservation. They are the background to the proposals in this week's
white paper on the future of British Rail.
For the railways, greater clarity about their future is good. Uncertainty is
unsettling and difficult to manage. The content is, as we have stated in the
past, a matter for the shareholder (the government) not British Rail. It is
for BR management to advise on the practicality of the proposals and to
achieve effectively their implementation.
Much has been done to divide and devolve in what was a monolithic,
technically driven organisation, and to redress the balance towards customer
need and satisfaction. The railway also has large capital requirements. The
introduction of private capital into the operation is welcome. So is the
concept of franchising, as it may unlock gains for the customers, through
entrepreneurial flair from within as well as outside the railway. The
management of change, which these developments will make necessary, is a big
task. The scale and rate of change will demand a balance between ambition
and pragmatism. The only criterion is success, and if this takes a little
longer, I would say: so be it.
For those businesses that are to be sold my advice is similar. Care must be
taken to ensure that they have competent management and a good chance of a
long-term future. If matters can be arranged in this way, then I have no
doubt a good number of our staff will look at the possibilities and come
forward as potential buyers. This, as the white paper says, will be
welcomed.
So far I have not mentioned the economics of railway operations. The
railways require up to Pounds 1bn a year of public subsidy to continue
operating a countrywide, price-constrained network - endorsed as the network
needed to meet social requirements. Privatisation will throw into relief
these facts of life; it is helpful to recognition of the reality of
transport issues that these transactions are more transparent.
The main lever in the economic operation of the railway is the charge for
access to the lines. This has the making of becoming the biggest
bureaucratic complexity since Lord Woolton set up the rationing system.
There will be anxious debate in months to come over concepts of
market-pricing versus cost-related charging and all shades in between. We
must arrive at systems that are above all practical - and lead to the most
effective use of the railway network we can engineer.
From these points of view, the white paper presents a challenge to all of us
 -to those in the private sector who have a contribution to make to a better
railway, and to all those working today to run a major national enterprise.
The challenge is to ensure there is overall national advantage. BR is
prepared to take up that challenge. The new policies require big changes,
and managing the process of change will be the key to future success.
The author is chairman of BR.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Stay in the ERM vice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK appears to have achieved the seemingly impossible. By raising
the largely symbolic discount rate by three quarters of a percentage point,
it has sent an emphatic signal of anti-inflationary resolve, but without
forcing up European interest rates. Yet Europe's finance ministers should
allow themselves only shallow sighs of relief. The Bundesbank intends to
rein in German credit growth, and further monetary tightening may yet be
necessary.
The Bundesbank remains beyond reproach. A 4 per cent inflation rate is
intolerably high for an institution committed to price stability. By leaving
money market rates unchanged, and instead biting into the profit margins of
Germany's banks, it is attempting to slow the pace of bank lending at the
minimum cost to its partners in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Yet the Bundesbank council has also staked its anti-inflationary credibility
on hitting the reconfirmed broad money target range before the year-end.
This will be almost impossible; and the gap between the Lombard rate ceiling
and discount rate floor is now so narrow that a rise in the Lombard rate may
soon be necessary.
The prospect of lower European interest rates this year thus looks
increasingly remote, while the possibility of higher rates remains. Economic
growth outside Germany may be slow, and unemployment rising fast, but
monetary policy looks set to remain punishingly tight well into 1993. Nor
are there any easy solutions. No ERM member has managed to maintain lower
rates than Germany for any significant period of time, and no country
appears willing to try; while a unilateral devaluation would deliver nothing
but lost credibility and higher rates.
Equal partner
A general realignment, which revalued the D-Mark, offers a theoretically
more attractive, but politically impossible, alternative. France must join
any realignment that is to deserve this label. But economically, France has
no compelling need to do so, and politically it would involve both loss of
face and a catastrophic weakening of France's desire to be an equal partner
with Germany in shaping the future of the European Community. Nor dare Italy
consider talk of a devaluation, however necessary, until it has first put
its fiscal house in order. Accordingly, it used yesterday's opportunity to
raise its interest rates.
Double defeat
Any European country which wants to reduce interest rates below those of
Germany can do so only outside the ERM. Those in Britain who would cut rates
must acknowledge this inevitability. A case can be made for such a British
exit. The UK is suffering a deeper and longer recession than any other
developed country. An independent Bank of England could, at least in theory,
do as good an anti-inflationary job.
Yet for the current government to leave the ERM now would be to admit a
double defeat. Entry to the ERM, in October 1990, signalled both a political
desire to be at Europe's centre and an unrelated economic desire to secure
low and stable inflation after the errors and convulsions of the 1980s.
Neither task is complete. Europe's political future may be uncertain: the
ERM might not survive a popular rejection of the Maastricht treaty at the
forthcoming French referendum. But departure from the ERM now, during
Britain's EC presidency and with the future of Maastricht so uncertain,
would squander to no purpose the UK's position of growing influence in
Europe's future. Nor has the government met its objective of low and stable
inflation. Although the annual growth rate of average earnings has finally
fallen below the 7 per cent barrier, it remains unsatisfactorily high.
The government should ignore the siren voices within its ranks. Low
inflation, regardless of the European political context, will remain this
government's central objective. Only when inflation has fallen below 3 per
cent, and unit labour cost growth below 2 per cent, will it have met this
objective. For the present, the ERM provides the most credible means of
achieving it. The government must press on until it has achieved the kind of
inflation targets it would set an independent Bank of England. For now,
there is no alternative.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: The Last Carnival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Derek Walcott's 1992 version of The Odyssey continues at The Other
Place (RSC, Stratford-upon-Avon), his 1970 play, The Last Carnival opens at
The Birmingham Rep. Vintage 1992 Walcott is far and away the better,
although the 1970 is still robust theatre.
Walcott sets The Last Carnival (part of a post-colonial Caribbean trilogy)
in Trinidad: an inland estate and the wharf at Port of Spain. In 1947,
Aggie, a firebrand radical cockney governess arrives to instruct the
children of a French Creole planter.
She sets about changing the plantation way of life, moving confidently
between native Trinidadians, European settlers and the British
administration.
But looking back on post-colonial Trinidad from 1970, eight years after
independence, Aggie - now Agatha - becomes implicated in the island's
complexities of race, culture, language and politics. Her original employer
and sometime lover is now dead, and a Black Power coup overshadows Carnival
this year. She has become more conservative.
Walcott's attention runs everywhere, and the play has no centre. The
tensions arise from the possibilities inherent in Trinidad itself, a Spanish
dominion with French settlers seized by the British in 1797. As one
character says: 'All th' races of th' world here, an' if dey ain't get on
here, dey ain't goin' get on anywhere.'
Walcott allows the play's issues to dissolve back into the environment:
national identity and cultural history are white burgundy at a cricket match
under a Caribbean sun. Political change is seen as impossible, British rule
continues in Trinidadian form.
Agatha the radical ends up crying, 'Why can't you people do anything for
yourselves?'
John Adams, in his final production at The Rep, directs with tact. The
narrative-flashback form means that each scene becomes predictable, and the
play builds slowly. Its strengths are not its plot or characters but its
setting.
The versatile design, by Roger Butlin, incorporates a French past in one of
Watteau's Embarkation to Cythera paintings and a soundtrack from
Cantaloube's Auvergne folk settings. There are steel bands and cicadas, but
not enough sweat, dirt or energy to make the carnival season convincing.
The actors move between creole, English, French and Trinidadian patois, a
cool collation of accents. Jill Brassington and Catherine Russell as Agatha
then and now hold the centre of the play, while Peter Woodward and Michael
Bertenshaw (the creole planters) orbit around them. Lorna Laidlaw as the
maid become minister of housing is a treat.
The key to the play is a poetic moment, a tribute to Caribbean time. When
Aggie arrives, her host takes her watch - she will not be needing it - and
swings it over the water: 'she knew she had all the time in the world.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: A wise man's gold - The connoisseurship of Philip
Pouncey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE glorious 'Hommage a Philip Pouncey' at the Musee du Louvre in Paris
accomplishes two goals. It is an affectionate tribute to the extraordinary
achievement of an English art historian who without doubt knew more about
Italian Renaissance drawing than any one ever has. It is also a celebration
of the exacting if now unfashionable science - or is it art? - of
connoisseurship.
When the editor of The Burlington Magazine dropped 'for connoisseurs' from
the title in 1948, he did so because the word connoisseur had come to
conjure up a comic image of an 'elderly gentleman in white bow tie and trim
imperial. . . In one hand he holds a fat cigar and in the other a magnifying
glass through which he peers knowingly at the contours of an oriental vase.'
Today, connoisseurship itself tends to be dismissed as unimportant by
proponents of the new art history. What these historians conveniently fail
to acknowledge was well understood by Philip Pouncey and his great
precursors, such as Bernard Berenson, and Crowe and Cavalcaselle.
Familiarity with an individual artist's style to the point of being able to
define it and distinguish it from that of another, is fundamental to any
real understanding of art.
In the case of Renaissance drawings, almost none of which are signed or
documented, an attribution to a particular hand is not easily attained. It
may be established by an analysis of style - the 'handwriting' of a
draughtsman - or, when possible, by association with a known painting, which
depends on extraordinary knowledge and visual memory. Even after this, a
sense of quality is required to distinguish original from copy.
Stories of Mr Pouncey's feats of memory, and of his capacity to empathise
with particular artistic personalities, have become legendary. There is the
tale of the drawing of a crouching male nude by Bastianino, an obscure
Ferrarese imitator of Michelangelo by whom no drawings were known to
survive.
'If Bastianino had made drawings,' declared Mr Pouncey, 'this is exactly the
sort of drawing that one would have expected of him.' Sure enough, an
altarpiece by the artist subsequently came to light containing a figure for
which the drawing was a study.
He recognised another sheet as by the 16th century Veronese artist Domenico
Brusasorci, and added that it looked like a study for a painting on slate.
The relating picture was found in Hungary. Its support was, of course,
slate.
Such off-the-cuff insights are witness to a rare combination of virtuosity
and single-mindedness. They came out of a passion for paintings and drawings
and after a lifetime of looking in the churches, museums, galleries and
private collections of Europe and, latterly, the US - and of looking long
and hard.
His French wife Myril, an equally indefatigable traveller and help-meet,
recalls their itineraries. Holiday leave was always taken in one lump to
make the annual trip longer and, given their very limited means, cheaper. It
might include spending every day for three weeks in the Albertina in Vienna,
but time in France and Italy was essential.
Myril arranged Italian trips around exhibitions and any artist Philip was
particularly interested in at the time. A typical day would start with two
churches before breakfast of a 'cappuccino-brioche' - 'we never sat in a
cafe ever, it took too much time'.
After churches and museums closed, there would be simple picnics of bread
and cheese, and a siesta, before starting again when things opened in the
afternoon. If they did not open, Philip was miraculous at procuring keys or
custodians. Once, in Brescia, he was even embraced by a nun because he told
her things she had not known about the life of the founder of her order,
Santa Angela de Merici.
These were the days before the proliferation of the illustrated art book.
Photography of interesting paintings and drawings had to be commissioned,
and was expensive. It is not surprising that Philip Pouncey should have left
the British Museum to go to work for Sotheby's in 1966, lured by the
prospect of three months travelling a year and as many photographs as he
wished.
Even when well into their 70s, the Pounceys - ever curious, and also ever
generous with their expertise - could be seen returning to spend yet another
day at an exhibition most other art historians had left after an hour or
two.
Philip Pouncey dedicated his energies and his extraordinary gifts to
establishing the drawn oeuvres of vast numbers of Italian artists who, when
he embarked on his studies in the 1930s, were often no more than shadowy
figures.
The discoveries he made, even in list form, make for a file of astonishing
thickness. When he first visited the Cabinet des Dessins at the Louvre in
1946, for instance, the Italian drawings had never been systematically
studied. Thousands of anonymous drawings languished in boxes filed not even
by school or area, but by subject. Over the years, he gave an identity - and
restored life - to some 500 sheets, 114 of which are on show.
As this exhibition eloquently reveals, he was not merely engaged in a
pedantic naming of names, but was also, and more significantly, a prospector
extracting nuggets of pure gold from the surrounding mud.
Glinting for our delight, for instance, is arguably the most beautiful and
most miraculously preserved drawing by Sebastiano del Piombo, a quivering
female nude study in black chalk, heightened with white, on blue paper. Its
discovery also allows us to see the way in which the artist, not
uncharacteristically for his age, hardened and stylised the girl in the
finished painting.
We owe our knowledge of countless petit-maitres to the connoisseurship of Mr
Pouncey. That is why it is so fitting that important drawings by particular
favourites such as Coreggio, Peruzzi and Lotto should take a bow here. On
show are two sheets by Lorenzo Lotto, an eccentric but great artist, almost
all of whose known drawings were discovered by Philip Pouncey.
'L'oeil du connaisseur: hommage a Philip Pouncey' continues at the Pavillon
de Flore, Musee du Louvre, Paris, until September 7. Further exhibitions of
drawings attributed by Philip Pouncey (1910-90), are planned at the Uffizi
in Florence at the end of this year, and at the British Museum in 1994.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: Ray Charles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to imagine a more emotionally intoxicating mix than soul and
suffrin' music spiked with sentimental gospel.
If it is sung by a handsome blind man, apparently for you alone, and whose
body language suggests he is deriving almost indecent pleasure from it, the
effect is evangelical.
Ray Charles provokes this devotional state in audiences as a matter of
routine, of course - alone at the piano or surrounded by strings and
celestial choirs.
But fronting a hefty brass and rhythm section and with the divine Raelettes
by his side is easily the most seductive setting for the man who can make
people from Sussex feel homesick for Georgia.
Charles takes a lot of stick, from people who should know better, about his
overt commerciality - the fact that he will advertise anything from charge
cards to soft drinks and is strict about his terms of contract.
Presumably they would prefer him to stick to the basket-weaving skills he
learnt in order to earn his pin-money when a penniless child in Florida.
Charles is the consummate professional who gives his fans exactly what they
crave, effortlessly. He sings the ones they will come again for ('Georgia',
'I can't stop loving you') and, from a huge repertoire, delights with
surprise covers ('Some enchanted evening' and Ruth Brown's 'Evr'y time it
rains'). Surely someone who gives so much pleasure should be allowed some
spin-offs.
The 61 year old voice is legendary, and in great shape, ranging from gruff,
rough velvet eructations through soothing C &amp; W tinged soul to pure blues
shouting.
The charisma of the man still harks back to monochrome footage of the
joyfully demented puppet in sunglasses, black patent shoes and grey DJ,
bent-double in pleasure and clutching at himself in excitement at the
audience's own rapture. (Part of Charles' magnetism is surely induced by an
anxiety that he might actually fall off his stool or somehow become parted
from his instrument.)
The monogrammed stands of the Ray Charles Orchestra, whose horn section is
staffed by implausibly big men, and the Raelettes, a rhapsody in black silk
and hairspray, complete the vision of soul and showbiz in perfect harmony.
The glitzy style of the show might appear even more superficial 30 years on,
but as an escape into sentimentality and 'sadness like a ball game on a

FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Councils face wide tests of
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCILS may find themselves forced to compile up to 178 'performance
indicators' - or measures of effectiveness - if draft proposals from the
Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, for implementing the
Citizen's Charter in local authorities are adopted.
The indicators are intended to be used in 'league tables' to enable people
to see how well their own council is performing. They will cover specific
services such as local tax collection and education, as well as overall
measures such as staff sickness rates.
The draft admits, however, that even all those indicators will not give much
guide to how well local services work.
Today's Local Government Chronicle, which gives details of the Commission
paper, says that full tables of indicators for all the councils in England
and Wales would involve more than 44,000 measures of performance, making
national comparisons complicated.
The draft has been sent to a number of local authorities in a
pre-consultation exercise before formal comments are invited on the
proposals from all councils in September.
The 98 'upper tier' indicators would apply to county councils, while
districts would have to compile 69 'lower tier' indicators, and both tiers
would face 11 general measurements. Metropolitan districts and London
boroughs would have to collect all 178 of the indicators.
In spite of the argument from some authorities that the raw data on, for
example, the number of council homes unfit to live in will not give the
basis for fair comparisons, the commission has so far decided against making
adjustments to the material. 'Those intent on misusing figures will do so
anyway,' it says.
In some cases, however, 'context' indicators - for example the local crime
rate - will be included.
The difficulties the Audit Commission has found in trying to devise a
workable system are apparent.
'The commission is conscious that the performance indicators listed here
provide a generally unsatisfactory measure of the quality or effectiveness
of services . . . It invites those that make this criticism to suggest
practical ways in which this could be done,' the paper says.
The scheme was the main element of the Department of the Environment's
contribution to the Citizen's Charter, the necessary legislation being
passed just before the election.
Although some of the measures included are flagged only as 'possibles'
because of doubts about their usefulness or measurability, professional
organisations have commented that there should be additional measurements to
give a clearer picture.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Committee in row over chairmanship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the committees where MPs co-operate to scrutinise government
departments has had a vigorous disagreement even before starting its work -
over choosing its chairman.
Although the parties are agreed that the chairman of the employment
committee should be a Labour MP, the Tory committee members blocked the
election of Mr Ron Leighton, Labour's candidate and the committee chairman
in the previous parliament, and refused to support him even as a temporary
chairman.
Mr Greville Janner, the senior Labour committee member, has been elected
chairman for the first two committee meetings, but has made clear that he
does not intend to stand for the chair after the next meeting, in October.
Instead, just a couple of days after government whips had been blamed by
some MPs for their role in appointing members of the departmental
committees, Mr Janner appealed to the 'usual channels' of communication
between government and opposition whips, to reach a consensus on the
chairmanship.
Mr Ian Bruce, Tory MP for Dorset South and one of two Tory members of the
committee in the last parliament, said yesterday that the Tories were
disappointed that Labour had not taken the opportunity of the committees'
being set up to bring in some 'fresh blood'. All five Labour members have
served on the committee before.
During the last parliament, some Tory MPs were critical of Mr Leighton for
dominating the questioning of witnesses in spite of an informal agreement to
share the questioning more evenly among committee members.
Mr Bruce said that although the Tories on the committee did not generally
veto subjects for inquiries, Labour members had stopped a Tory proposal
early this year for an inquiry into a minimum wage and into wages councils.
Although a programme of work for the first month of so has been sketched
out, the committee's next meeting is likely to be concerned with sorting out
its own working relations. The choice of chairman is a matter for the
committee members, and pressure may well be needed from some outside source
for the deadlock to be broken.
The home affairs committee has invited Mrs Stella Rimington, the
director-general of the security service, to give evidence about MI5's
responsibilities.

Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that

Mr Dorrell said a provision to be included in next year's Finance Bill would

FT  17 JUL 92 / Accounts body plan attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chartered Institute of Management Accountants has criticised the
Accounting Standards Board's proposals for an operating and financial review
in company accounts.
The Cima response follows the publication in April of a discussion draft of
the ASB review, which suggests that companies should be required to describe
their activities in detail.
Cima broadly supports the review, which echoes Canadian requirements and the
discussion and analysis in US company accounts.
It argues that the increases in management time, audit and other costs,
including the preparation of the review, are such that 'the board needs to
make a strong case for its provision'. It adds that the greater level of
disclosure should not place UK companies at a disadvantage in relation to
other European competitors.
Cima says that too much detail is required in the review and that might add
10 pages to the average annual report. The review should concentrate merely
on sales, profits and cashflow.
It suggests that the review might include a statement from leading lenders
to a company, giving their assessment of its financial needs and resources.
Cima says the board's suggestion that the review should be voluntary will
not work. To be effective, it should be enforced with an accounting standard
or be a requirement for a Stock Exchange listing.
Cima also argues that the review should be examined by auditors to ensure
that it is not inconsistent with UK company law and that accounts give a
true and fair view.
It suggests that aspects of the review should be included in the
recommendations of the Cadbury committee on financial aspects of corporate
governance.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Row over directorships averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance, has moved to avert a row over his position on whether
people should hold more than one non-executive directorship.
He said yesterday that there were advantages in holding more than one
outside directorship but non-executive directors who held too many posts
might not be able to meet the increased demands of the job.
Sir Adrian was speaking at a seminar on corporate governance sponsored by
the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. He said he was
seeking to clarify remarks he made last month suggesting that individuals
could not be effective if they accepted more than one non-executive
directorship. His comments provoked a storm of protest from many
non-executive directors who hold multiple posts.
The Cadbury Committee recently issued a report urging a code of best
practice for corporate boards of directors which urges a greatly increased
role and responsibilities for non-executives.
Sir Adrian said yesterday he did not mean to imply in his earlier remarks
that it was advisable to hold only one directorship. 'There are advantages
in holding more than one outside directorship in terms of the exchange of
experience and of making the best of scarce resources,' he said. However,
holding too many posts could be a disadvantage.
According to Director magazine, published by the Institute of Directors,
some non-executives hold up to 10 different directorships.
Sir Adrian also urged companies to broaden the pool from which they selected
non-executive directors. Candidates might be divisional heads at leading
British corporations or come from the public sector.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Shell will launch Pounds 250m food shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL, the oil group, is to spend Pounds 250m on building up to 1,000 food
shops on its garage forecourts, it announced yesterday.
The decision is in response to moves by food retailers in recent years to
open petrol stations on their superstore sites. Oil companies have become
increasingly irritated as food retailers have won a growing share of the
petrol market. Some have now decided to fight back by selling more food.
Shell said it was taking advantage of what it describes as a developing
'top-up society'.
The company suggests that 90 per cent of consumers 'top up' every week in
addition to a the main shopping trip to a supermarket. Petrol stations,
Shell believes, are well placed to take advantage of such passing traffic by
stocking items such as milk, bread, pet foods and hot and cold snacks.
The concept of shops on petrol-station forecourts is hardly new - BP, Esso
and Texaco also run them - but Shell is spending big money on expanding its
Select chain. The company runs 350 Select service stores, and plans to open
a further 650 by 1995.
Shell is due today to launch a Pounds 2.5m television and poster advertising
campaign promoting its 'most convenient convenience stores'.
According to Gallup market research commissioned by Shell, a quarter of the
average weekly grocery budget of about Pounds 55 is spent on 'topping-up'.
Shell believes the trend will increase as more working women find they have
less time to shop at out-of-town superstores.
Meanwhile, the grocery superstores are hoping to attract more custom by
selling petrol. There are more than 500 retailer-owned petrol stations in
the UK. Last December the Safeway chain, which is owned by the Argyll Group,
hired its own oil trader in Rotterdam in order to buy petrol at more
competitive prices.
Norwich Union, the insurance group, is refusing to insure new customers
seeking cover for high-performance hatchback cars unless they are fitted
with Vecta engine immobilisers.
The company said the cars were three times more likely to be stolen than
standard models. It had decided to make the immobiliser a requirement
instead of raising premiums.
A 10 per cent discount had been negotiated for customers in the cost of
fitting the device, which would make the average price Pounds 360. Existing
customers with such cars would not have to fit the device but would get a
discount if they did.

FT  17 JUL 92 / New hospitals unit raises closure fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE that the gov-ernment is preparing to rationalise health services in
London strengthened yesterday when Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
announced the creation of a special unit.
The new unit will be responsible for implementing ministerial decisions
'decisively and rapidly' after Sir Bernard Tomlinson, the former chairman of
the Northern Regional Health Authority, produces his report on healthcare in
London. The report is due in the autumn, and is certain to recommend a
reduction in the number of hospital beds in the capital. London is
relatively overprovided with beds compared with the rest of the country.
Financial difficulties in the capital's big teaching hospitals have been
brought to a head by the new financing system of last year's health reforms.
That is prompting health authorities in outer London and the home counties
to send fewer patients to the teaching hospitals. Many are being forced into
bed closures, staff cuts and other economies as a result.
The government is likely to face the politically sensitive decision of
closing one or more of the famous teaching hospitals.
A report last month by the King's Fund health policy centre suggested that
up to 15 big London hospitals might disappear by 2010.
The idea of a task force to implement change in London was recommended by
the King's Fund, which welcomed the move. Mrs Bottomley said she would
announce the membership of the unit when Sir Bernard produces his report.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Business school wins fight for autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER Business School is to keep its separate identity and will
continue to operate with considerable autonomy from Manchester University,
its parent.
Arrangements finalised this week are seen as a shift of position by the
university after 14 private-sector members of the school's advisory board
resigned in May. They were protesting at plans to federate the graduate
school with other, mainly undergraduate, business studies sections in
Manchester.
Federation will proceed but the business school - which has an international
reputation that ranks its Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree
with those of Harvard in the US and Insead in France - will remain in its
buildings.
They include hotel-standard accommodation for students, who are all
experienced or senior executives and half of whom come from abroad.
'We need high-quality teaching and living facilities for competitive
purposes,' according to Professor Tony Cockerill, the school's deputy
director.
The business school will still be able to reinvest surpluses in improving
its facilities. This academic year it has made Pounds 350,000 on a Pounds
12m turnover.
With bookings full for MBA and senior executives' courses, the business
school expects similar profitability in the new academic year, which begins
next month.
The seriousness of the dispute over the school's future has prompted
Professor Martin Harris, who becomes the university's vice-chancellor next
month, to take the chair of a new interim management committee for the
school.
The committee will probably preside over the business school for a year
until an executive board is appointed with a majority of private-sector
members.
Mr Joe Dwek, chairman of Bodycote International and one of northern
England's most prominent business leaders, will be on the committee. Mr Dwek
has active links with the University of Manchester's Institute of Science
and Technology, which is putting its school of management into the new
federation.
Mr Edmund Gartside, of Shiloh, the Manchester textile company, will also
serve on the committee, along with Mr Tom Hinchliffe, a director of ICL, and
Mr Norman Quick, former chairman of Quicks, the car distributor.
No plans have been made to replace Professor Tom Cannon, who resigned as the
school's director a few days after the 14 board members. The job may rotate
among senior academics in the federation.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Peace dividend at risk of draining away: The audit office
accuses Whitehall of costly defence spending errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE ministers, contractors and civil servants are wasting tens of
millions of pounds of the peace dividend through mismanagement, political
interference in procurement decisions and foreign exchange errors, according
to an independent government report.
The National Audit Office's Statement on Major Defence Projects, published
today, lists errors that have cost tens of millions of pounds and are
leaving part of Britain's navy unable to defend itself.
The report comes less than a week after publication of the defence white
paper that detailed measures to make Britain's armed forces 'smaller but
better'. It is the more sensitive for being a first: until this year, its
contents were largely classified.
The report will make uncomfortable reading for Mr Malcolm McIntosh, the new
head of defence procurement, and his bosses, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, the minister for defence procurement. The
audit office is a government watchdog that examines the financial
performance of public bodies.
Perhaps the most serious of the audit office's accusations is that in 1987
Sir George Younger, then defence secretary, overruled Mr McIntosh's
predecessor, Sir Peter Levene, by insisting that a contract worth Pounds
130m was placed with the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside.
Sir Peter had advised that that 'the prudent and economical course' was not
to accept the Swan Hunter bid to build the second of two auxiliary oiler
replenishment vessels. He wanted a competition for the contract.
The audit office says privately that the government decision to give the
order to Swan Hunter 'was political rather than economic': the yard had just
been sold by the government to its management.
The decision was one of a series of errors with the oiler contract that have
left the project almost three years behind schedule.
The oiler is an essential part of Britain's post-cold war naval defences,
supplying fuel, stores, maintenance and ammunition to ships at sea. Two have
been ordered by the MoD, the first from Harland and Wolff in Northern
Ireland, the other from Swan Hunter.
Both projects are now late, with Harland and Wolff so far behind schedule
that the ship has been sent to another yard, Cammell Laird, to be completed.
Exasperated at the delays, the MoD suspended payments to Harland and Wolff
in 1990 and 1991, but the audit office says: 'None of the sanctions imposed
by the department appears to have had a significant impact on the rate of
progress'. The original four-year timescale to completion has slipped to
almost seven years, with the first of the ships due to enter service at the
end of this year. The ships are also over budget: the original target price
for the contract was Pounds 122m a ship, and the MoD estimates that total
Harland and Wolff costs so far amount to Pounds 172m.
The audit office says the MoD had been 'over-ambitious' in awarding the
contract to Harland and Wolff, which had 'limited recent experience of
warship building'. Audit office officials say privately that Harland and
Wolff should never have been given the business because it had been late on
previous defence contracts.
The Swan Hunter deal is also criticised: the MoD decided to award the
contract too soon after Harland and Wolff had started work. The Northern
Ireland yard had not yet drawn up its construction plans and the MoD was
forced to pay up to Pounds 13m to Swan Hunter for another set of plans. It
had to accept a delay in the delivery date as a result.
Furthermore, says the audit office, neither ship will be able to defend
itself when launched over the next two years. The specification called for
the ships to be fitted with vertical-launch Sea Wolf missiles, developed by
British Aerospace and GEC-Marconi for protection against incoming missiles
and aircraft, and EH101 anti-submarine helicopters made by Westland with
Agusta of Italy. The EH101 is not expected to enter service until 1998, five
years late. While the Sea Wolf is ready, the ship cannot make use of them
until its command system becomes operational in 1996.
'These difficulties call into question the wisdom' of MoD procurement
policies that include new defence systems in a ship procurement contract,
the audit office says.
The MoD argues that it is only partly to blame for the delays in the oiler
construction projects. The department defended itself yesterday over the
oiler problems by saying contracts with suppliers were tightly drawn so that
contractors, not the ministry, would bear cost overruns.
But the audit office lists several examples where the department had to pay
more than the contracted price to Swan Hunter for items such as rewriting of
software.
The report concentrates on difficulties with the oiler contract but also
lists eight projects worth more than Pounds 250m that have had suffered cost
overruns of more than 5 per cent.
The mid-life update of the Tornado fighter aircraft and development of the
Type 23 frigate will have cost up to a third more than planned.
Another four projects will be more than 5 per cent cheaper than anticipated,
largely due to cuts in the size of orders.
Other losses include a Pounds 36,000 shortfall in foreign-exchange dealings
as a result of an omission in a contract with McDonnell-Douglas, the US
defence manufacturer.
The watchdog does not provide a total figure for the losses it has
identified because of inconsistencies in the way the figures are calculated
by the MoD and the Treasury. Nor did it give an overall view of how much a
typical project was delayed, this time blaming 'a lack of consistency in the
definition of in-service dates'. The army and air force, for example, had
different definitions for the entry dates of the British Aerospace Rapier
surface-to-air missile.
The audit office says such inconsistencies give 'a misleading impression
that equipment is universally in use by front-line forces and performing
fully to specification'.
The government is not likely to respond in detail to the report until
October, when parliament returns. Some responses should emerge when Mr
McIntosh gives evidence to the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee or
the Commons defence committee. When he does so depends on when he is called
by the committees.

A blacksmith-made track iron dating from about 1790, sold by the Royal Golf
Club, was bought by a private collector for Pounds 20,900 and a gutta golf
ball made about 1860 trebled its estimate at Pounds 7,700.
A red playing coat worn by members of Leicester Golf Club about 1890 to warn
non-golfers of possible danger sold for Pounds 935.
The present malaise in the art market was underlined by Sotheby's sale of
18th-century and 19th-century British drawings and watercolours. It totalled
Pounds 276,375 and was more than 38 per cent unsold. In a healthy market,
the department would have expected about 12 per cent to be unsold.
The top price was the Pounds 44,000 paid for a chalk drawing by Gainsborough
of the Duchess of Buccleuch. The London dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox paid
Pounds 28,600 - twice the estimate - for a landscape with a boy and horses
by the same artist, while another London dealer, Leggatt, acquired a view of
Worcester Cathedral by Constable for Pounds 24,200.
Bonhams has come back into the market for 20th-century art at a difficult
time, and its auction yesterday totalled Pounds 200,000, at the bottom of
the estimate.
'Feeding the chickens' by Sir Alfred Munnings sold for Pounds 19,800, below
forecast, and 'Megalith' by Ben Nicholson, an abstract which Daphne du
Maurier had hidden from view in her Cornish house 'Manderbilly', the
inspiration for Rebecca, also went cheaply, at Pounds 16,500.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Executive ousted from TV network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francis Baron, chief executive of the European Television Networks (ETN),
the former satellite television division of WH Smith, has been ousted from
his job.
Mr Baron had been responsible since 1984 for WH Smith's foray into
television until last year, when the cable and satellite channels were sold
to Capital Cities/ABC of the US, and Canal Plus and Compagnie Generale des
Eaux.
There have been disagreements about the direction of the company, with
important decisions being delayed. It is believed that Mr Baron called a
shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to try to resolve the deadlock.
One issue is likely to have been Mr Baron's fight to win equal access to
television sporting rights.
There was also a difference of approach on strategy. Mr Baron has pioneered
the creation of a pan-European network of sports channels. Canal Plus, the
subscription television channel, has tended to expand by setting up separate
ventures in individual nations.
Mr Richard Spinner, an executive of Capital Cities/ABC, and senior
vice-president and managing director of CC/ABC's European operations, has
taken over as chief executive of ETN.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Single parents lose benefits battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S system of income support, which can leave single parents better
off on the dole than working, is not a breach of European Community sex
discrimination laws, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled
yesterday.
Mrs Patricia Cresswell and Ms Sonia Jackson, supported by the Child Poverty
Action Group, had argued that Department of Social Security regulations made
it financially impossible for almost 1m mothers with young children to work.
Both mothers were challenging the Social Security Act 1986 which, unlike the
Supplementary Benefit Act it replaced, does not allow child-minding expenses
to be deducted from part-time earnings when assessing eligibility for
benefit.
Mrs Cresswell said she was Pounds 10 a week worse off by working part-time
as a graphic designer. She had to pay Pounds 25 a week for child-minding for
her six-year-old son but only the first Pounds 15 of her income was free
from DSS clawback of allowances.
The European Court ruled that the issue was not covered by EC directives on
equal treatment regarding access to work and social security.
Mrs Cresswell expressed disappointment at the ruling but said there was no
possibility of further appeal: 'If the government just gave us a little bit
of money to help us with our childcare costs we can take jobs and we are not
going to be claiming income support. That will benefit everybody.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Lecturers' 6.75% pay rise is vetoed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITY lecturers yesterday became the latest targets of the government's
campaign to limit public sector pay to about 4 per cent.
In an unusual intervention ministers have vetoed a pay settlement agreed by
university employers and unions, in the process sparking a row over who runs
Britain's 48 universities.
The 10-week-old settlement is worth a total of 6.75 per cent, including 1
per cent for local performance awards. The government is withholding a grant
of Pounds 24m which the universities need to finance the settlement.
Ministers say they will withhold the extra money until university employers
and unions reach a settlement worth less than 5 per cent, including 0.75 per
cent in local pay awards.
Mr Nigel Forman, further and higher education minister, said government
willingness to agree a settlement higher than 4 per cent signalled
recognition of productivity gains in the universities.
The government's move follows a 7.8 per cent rise for school teachers agreed
through their pay review body. The row is bound to fuel demands for a
similar body for university teachers.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents the
universities and related institutions, and the Association of University
Teachers, which represents 31,000 employees, yesterday refused to
renegotiate the settlement and called for a meeting with Mr John Patten, the
education secretary.
Professor Stewart Sutherland, vice-chancellor of London University, said the
government's attitude left a clear question over 'Who manages the
universities?' He said it seemed universities were no longer free to
negotiate pay deals with their staff.
Ms Diana Warwick, general secretary of the AUT, said: 'Members will be
enraged by this rejection of a moderate, deserved pay increase.' She said it
was in line with other pay deals this year.
Sir Pat Lowry, who chaired the negotiations for the original settlement,
said that unlike every other group, university teachers' pay had not kept
pace with retail prices.

THE value of performance-related pay to employers and employees has been

The survey, conducted by the Society of Telecom Executives, found that only

FT  17 JUL 92 / Recession forces jump in PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S public-sector borrowing requirement jumped to a
higher-than-expected Pounds 4.23bn last month as the recession depressed
government revenues and boosted spending.
The June PSBR was well above average market forecasts of a Pounds 3.5bn
Budget deficit and higher than the Pounds 3.15bn PSBR recorded in May and
the June 1991 deficit of Pounds 1.36bn.
It brought the total borrowing requirement in the first three months of the
1992-93 financial year to Pounds 10.8bn, fuelling fears that the government
will not be able to keep within its Pounds 28bn target this year.
The April-to-June deficit compares with the Pounds 7bn PSBR recorded in the
same period of last year and the total 1991-92 PSBR of Pounds 13.9bn.
Although government deficits tend to bunch in the early months of the
financial year, the worsening finances will bolster the case of Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, when he presses for
public-expenditure cuts in the present spending round.
Last month's PSBR incorporated Pounds 446m of privatisation proceeds from
the sale of the Northern Ireland electricity companies and receipts from
this year's sale of BT shares. Without income from privatisation, the PSBR
for the three months to the end of June would have been Pounds 12.7bn,
against Pounds 9.2bn the year before.
Central government cash receipts fell 0.5 per cent to Pounds 46bn in the
three months to June against a 7 per cent increase in cash outlays to Pounds
56.4bn. Inland Revenue receipts were down 3.5 per cent on a year ago,
reflecting depressed revenues from corporation and income tax.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Car output to be cut as sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR MARKET leader Ford is to cut production at its Halewood plant on
Merseyside for a month because of the continuing slump in new-car sales.
Peugeot Talbot is also to cut production by 7 per cent, with the loss of
about 100 jobs, after its 3,000 employees return from their summer break. It
says this is because of changes at its Ryton manufacturing plant near
Coventry in preparation for building a second model and not because of
economic factors.
Main rivals Vauxhall and Rover Group said yesterday they had no plans for
cutbacks. While Vauxhall forecast that it could achieve record production
this year, Rover warned that if August sales were significantly below the
400,000 for which the manufacturers hope, the industry could have no choice
but to cut output later in the year to prevent stocks building up.
The cutbacks were disclosed as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office jointly released statistics
showing that, in spite of the severe slump in new-car sales this year and
weakening exports, car production in the first six months, at 686,763, was
only 1.1 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago.
Total car production for June, at 129,219, was 3.31 per cent higher than in
June last year.
The statistics also show a sharp rise in commercial vehicle production for
the first half, up 24.72 per cent to 138,384 from 111,440, and up 49.3 per
cent in June, to 27,493 from 18,414. Unlike cars, the expansion in
commercial vehicle production was export driven, and largely because of the
start of production on Ford's new light-van ranges.
Ford is to abandon the night shift at Halewood for four weeks after the end
of the three-week summer shutdown. By doing so, it will lose output of
around 500 Escort and Orion models a day.
When two-shift working resumes, it will be on a four-day-week for a further
two weeks before production returns to normal five-day working.
Peugeot Talbot, denied its cutbacks were market linked. It had sold 5,000
more Peugeot 405s this year and seems to be heading for a record market
share.
The relatively high production figures for the first half reflect
preparations for an August sales bulge - expected to be 30,000 units higher
than last year's 370,000 - and predictions of an overall recovery for the
market in the second half. Both hopes now appear to be fading.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Treasury plans to overhaul its model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury has commissioned research into consumer behaviour with a view
to improving its economic forecasts.
Two outside teams of researchers have been called in to overhaul the section
of the Treasury's computerised model of the economy that is linked to the
way people borrow and spend.
Warwick University and the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research are to examine these aspects of the model over the next year or so.
They will be taking into account both the financial deregulation of the
1980s and also the reduced demand for credit by many consumers during the
recession.
If the research is suc-cessful, the results will be translated into
mathematical equations and fed into the Treasury model - a vital tool used
in forecasting the economy.
The Treasury, like most private-sector forecasters, failed to forecast the
extent of the 1986-88 boom and of the recession.
In November 1990, the Treasury projected that there would be growth of 1 per
cent in 1991. In the event, the economy contracted by 2.4 per cent.
Behind the forecasters' failings has been lack of insight into spending by
consumers - which accounts for two thirds of gross domestic product.
Spending took off much more sharply than envisaged in the late 1980s, and
has fallen particularly steeply over the past two years, partly because of
the cost of servicing previous debts.
Under the new contracts, Warwick University's macro-economic modelling
bureau is to examine changes in credit constraints affecting consumers,
leaving the institute to look specifically at the housing market and the
links with borrowing.
The work is part of an effort by the Treasury to shift more of the
development of its model to outside researchers, rather than rely on its own
economists. The Treasury said the studies would look in detail at the new
information about consumer behaviour that has emerged in recent years.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Shortfall in Maxwell funds may be Pounds 434m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHORTFALL in the Maxwell pension funds is at least Pounds 248m and could
be as high as Pounds 434m, according to one of the funds' liquidators.
Mr Neil Cooper, head of corporate recovery at chartered accountants Robson
Rhodes, said last night that, of the total funds managed by Bishopsgate
Investment Management, the liquidators now had assets of Pounds 248m under
their control
BIM was the private company that managed most of the Pounds 700m in the
pension funds of the public companies of the late Robert Maxwell on behalf
of 30,000 past and present pensioners.
Mr Cooper said that disregarding the proceeds of legal actions, the
shortfall was now Pounds 434m on the basis that no more was recovered from
institutions holding investments. This would fall to Pounds 248m if all the
investments were recovered for the benefit of the pensioners. These figures
ignored the government's 'soft loan' package of Pounds 2.5m.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Winners of city renewal funds named: Pounds 2bn
private-sector top-up sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, yesterday announced the 20
run-down urban areas which will share Pounds 750m of government City
Challenge funding over five years from 1993.
He said he expects the private sector to contribute more than Pounds 2bn in
partnership projects in the areas, taking the total investment to nearly
Pounds 3bn.
The 20 'winners', chosen in a competition judged by ministers on the basis
of bids put forward by all but three of the 57 urban programme authorities,
complement the 15 which gained funding under the first round of City
Challenge.
A majority of the 57 urban programme areas now have funding under the
scheme. But the losers are concerned because the Pounds 750m comes off
existing regeneration budgets.
Each winner gains Pounds 37.5m for a regeneration project in a particular
depressed area, in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors.
The 20 winning authorities are: Barnsley, Birmingham, Blackburn, Bolton,
Brent, Derby, Hackney, Hartlepool, Kensington and Chelsea, Kirklees,
Lambeth, Leicester, Newham, North Tyneside, Sandwell, Sefton, Stockton,
Sunderland, Walsall and Wigan.
In addition, Birmingham, Haringey, Plymouth and Stockton will gain 'task
forces' - small groups of civil servants charged with 'bringing residents in
their areas back into the economic mainstream.'
Virtually all of the 20 City Challenge authorities are Labour controlled,
and Mr Howard pointedly complimented them on their efforts. 'One of the
successes of City Challenge is the change it has wrought to the attitude of
councils controlled by Labour,' he said.
Mr Howard described the City Challenge programme as a 'revolution in urban
policy' which had 'transformed the way in which local authorities and their
partners have approached the task of urban regeneration'.
Privately, many Labour council leaders agree with him, recognising the
benefits of forging new links with business and voluntary bodies in their
areas.
But Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, objected to the
creaming of funds for City Challenge. He said funding for the urban
programme had been cut by Pounds 14.3m in the current financial year, and
the programme was now Pounds 121m less than it was in 1985-6.
'For the price of commissioning the Trident submarine . . . all those
bidding for City Challenge funds could have been granted the necessary
financial support to transform the inner-city areas and urban blight,' he
said.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Big City prosecutions produce low conviction rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN THE three big City fraud trials
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness, Barlow Clowes and Blue Arrow - 26 individuals and three companies
were charged and only six convictions have so far been achieved.
Eighteen defendants have been acquitted or seen the cases against them
dropped. Five remain to be tried - four of them being the remaining Blue
Arrow defendants, whose prosecution must now be in doubt.
Those three trials were, admittedly, at the high-profile end of the SFO's
activities. In his annual report in May, Mr George Staple, SFO director,
announced that in the previous year the SFO had prosecuted 58 defendants in
28 trials. Of those, 22 pleaded guilty and 16 others were convicted.
The SFO is not the only prosecuting authority whose record in dealing with
City crime is dismal. The Department of Trade and Industry, which spearheads
the drive against insider dealing, has had only limited success.
In 28 insider dealing trials in the past 11 years, almost half the
defendants have been acquitted. Nearly two thirds of those convicted had
pleaded guilty.
In Guinness, eight people were charged. Four - Mr Ernest Saunders, former
Guinness chairman and chief executive; Mr Gerald Ronson, chairman of Heron
group; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker; and Sir (now Mr) Jack Lyons, a
millionaire financier - were convicted in the first trial.
Mr Saunders' five-year sentenced was halved on appeal and he was paroled
after 10 months. Mr Ronson served six months of a 12-month sentence and was
fined Pounds 5m. Mr Parnes, whose 2 1/2 -year sentence was cut on appeal to
21 months, served 11 months. Mr Lyons was fined Pounds 3m.
The second Guinness trial ended abruptly for reasons for which the SFO could
not be blamed.
The judge accepted the view of two psychiatrists that the mental and
emotional strain on Mr Roger Seelig - a former corporate finance director at
Morgan Grenfell - of conducting his own defence was so severe that there was
a risk that he would commit suicide if the trial went on.
A nolle prosequi, which halted the proceedings but was not equivalent to an
acquittal, was entered in respect of Mr Seelig, and proceedings were
discontinued against his co-defendant Lord Spens, former corporate finance
managing director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank.
Shortly before that trial collapsed, the SFO announced that it was dropping
charges against Mr David Mayhew, a partner in Cazenove &amp; Co, the
stockbroking firm, and Mr Seelig, who were to have stood trial in Guinness
Three.
There remains the trial of Mr Thomas Ward, a US attorney and former Guinness
non-executive director, on theft and false-accounting charges, due to begin
in October.
In the Barlow Clowes affair, seven men were originally charged. The case
against one of them was dropped. After a six-month trial, Mr Peter Clowes
was sentenced to 10 years in jail and Mr Peter Naylor to 18 months.
Mr Guy Cramer and Mr Christopher Newman were acquitted. The SFO decided to
offer no evidence against Mr David Mitchell and Mr Ian Crabtree, who were to
have figured in a second trial.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Stamps expert cleared of plot on 'fakes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE FEIGENBAUM, a former chairman of Stanley Gibbons, the stamp
dealers, was yesterday cleared of masterminding a plot to dupe collectors
into buying fake rare stamps deliberately printed with errors to boost their
value.
After a three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court the jury acquitted him of
fraud-ulent trading.
Two weeks ago, at the end of the prosecution case, the judge directed the
jury to acquit six men charged with Mr Feigenbaum because there was
insufficient evidence against them. Another man, who had originally pleaded
guilty, changed his plea and was also discharged.
The prosecution had alleged that Mr Feigenbaum was behind a fraud that
involved the manufacture of colonial government stamps with deliberate
printing imperfections such as lack of perforations or missing colours. Such
stamps, which do not normally slip past printers' checks, are known as
varieties.
The stamps had been advertised without Mr Feigenbaum's knowledge in
collectors' catalogues as genuine 'mistakes' with rarity value.
Mr Feigenbaum claimed that Commonwealth stamps produced with his authority
under 'open contracts' were valid reprints and varieties to meet demand from
collectors interested in special subjects such as cars and trains.
He said that 'revolutions' in the stamp industry had allowed 'open
contracts' to be negotiated with governments, allowing certain varieties and
reprints of issues to be made. The prosecution had mixed up that sort of
agreement with contracts negotiated by colonial governments through Crown
Agents for new stamps, he claimed.
Judge Eugene Cotran made clear during the course of the trial that the
production of varieties in itself was not illegal, although it is an offence
to sell them as if they were produced accidentally.
Mr Feigenbaum's acquittal may disturb some sections of the philatelic world,
which does not accept the practice of printing varieties.
Mr Feigenbaum has collected and dealt in stamps since childhood. Over the
past eight years his career has changed from the chairmanship of Stanley
Gibbons, the biggest name in the stamp world, to a position outside the main
industry body, the Philatelic Traders Association.
The reflotation of Stanley Gibbons on the Unlisted Securities Market was
called off at the last minute in 1984, when Mr Feigenbaum was chairman. He
resigned and sold his stake in the company.
Informed collectors are now wary of spectacular errors in newly issued
stamps from certain small countries, but those in the philatelic trade say
that few will follow Mr Feigenbaum into openly printing varieties.
Mr Richard West, editor of Stamp Magazine, says that most printers would not
touch a request to print varieties. 'In fact, it is common knowledge that
another stamp printer was approached with a similar proposal and just flatly
refused,' he said. 'It was more than their reputation was worth.' Printing
contracts can depend on a record of producing as few accidental varieties as
possible.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow leaves SFO reputation in tatters: Failure comes
as Maxwell and Polly Peck cases await trial City regulators wait in wings to
be enforcers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROUT of the Serious Fraud Office in the Blue Arrow fraud trial yesterday
left the reputation of the prosecutors in tatters and again cast doubt on
the high-profile pursuit of financial fraud adopted by the authorities in
the UK in recent years.
The latest failure comes at a sensitive time. With two other big prosecution
cases being assembled - over the Maxwell affair and the collapse of Polly
Peck International - the Blue Arrow fiasco strikes at the heart of the way
such cases are prepared and staged.
'It looks like another nail in the coffin of the SFO,' said one senior City
regulator, who refused to be named. A partner of one of the biggest City law
firms, who also declined to be named, said: 'They aren't of the calibre of
the people they are trying to prosecute. They don't pay enough. They aren't
a top-flight team.'
Memories of other failures are still fresh in the City's mind: the banks and
individuals who were acquitted during the course of the Blue Arrow trial;
the abandonment of the second Guinness trial and the decision not even to
begin the third; the dismissal of the planned prosecution of former
directors of Alexander Howden, the Lloyd's of London insurance broking
group.
Anguish about the way these trials have been mounted, and the personal
pressure put on the defendants in each case has intensified - aided by the
widely publicised illnesses of Mr Ernest Saunders, former chairman of
Guinness, and Mr Roger Seelig, a director of Morgan Grenfell, Guinness's
advisers.
After nearly five years and a trial that cost more than Pounds 35m, the
acquittal of the only four defendants convicted in the Blue Arrow trial
added to that anguish in the City. In spite of joy in some quarters - 'Isn't
it wonderful]' was the spontaneous reaction of a personal assistant who had
worked with Jonathan Cohen - there was widespread disquiet about the
futility of the prosecu-tion.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, summed up the
prevailing mood. Bemoaning the 'appalling waste of money and resources', he
said: 'We must be able to find better ways of doing things.'
According to some City lawyers, the SFO has been the victim of its own
prosecution policy. Set up four years ago to pursue big and complex frauds,
it decided from the outset to generate voluminous lists of charges against
defendants, apparently with the view that it was better to get part of its
case to stick than to focus on only one aspect of a fraud and risk failure.
'They brought more charges than they needed to and made the cases more
complex as a result,' said Mr Mark Dawkins, a partner at City law firm
Simmons &amp; Simmons.
Blue Arrow may be a throw-back to those early days. However, the rejection
of a raft of offences against Mr Asil Nadir, who was charged more recently
in the Polly Peck case, suggests that the SFO's prosecution policy has not
changed entirely.
With the SFO stumbling again, City regulators were yesterday dusting down
their credentials, preparing to put themselves forward as the best enforcers
of the complex rules and regulations that govern financial markets. However,
the need to work closely with the SFO, and concern about raising political
hackles in Whitehall, left the regulators reluctant to go public with their
views.
'When this case was started, there was no other way to go,' said the head of
one regulatory body.
He suggested that the Financial Services Act, which came into force after
the events that led to the Blue Arrow trial, provides an alternative
mechanism without involving the criminal justice system.
However, while there is a widespread feeling that the City could deal with
such complex cases more quickly than the judicial system, by exercising its
traditional sanction of blackballing miscreants, few believe that that would
be a politically acceptable way forward. 'You could make quite a strong
argument for saying that the City could sort its own messes out better,'
said Sir Andrew. 'But is society going to accept that that is a good idea?'
One fear that persists outside the City is whether the regulatory bodies -
which are still made up largely of market practitioners rather than
independent regulators - deal sufficiently severely with wrongdoers.
A test of the regulators' resolve may come now with the Blue Arrow
acquittals. At least one of those prosecuted is already thought to have made
an attempt to gain recognition from the Securities and Futures Authority.
The SFA, while saying it will look at each case individually, has hinted
that it may take a favourable attitude to any applications by suggesting
that it would not try to reopen questions about indi-viduals raised during
court cases.
'We will most certainly not try to second-guess the court,' said Mr Geoffrey
Turner, SFA membership secretary.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Taxpayers' bill set to exceed Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXPAYERS are now set to pick up a bill in excess of Pounds 35m after the
overturning of the convictions in the year-long Blue Arrow trial.
Yet the costly failure of the prosecution was far from unpredictable.
The three appeal court judges have yet to give their reasons for quashing
the convictions. However, the arguments of the defendants' lawyers were
plain enough - the mammoth, year-long proceedings had put too heavy a burden
on the jury and the decision by the trial judge dramatically to scale down
the indictment unfairly distorted the trial.
Like many disasters, the seeds of destruction in the Blue Arrow prosecution
lay in decisions taken early on.
In early 1989 the Department of Trade and Industry report into the Blue
Arrow rights issue was published and passed to the SFO. At that time the SFO
was a young organisation, less than two years old, with a reputation to make
and its innovative multi-disciplinary approach largely untested.
The DTI report was passed to Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, an experienced criminal
prosecutor. From then on, every big decision connected with the prosecution
was taken by him.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, now director of public prosecutions, but SFO director
for most of the Blue Arrow case, consulted Mr Purnell frequently about its
progress. However, she was content to leave most of the decision-making to
Mr Purnell, with whom, when a practising barrister, she had shared chambers.
Unlike most SFO cases, the Blue Arrow affair apparently required little
investigation. The bulk of the digging, it seemed, had already been done by
DTI inspectors.
Comparatively little follow-up work by the police was considered necessary.
The 11 individual defendants were not interviewed before they were arrested
in November 1989. Evidence given to the DTI inquiry was to form a
substantial plank of the prosecution's case.
From the outset it was clear that the trial was going to be one of enormous
proportions, putting great stress on the system of trial by jury. During the
50-day pre-trial hearing, designed to ensure that the trial itself was
manageable, the prosecution was repeatedly warned by defence lawyers that it
was being too ambitious.
Mr Purnell resisted the arguments, insisting that one 'mega-trial',
involving all 11 individual and three corporate defendants was the only fair
and sensible way forward. He told Mr Justice McKinnon, the judge, that the
trial would last between four and six months.
Against Mr Purnell's will, Mr Justice McKinnon insisted on two trials to
keep proceedings manageable. By his own admission, the judge was later
proved wrong. Merely dividing the proceedings into two trials was not to be
enough.
The prosecution ran into serious difficulties once the Crown had closed its
case. The evidence provided by the DTI report came under close scrutiny,
notably by lawyers for Mr Stephen Clark, County NatWest's former finance
director, who was acquitted on the judge's direction, the case against him
'completely destroyed'. Mr Alan Keat, the Travers Smith Braithwaite
solicitor, was also acquitted.
In legal arguments with the jury excluded, defence lawyers began lengthy
protests that the trial had already become too large and unwieldy to be
fair.
The judge allowed the trial to continue, but was strongly critical of the
prosecution. It had lost sight of the limits of the jury system, he said. In
grappling with the case to make it manageable, he felt like a dentist
extracting teeth, he said. Relations between him and Mr Purnell became
visibly and increasingly strained.
However, it was after all the evidence had been heard and the closing
speeches made that the difficulties came to a head.
Mr Justice McKinnon decided that the evidence was too much for the jury to
cope with. The indictment was cut radically, with the jury left to decide
only on the issue of the late taking up of shares on the night the rights
issue closed. Three quarters of the evidence had to be disregarded. The
evidence that remained had almost all been given in the early weeks of the
trial.
The judge's move left everyone in court and many at the Bar astonished. It
was, everyone agreed, a decision that should have been taken before the
trial had started.
Mr Justice McKinnon told defence lawyers: 'You are all entitled to one 'I
told you so'.'
Lawyers have for months been assigning the blame for the Blue Arrow debacle
to various quarters. Barristers have privately expressed criticism of Mr
Purnell for maintaining such a large case. While the jury were out
deliberating, Mrs Mills held an unprecedented off-the-record press briefing
at which she criticised the judge for his non-interventionist handling of
the trial.
Wherever the blame lies, there is no doubt that the trial has prompted both
judges and prosecutors to recognise the need to tailor future cases to the
limits of the jury system.
Few think a trial of the size of Blue Arrow will be attempted again. As one
onlooker in the public gallery observed drily during the trial: 'It's like
sailing on the Titanic, blessed with the gift of foresight.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Rebuilding careers will be hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, BETHAN HUTTON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE businessmen acquitted in the Blue Arrow trial are likely to find
rebuilding their careers an uphill struggle, although they are not without
friends in the City.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, 48, Mr David Reed, 44, and Mr Nicholas Wells, 37, are of
an age and experience in which they could theoretically return to their
pre-trial jobs as corporate finance directors. Mr Martin Gibbs, 62, took
retirement in 1989.
Headhunter Mr Nicholas Crossthwaite said the obstacle was not so much the
public perception of the defendants as the way the City has changed since
they were arrested and the narrowing job opportunities in the finance sector
generally.
'They have shown good skills in the past but the market is against them,' Mr
Crossthwaite said.
'Corporate finance activity is 50 per cent of what it was. People think
twice now before they hire because money is tough.'
Among those who have consulted headhunters in recent months is Mr Stephen
Clark, the former Blue Arrow defendant who was acquitted at the direction of
the judge at the trial's halfway stage in October last year.
Mr Clark was group finance director at County NatWest until he was suspended
on publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report in July 1989.
He left the company by mutual agreement in December last year. He now says:
'Certainly in my case, being totally vindicated in a central criminal court
has not left me without a considerable challenge to re-establish my career.'
He is now a consultant on a securities-related project with Cripps Harries
Hall, the solicitors, and has worked as a fund-raiser for the Urban Learning
Foundation charity.
Two of the defendants acquitted yesterday, Mr Cohen and Mr Wells, found
similar consultancy jobs during their trial.
However, 10 months of answering advertisments, tapping personal contacts,
and visiting headhunters like Mr Crossthwaite has not got Mr Clark the job
he most wants - a similar position to the one he used to hold at County
NatWest.
He accepts that involvement in a well publicised fraud trial has not made
the search for work any easier.
Former employers of the defendants yesterday mixed sympathy with a sense of
relief at the court decision, but none would commit themselves to rehiring
their former employees.
National Westminster bank, County NatWest's parent, said in a brief
statement: 'This affair has cast its shadow over these men and particularly
over their families for several years.
'We are naturally very pleased that it has now been concluded for them.'
Mr David Parish, vice-chairman of Charterhouse Bank, said of Mr Cohen: 'I
wouldn't want to be drawn on Jonathan's personal employment prospects,
although I personally have got a lot of time for him.'
He added that the decision ought to lead to the removal of any bar imposed
on Mr Cohen by City regulators. The Securities and Futures Authority, which
approves advisers on securities and corporate finance, said it would review
the position of the Blue Arrow defendants if they sought recognition.
The four can take some comfort from the fact that not all the figures caught
up in the recent high-profile City scandals have been forced out of the
financial industry.
Mr David Mayhew, a senior partner at Cazenove, the stockbroker, was able to
continue work while charges in the Guinness affair hung over him, thanks to
special dispensation from the SFA. Mr Charles Villiers, charged in the Blue
Arrow affair, continues to work as head of corporate development at Abbey
National.
As one City banker put it last night: 'We are a broad church. There is a
general feeling that the trial has been ridiculously handled and the
defendants deserve some form of rehabilitation.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Airliner subsidy deal model for Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community and the United States yesterday offered their
hard-won accord limiting subsidies to civil aircraft as a model for a new
international agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
The bilateral accord, reached on April 1 after six years of wrangling over
government aid to the European Airbus project, will come into effect next
week after endorsement by EC finance ministers last Monday.
It limits direct government support for new aircraft programmes to 33 per
cent of total development costs. Indirect supports, for instance through
military contracts, are limited to 4 per cent of a company's turnover.
Both the EC and the US are long-standing critics of Gatt's civil aircraft
code, drawn up in the Tokyo round of trade talks that ended in 1979. The
code, which has 22 signatories, eliminates import duties on civil aircraft
and the bulk of aircraft parts, including engines. But its references to
subsidies and competitive practices are vague, leaving the door open for
conflicting interpretations.
The US, overriding EC objections, has instead chosen to use Gatt's subsidies
code as the vehicle for attacking state assistance to Airbus. It alleges
that Germany, France, Britain and Spain have spent Dollars 13.5bn-Dollars
26bn on subsidising the consortium, while the EC says US manufacturers have
received similar amounts indirectly through military programmes.
Gatt's civil aircraft committee yesterday agreed in principle to renegotiate
the code. This will most probably be based on the US/EC agreement. However,
Gatt cannot simply adopt the agreement.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Perot cuts his losses and runs: Who will win the votes of
the discontented who flocked to him?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE end for Mr Ross Perot, when it came, really was quick, almost
businesslike. Less than a day after a top adviser walked out, and with poll
after poll showing his popularity in free fall, the Texas billionaire
'picked up his marbles and went home', as Molly Ivins, the Dallas newspaper
columnist, said he would the night before.
He did it in Perot style too - unabashed, unapologetic, ad- mitting no more
than a minor mistake here or there. He felt for his 'volunteers' but offered
them no guidance, beyond a complimentary nod to the revitalised Democratic
party. In effect, he cut his losses, about Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m), and
ran.
But he left claiming to have made a difference, and, in that belief, his
confidence is not entirely misplaced. For this has been the political year
of the protest - from Pat Buchanan, Jerry Brown, even Paul Tsongas and
certainly Mr Perot himself - and though each has individually failed, their
cumulative effect has been to change the tenor of the presidential election
campaign.
The critical question now for the two who remain standing, President George
Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, is who is best positioned to pick up the
pieces, above all those left stranded by Mr Perot.
Mr James Carville, Mr Clinton's top strategist, is sure it will be his man.
He said yesterday that, whatever else might be said of Mr Perot, he had
tapped a well of discontent in a country dissatisfied and demanding change.
The Clinton premise throughout, he argued, has been change, while that of Mr
Bush has been retention of the status quo. The fact that Mr Perot has quit
while Mr Clinton is in the climactic stages of a successful convention,
leaping ahead in popularity, may also provide an extra boost, even
justification for the claim that it was Mr Clinton, not the president, who
proved the Perot-slayer.
The president has also been portraying himself recently as the architect of
change. But he has also consistently maintained that the electorate will not
make up its mind until the last two months of the campaign, when he promises
to pull out the stops.
In reality, Mr Perot's softer support had already begun to switch in droves
to Mr Clinton, as all the recent polls prove. Its harder core element is
probably overwhelmingly Republican and concentrated in the southwest and
west. If Mr Bush wins this back, he will have evened the odds.
The all-southern Clinton-Gore ticket is intended also to boost the Democrats
in the deep south, where a breakthrough is imperative and where Mr Bush is
still more popular than elsewhere. The three-way contest would have been
helpful here.
But the Perot factor was more than just a demand for change. It was a direct
and adverse reflection on the perceived abilities of Mr Clinton and Mr Bush,
seen as practitioners of politics as usual.
Mr Clinton may be on the up at the moment, while Mr Bush is not. But both
still have a way to go to convince voters they can lead the country
effectively. The Perot jury is not the only one whose judgment is still
being reserved.
The disappearance of the Texan also illustrates the immense practical
difficulties of waging an independent campaign, albeit one whose appeal is
purely populist and not lacking in finance.
The departure from the Perot camp on Wednesday of Mr Ed Rollins, President
Ronald Reagan's campaign strategist in 1984, shows that professionals and
amateurs do not live together easily in politics, that a campaign chest
which is a personal fortune is not a common campaign property, and that the
executive decision-making of business and the collectivity and compromises
that are the essence of politics are inherently very different.
Mr Perot reached the peak of his popularity last month very much on his own.
He captured the TV talk shows, set up his own phone banks, conducted his own
personal schedule, and spent his own money - not a lot of it, compared with
what he has and what he would have to spend if he were to run for president,
but a sum beyond the reach of just about any other mortal.
He brought in Mr Rollins and Mr Hamilton Jordan, Mr Jimmy Carter's former
political guru, 45 days ago because, he said, 'world class' supporters (his
volunteers around the country) needed 'world class' professional direction.
A lot of the volunteers promptly took umbrage.
The specific grouses of Mr Rollins are symptomatic of the dichotomy. Mr
Perot did not think the experienced ad-man they wanted to hire was worth the
money; he reportedly did not show them in advance his patronising speech
last weekend to a black audience (if he did, their professionalism was
wanting); and he did not believe them when they said he was losing momentum
and had to kick into another and more expensive gear straight away.
Now he does not have to. The billion-dollar man has gone back to earning
more millions. It is probably easier than politics anyway.
US and Mexican share prices surged yesterday after Mr Ross Perot, the Texan
billionaire who had voiced opposition to a free-trade pact with Mexico,
announced he would not run for the US presidency, Our Foreign Staff reports.
On Wall Street Mr Perot's decision provoked a brief spurt of buying in the
belief that President George Bush's chances of re-election had increased.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 16.22 points higher at 3,361.63.
In Mexico, the Bolsa Price Index of the 40 most actively traded shares
advanced 52.26 points within the first two hours in a rally led by foreign
buying of Mexican shares.
It closed 49.42 points, or 3.01 per cent, higher at 1,689.18. Shares in
Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) jumped 275 pesos to 7,750 pesos. The company
accounts for about 25 per cent of the Mexican market's Dollars 127bn
capitalisation.
Mexico supports the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would link
its economy more closely to those of Canada and the US. Mr Perot's presence
in the election race contributed to a slide in the Mexican market from its
June 1 record of 1,907.36.

<TEXT>
TOYOTA, Japan's biggest car maker, is to start importing US-made Toyota cars
into Japan next month.
The move is important symbolically as an effort to reduce Japan's huge trade
surplus with the US, particularly given Toyota's huge market power in Japan,
where it claims 42 per cent of car sales. It will also help Toyota meet a
growing domestic demand for estates (station wagons).
Toyota will import the right-hand-drive version of its Camry Wagon,
manufactured at its plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, to be sold domestically
as the Scepter.
The company has set an ambitious sales target of 700 units a month. It will
compete against Honda's US-made and designed Accord Wagon, whose sales have
averaged 836 a month this year.
Nissan said yesterday it would next year start importing to Japan a small
wagon to be manufactured at its Mexican assembly plant.
Honda remains the leader in so-called reverse imports, with average monthly
imports of 1,146 units of three different models of the Accord.
The cars tend to be sold as premium products without the extensive
discounting now available on domestically-made models.
Nissan has been selling an average of 192 UK-made Primera models, while
Mitsubishi has sold 46 US and Australian-made models each month. Mazda has
sold about 160 US-made cars bearing the Ford marque each month. Ford owns a
24 per cent stake in Mazda.
Total sales of imported vehicles in Japan in the first six months of the
year came to 85,129 units, down 12.7 per cent from a year ago. European
marques were hit hardest.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BEING a delegate at this week's Democratic convention may involve a lot of
parties, but it is no picnic.
As far as the party bosses are concerned, the cheering and waving of
posters, which came to a climax last night, are essential elements of
prime-time television coverage. But on the ground, life is different.
Take Mr Roy Oppenheim, a 32-year-old delegate from Florida who came to New
York committed to Mr Paul Tsongas. Like many of his nearly 5,000 peers he is
a first-time delegate who is bored and frustrated.
Mr Oppenheim is a property lawyer and lifelong political junkie who first
became active in 1972 when, at the age of 12, he worked on the George
McGovern campaign.
In 1980 he worked for Ted Kennedy's campaign and in 1988 he gave speeches in
Florida as a surrogate for Al Gore, then one of the candidates for the
party's presidential nomination. He formed a local Democratic party club in
Fort Lauderdale and was later asked to stand for Congress, an offer he
turned down because he reckoned it was 'too soon'.
Mr Oppenheim says he became a Tsongas delegate - one of 30 in the Florida
delegation - 'because I wanted to influence the process, especially on the
vital issue of education'. As with many delegates, he is paying his own way.
He estimates his total travel, hotel and other expenses will come to more
than Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,050).
In the small hours of Wednesday morning, as he watched a doleful Mr Tsongas
greet hundreds of delegates at a low-key reception at Central Park's Tavern
on the Green restaurant, Mr Oppenheim opened up.
'I haven't participated in any decisions here in New York. I arrived on
Sunday, checked into my hotel, found a ton of uninteresting paper and nine
baseball caps from sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Con Edison. Then I was
told that for security reasons I have to collect a new set of credentials
every morning, between 6.45 and 7.30.'
On Sunday afternoon he got down to the most common activity of most
delegates - going to receptions. The first was a party in the dinosaur room
of the Museum of Natural History, sponsored by Merrill Lynch and featuring a
reggae band and Caribbean food.
On Monday he sat through a breakfast meeting of the Florida delegation and
found it so dreary he decided to pass on the others. Meetings of Tsongas
delegates 'were equally boring'.
During the afternoon and evening he has been on the convention floor. 'But I
do nothing. It is hard to hear most of the speeches so I walk around a
little, talk and read newspapers,' he said.
'There has been absolutely nothing for me to do here. It's a farce. This is
really a media circus and I am just a pawn in the process. But I guess I'm a
willing pawn. It may be boring here in New York, but back home it plays very
well.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Gore calls for new generation of leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Al Gore last night performed his first big duty as the Democratic
party's vice-presidential candidate: warming up the audience of party
delegates at Madison Square Garden for the man who last week picked him to
be his running mate.
Trading tales of hardship, Mr Gore paved the way for Governor Bill Clinton's
story of growing up poor in Arkansas with the tale of his son's almost fatal
car accident in Baltimore three years ago, according to a draft text of the
speech he had prepared for his acceptance of his party's vice-presidential
nomination.
'When you've seen your reflection in the empty stare of a boy waiting for a
second breath of life, you realise that we weren't put here on earth to look
out for our needs alone; we're part of something much larger than
ourselves,' he said.
Attacking President George Bush and Vice-President Dan Quayle for 'making
excuses for deadlock and decay', Mr Gore called for 'a new generation of
leadership for the United States of America to take over'.
'The American spirit isn't gone. But we vow here tonight that in November,
George Bush and Dan Quayle will be,' he said. 'They've had their chance and
they have failed. They have taxed the many to enrich the few. It is time for
them to go.'
Mr Gore hailed his running mate's achievements as governor of Arkansas in
shaking up one of the worst school systems in America, undertaking to reform
the welfare system and balancing 11 budgets.
He called, too, for a new effort to save the earth's environment - the cause
for which he has become best known during his Senate career.
'For generations we have believed we could abuse the earth because we
weren't really connected to it. But now we must face the truth. the task of
saving the earth's environment must and will become the central organising
principle of the post-cold war world.'
But he also appealed to those who have been supporting Mr Ross Perot not to
give up their fight for change.

companies to transmit television programmes to homes over their telephone
lines, a move which could eventually mean strong competition for the
monopolistic American cable television industry.
However, the ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees
the communications industry, is only a first step towards encouraging
competition in the potentially vast market for television-based home
information services.
First, the FCC has maintained a ban on the telephone companies' owning a
significant stake in a producer of the programmes transmitted through its
communications networks. Its ruling prevents the phone companies from owning
more than 5 per cent of a programmer, a slight relaxation from the previous
1 per cent limit.
Second, the telephone companies are in no position to offer immediate
transmission services, since video signals do not travel well on the copper
wire lines which currently connect nearly all American homes to the
telephone network.
Video signals require either coaxial cable, which is used by the cable
industry, or the new technology of fibre-optic cable, which can transmit
vast amounts of data of a high quality.
However, the telephone companies are expected to rewire much of their local
networks with fibre-optic cable over the next 20 years, and they have long
argued that the FCC move was vital to encourage them to make this
investment.
The cable television industry, which is under attack in Congress for the
sharply rising price of its service and fears the financial muscle of the
phone companies, opposed the FCC move.
However, the cable industry is also protected from competition under a 1984
act which prevents telephone groups from owning cable operators in areas
where the phone companies operate.
Mr Bob Levetown, vice-chairman of Bell Atlantic, a large regional phone
company serving part of the eastern seaboard, said the FCC move was 'an
important first step' but consumers would only realise 'the true benefits of
competition and choice when telephone companies have complete freedom to
provide video programming'. He urged Congress to remove the remaining entry
barriers.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Clinton reaches out to middle class: Democratic presidential
candidate sketches his vision to the convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas last night set out to reintroduce himself
to American voters as he accepted the Democratic party's nomination to be
its presidential candidate.
After a week in which the Democrats have tried to redefine themselves in the
public eye as a more moderate party that cares about and understands the
'forgotten middle class,' Mr Clinton's speech added an autobiographical
portrait designed to demonstrate a vision rooted in his life and upbringing,
rather than just a politician's promises.
In a draft of the acceptance speech he was due to deliver to the Democratic
convention in New York's Madison Square Garden last night, Mr Clinton told a
personal tale of growing up in the town of Hope, Arkansas; of the father who
died before he was born; of the mother who left him with her parents so she
could train to be a nurse; and of the grandfather who taught him 'to look up
to people other folks looked down on'.
'I am a product of America's middle class. And when I am president you will
be forgotten no more,' he said.
After a bruising primary campaign in which Mr Clinton's popular image came
to be dominated by doubts about his character, his marriage and veracity,
last night's acceptance speech - due to be broadcast live during peak
television viewing hours - offered him the chance to kick off the general
election campaign by painting a different picture of himself.
Clinton aides described the text as an optimistic speech, much of it 'just
basic biographical' information.
'You can't understand what it is he wants to do for America until you
understand where he has come from,' said Mr Paul Begala, one of the advisers
who helped Mr Clinton write the speech.
But Mr Clinton also sought to weave some of the more detailed policies he
has espoused - his economic growth plan, health care reform, fewer civil
servants and more policemen, parental leave legislation - into his broader
theme of a 'new covenant' offering opportunity to the American people and
demanding responsibility in return.
'Now that we have changed the world, it is time to change America. We have
got to go beyond the brain-dead politics of Washington and give our people
the kind of government they deserve: a government that works for them,' he
said.
The phrase 'new covenant' brought to mind John F. Kennedy's successful 1960
election call for a 'new frontier.' It was yet another example of how Mr
Clinton and his equally young running mate, Senator Al Gore, are trying to
pitch their ticket as offering a 'new generation of leadership' in the image
of JFK.
Openly appealing for the support of disgruntled voters turned loose
yesterday by Mr Ross Perot's decision not to enter the election as an
independent, the Democratic candidate acknowledged that his party, too, must
change.
'Because we are making those changes we are, in the words of Ross Perot, a
revitalised Democratic party. I am well aware that those who rallied to his
cause wanted to enlist in an army of patriots for change. We say to them:
join us - together we will revitalise America.'
Mr Clinton took aim at President George Bush, his opponent, as a man 'caught
in the grip of a failed economic theory' who had 'raised taxes on the people
who drive pick-up trucks and lowered taxes on people who ride in
limousines.'
He also criticised him for lacking any vision of a better future. 'Of all
the things George Bush has done that I disagree with, perhaps the thing that
bothers me most has been how he derides and degrades the American tradition
of seeing - and seeking - a better future. He mocks it as 'the vision
thing',' Mr Clinton complained.
'Right now I know how President Lincoln felt when General McClellan wouldn't
attack in the Civil War. He asked him: 'If you're not going to use your
army, may I borrow it?' George Bush, if you won't use your power to help
people, step aside.'
Mr Clinton's acceptance speech has been viewed by some political pundits as
the most important test of his career.
If he was not expected to outshine in eloquence the electrifying nomination
speech given on Wednesday night by Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, he was
certainly set to put behind him the ghost of his own dismal speech
nominating Governor Michael Dukakis at the 1988 convention.
The convention over, Mr Clinton is not going to draw breath to plot his
campaign strategy for the autumn. He and Senator Gore will embark today on
an eight-state bus tour taking them from Coatsville, Pennsylvania, to
Vandalia, Illinois.
Mr Clinton has emerged from this week's Democratic party convention with a
heartening boost to his standing in public opinion. But Democratic
candidates have surged before in the wake of their convention, and have
rarely been able to sustain the momentum.
The memory of Governor Dukakis is raw in Democrats' minds. The convention in
1988 helped boost Mr Dukakis by 6 percentage points, opening up a gap of 17
points over then vice-president George Bush. Party organisers are keen to
avoid repeating the strategic mistakes that then frittered away the lead.
'Dukakis made a mistake in taking a break. Bill Clinton and Al Gore are not
going to make that mistake. They are going to come out of this with a pop in
the polls, but then George Bush is going to get a pop from his convention,'
said Congressman Les Aspin.
Mr Ron Brown, party chairman, said his organisation was ready to move into
action behind Mr Clinton's candidacy. 'He is going to leave this convention
on the run. There is going to be no hiatus while he goes back to Arkansas to
plan the campaign.'
The bus tour is designed to keep the Democratic candidates in close touch
with the US heartland.
'The idea of the trip is that they are going to hit the ground running and
take the country back,' said Mr George Stephanopoulos, Mr Clinton's deputy
campaign manager.
On a whistle-stop tour by aircraft, he said, 'you don't get the feel for the
country'.
But Clinton advisers also expect to take their campaign to a broader
audience with an early wave of television advertising - a decision made
easier by the campaign's vastly improved finances.
After ending the primary season with a deficit, Mr Clinton has managed to
raise enough money to pay off debts and his staff salaries, and can begin
the general election campaign in good shape.

BRUSSELS yesterday put forward its long-awaited plan for EC states to

external frontier, to let them dispense with such checks along internal
borders, David Buchan writes from Brussels.
The European Commission's draft regulation, covering the tricky category of
dual-use and nuclear goods which have a military as well as civil
application, is designed to remove another pretext for keeping customs
officers busy at internal EC borders after January 1, when the single EC
market is due to take effect.

<TEXT>
MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, is pressing China to resolve a
list of trade disputes by mid-August, well ahead of an October 10 deadline
set last year, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
Mr Michael Moskow, her deputy, said yesterday that Mrs Hills had given the
Chinese government a list of trade issues she wants resolved during talks in
Beijing starting on August 17. Otherwise she will publish a list of
potential sanctions and begin public hearings.
President George Bush, who has been portrayed as being soft on China, could
gain politically should the US retaliate in October or win substantial
concessions from Beijing.
It is usual to begin any retaliatory process once a deadline has passed.
However, Mr Moskow said a similar threat produced an agreement with Beijing
on intellectual property rights earlier this year.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UN move to end deadlock in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND senior United Nations envoy is joining efforts in Baghdad to break
a 12-day deadlock involving UN weapons inspectors and the Iraqi authorities.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN special commission charged with
overseeing the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is joining
Mr Douglas Englund, head of UN field operations, to persuade the Iraqi
government to allow inspectors to enter an agriculture ministry building.
But Iraq's official press yesterday stepped up its condemnation of the UN
inspectors, who are seeking documents in the building believed to detail
parts of Iraq's chemical weapons programme. The state-run al-Jumhouriyah
newspaper accused Mr Englund of 'empty haughtiness', while other government
papers called the UN inspectors 'deviants'.
Iraqi officials say nothing related to its weapons programme lies in the
agriculture ministry building and that a search by UN chemical weapons
inspectors would insult the Baghdad government and breach Iraq's
sovereignty.
The US state department on Wednesday warned Iraq that failure to comply with
the UN demands would threaten the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, which
established the special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
The US said yesterday it was consulting allies about possible ways of
forcing Iraq to honour the UN inspection demand. Although spokesmen at the
defence and state departments left open the implied threat of renewed
military action, a senior US official indicated such action was not
expected.
Both departments said the US was 'very determined' that Iraq give UN
inspectors unimpeded access.
However, Iraq has insisted that it will not permit the UN team entry the
building - a limitation on inspectors' freedom to operate in Iraq which UN
officials say would set a precedent potentially fatal to the whole task of
monit-oring Iraq's weapons pro-grammes.

France's 45-year dock labour scheme expired yesterday, with the application

However, a handful of ports, led by Marseilles and Dunkirk, were yesterday
continuing to hold out against the reforms and the terms of a FFr2bn (Pounds
208m) early retirement and redundancy package from the government and
employers. As a result of the reforms, voted through parliament in May,
nearly half of France's 8,300 dockers will lose their jobs. The change means
dockers will be paid monthly at market rates by cargo handling companies,
instead of at centrally fixed rates paid by port authorities irrespective of
whether or not work is available.

MR Henri Emmanuelli, president of the French national assembly, was
yesterday summonsed to appear before a court between September 8 and 14 to
answer charges over alleged illicit fund raising by the ruling Socialist
party.
The move intensifies tensions between the government and the judicial
investigation system and will bring a long-running scandal over political
corruption into the public eye in the weeks before the September 20
referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Emmanuelli's lawyers said the summons, from the Rennes appeal court,
indicated he was likely to face charges in his capacity as former Socialist
party treasurer. He was expected to be charged with complicity in trading
favours, attempting to conceal this, and having illicitly collected cash for
the Socialist party from two construction companies, Urba and Gracco. This
was a charge against the Socialist party itself, said Mr Emmanuelli, and his
lawyers said he would therefore not resign.

NIGERIA is due to take delivery of 12 Czechoslovakian jet trainers in a
secret deal which could jeopardise efforts to renew a standby agreement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Negotiations on the IMF agreement, a precondition to further rescheduling of
Nigeria's Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15.7bn) external debt, are stalled. The main
hurdle is government over-spending, including defence outlays, which
resulted in a fiscal deficit last year of 35bn naira (Pounds 1bn).
Without a rescheduling arrangement, Nigeria will be unable to pay debt
service obligations this year of more than Dollars 5bn from forecast export
earnings of Dollars 9bn-10bn.
The purchase of the 12 Aero L-39 Albatros trainers is believed to be part of
a larger order, made last year, for 30 L-39s. Defence experts say the deal
is worth more than Dollars 90m. Diplomats believe that part of the payment
will be in crude oil. The military government of President Ibrahim
Babangida, scheduled to hand over power to a civilian administration at the
end of this year, is taking delivery of a second controversial arms order.
The first batch of an order for 80 British Vickers Mark 3 tanks, worth more
than Dollars 225m, has arrived at Lagos port. Nigeria already has over 70
Mark 3 tanks.
Western donors say the two defence deals are part of a web of
extra-budgetary spending which has undermined the country's economic reform
programme. Last year, in a confidential report, the World Bank strongly
criticised the lack of accountability and transparency in public spending
programes, and questioned the accuracy of figures for oil export earnings.
Defence experts say the Czech order makes no strategic sense. The country
faces little external threat, and the priority should be maintenance of the
existing sizeable air force fleet. The fleet includes 23 Russian MiG 21s, 15
British Jaguars, 21 German Alphajets, and 12 Italian Aeromacchi MB339s. Most
are grounded for lack of spare parts and because of inadequate servicing.
Many of the aircraft in the air force's transporter fleet are also grounded.
'The deals make no sense when you look at the military's maintenance needs,'
said one defence expert.
'But the big boys always choose to buy new machines because there is a
bigger opportunity for graft.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations last night prepared to send an envoy to South Africa to
try to help end violence and bring about resumption of talks on the
country's constitutional future.
The Security Council gave the go-ahead to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
secretary general, to send a special representative there on a fact-finding
mission.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 15-member body after a two-day
debate.
Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), urged
the UN to take such a step as an initial measure in a speech during the
debate. He said the special envoy should help the UN to decide on subsequent
action which, he said, should include 'continuous monitoring' of the
situation in South Africa.
The UN resolution condemned 'escalating violence' in black townships, in
particular the massacre of 43 people at Boipatong last month.
But it sought to find some middle ground between the ANC and President FW de
Klerk's government. It urged South African authorities to take immediate
steps to end the violence and bring those responsible to justice, while at
the same time appealing to all factions to avoid violence.
The resolution underlined the importance of all parties resuming talks on a
new constitution as soon as possible.
The secretary general's emissary to South Africa would recommend measures to
help bring an end to the country's violence and create conditions under
which negotiations towards a non-racial government can be resumed.
Earlier, Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, renewed his
government's call to the ANC to take part in talks aimed at ending political
violence. He also left the way open for a future UN observer mission to
South Africa.
Mr Botha, in an address broadcast live on South African television, told the
UN security council that the government was 'prepared to consider' a role
for the international community 'in an observer or other acceptable
capacity', working alongside a monitoring group which would include the ANC
and Chief Mangosuthtu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
Mr Botha did not elaborate on this proposal, hinted at earlier by President
de Klerk.
It seemed clear that the government would raise no objection to despatch at
this stage of a UN envoy on a fact-finding visit.
But political observers last night doubted that the stalemate on the
country's constitutional talks had yet been broken. Most observers doubt
that a formal resumption of negotiations can begin before a UN envoy has
reported back to the security council.
Mr Botha told the UN the government had nothing to gain from the violence
that led to last month's decision by the ANC to suspend talks.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Battle for town rages despite ceasefire order: The latest
Bosnia peace moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERB and Moslem forces exchanged artillery fire at the embattled Bosnian
town of Gorazde yesterday long after the leader of Bosnia's Serbs had
ordered a ceasefire there.
Serbs besieging the town were ordered to cease fire by Mr Radovan Karadzic,
who is in London for the European Community-sponsored peace negotiations
chaired by Lord Carrington.
But according to Reuter newsagency reports, the order appeared to have
little effect on the ground.
Sarajevo radio editor Zoran Pirolic said he had been in contact with Gorazde
by short wave radio more than six hours after the London announcement and
fighting continued unabated. Serb forces were meeting fierce resistance, he
said.
Gorazde is a town of 37,000 inhabitants, 70 per cent of them Moslem. EC
diplomats in London said Serb irregulars were besieging the town as part of
a plan to 'ethnically cleanse' the region and annex eastern Bosnia to
Serbia.
Mr Karadzic told reporters that he was proposing a l4-day truce agreement by
the three sides at the London negotiations, which he said would enter a
third day today.
Despite differences and the fact that all three sides did not meet, Mr Jose
Cutileiro, the EC mediator, said: 'I am not that pessimistic.'
Mr Karadzic denied Serb forces were involved in deportations, expulsions,
and killings, despite numerous eye-witness accounts. 'What we want is a
Bosnia-Hercegovina which is based on three constituent states. With this in
mind, we support the current EC negotiations,' he said.
He said these three ethnic states would consist of Moslem, Serb and Croat
regions.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said he wanted a unitary
state, adding that the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina along ethnic lines
would fail to take into account mixed marriages, as well as those who
perceived themselves to be Bosnian.
'What Serb extremists are doing in Bosnia today is what the Nazis did in
world war two. Identity and ethnicity are being imposed on innocent
civilians,' he said.
In an open letter to Lord Carrington, and Mr Cutileiro, Mr Silajdzic asked
the EC to stop the flow of weapons into Bosnia from neighbouring Serbia and
Montenegro.
Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats and a close ally of Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman, said he would support the EC Lisbon plan of March
9 which stipulated that Bosnia would be composed of several national units,
but that the current borders of the republic would remain intact.
However, EC diplomats in London said Croatia and Serbia were working on
dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina between them, as witness the recent declaration
of a Croatian-run state within a state in western Hercegovina.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK warns Serbia over 'war crimes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN signalled yesterday that it may press for international action to
investigate allegations of war crimes committed by Serbs against Moslems in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, said abuse against Moslems
was 'obviously a war crime under the terms of the Geneva Conventions, and we
give due warning that is so'.
She added: 'The Serbs are following a systematic policy of 'ethnic
cleansing' and that has to be dealt with by the international community.'
Downing Street officials said there was sufficient prima facie evidence of
torture and indiscriminate killing of civilians to justify an investigation,
possibly under United Nations auspices.
However, the Foreign Office said last night it was unclear if external
countries could have jurisdiction over atrocities committed in another
country's internal conflict.
Baroness Chalker was speaking after a meeting in London between Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, and Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for
refugees, to discuss Britain's contribution to humanitarian aid for
Yugoslavia.
Mrs Ogata told the prime minister that she regarded the refugee problem in
Yugoslavia as the worst in Europe since the second world war.
The UK has sent medical staff to Yugoslavia at a cost of Pounds 25m. Mr
Major promised he would use Britain's EC presidency to persuade other member
states to attend a conference on refugees and other humanitarian issues,
called by Mrs Ogata in Geneva for July 29.
The conference is also likely to be used to press for international action
to stop breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
Baroness Chalker said reports from Mrs Ogata and from UK officials in the
region told of 'the purposeful pinpointing' of Moslems in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Their houses are shot up at night to threaten them to
leave the following morning, and, when these Moslems have left, the houses
are then set on fire from the inside,' said Baroness Chalker.
'I don't believe people know how bad it is.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Germany faces investment fall and
slower growth

THE Bundesbank's action will expose the German economy to the risk of
falling investment, slower recovery and increased long-term interest rates,
German bankers, industrialists and economists warned yesterday.
However, the Bonn government, which routinely supports Bundesbank decisions
and is careful to show respect for its independence, gave few clues to its
real feelings.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said he expected the discount rate rise
would 'help bring monetary growth nearer to the target range without
burdening economic development in east and west Germany'.
Others were more outspoken. Mr Klaus Friedrich, soon to take over as chief
economist at the Dresdner Bank, said the decision was 'brave but wrong'.
He took issue with the anti-inflationary arguments of Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
Bundesbank president. All experts agreed inflation was heading down in any
case, he said, and there was no need for the extra downward pressure which
would come from yesterday's interest rate increase.
Mr Willi Leibfritz, chief economic analyst at the respected Ifo economics
institute in Munich, said he thought the central bank's move might have been
less dramatic had economic growth not been so strong in the first quarter.
He accepted the bank's top priority had to be control of monetary growth.
However, the move represented a risk to recovery. Investment in construction
and plant could be hit, demand would be depressed, profits be reduced and
the period of economic weakness could be prolonged, Mr Leibfritz suggested.
'It is certainly very difficult to find the balance between fighting
inflation and fighting economic down-swing.
'After last December's discount rate increase, long-term interest rates
fell, and it is possible the Bundesbank expects a similar effect this time.
But I rather expect long-term rates could increase a little or at least not
be reduced,' he added.
The BDI federation of German industries said it doubted that the rates
increase would damp monetary growth quickly. 'The measures need time to
work,' it said. Meanwhile, the risks to Germany's performance should not be
under-estimated. Economic reconstruction in the east relied on heavy
investments.
The ZDH association, representing small businesses, said its members, with
limited if any access to capital markets, would be hit hard by inevitable
increases in overdraft charges and suffer liquidity problems.
Despite the doubts, all branches of industry accepted that the bank had to
act. The BDI said that while there was no ideal solution, 'the considerable
over-stepping of money supply targets demands a clear stability signal.
'Only tight money can guarantee a stable currency'.
The following is the text of the statement issued by the Bundesbank
yesterday (translation by Reuters):
The Central Council of the Bundesbank, at its meeting today in the presence
of Economics Minister Jurgen W Mollermann, conducted a review of the 1992
money supply target and the current situation in monetary policy. It made
the following decisions:
The German Bundesbank maintains the money supply goal established in
Decemeber last year, which envisages an increase in M3 money supply of 3.5
to 5.5 per cent from fourth quarter 1991 to fourth quarter 1992. The
assumptions which were the basis of the money supply goal at that time are
not essentially different today.
The discount rate of the German Bundesbank will be raised with effect from
July 17 from eight per cent to 8.75 per cent. With this measure, the
Bundesbank aims to stem price pressures, monetary growth and excessive
growth in credit volume and also to strengthen confidence in maintaining the
stability of the mark in the currently difficult conditions in united
Germany.

FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Europeans impeded by policies
'made in Frankfurt' - Bundesbank serves notice that the stability of its own
currency remains a top priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Germany's policies on European integration, according to government
statements in recent years, have always been aimed at producing 'a European
Germany, not a German Europe'.
Those words, immortalised by author Thomas Mann, must be ringing hollow in
the ears of European finance ministers as they ponder the impact of
yesterday's fourth Bundesbank tightening move since unification in October
1990.
Once again, the Bundesbank has served notice that its priority remains the
stability of its own currency - not that of any other European country.
This has important implications for the Maastricht timetable for European
economic and monetary union (Emu). The German central bank's conviction is
that European monetary affairs will be best looked after if they are kept
securely in German hands. The Bundesbank cannot, however, spell this out in
public.
Yesterday's action thus serves several interlocking purposes. Any move to
cut German inflation can be billed - as Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's
vice-president put it yesterday - as Germany's 'contribution' to the
Maastricht process.
The Bundesbank can correctly point out that it stopped short of taking the
more drastic interest rate step - an increase in the Lombard rate - which
would have looked like an all-out assault on Maastricht.
But the Bundesbank can also take comfort from the likelihood that
yesterday's discount rate increase, on balance, will impede fulfilment of
the Maastricht goals.
Several countries, led by Britain and France, are trying not to follow the
German move upwards. But yesterday's increase sets a firm floor under
European interest rates. Just at a time when most countries had hoped,
through easier credit, to develop the rhythm for economic recovery, they
find themselves dancing to an austere German tune.
Pursuing interest rate policies marked 'made in Frankfurt' is a political
irritant for most of Germany's neighbours. However, France, in particular,
has always thought that the effort would be worthwhile if, through improved
monetary co-operation, Emu were brought closer.
France's objective, under successive governments in Paris, is to manoeuvre
the Germans into a position where they will one day have to give up the
D-Mark and hand over European monetary supremacy to a European central bank.
Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, calls the process 'sharing'
monetary power.
Unfortunately, yesterday's action, by adding to the factors delaying any
firm European economic recovery, compounds the question marks over the
Maastricht plan of achieving Emu by 1999.
The probability that individual countries will reduce fiscal deficits - a
firm condition of the Maastricht process - will be heavily reduced if, as
seems likely, Europe remains stuck in a period of slow growth. This means
that Germany's partners - including Britain, even though it is not formally
signed up to Emu - may during the next few years be getting the worst of all
worlds.
Unless Britain and France can persuade the foreign exchange markets that
they can safely cut interest rates below German levels, Bonn's EC partners
will continue to suffer from high German interest rates in Germany.
At the same time, because of the deflationary impact of high European
interest rates, achieving the political goals behind the Emu process may
become more difficult.
Mr Brendan Brown, chief economist at Mitsubishi Finance in London, points
out that 'to get anywhere on the deficit targets (under Maastricht), Britain
and Italy in particular need to have high economic growth'. Their best
chance of achieving this, he says, is by improving export competitiveness
through a realignment in the European Monetary System.
For the moment, all EC countries are ruling out this step. This could
quickly change, Mr Brown believes, if the Italian lira, despite yesterday's
interest rate increase in Rome, is forced closer to its EMS floor against
the D-Mark.

FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Economists say French GDP will
still grow 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH business confidence will be hit by the rise in the Bundesbank's
discount rate, but the economy will stay on course for 2 per cent GDP growth
this year, up from 1.2 per cent in 1991, economists said.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, and Mr Jacques de Larosiere, central bank
governor, yesterday faced the rate rise with grim calm and stressed that
French monetary policy would remain unchanged.
Earlier in the week, Mr Sapin put pressure on Bonn to lower rates. French
employers say they see no hope for an interest rate fall for several months,
something they need to stimulate investment.
'Our investment situation is not good and this will make it worse,' a
Patronat employers' organisation official said.
Investment in French manufacturing industry fell by 7 per cent last year and
is set to decline 8 per cent in 1992, Insee, the state statistics institute,
said.
This reflects the fact that France already has among the highest real
borrowing costs in Europe, with a bank base rate of 9.85 per cent and annual
inflation at 3 per cent.
But companies can take some comfort from the fact that the Banque de France
is unlikely to raise its rates in response, because German discount rate
increases have little or no effect on market rates.
'The franc has been well within its EMS fluctuation margin in recent weeks,
so I don't expect an increase in French rates,' said Mr Jean-Michel Charpin,
chief economist at Banque Nationale de Paris.
'It would be useful to drop rates, but that is no longer possible. So we
expect continuation of an already gloomy economic situation.'
'I see no reason for the Banque de France to act now, though it will not
hesitate to raise rates if it sees the franc weakening,' Mr Jean-Francois
Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London, said. The D-Mark rose
slightly in Paris after the announcement to FFr3.38, but it fell back
towards the end of the day to FFr3.37.
The German move was likely to hit French equity and bond markets, Mr
Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez, predicted. 'Europe will have to live
painfully for a few more months with high German interest rates.'
The French CAC-40 stock market index fell slightly, on the announcement,
partially recovering to end the day down 0.11 per cent at 1,851.23.

FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Symbolic increase by central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank tightened the monetary screw a little more yesterday, but
argued that it had taken care to avoid drawing howls of pain from the rest
of Europe while seeking to reduce inflationary pressures in Germany. Only
time will tell whether it will succeed.
As expected, the 18-man central bank council made no change in the Lombard
rate of 9.75 per cent, which sets the ceiling for money market rates. An
increase in this rate would have upset financial markets and put pressure on
other countries to follow suit.
Instead, it raised the cost of commercial banks' refinancing to reduce
credit flow to companies and individuals by making it more expensive. This,
too, was expected in the form of a rise in the discount rate, but the
Bundesbank maintained its capacity for surprise by moving this up by 0.75
percentage points to 8.75 per cent, its highest since 1931.
'We thought the Bundesbank would do something symbolic,' said Mr Dieter
Wermuth, managing director of Caisse des Depots et Consignations' Frankfurt
subsidiary. 'This is more or less symbolic'.
Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of BHF-Bank, went a little further.
'It was another pinprick to emphasise the Bundesbank's restrictive policy'.
'We were seeking a solution appropriate for the domestic situation and which
tries to avoid any complications for our partner countries'. He gave no
indication the council had been split by the desire to tighten policy
further and avoid monetary overkill.
There was another modest surprise, in that the bank did not restrict access
to its funds to reinforce the interest rate move. The bank reaffirmed its
money supply target of 3.5-5.5 per cent for M3, which has been growing at an
annual rate of some 9 per cent.
Mr Schlesinger again stressed the Bundesbank's anxiety that inflation,
recently above 4 per cent, was too high. Its medium-term goal, incorporated
into the M3 target, is 2 per cent. He said money supply could not be allowed
to continue expanding at recent rates in view of the inflationary pressures
which could be exacerbated by next January's one percentage point rise in
value-added tax.
He was unhappy also about price trends in east Germany, where inflation was
around 6.5 per cent (excluding rises in rents from subsidised levels under
the old regime). Building prices in the east, where economic reconstruction
is getting under way, were some 20 per cent above those in the west.
Nor did he like the public sector wage deal which will put east German pay
at 80 per cent of the west German level in mid-1993. It is the costs of
rebuilding the east German economy that have led to the Bundesbank's
problems. But while Mr Schlesinger was pleased at the Bonn government's
efforts to curb the budget deficit, he was less happy at the continued
spending plans of the regional states, local authorities, and social
security bodies.
The main problem from unification for M3 has been the rush of lending to
finance investments in the east. This is beneficial in broad economic terms.
But because corporate investments in east Germany are subsidised, roughly a
sixth of all German bank lending to companies and private persons is highly
insensitive to interest rate moves. This means rates have to be even higher
to affect bank lending, which has risen at an annual 11.5 per cent this
year. Mr Schlesinger said the latest M3 growth figure for May was 8.7 per
cent, slightly less than the 9 per cent first reported.

FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Setback to US hopes for domestic
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank move comes as a severe disappointment to the US
administration, which has based its own hopes of a domestic economic
recovery largely on a policy of pressing the Federal Reserve to make
repeated cuts in its discount rate.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, has tried for some time to urge
his opposite numbers in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations for a
more concerted effort to boost world economic growth, and claimed some
success in this direction at the Munich economic summit this month.
The Munich agreement, however, relied heavily on the premise that Germany's
promise to rein in its budget deficit would pave the way for interest rate
cuts.
Senior Treasury officials have until now been careful not to blame the
Bundesbank for Germany's relatively high interest rates, criticising instead
the German federal budget deficit and heavy borrowing by quasi-governmental
organisations such as the state railway and telecommunications companies.
Although yesterday's German move was not unexpected on Wall Street,
economists and foreign exchange analysts said it would put the already shaky
dollar under further pressure.
Mr Steve Giovanis, a forex dealer with Merrill Lynch, said during a midday
break from hectic trading: 'It feels as though short-term the pressure is
not off (the dollar), particularly with these other rate increases in Europe
today. The rate differentials just continue to be enormous' - referring to
the gap between the 3.25 per cent yield on US short-term Treasury bills and
the near-10 per cent yield on comparable German securities.
The latest German rate increase could not have happened at a worse time for
the dollar, coming barely two weeks after the Fed slashed domestic interest
rates to stimulate an ailing economic recovery.
Economists said there was little the Fed could do over the short term to
protect the dollar, except to try to hold it up through intervention in the
foreign exchange markets. Mr Joe Taylor, foreign exchange analyst with
Technical Data in Boston, said: 'The Fed is certainly in no position to
tighten (monetary policy) given the politically sensitive time period we're
in and the state of the economy.'
Mr Taylor warned that the dollar could fall further against the D-Mark over
the next few days and weeks, testing its most recent low against the German
currency of DM1.44.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Bush and Clinton vie for votes as Perot quits race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE will not be a President Ross Perot nor even a candidate Ross Perot.
The billionaire Texas businessman yesterday said he was abandoning his
independent bid for the White House.
The announcement came as Governor Bill Clinton prepared to deliver his
nomination acceptance speech to the Democratic convention in New York last
night. Both Mr Clinton and President George Bush made a rapid pitch to pick
up the supporters of the erstwhile independent.
After telephone calls to the Perot camp, both reported warm conversations
and claimed to represent the sort of change Mr Perot wanted.
Mr Perot said that with the Democratic party now revived, he had concluded
that, if he ran, the November election would leave no outright winner and
the presidency would have to be decided early in the new year in the House
of Representatives.
The country could not afford such a hiatus and any new president was
entitled to have the time between the election and the inauguration to form
a new government, he said.
Mr Perot did not endorse Mr Bush nor Mr Clinton. He urged his volunteers to
continue to register his name on state ballots so the other parties would
have ready-made lists of those concerned about the state of the country. His
presence on the ballot could still make him a factor in some states, but,
judging by calls to radio and TV talk shows, many supporters felt betrayed.
Mr Perot said he thought the Democrats had done 'a brilliant job' in
reviving themselves and blamed the Bush administration for a number of
severe problems, including the federal deficit. He also appeared to favour a
strong president working with a party of the same persuasion in Congress,
which is likely to remain in Democratic hands.
Asked repeatedly at a press conference to say whether this constituted a
preference, he responded: 'I was afraid you'd get that impression', adding
he was endorsing nobody.
Mr Perot's withdrawal came less than a day after the resignation of Mr Ed
Rollins, his senior campaign manager, and as polls showed his popularity
plummeting. A Washington Post/ABC survey showed Mr Clinton at 45 per cent,
Mr Bush on 28 per cent and Mr Perot down to 20 per cent. A poll last night
by the New York Daily News gave Mr Clinton 45 per cent and Mr Bush 33 per
cent in a two-man race.
The text of Mr Clinton's planned speech to the convention, was upbeat and
designed to reveal more of his personality and roots in the country he wants
to lead. Its climax was a reference to his birthplace in Arkansas, but he
also affirmed other values. 'I am a product of America's middle class and
when I am your president you will not be forgotten,' he said.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow convictions fall in new blow to SFO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office yes-terday suffered the most severe blow yet to its
reputation when four City advisers found guilty of fraud over the Blue Arrow
affair had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed and Mr Nicholas Wells, all former
executives of National Westminster's merchant banking arm County NatWest,
and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former director of Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker,
had their convictions overturned after a three-day hearing.
The appeal court decision prompted fresh calls for a review of City
regulation and the handling of alleged fraud cases by the courts.
The judges, Lord Justice Mann, Mr Justice Ognall and Mr Justice Buckley,
delayed giving the reasons for their decision.
The four men, cleared of conspiracy to mislead the markets by secretly
buying shares in the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue, expressed their delight
at the appeal court decision.
Their lawyers had argued that the convictions were unsafe because of the
length and complexity of the trial and because of the cutting down at a late
stage of the indictment.
The failure of the prosecution provoked criticism in the City and at
Westminster. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange,
said the case had proved an 'appalling waste of money and resources'.
He said: 'Something that is as long-drawn-out as this is inherently
undesirable. It does not seem to offer justice to the accused, or to
society.'
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, who speaks on City matters for the Labour party, said:
'Either the law is unviable or the Serious Fraud Office's ability to
inter-pret it is defective.'
As a result of the latest judgment, the costs of the trial - estimated at
Pounds 35m - are now almost certain to be met from public funds, and not
from the defendants' employers.
The SFO would only say that an urgent review of the case was under way
following the court's judgment.
Two other Blue Arrow trials are still pending. Mr Charles Villiers and Ms
Elizabeth Brimelow, both former County NatWest directors, and Mr Paul
Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, both Phillips &amp; Drew executives, are still
charged with conspiracy to defraud over their roles in the Blue Arrow issue.
It is widely expected that yesterday's decision will force the Serious Fraud
office to drop these charges.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Decision helps ease pressure on UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE City and Whitehall breathed a collective sigh of relief when it became
clear that the UK would not be forced into following the German discount
rate rise.
Although the  3/4 percentage point increase in the German rate exceeded
expectations, the Bundesbank's decision to leave its internationally
important Lombard rate unchanged at 9 3/4 per cent meant no market pressure
for an increase in British bank base rates from 10 per cent.
The news that average earnings in Britain showed the lowest annual increase
for 25 years in May, with an underlying rise of 6 1/2 per cent, lent some
support to sterling.
The German decision was welcomed by the UK government as 'clearly
preferable' to a Lombard rate increase.
While City analysts warned that the pound would be vulnerable to mood swings
in the days ahead, the government repeated its commitment to take sterling
into the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism at the existing
DM2.95 EMS central rate.
Officials made clear that the government would keep this pledge in the
unlikely event of Germany revaluing the D-Mark. They said that Britain would
set interest rates at the level necessary to keep sterling in the ERM.
The pound, which dipped immediately after the Bundesbank's decision,
recovered in London to finish at DM2.855, up 1 pfennig from Wednesday's
close. Money market rates in London eased slightly: the 3 month interbank
rate, which usually acts as the bellwether for base rates, dipped to about
10 1/8 per cent, from 10 3/16 per cent the day before.
The London equity market fell prey to doubts as the conviction grew that
there could be no reduction in German - and hence UK - interest rates this
year. The FT-SE 100 index finished down 3 at 2,483.4.
Events in Frankfurt overshadowed UK jobless figures, which were unexpectedly
good. The 7,000 rise to 2.72m in seasonally adjusted unemployment in June
was the smallest for two years. Economists expect a higher rate of increase
this month, but longer-term trends suggest unemployment growth is slowing.
The slowdown in average earnings growth to 6.5 per cent in May from 7 per
cent in April points to lower inflation ahead. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK
economist at Warburg Securities, said research by Warburgs and Income Data
Services, the pay information group, suggested that average UK private
sector wage settlements have fallen below 4 per cent this month.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers, said retail price
inflation could fall to 2 per cent in the second half of 1993.
Speaking for the Confederation of British Industry, Professor Douglas
McWilliams, its chief economic adviser, said the faster-than-expected fall
in inflation meant there was 'no case for a rise in UK interest rates'.
Sir Brian Hill, president ot the Building Employers Confederation, said:
'The construction industry is already on its knees. A rise in British
interest rates at this stage would be disastrous.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Bundesbank rate up to 8.75%: Europe's central banks braced
as German move sends shudder through markets

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN central banks will today attempt to maintain their resistance to
upward pressure on interest rates following yesterday's monetary tightening
action by the German Bundesbank.
The Bundesbank's increase in the discount rate by a larger than expected
3/4 point to 8 3/4 per cent, sent a nervous shudder through foreign exchange
and securities markets yesterday. But with Britain and France both refusing
to follow the German lead, the Bundesbank failed to touch off a generalised
increase in European interest rates.
The Bundesbank, at a meeting of its 18-man central bank council, raised its
main rate for lending to banks in a determined signal of its desire to damp
domestic inflation and monetary growth. But it also sought to mollify its
European partners by keeping unchanged its 9 3/4 per cent Lombard rate,
which has a greater impact on money markets than the discount rate.
The only exception to the generally unruffled response was the increase in
the Bank of Italy's discount rate to 13 3/4 per cent from 13 per cent to
defend the lira. Belgium and the Netherlands, which closely follow the
Bundesbank's moves, made only smaller technical increases in central bank
lending rates.
The German discount rate now stands at its highest since September 1931. The
continuous rise in German lending rates during the past four years ranks as
the longest in German monetary history.
Currencies within the European Monetary System managed to shrug off the
Bundesbank increase, while the US dollar and the Japanese yen both lost
ground in the aftermath of the decision.
Sterling strengthened against the D-Mark in New York at DM2.8666 against
DM2.8472 on Wednesday. The Italian lira was little changed at L758.8 to the
D-Mark compared with L761.65 on Wednesday.
The dollar lost 2 pfennigs in the immediate aftermath of the Bundesbank
announcement, but recovered later on news that Mr Ross Perot was withdrawing
from the US presidential race.
The Bundesbank admitted that it had reflected on the pressure from the rest
of Europe not to trigger interest rate rises in countries with weaker
economies.
'We considered very carefully the impact of this measure on our partners,'
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, told a press conference.
'Our measure mainly had domestic targets in mind, namely reducing the rise
of the money supply in its present magnitude.' Mr Schlesinger denied the
Bundesbank wanted a realignment of currencies in the European Monetary
System, saying any initiative was up to its partners.
This year, M3, the broad measure of money supply, has been rising at an
annualised rate of around 9 per cent against a target range of between 3.5
and 5.5 per cent. 'The expansion of M3 is too strong,' Mr Schlesinger said.
By raising the discount rate, the lower of its two key rates, the Bundesbank
intends to make it more expensive for commercial banks to obtain central
bank funds and thus curb high lending to companies and individuals.
The strong rise in bank lending, much of it to finance investment in east
Germany, is one of the main reasons for the steep increase in money supply.
Since investments there are subsidised heavily, past interest rate rises
have had less of an impact than they would otherwise have had, Mr
Schlesinger said.
The rise in the discount rate by as much as 0.75 percentage points - against
a generally expected half a point - showed the Bundesbank's concern about
inflation and its determination to keep its tight monetary policies on
course.
'The Bundesbank has had on the brakes for a long time and nothing has
happened, so it has raised rates again,' said Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief
economist at BHF-Bank. 'It is something more than just a symbolic measure.'
Other economists felt the Bundesbank should have waited for expected lower
inflation figures for July - the June rate was an annual 4.3 per cent.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): It's time for
a Pep - but which one? - In giving personal equity plans a fillip, the
chancellor has made the choice more difficult / The Experts' Panel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME for personal equity plans (Peps) seems finally to have arrived. The
chancellor's decision to raise the annual limit for investment in qualifying
unit and investment trust Peps from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000, seemed, on
initial figures to have opened the floodgates for pent-up demand.
About 230,000 new unit trust Peps were opened in the first three weeks of
this tax year alone, while net investment of Pounds 151m made it the best
month for sales since Peps were introduced.
All our experts made clear that this move has made Peps much more useful for
the general investing public. However, their varied choices show that there
can be serious problems choosing between unit and investment trusts. With
155 companies offering 1,414 unit trusts (at the end of April) investors can
be excused for feeling confused.
The case for Peps is clear: they allow investment in equities, traditionally
good for long-term growth, free of either capital gains tax or income tax.
But they do carry charges, which can eat into the tax advantages.
It is possible to buy Peps with shares in a single company up to a maximum
of Pounds 3,000, but these should be regarded as a distinct animal from a
'managed' Pep, and our experts have not considered them.
Yet even in this restricted field, there is room for differences of opinion.
Tony Shepherd, of Shepherd Associates, who is also chairman of the Institute
of Financial Planning, says:
'Selection must first depend on competitive performance and charges; but it
is also important that it does not upset the balance of the investor's
allocation of equity investments. Within his portfolio, the highest yielding
investments should be placed in the Pep to maximise the income tax
advantage.
'Unit trusts are competitive, with initial charges averaging 3 per cent if
commission paid to a fee-charging intermediary is reinvested. On investment
trusts, stockbroking commission, stamp duty and market spreads usually
result in a higher initial charge. But investment trusts generally have
lower annual management fees.
'Depending on the structure of the Pep, some may charge VAT, adding a
further 0.9 per cent charge up front. A number of companies make additional
annual charges of up to 1 per cent for the plan administration.
'Some investment trust plans make an initial charge of up to the equivalent
of 1 per cent plus VAT (based on a Pounds 6,000 investment), in addition to
the initial costs of the investment itself. Others charge between 3 and 5
per cent plus VAT (of which up to 3 per cent is commission for the adviser),
but this may include the cost of buying shares which can be an additional 1
to 1.5 per cent plus VAT on top of the underlying management charge.
'The unit trust Peps of M&amp;G, James Capel, Schroder and Fidelity are free of
additional charges, and each allow access to a range of funds likely to
continue to perform well. Selection of investment trust Peps is more
complex, but a new investor in equities - say, with no more than Pounds
1,500 to invest this year - could obtain a wide international spread at
modest cost with Foreign and Colonial.'
John Edwards, a former FT personal finance editor who now works as an
adviser at Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says:
'Recommending a Pep has become a lot easier since the last budget. Now it is
just a question of selecting the right trust for your Pep. A few years ago,
I considered investment trusts to be superior, and particularly favoured
Dunedin and Touche Remnant. But with discounts narrowing as the result of a
big influx of funds, I believe investment trusts have lost some of their
competitive advantage. They are inherently more risky. Maybe charges are
generally cheaper, but in the long run it is return on investment that
counts.
'So my first choice would be a unit Pep from Perpetual. This medium-sized
group has an excellent track record, winning quite a lot of awards over the
past 10 years. Furthermore it is one of the few groups to tailor funds
specifically for Pep investors. It has two special funds, the Growth Option
or the High Income Option, and I particularly favour the High Income Option
to avoid paying income tax.
'My other recommendations may seem a bit boring, and a bit surprising in
view of their recent track records. They are Fidelity and M&amp;G. The
performance of Fidelity funds read like a horror story in 1990, but it has
subsequently taken some drastic action to pull its stock up. It had to do
something. The group's decision to cut their initial charge from 5 to 2 per
cent provides further evidence that it is determined to recover lost ground,
and obviously makes it more attractive to investors.
'M&amp;G is somewhat similar. It, too, has suffered a rough time in recent years
as a result of the underperformance of small company stocks in particular.
But it is now doing a lot better in a rising market, and is well placed to
take advantage of any recovery in the UK economy. Its Recovery fund has a
superb long-time record, even though suffering some nasty blips in recent
years.'
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, has a slight preference for
investment trusts. He reasons as follows:
'A lot of people would invariably contribute to a Pep on a lump sum basis,
but there is nonetheless a strong argument for drip-feeding contributions on
a regular basis, and certainly the systematic savings would have innumerable
advantages over any form of saving life assurance may offer.
'There remain two further important factors - performance, which is of
overriding importance, and costs.
'There is no substitute for long-term consistent gains, particularly if you
have the ability to select more than one fund within your Pep.'
Mr Boyton's favoured four companies are set out below. He says they not only
produce considerable income (where applicable) but have made consistent
long-term gains for their investors.
Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trusts, which have a Pounds 50 initial charge,
and allow contributions from Pounds 100 up to Pounds 500.
James Capel unit trusts, which charge 5.25 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent
annual. They offer a selection of income, growth and tracker funds, with
monthly contributions from Pounds 50 to Pounds 530.12.
Stewart Ivory's New Saints Pep, which has an annual charge of Pounds 25,
excluding VAT. He describes this as one of the lowest charging Peps  -
monthly contributions are allowed from Pounds 150 to Pounds 500.
Touche Remnant, which offers four investment trusts, of which TR City of
London is the most popular. Charges are 5 per cent initially and 1.25 per
cent annually.
Angela Cooper, of Noble Lowndes, divides Peps into two categories:
share-only Peps and unit trusts.
Noble Lowndes operates a panel of 15 different providers for the two
different forms of Pep, all of which are on the list for different reasons.
These are the criteria she uses when selecting the most suitable Pep for a
client:
'An individual's attitude towards risk, together with the purpose for
investing in a Pep, will dictate the Pep providers which may be appropriate.
The investment expertise of the Pep providers needs to be identified, so
that those with consistently good performance are considered.
'It is then important to compare the charging structures, in particular the
level of the initial charge and ongoing annual management charge. These
cover the costs of setting up the plan, making the appropriate investments
and managing the plan on an ongoing basis. General Peps usually allow for
single or regular contributions, and sometimes a phased investment option is
available. The latter is a system whereby a lump sum is paid to the selected
Pep provider to 'drip' into the market over an agreed term.
'Some providers also have a facility for exchanging existing shareholdings
for holdings within the Pep, for which there may be a charge. Some Peps will
allow for a regular tax free income to be taken or permit partial encashment
providing that a certain minimum level still remains invested. If an
individual becomes dissatisfied with the investment performance of their Pep
provider, then it is possible to transfer the funds to an alternative
provider but a charge will usually be made.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Buy it for the
wall not the bottom line - Summer sees the opportunity to snap up the work
of tomorrow's top artists. But choose what you enjoy, or you may lose money
/ Alternative investments
</HEADLINE>

THE BRITISH middle classes are not great art collectors. They prefer to
spend their surplus wealth on mortgages and school fees. But increasingly
they are tempted into picture buying, both to decorate their homes and
because they feel they could be investing in a bargain.
There is nothing easier than to spend up to Pounds 5,000 on a picture. But
how do you ensure that your purchase is a good buy?
No one should collect art purely for investment: if they do, they will
probably lose money. In the late 1980s, various sectors of British art - the
Newlyn School, the Scottish Colourists - were hyped by dealers to inflated
price levels. There are many people ruefully looking at a painting which has
lost both its creative and its financial appeal. You should buy art because
you enjoy a particular picture and want to live with it. That way you cannot
lose. It's an added bonus if it slowly appreciates in value.
There are some obvious rules for anyone concerned at the investment
potential of their chosen painting. It should be a good work by an
acknowledged artist and in perfect condition. Obviously a Royal Academician,
or a member of the Royal Society of Watercolourists, or of the Society of
Portrait Painters, comes with a seal of critical approval. Buying the work
of a contemporary artist keeps the tradition of privatepatronage alive and
makes for a more exciting commitment.
Perhaps the biggest array of art of a guaranteed quality is provided by the
Summer Show, which runs at the Royal Academy from early June until
mid-August. A judging panel has selected more than 1,700 works, some by
aspiring amateurs, from the 12,000 submitted, and leavened the display with
contributions from the RAs. Few of the paintings by the RAs are priced below
Pounds 5,000, but most others are modestly valued. The Summer Show is
criticised for its traditionalism, but it provides an unparalleled display
of mainstream British art.
It is a good idea to contact the artist of any work you admire and
commission a painting direct. This way you avoid paying the RA's (fairly
modest) commission.
One of the problems with buying art is that galleries, which often have a
precarious financial existence, can demand from unknown artists commissions
of up to 75 per cent in return for hanging their work, vastly inflating its
retail price.
Obviously it saves money to circumvent dealers, but owners of serious art
collections have invariably amassed them through working with a good dealer,
who offers experienced advice, and who will often agree to take back
paintings if a client gets bored with them.
If the Summer Show is the safe entree for the first-time buyer, anyone
wishing to be at the cutting edge of art will be better served at the annual
sale organised by the proselytising Contemporary Art Society, at Smiths in
London's Covent Garden, in October.
This presents itself as an art supermarket (it is actually sponsored by
Sainsbury's) and offers over 1,000 paintings all priced below Pounds 1,750.
Many are by established artists - Bridget Riley, Maggi Hambling and Craigie
Aitchison were on the walls last year - who like to hang alongside younger
artists. The aim is to encourage a new generation of informed collectors,
and, in prosperous times, queues form hours before the opening in the hunt
for bargains.
If you are feeling even more experimental, you should sound out the Degree
Shows of the leading art schools, such as the Royal College and St Martin's,
in London: the top dealers certainly have a prowl around.
These opportunities for the graduates to gain an instant reputation take
place in June. Thirty odd years ago, if your eye was right, you could have
acquired a Hockney for Pounds 20. The law of averages suggests that some of
the young artists parading their collages, videos, mobiles, and sculptures
will, in time, become RAs, great names in British art - and wonderful
investments. You may be surprised at the prices some of the students ask -
Pounds 1,000 plus is not unusual  - but haggling should secure a
satisfactory deal.
The success of the Degree Shows has encouraged other art colleges to pool
their resources for a London view, and 40 of them are participating in
'Fresh Art', to be held at the Business Centre in Islington from July 17. If
you are serious about art, rather than just looking for a picture to
decorate the living-room wall, you really should go to the college shows, to
take the pulse of the new generation.
Also at the Business Centre, the dealers in contemporary art gather once a
year to excite traditional customers and tempt in new buyers. Art 93 will be
held in January. Along with such established events as the Whitechapel Open,
where artists from London's East End, which numerically houses the largest
congregation of artists in the world, show the inspirations of the loft
culture, and the Bath Contemporary Art Fair in May, these are the main
gatherings events of the British contemporary art world.
Of course, the country is dotted with galleries. In certain parts of London
 -Portobello, Hackney, Barnes - they congregate in considerable numbers.
Glasgow and Edinburgh are well served to exploit the current high reputation
of the younger generation of Scottish artists.
The recession has hit galleries hard, and there have been many closures.
Artists are pursuing other avenues to sell their work - displays in
restaurants, offices, local craft fairs. These days you could find your
chosen work virtually anywhere.
The auction houses are also becoming more involved in selling contemporary
art at modest prices, and Sotheby's and Christie's in particular have sales
two or three times a year at which they expose established names to open
bidding. Obviously, in many cases this is buying art wholesale, avoiding the
dealers' mark-up.
Prices of art have stabilised or fallen in the past two years. Some forms,
especially watercolours, are undeservedly cheap compared with oils, and
there are bargains to be had in limited-edition prints - provided the
edition really is limited.
No one should rush into buying a painting, or a sculpture. Visit galleries
and fairs, study auctions and the art press, absorb yourself in the subject.
Make sure you really love the work you buy. And never buy just for
investment. Then there is a good chance that you will acquire a family
friend that could provide a windfall in the future.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): A cash
compromise for worriers - Money market funds remove risk and give a good
return, but there are some snags / Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE US, money market funds are one of the most common ways for the
private investor to hold his liquid resources. In the UK, they form less
than 0.5 per cent of the unit trust market.
One reason is that the British investor is wedded to his building society,
where an account is easy to understand, simple to operate and has offered an
attractive return. In contrast, many investors find the idea of investing in
a unit trust confusing and risky. There are no unit trust shops in the high
street, where they can pick up a leaflet; the names of fund management
groups are not well known.
So what is a money market fund? In simple terms, it is a fund which invests
in the short-term debt of banks and other leading financial institutions.
Because of this, the fund is always likely to offer a competitive rate, with
a gross return similar to base rates.
Individual building society accounts may offer higher returns from time to
time, but they offer no guarantee of doing so over the long term. Many
investors have found, to their cost, that an attractive building society
rate is quietly cut a few months after they open the account.
The fees on a money market unit trust are low. Most have no bid-offer
spread, and annual management fees are under 1 per cent. The interest earned
by the trust rolls up, so that the price of the units increases. So if you
bought 1,000 units at 100p, and the return was 10 per cent, then your units
would be worth 110p.
There is no such thing as the ideal product, so what are the potential
drawbacks of a money market fund?
The trust invests in the deposits of banks and other financial institutions.
If the banks became insolvent, that could cause the unit price to fall.
However, the fund managers screen the banks very carefully to avoid this,
and no significant problems have occurred to date.
Indeed, in some ways, money market unit trusts have extra safeguards. If you
invest in a building society which goes bust, your maximum compensation is
90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. If a money market unit trust goes
bust, you are covered by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which repays
the first Pounds 30,000, and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000.
Unlike building societies, trusts cannot pay interest gross. Non-taxpayers
will have to wait and reclaim the tax.
Access to your cash can be delayed. You will have to go through the normal
unit-selling process, which can take a couple of weeks. However, Fidelity's
trust offers a chequebook for those who keep more than Pounds 5,000 in their
account. Other trusts may follow suit as the market develops.
Tracker funds on the scent of higher returns
UNIT TRUST managers are in buoyant mood. Total funds under management
exceeded Pounds 60bn for the first time in May. The Unit Trust Association
inferred that investor confidence was returning.
However, unit trusts still have problems. The patchy performance of world
stock markets over the past five years has ensured that unit trusts do not
look as strong as they might. Managers have little control over this.
But their performance, relative to market indices is a different matter. And
even the bid/offer spread is not enough to explain unit trusts'
underperformance.
According to Finstat, over the five years to July 1, the average UK General
unit trust rose only 7.9 per cent, while the FT-A All Share index rose 29.0
per cent. Growth funds dropped 3 per cent, while the FT Ordinary Share index
rose 9 per cent over the same period. Even over 10 years, UK General funds
are up 366 per cent, while the FT-A All Share has increased by 440 per cent.
Active fund management does not, on this evidence, seem to be worth paying
for. This has led to the increasing popularity of 'index' or 'tracker'
funds, which make no attempt to out-perform the index. Instead, they choose
stocks deliberately to replicate the index as closely as possible.
Their relative performance shows that they do better than most actively
managed funds. For example, the James Capel UK Index fund is 21st out of 95
in the UK General sector over two years, with growth of 5.3 per cent; and
Norwich Union's Index Tracking fund (19th) is up 5.4 per cent. Royal Life UK
Index Tracking is 24th with growth of 5.0 per cent.
Gartmore eases the load, Capel spreads the burden
THESE FUNDS are ideal for lowering charges, as the costs involved should be
less than for an active fund. Gartmore realised this, and followed the lead
of Lazards and Murray Johnstone by cutting front-end charges on its UK Index
Trust.
It will now have no initial charge and an annual charge of only 0.5 per
cent. There will still be a bid-offer spread of 1.9 per cent, which will
reflect the costs incurred by the fund in share dealing.
The fund is now one of the lowest charging trusts in the market. At the
start of May, the average bid-offer spread in the UK General sector was 5.9
per cent, and in the UK Growth sector 6.1 per cent. Annual fees were
normally 1 to 1.5 per cent.
The investor who backs the Gartmore fund thus has a 4 per cent head-start
over rival trusts (because of the lower initial charge) and a lead of 0.5 to
1 per cent a year, because of the lower annual charge. Minimum investment is
Pounds 5,000.
James Capel is also alive to the marketing opportunties of tracker funds. It
is offering a portfolio service, allowing investors to switch between the
company's six tracker funds - which cover the UK, UK smaller companies,
America, Japan, the Far East and Europe. Initial charge will be 4.25 per
cent, while the annual management charge for the portfolio service is 1 per
cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 10,000.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Supportive
columns - A guide to the information about trusts that is published each day
in the FT / Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW CAN you use the Financial Times share price pages to help you choose an
investment trust, and to follow your trust once you have bought shares?
Almost two whole columns of the share listings pages are devoted to
investment trust share prices, with the trusts listed in alphabetical order.
One important point to note is that many trusts have more than one type of
share capital. The most common types are:
Capital shares. These have no fixed repayment value and pay no income. They
depend for their return on the trust managers growing the assets of the
trust.
Income shares. These get all the income of the trust, and have a very high
yield. But their repayment value may be low or virtually zero, so some
investors may simply be converting capital into income.
Warrants. These give the investors the entitlement to buy further shares at
a set price. The price of warrants can be highly volatile and they can
expire worthless; they also pay no income.
Zero-coupon preference shares. These pay no income but should be redeemed at
a much higher price in future. They thus offer steady capital growth and are
useful for people who do not pay capital gains tax.
If you are thinking of dabbling in any of these specialist classes of share,
or others such as stepped preference shares, you really need a stockbroker's
advice.
Once you have sorted out the class of shares you want, you can glean further
information from the share price pages. In most cases, we show the net asset
value (supplied by County NatWest Wood Mackenzie) and the discount or
premium on which shares trade.
This can be quite a good guide for general trusts - in theory, the wider the
discount the better. But care needs to be exercised. A wide discount may
reflect a poor management record. Any narrowing of the discount might be
counteracted, therefore, by poor asset growth. In addition, if the trust has
a large proportion of unquoted stocks, then the discount might reflect
investor suspicion of the real value of that unquoted element.
And the 'discounts' applied to capital shares of split trusts may be an
illusion, if the trust has zero-coupon shares with a steadily rising claim
on the asset base.
That said, it is obviously better to buy shares in an international general
investment trust on a 20 per cent than on a 10 per cent discount.
The listings also show the yield on each share. Again, caution is needed
before you assume that the highest yielding shares are the best. High yields
on income shares may reflect the prospect of capital loss; and on general
trust shares, a high historic yield may also reflect the expectation of a
dividend cut. One should also remember that yields in Britain are higher
than those in overseas markets, so geographical specialist trusts may not
offer much of an income.
Monday's listings show slightly different information, in particular the
dividends for the last year, the dates on which the dividends are paid, and
the last date on which the shares went ex-dividend.

INVESTMENT TRUSTS have shown unexpected signs of life over the past three
months. Analysts had expected a slowdown in launches, while the big
management companies digested the money they had taken in at the end of the
last tax year, but it has not happened like that. Four companies went to the
market to raise funds via investment trusts.
The most ambitious offering was Thornton's, which in June raised Pounds
35.5m for its European Smaller Companies investment trust. The
country-specific fund management and stock-picking will be shared by
Thornton in London, BNP in France, and Dresdner in Germany, while asset
allocation will be determined using a newly constructed index.
Thornton chose a simple capital structure - just ordinary shares, with
warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. Henderson's European investment
trust offered 25 per cent of its share capital in zero-dividend preference
shares. Henderson's offer raised Pounds 17.3m, and chose blue-chip stocks
rather than smaller companies.
Edinburgh Fund Managers decided that the heavy falls on the Tokyo stock
exchange earlier this year meant the time was now right to launch a Japanese
general investment trust. EFM Japan raised Pounds 10m, with warrants
attached on a one-for-five basis.
None of these trusts raised its target. All were hit by gloom surrounding
the new issues market.
Kleinwort Benson offered a rather complicated trust to invest in the newly
developing market in secondhand endowment policies. It has a fixed life of
11 years, and the underlying investments are generally regarded as secure
enough for the trust's shares to be regarded as 'quasi-zeros'.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): New Peps
triggered by the Budget - A guide to the information about trusts that is
published each day in the FT / Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BUDGET change in personal equity plan (Pep) rules has provided a boost
for most of the investment trust industry. Now that a full Pounds 6,000 can
be invested in an existing investment trust, the sector can compete even
harder in the savings market, writes Philip Coggan.
River &amp; Mercantile, the split-capital trust specialists, launched three
packaged Peps to try to take advantage of the new Pounds 6,000 limit. The
plans were constructed to meet different investor needs - high income,
capital growth and income &amp; growth - by investing in different combinations
of split shares.
The capital growth plan, for example, invests in a combination of stepped
preference and capital shares. The yield on the stepped preference shares
covers the plan charges; the capital shares will provide growth if the
assets of the trusts rise.
No doubt plan managers will be able to construct ever more ingenious ways of
meeting investors' specific requirements. But it still seems a shame that
one of the most stable and diversified sectors - the international general
trusts - are excluded from the Pounds 6,000 limit.
Trusts still need to keep at least 50 per cent of their assets in EC markets
to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 limit. Some generalists, such as
Foreign &amp; Colonial, will not commit themselves to meet this requirement;
they want the flexibility to invest in other markets as opportunity
dictates. That means that an investment in such a trust is limited to Pounds
1,500. It seems a strange regime that allows investors to put a full Pounds
6,000 in a specialist sector such as, say, German smaller companies but not
in an internationally diversified trust.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Not quite as
portable as they seem - Group schemes / Personal Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRIVE towards group personal pensions has intensified over the past
year, with small to medium sized employers seeing this product as a cheaper
alternative to final-salary arrangements.
However, employees should beware the promise of portability without penalty
that these group plans claim to offer. All too often, employees who leave a
group personal pension face a hefty fine that reduces their fund by over 50
per cent.
At present, most of the UK's company pensions operate on a final-salary
basis. Under a typical scheme, your pension builds up at a rate of 1/60th of
your final salary for each year's service, up to an Inland Revenue limit of
40/60ths or two-thirds final salary, subject to a maximum of Pounds 50,000
where the 'earnings cap' applies.
Group personal pensions are money-purchase products, which means that
contributions are invested in a fund which is used to purchase an annuity at
retirement. Some companies have set up a different type of money-purchase
arrangement, known as a contracted-out money-purchase scheme (Comp), but
these are more complex and less popular.
At their most basic, group personal pensions are no more than a collection
of individual plans, although some providers reduce their charges due to
economies of scale. More generous plans also offer employer contributions,
death benefits and, less frequently, disability benefits. It all depends on
how much the employer is prepared to pay.
Group personal pensions have proved particularly popular among smaller
companies where the staff turnover is high. In theory, since each employee
has his or her own plan, this can be taken from job to job. But the claim of
portability without penalty is proving false.
The main problem is that company pension schemes are notoriously
incompatible. Unless the new company has an identical group personal
pension, the employee may be forced to abandon the original plan in order to
benefit from employer contributions and the other benefits associated with
the main company scheme.
So what happens to the existing plan? Any reduced charges that applied to
the group personal pension will not apply once the employee leaves. If the
employee joins the new employer's final-salary scheme, under Inland Revenue
rules it is not possible to maintain the personal pension plan (unless there
are additional self-employed earnings on which to base the contributions).
The plan can be made 'paid up', which means that no further contributions
are added and the existing fund continues to grow until the individual
retires.
This may sound fine, but invariably the pension provider will impose a
severe penalty if the contributions stop. This reflects the high up-front
charges that are incurred in sales of most personal pensions, including the
payment of commission to the adviser.
If you want to join the new employer's scheme, you could transfer-in your
personal pension fund. Unfortunately transfers, particularly in the early
years of a plan, reflect the hefty penalties associated with paid-up
policies. Typically, after two years, an employee is likely to get back just
50 per cent of the voluntary premiums paid in. (The appropriate rights fund
secured by the rebate of Serps contributions is treated less harshly.)
Some life offices have reduced the impact of capital units on their personal
pensions. These units, which are bought with contributions in the early
years of a plan, attract very heavy charges. Scottish Provident got rid of
its capital units altogether, and imposes no penalty on transfers. There is
still a deduction to cover up-front costs, but the transfer value is about
70 per cent of contributions paid, instead of the 40 per cent more typically
available where capital units are applied.
If you want to join the company scheme, one way of dealing with the personal
pension is to switch the fund into a free-standing additional voluntary
contribution (FSAVC) contract. FSAVCs are used to top up company schemes,
where the company pension is expected to fall short of the Inland Revenue
maximum.
But Peter Timberlake, marketing manager at Legal &amp; General, warned:
'Officially, the FSAVC is a new contract, and the conversion, even if it is
with the same provider, could incur fresh up-front commission for the
salesman or adviser.' Since there is no industry standard on this, it is up
to the individual to negotiate with the adviser to reduce the impact of
commission.
Unfortunately, even if the switch to an FSAVC can be achieved at little
cost, few young people with heavy mortgage commitments can afford to pay
both the occupational pension scheme contributions and to maintain the FSAVC
premiums. If the FSAVC premiums are reduced, once again a charge probably
will be incurred.
The same problem can arise where the employee leaves to become
self-employed. If the salesman and provider regard the switch in employment
status as an excuse to set up a new policy, full up-front commission will be
paid. Further problems arise where the employer previously made a
contribution. Unless the individual can afford to maintain the total
contribution level, the provider is likely to regard this as a drop in
premium and impose a charge accordingly.
Clearly, there seem to be portability problems associated with any change of
employment. The cost of switching to an FSAVC or self-employed contract is
likely to be every bit as expensive as making the plan paid-up or taking a
transfer to an occupational scheme. Whichever way you turn, you are caught
in a vicious circle that the pensions industry seems at pains to ignore.
If you are offered membership of a group personal pension scheme, check at
the outset what will happen to your fund if you change jobs. Some providers
may be more sympathetic to the transfer issue than others, particularly
those which operate on a non-commission or low-commission basis.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Job changers
may lose a few years - Transfers / Personal Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT CONCERN over mis-selling of personal pensions for transfers from
occupational schemes has highlighted the plight of thousands of employees
who change jobs every year, little realising that each move can jeopardise
the value of their pension fund.
Those who have been in a company pension scheme for less than two years are
entitled to a cash refund of contributions, less a deduction for tax and
back-payments to the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps).
After two years, you can leave the pension benefit in the former employer's
scheme or take a transfer value to the new employer's scheme or to an Inland
Revenue-approved private individual plan such as a personal pension or a
Section 32 buy-out bond (introduced under Section 32 of the Finance Act of
1981). Each option has its merits and drawbacks, and should be analysed
carefully in the light of individual circumstances.
The first option is to take a deferred pension - that is, to leave leave the
benefits in the old scheme until retirement. By law, schemes must pay
limited price indexation (LPI) of 5 per cent a year (or retail prices, if
less) on benefits in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP). The GMP
is the element of an occupational scheme that replaces the Serps pension.
While LPI, at a maximum of 5 per cent, represents an improvement in the law,
many would argue that it does not go far enough, given the fact that average
earnings inflation historically is about 8 per cent.
Larger schemes may award higher increases, often on a regular discretionary
basis. Schemes may also offer good death benefits and pensions for widows
and dependants. If some or all of these features are present, the
job-changer's best bet is likely to be a deferred pension.
Due to pending legal changes, there are other factors that could affect the
value of the deferred pension or transfer value. These include the
application of LPI to pensions in payment, the retrospective application of
equal pension benefits for men and women, and the uses of any pension scheme
surplus. Employees or their advisers certainly should consider these factors
before taking the decision to transfer out; but, according to Ian Sigston,
director of technical research at Noble Lowndes &amp; Partners, it is unwise to
attempt to 'double guess' which way the legislation will go and to delay
making an important decision.
The second main option - transferring to the new employer's scheme - often
leaves the employee feeling cheated. Before looking at this process, it is
important to understand how transfer values are calculated.
Most company pensions in Britain operate on a final-salary basis. Under a
typical scheme, the pension builds up at a rate of 1/60th of final salary
for each year's service. After 40 years' scheme membership, the employee
should qualify for the maximum pension permitted by the Inland Revenue of
40/60ths or two-thirds final salary. Employees caught by the 'earnings cap'
are further restricted to a maximum pension of Pounds 50,000 for the current
tax year. Employees usually pay contributions to their company schemes of 5
or 6 per cent per annum, while the employer's contribution will vary
according to age.
There are two schemes involved in an inter-company transfer - the ceding
scheme, and the receiving scheme. A typical transfer might reduce 10 'years'
in the old scheme to just five in the new scheme.
This is because the ceding scheme actuary turns the accrued number of
'years' into a cash value based on the value of the deferred pension plus
any increases to retirement. Due to the 5 per cent annual LPI cap on
deferred pensions, this immediately limits the growth assumption to less
than average earnings.
The receiving scheme actuary then calculates the number of 'years' this
transfer value will buy in the new employer's scheme, taking into account
any increases in salary to retirement and the level of benefits offered by
the scheme. Clearly, a higher salary and better pension scheme benefits will
'cost' more, and so reduce the number of years the transfer buys.
Only when the above options have been considered and found wanting should
the employee consider a transfer to a private plan. There are two options
here, namely a personal pension or Section 32 buy-out bond. The bulk of
current transfers to date have been to personal pensions, but there are
cases where a buy-out bond may be preferable.
Personal pensions are available from life offices, unit trust groups, banks
and friendly societies. Section 32 buy-out bonds are only available from
about 18 life offices. Both products operate on a money-purchase basis. This
means that your fund builds up to purchase an annuity at retirement. There
is no final-salary link, which makes it notoriously difficult to compare
company scheme benefits with these products.
While both products invest the transfer on your behalf, in order to provide
a fund at retirement to purchase an annuity, there are important
differences. For example, the buy-out bond can only accept the transfer
value, whereas it is possible to pay regular or additional single premiums
into a personal pension. Furthermore, the buy-out bond cannot be used to
contract out of Serps and is more restrictive in terms of retirement date
and investment scope.
However, the buy-out bond does offer important guarantees by retaining the
GMP, and for this reason the merits of this product should always be
considered alongside a personal pension for transfer purposes.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): The longer you
wait, the higher the benefits - Options at retirement / Personal Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEONE WHO has contributed to a personal pension and wants to take the
benefits must first take three important decisions:
Precisely when to take the benefits?
Whether to take any part of the benefits as a tax-free cash sum, and if so
how much?
What type of annuity to buy with the remaining value of the contract(s)
after any cash has been taken?
To understand the relevance of these decisions, one should look quickly
again at the format of personal pensions, whether the old-style retirement
annuity contracts or the new-style personal pensions.
There is considerable flexibility over the timing of benefits. With
retirement annuity contracts, benefits can be taken at any time between
one's 60th and 75th birthday (both dates inclusive); with personal pensions,
the choice extends from the 50th to the 75th.
You do not have to stop work and retire in order to take the benefits, nor
do you have to take the benefits simply because you have stopped work.
Benefits can be taken to fit individual circumstances.
If a person dies before taking the benefits, under many contracts the
accumulated value is paid, free of inheritance tax, into his estate. Some
traditional contracts only pay a return of contributions, with or without
interest, on death.
Many people may consider the death benefit far more valuable than the
pension/cash sum benefit, and so can defer taking the benefits for as long
as possible. But they have to take the benefits when they reach age 75.
When the contract is cashed in, part of the accumulated value can be taken
as a tax-free cash sum. With a new-style personal pension, up to 25 per cent
of the value can be taken in this way.
With retirement annuity contracts, the formula is more complex, but the
percentage increases with the age at which benefits are taken and is greater
than with a personal pension. The remainder must be used to buy an annuity.
When to take it
In general, the longer you can defer taking the benefits, the greater the
accumulated value under the contracts. Similarly, the older you are, the
higher the annuity rates used to buy the pension.
If you have a series of personal pension contracts, you can arrange to cash
in a few contracts at a time, thereby building up your pension.
In deciding when to cash in, it is necessary to consider any other sources
of income, such as state pensions or personal savings. Care needs to be
taken if a contract is unit-linked - cash in when the market is depressed,
such as immediately after Black Monday in October 1987, and the value of the
contract will also be depressed.
Similarly, if contracts are cashed in when interest rates are falling, then
annuity rates will also be falling and the contract value will buy less
pension.
The cash option
This is the easiest question to answer. One should always take the maximum
available cash. It provides flexibility in one's financial arrangements, and
it usually makes sense to convert taxable income into tax-free cash.
An individual should take cash, even if he needs maximum income. He can use
the cash to buy an ordinary annuity, which, because of the favourable tax
treatment, provides a higher rate than the corresponding pension annuity.
Buying the pension
This is the most difficult decision, and one where an adviser cannot really
help, other than to explain the situation clearly.
Most articles in the media discuss the open-market option - where one can
find the best annuity rates. But this is the last in a series of decisions
that must be taken. The first and most important is: which type of annuity
to buy?
Ideally, one wants the maximum starting pension, where the real value keeps
pace with inflation. But such pensions are only available to civil servants
and other public sector employees. People with personal pensions must buy
their annuities in the real world. There is a variety from which to choose:
Level annuities.
Annuities increasing at a fixed annual rate.
With-profits annuities, where the value is increased each year by bonus
additions.
Unit-linked annuities, where the value varies according to the unit price of
the underlying fund.
Index-linked annuities, where the value increases annually in line with
rises in the Retail Price Index.
These can be on the life of the individual or on the lives of the individual
and spouse or partner, with payments continuing at the same rate or a
different rate after the first death. The annuity payments can be guaranteed
for a minimum period. The permutations are almost endless.
The only restrictions imposed by the Inland Revenue are: first, that the
guaranteed period of annuity payments cannot exceed 10 years; and second,
that payments to a surviving spouse or partner must not exceed the payments
made when both were alive.
Unfortunately, the general rule is that the higher the annual increases in
annuity payments, the lower the starting value of the annuity. The highest
starting value is provided by a level annuity on the life of the individual
with no future increases. Someone who wants pension increases must accept a
lower starting value. If he wants to provide for a spouse or partner, he
must accept an even lower starting value.
Few people will have accumulated sufficient value on their personal pension
contracts to be able to afford an acceptable starting pension that will rise
with inflation. For example, a man aged 65, wanting an index-linked annuity,
has to take a one-third reduction in the starting value compared with a
level annuity.
In making the choice, a person must decide:
How much he needs to live on at present.
How long he is likely to live, remembering that the life expectancy of a
healthy man aged 65 is about 14.6 years and about 22.5 years for a healthy
woman aged 60.
What the inflation rate will be over his lifetime, remembering that, if
inflation averages just 5 per cent a year, the real value of a level annuity
will be halved after 14 years.
What will happen to the individual's spouse or partner when he or she dies.
Someone selecting an annuity has to compromise between the starting value
and the annual increases. One approach is to assess what income you require
on retirement, taking into account all other sources of income, including
the state pension, which is revalued each year in line with inflation. You
can then judge what type of annuity will meet this requirement. The exercise
should include provision of a pension for your spouse or partner, taking
into account any income they may have.
The with-profits annuity offers a convenient compromise. With these
annuities, offered by Equitable Life, one can vary the starting income and
the annual increases by anticipating part of the future bonuses, as shown in
the tables. The greater the amount of anticipated bonus, the lower the
future increases.
If someone wants to take the highest starting income and let the future look
after itself, as most do when buying annuities, then it is their own choice.
But no adviser could, under best-advice rules, recommend such a course.
Once the type of annuity has been selected, the individual can use the
accumulated value to buy the best one available - this is the so-called
'market option'. An independent financial adviser should be able to help him
to select the best annuity rates.
However, someone with the old-style retirement annuity contracts could find
that, by going to a life company other than the one with issued the original
contract, the maximum cash sum available would be limited to 25 per cent.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Check your
Serps position every year - Opting out / Personal Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES WHO are relying on just themselves and the state for their pension
must decide how much they will do for themselves and how far they will rely
on the state.
All will receive the basic state pension. If they do nothing else, then by
default they are also in the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) -
the second tier of the state pension scheme.
But they have the choice of opting out of Serps, known as 'contracting-out',
and making their own provision through an appropriate personal pension.
With the general election over, some of the uncertainty about the future of
pensions has been removed. Employees can make the choice as to whether or
not to opt out of Serps with certainty, at least for the current financial
year. The choice depends on whether the employee considers that a personal
pension will provide a greater pension than Serps at the state pension age -
65 for men and 60 for women - for the particular year's contribution. It is
not an easy comparison.
The Serps pension for a year, say 1992-93, is a certain fraction of the
employee's earnings for that year between the lower earnings limit
(currently Pounds 2,808 a year) and the upper earnings limit (Pounds
21,060). This amount is revalued each year in line with national average
earnings until the employee retires.
In contrast, if an employee opts out of Serps, the contribution paid into
the personal pension would be 8.46 per cent of earnings between the lower
and upper earnings limits consisting of:
Employee's contracted-out rebate           2.00%
Basic tax relief on this rebate            0.66%
Employer's contracted-out rebate           3.80%
Incentive contribution                     2.00%
TOTAL                                      8.46%
Employees do not receive any tax relief if they remain in Serps. The
incentive contribution applies to all employees who have not been
contracted-out during the previous two years. It is paid from the National
Insurance fund. This contribution, less expenses, is invested in an
appropriate personal pension from a life company, and the accumulated sum at
state pension age used to buy a pension. So the longer the time to pension
age, the greater the accumulated sum, and thus the greater the ultimate
pension.
So, under the present regime, the younger the employee the greater the
pension secured from an appropriate personal pension, compared with the
pension from Serps which is virtually fixed in relation to the employee's
earnings.
Employees can obtain an individual benefit illustration, prepared under the
rules of Lautro (the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry),
which compares the Serps benefit with that on a personal pension. The Lautro
rules, for once, are realistic for these illustrations, and employees can
make their choice on appropriate figures. A rule of thumb used by certain
life companies is that it is favourable for men up to age 45 and women up to
age 37 to contract-out of Serps with a personal pension.
Employees should check each year whether it is still advantageous, because
conditions are changing, and a different set of criteria will apply for
future years.
In April 1993, the rebate on National Insurance contributions is reduced to
4.8 per cent of earnings between the lower and upper limits - 1.8 per cent
for employees, and 3 per cent for employers.
In addition, the incentive payment, which was originally intended to cease
next April, will continue to be paid at the reduced rate of 1 per cent to
all employees aged 30 or more.
This in itself alters the equation, and the pivotal ages for contracting-out
will be a year or two lower than at present. These criteria, taken at face
value, would mean that employees presently contracted out through personal
pensions, who will have reached or passed the pivotal age by next April,
should seriously consider going back into Serps.
But the changes carry deeper implications, particularly the 1 per cent
incentive payment. It is widely interpreted that this payment heralds the
introduction of age-related rebates - that is, the level of rebate will
increase with the age of employees, to reflect the rising cost, with age of
matching pensions provided by Serps. If an age-related rebate system is
introduced, then there may not be any advantage in returning to Serps
whatever one's age. So employees should delay any decision until the
situation is clarified.
However, those relying on Serps, or its contracted-out equivalent, will find
that their ultimate pension will still fall well short of expectations,
particularly the higher paid. They need to top-up with personal pensions,
whether or not they are in Serps.
This message appears to be getting through. The Prudential group reports
that nearly three-quarters of employees who have contracted-out through
personal pensions have made additional provision.
Contribution rates are related to age:
Age                    Percentage of
                        net relevant
                            earnings
Up to 35                       17.5%
36-45                          20.0%
46-50                          25.0%
51-55                          30.0%
56-60                          35.0%
61-74                          40.0%
High earners, however, are restricted as to the ultimate amount of
contribution which they can make by the ceiling on their earnings - known as
'the cap'. This is currently Pounds 75,000. They can only relate their
contributions to personal pensions up to this limit. But this is the only
restriction imposed on personal pensions.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): With-profits
plans are the most secure - Choosing one / Personal Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROCESS of choosing a personal pension plan starts with a calculation of
how much can be invested.
As background and a stark warning, the DSS will provide a forecast of how
much is due under the state retirement scheme, based on contributions
records.
Requests for this information must be made on form BR19, available from
local DSS offices.
Inland Revenue limits, scaled by age, currently allow between 17.5 per cent
(at ages under 35) and 40 per cent (between 61 and 74) of annual earnings to
be invested in a personal pension qualifying for highest rate relief.
Payments can be made and tax relief claimed up to six years after the
earnings are received.
There are four main types of personal pension:
With-profits plans, where the money is invested in gilts and property, as
well as shares, with the proportions chosen by the insurance company's
investment managers.
'With-profits' means that, each year, a share of the investment profits is
added to the policy for keeps. When the policy matures, a further terminal
bonus is usually also paid.
Unit-linked plans, where the money is invested in unitised funds chosen by
the investor from the range offered by the pension provider.
There are no bonuses: the value of the plan depends entirely on the unit
prices of the funds. So a stock market crash will severely damage a
unit-linked pension. Holders of unit-linked plans maturing in October 1987
found they were forced to postpone retirement by the 30 per cent drop in
plan values. Unit-linked pension policies usually allow holders to defer
cashing in, but legally the deferment cannot extend past the policyholder's
75th birthday.
Self-invested pensions, where an insurance company supplies the basic policy
and administrative services, while investors themselves, or managers of
their choice, select the investments without being limited to funds run by
the company.
Cash or deposit-based pensions, where interest rolls up gross.
Broadly speaking, with-profits plans are the most secure, though there have
been cuts in bonus rates and warnings of more to come.
Unit-linked and self-invested plans are riskier, and probably not suitable
for anyone within less than 10 years of retirement.
Cash-based plans do not have the long-term growth potential of stock market
investments, and tend to be a relatively short-term option for people close
to retirement.
Unit-linked plans now often have a facility for holders to switch into cash
two years before retirement, so as to avoid last-minute market plunges.
Most pension plans take either regular or single premiums, setting a variety
of minimum payment levels. A significant difference is that much higher
commission is charged on regular premiums than on single payments.
The retirement date written into the pension plan also influences commission
charges, which rise as the term increases. It is cheaper to set an early
retirement date, say 50, and then defer it if necessary, as this can be done
without the penalties imposed if retirement takes place before the date
specified.
Having chosen a basic type of plan, or perhaps a combination, the next move
is to find a pension provider with good investment performance and low
overall costs.
As commission is such a major component in costs, especially in the early
years of a plan, the most satisfactory way of buying a personal pension is
to go through a specialised adviser, who will charge a fee for advice and
rebate any commission in full.
Beware of advisers offering to rebate 'full Lautro commission'. This means
they will pocket a sizeable chunk of the commission, rebating only the
amount set out in the Lautro maximum commissions agreement scrapped three
years ago, since when commissions have rocketed.
Recently, the second annual commission survey by the regulator Lautro showed
that, in 1991, on average, independent advisers were receiving 23 per cent
more than the level set by the maximum commissions agreement for 10-year
pensions, and 26 per cent above for 25-year pensions policies.
Tied agents selling 10- and 25-year pensions were getting 44 per cent and 40
per cent more respectively than under the maximum commissions agreement.
This hefty bite out of the initial investment is not the only reason for
avoiding tied agents in the pension field. Another is that they can only
advise on or recommend the investments provided by the company to which they
are tied, instead of scanning the whole range on offer as independents are
supposed to do.
Assessment of future investment performance and costs is really a matter of
guesswork, based on past records.
The projections put out by the companies themselves are no help here, as
they are required to use standard growth assumptions and an industry-wide
average for expenses.
Recent research by the Securities and Investments Board showed what this
would mean to investors. Although companies' expanses knock anything from 6p
to 40p in the pound off pay-outs, the average to be used in projections is
14p. So some companies are vastly understating their charges.
One of the most reliable sources of comparative information about company
charges is a table derived from returns filed by life companies to the
Department of Trade and Industry. This was published in a simplified form in
the Weekend FT on February 22 this year.
The table shows an initial expense ratio, expressing the amount a company
spends on starting up a policy as a proportion of the first year's premiums,
and a renewal ratio, setting the running costs against the annual premium.
The sixty-one companies covered in the last table ranged from Equitable
Life, a company paying no commission, with an initial expense ratio of 24.1
and a renewal expense ratio of 4.57, to NEL Assurance with an initial
expense ratio of 307.65 and a renewal ratio of 2.39.
For past performance records of with-profits and unit-linked policies, one
of the most authoritative sources is Money Management, a monthly sister
publication to the Financial Times, which publishes annual rankings of past
investment performance over different periods.
Any statistics rehashed by a company and presented in a favourable light
should be rechecked at source.
As a rough guide, it is worth remembering that a company proud of 'top
quartile' performance has probably never made it into the top ten.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Threatened by
their own success - Government concessions, spectacular marketing and
anxiety about the safety of employers' schemes have helped to boost the
sales of personal pensions. But the climate is changing / Personal Pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AS A product, personal pensions have been spectacularly more successful than
even their designers can have hoped.
The latest figures from the Department of Social Security showed that 4.6m
people held personal pensions, and the indications are that the number is
still rising.
For the life insurance industry, the main purveyor of the product, they have
proved a boon during the lean years of the recession, with single-premium
pensions business having risen by 45 per cent in the year to March 31.
In explaining this spectacular success, analysts point to two key factors.
The first is the introduction of government incentives, designed to
encourage young people to opt out of the State Earnings-related Pension
Scheme (Serps). 'These products have been sold to young people on the basis
that the government is offering you a bribe to opt out,' said Mr Stewart
Ritchie, pensions manager at Scottish Equitable.
Indeed, the DSS's forecast of the number who would take up the initial offer
of a personal pension, 500,000 at the most, was based on an assumption that
no incentive would be offered at all.
The second factor is the spectacular marketing effort launched by the life
insurers themselves. This has been given a late boost by the collapse of
occupational pension schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell with
over Pounds 400m of members' assets apparently stolen.
This combination of give-aways from the National Insurance fund,
enthusiastic sales agents and anxiety about the safety of employer-run
schemes in general helped to boost personal pension sales to Pounds 5.9bn in
the year to March 31.
But recently the government has proposed that, from next April, there should
be less generous incentives, limited to those over 30 years of age; while
the antics of some over-enthusiastic pensions sales agents has turned a
harsh spotlight on some of their sales claims, with consumer advocates
singling out the product for special criticism. So the question facing the
industry is whether the growth seen in the past four years is likely to
continue; and, if not, how will the pensions industry adapt?
'It will still be a very strong area of growth, but not as strong as it has
been,' predicts Mr Brian Sharp, secretary to the Association of British
Insurers Life Insurance Council.
Before personal pensions were launched, it was estimated that 10m employed
people were not covered by any occupational scheme, and it was at this pool
that the initial sales pitch was aimed.
'Now that group is fairly saturated,' said Mr Sharp. New business, he added,
had come largely from existing personal pension holders topping up their
policies, or from people changing jobs who had opted to place the transfer
value from a previous pension scheme into a personal pension.
It is these new sources of growth that have caused most anxiety among
consumer advocates and regulators, who are concerned about the wanton sale
of personal pensions to those people for whom they are clearly
inappropriate.
A protected-rights personal pension may well be a less attractive option for
a job-changer, and should only be considered after the merits of both the
former and future employers' schemes have been reviewed in detail. Those
leaving with a redundancy payment, and who remain unemployed, cannot take
advantage of the tax incentives of personal pensions.
Helena Wiesner, a consumer affairs consultant, who recently completed a
study of retail financial products for the Office of Fair Trading, expressed
concern about sales tactics. She cited figures from the Department of Social
Services for the 1988-89 tax year, showing that personal pensions were sold
to 63,000 women who had no earnings at all and were therefore ineligible for
tax incentives.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, in
recording a 77 per cent increase in complaints last year, singled out the
sale of personal pensions for particular concern. It mentioned several cases
of commission-based sales agents who had encouraged individuals to switch
out of perfectly good occupational pension schemes into less desirable
personal pensions.
Like life insurance, personal pension schemes are frequently sold by sales
agents whose salary is dependent on the number of policies they sell. And,
like life insurance, sales procedures are subject to the same rules of
opaque disclosure, which make it difficult for consumers to learn exactly
what they are paying for. The industry faces the danger that dubious sales
tactics from a number of agents will cause their general lack of credibility
to rub off on the product as well.
Meanwhile, the industry must face up to somewhat less generous incentives in
future years. The cut in incentives, announced earlier this year, follows
widespread criticism that the incentives cost Pounds 5.9bn more than could
be saved from the National Insurance fund.
The lower rebate from next April, together with the reduced incentives, will
have the effect of encouraging people to opt back into Serps roughly five
years earlier than under the existing rebate. While actuaries' calculations
about the exact break-even age vary, the consensus is that men in their
mid-forties and women in their late thirties have more to gain by opting
back into Serps.
Meanwhile, the personal pensions industry remains uncertain about whether it
can count on the existence of incentive payments at all indefinitely. Both
Labour and the Liberal Democrats are pledged to end what both have described
as a bribe.
Furthermore, the Tory government's own intentions remain uncertain. While it
is committed in principle to encouraging individuals to opt out of the
National Insurance scheme, the method may well change. Indeed, the former
social security secretary, Mr Tony Newton, in announcing the new rebates for
the five-year period beginning next April, caused a stir when he said the
government would look into age-related rebates.
Larger contributions are required to a pension scheme as the member becomes
older. Thus, the incentives offered to young people opting for personal
pensions are larger than the contributions they would need to make if they
remained in the state system. By the time people reach their mid-forties,
the contributions required to a personal pension are far larger to obtain
the same benefits offered by Serps, and they are advised to opt back in.
The insurance industry has largely opposed age-related rebates, because they
would offer too little incentive to young people to opt out of the state
scheme, and older individuals are more likely to remain with their existing
arrangements.
However, Mr Ron Spill, pensions manager at Legal and General, a leading
provider of personal pensions, has urged a sliding scale of rebates based on
age, to encourage those who have personal pensions to hold on to them as
they get older. That view has been echoed by the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, an economic think-tank, which argues that the present system costs
more in incentives than it saves.
While personal pensions remain a booming business for the insurance
companies which sell them, they risk being undermined by their own success.
The over-eager sales agent and the drain on the public purse from incentive
payments could threaten the popularity of the product.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Small print
that sounded the pension alarm - Malcolm Allbutt worked for a company that
was taken over by Robert Maxwell. After the pension fund had also been
absorbed, he read the annual report, and was horrified by what he learned .
. . / Hindsight

<TEXT>
MALCOLM ALLBUTT had a terrible shock when he read through his company
pension fund annual report last year.
He worked for AGB, a market research company which had been taken over by
Maxwell Communications Corporation the previous year. Its pension fund, of
which he was still a member and into which he had contributed for 22 years,
had now been incorporated with that of the main group.
The report was more informative than some, and listed the top 20 investments
made by the scheme. They were principally in equities.
Pension funds make savings for 'widows and orphans'. Although they often
invest in speculative ventures at the edges of their portfolio, the ballast
is usually in large and secure companies, which have the kind of names
people will recognise - the ICIs, BPs and Marks &amp; Spencers.
Mr Allbutt was therefore horrified to discover that with the exception of a
couple of printing companies - De La Rue and EMAP - and MCC itself, he had
never heard of any of them.
The portfolio seemed to be dominated by the detritus of Maxwell's worldwide
acquisition spree - for example, the seventh biggest holding was in Official
Airlines Guide 'C' Loan Stock. Other less familiar names - such as Agence
Havas and Quebecor - turned out to be large media and printing groups.
Ploughing through the list, it was possible to find out that Teva
Pharmaceutical was an Israeli drug company, while IBI Holding was also a
Maxwell-owned company. Euris and Marceau Investissements were both French
investment vehicles which Robert Maxwell had backed in a bid for French
banking giant Societe Generale.
In short, the portfolio had no logic, beyond its use as a support for
Maxwell's financial forays. While some of the printing groups within it were
strong and reputable companies, it was still unusual for a cautious pension
fund manager to concentrate holdings so narrowly in one sector.
As Mr Allbutt later put it to a Commons select committee, he was 'more than
a little horrified' to see where the money was going. He pointed the list
out to a colleague, closer to retirement, whose reply was: 'Ah yes, but is
there anything there?' At the time, this was still tongue in cheek.
Mr Allbutt decided that the time had come to get out - he could not rely on
this pension fund to pay him a pension.
Unfortunately, the Maxwell pension funds were slow to move - one of Mr
Allbutt's friends who had left the company still found that it took 18
months to receive a transfer value. The employees believe that many of these
delays were deliberate.
Last year, as Maxwell himself went over the side of the Lady Ghislaine, and
his financial empire fast disintegrated in its wake, time was not on the
side of pension fund members.
In early December, Mr Allbutt received the details of what his pension
transfer value would be.
The next day, he was informed that the transfer value was inoperative, as
the fund's assets had been frozen. He had acted as soon as he could, but
still not in time.
Subsequent events confirmed all his worst fears.
In March this year, Clay &amp; Partners, the consulting actuaries appointed to
wind up the four Maxwell pension schemes, announced that about Pounds 40m
was missing from the AGB pension scheme.
The scheme had access to about Pounds 20m in assets - when it should have
had around Pounds 60m.
So, for the time being, Mr Allbutt's contributions to that pension fund are
lost. He has now had to make new arrangements, and has a considerably more
secure personal pension with Scottish Widows.
Could it happen again? Mr Allbutt admits that he, like most of his
colleagues, had never found pensions at all interesting. Had he not been
worried by Maxwell's behaviour, he would not even have checked when he did -
reports of the pension scheme were advertised on company noticeboards as
being available, but were not sent to members individually.
He added: 'You get a lot of creatures like Maxwell who cajole and threaten
people. He had the reputation of being an impetuous and irrational
character. At the time, asking questions could well have put one's job on
the line.'
Hopes of compensation are now slender, as Mr Allbutt, although in his
fifties, is near the back of the queue for compensation. If he is to have
access to his savings, he says, compensation will not be 'terribly useful'
unles the AGB fund is totally refilled. He is determined to maintain
pressure to make sure this happens.
For the time being, he takes the episode very philosophically. 'You hadn't
better ask any of us what we think of Maxwell. He was a crook. But one has
to live one's life.'
And there is also the consolation that Maxwell's theft has provoked some
long overdue action. A government-appointed committee is now considering a
compensation scheme for company pensions, and is likely to force much
greater disclosure of fund management activities. Even changes to trust law
are possible.
But for the time being, how can you best spot potential misuse of your
pension fund? Mr Allbutt's experience provides many of the keys. Actuaries
at Noble Lowndes suggest that you start by finding out about the trustees:
Is there employee or trade union representation?
Is there an independent professional trustee?
Are the trustees all directors of the company?
Then read all the information you are sent, which should soon reveal if
something is amiss. Noble Lowndes suggests you look at the following:
The latest audited accounts and report to members - particularly those from
auditors and actuaries.
Reports on investments. Are the top 10 investment holdings in companies in
big reputable companies, or are they companies like Euris or Teva
Pharmaceutical, of which you have never heard?
Are significant amounts of funds invested in the employing company, or lent
back to it? (This one requires careful scrutiny. AGB's scheme had money in
Maxwell Communications, which was noticeable enough, but there was plenty
more inward investment to be unearthed).
Are investments concentrated in a small number of shares? In the case of
AGB, the top 20 holdings in a fund running to tens of millions of pounds
made up 65.6 per cent - not the kind of figure you will find in the ICI
Pension Fund or the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust.
If the actuarial valuation says the fund is in deficit, what plans are there
to remedy it? Had this question been raised publicly in the Maxwell case, no
convincing answer could have been forthcoming.
Finally, if the trustees do not give you the information you want, contact
the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (tel 071 233-8080), which can if
necessary refer your complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman. The name of a
solicitor with pensions knowledge can be obtained from the Association of
Pension Lawyers (tel 071 628-9151).
All of this may help you make an escape in time, if another fraud is being
perpetrated. But all these measures are stop-gaps. Long-term change is
needed.
Mr Allbutt's views are clear: 'The secrecy which has surrounded pension
funds can and must stop. We've got to lift the curtain to have more employee
representation and proper regular communication to fund members.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): How going by
the book drew order from chaos - Bernice Cohen is a theorist whose main
portfolio holds barely half a dozen shares, which she is prepared to trade
regularly to keep up her profits / Serious Riches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
A BUTTERFLY flapping its wings in Tokyo could create a hurricane in
Honolulu,' says Bernice Cohen. This is one of the principal claims of chaos
theory, a modern discipline which attempts to explain how unpredictable
events can be caused by chance circumstances, and how small changes in one
area can cause massive reactions in areas which are apparently unconnected.
The theory is central to Mrs Cohen's investment strategy, which over the
past year has successfully found plenty of order in the chaos of the equity
markets. These theories are also, indirectly, responsible for her entry into
the market in the first place.
Her interest in chaos theory, and related disciplines of systems analysis
and human sciences, led her to write three books, The Seamless Web, The
Origin of Civilisation and Global Perspectives, which set out an ambitious
holistic theory of human behaviour. In 1987, just as they were about to go
to press, her publisher was taken over, and the new owners decided not to
print it.
Nothing daunted, the Cohens remortgaged their house to fund a private
publication for the three volumes.
They did not make a profit.
Then the economy began to turn down, and Mrs Cohen decided on the strategy
she has now adopted. They sold their old house, and moved to a considerably
smaller one. She then invested the profits in equities in an attempt to
restore the money lost on the books in time to allow her husband to retire
two years early, as he had originally intended.
That means that all her investment targets are aimed at the end of next
year. So she does not have the luxury to look to the long term. She also
lacks large resources of capital.
This dictates her strategy, she says. She trades regularly, as long-termism
is not possible, and keeps diversification to a minimum.
But she is not distressed unduly by this. Chaos theory suggests that, as she
puts it: 'You can't have long-term forecasts on the stock market.'
This can be tempered by the recurring patterns, or 'fractals' in the jargon,
which can be identified; but the example of the butterfly's wings leaves her
with a deep cynicism about long-term planning.
And in any case: 'Diversification can be a bad idea, because it limits your
profits.' She quotes Peter Lynch, former manager of Fidelity's phenomenally
successful Magellan mutual fund in the US, in defence of this view. He had
problems with companies which diversified into areas in which they were not
experienced, and she has extended this to the management of her entire
portfolio.
Apart from a tax-efficient 10-year insurance plan from Skandia, which the
couple bought in 1984, and which allows frequent trades between different
unit trusts, the couple hold no collective investments.
Hence Mrs Cohen's main portfolio, which she administers using Fidelity's
share-dealing service, holds barely half a dozen shares, which she is
prepared to trade regularly to keep up her profits. She finds the Fidelity
service 'fabulous', as it is quick, efficient, and holds easily accessible
computer records of all previous trades.
She keeps a small portfolio, even though her early experiences might have
pushed her in another direction. Her first equity investment, made in April
1990 following a recommendation from Barclayshare, was Polly Peck. Within
months, she read a report in a Sunday paper which suggested the company was
heading for trouble.
She left a message with her broker's telephone answering machine, and was
able to sell first thing on Monday morning. As a result, she escaped with a
loss of 'only' 25 per cent. Many Polly Peck shareholders will have lost
everything.
Unit trusts and other collective investments seem so cosy because they
minimise just this risk, but Mrs Cohen carried on investing in shares. She
just decided to do her own research, rather than rely on the analysts. That
has made managing her portfolio a full-time job.
Her daily routine is based around the markets - it starts with the FT, which
she reads in the morning. Normally several articles will be cut out and
filed away.
She also uses the FT to revalue her portfolio (a task performed each week)
and update her charts, which are the key to playing the market. 'People who
say charts are voodoo investing are denying themselves a very powerful
analytical tool to help them in their investment success,' she says.
Like one of the previous subjects of this feature, Mrs Cohen subscribes to
Investment Research of Cambridge. When she sees a stark variation from a
stock's long-term trend, the time has come to trade in it.
How successful have the methods been? Last year, the largest stock in her
portfolio was Glaxo, the star stock market performer of the year. By the end
of the 1991, her holding in Glaxo made up 90 per cent of one of her personal
equity plans, and she decided it had peaked. Thus, on Boxing Day, she left a
letter with her Pep manager instructing him to sell.
Glaxo, in common with the rest of the pharmaceutical sector, has gone off
the boil this year, and this appears to have been the right move.
Now, the Pep is split between British Airways and Clarke Foods. She
describes BA as a recovery stock which is cutting its costs, and has also
noted a trend for Americans to buy cyclical recovery stocks.
In her main Fidelity portfolio she holds Airtours, which benefited last year
from the collapse of its main competitor, ILG. She doubled her money in
'about six weeks', and then sold her holding in three lots. Each successive
lot gained a higher price, as the shares were still going up.
The trend continued. Eventually, Mrs Cohen decided it was worth ploughing
back in to Airtours, but she chose to do so through the geared investment
vehicle of a warrant. The price of the shares has doubled again since she
bought the warrants, each of which allowed her to buy four shares. She has
now exercised the warrants, and is sitting on a massive profit.
However, she chose warrants because they were a cheap way to buy exposure to
the stock, rather than for the particular speculative advantages of gearing.
The rest of the Fidelity portfolio holds more BA, more Clarke Foods, Laird,
Psion, and Rathbone Brothers.
Mrs Cohen's diligent valuations allow her to pin-point the low point of her
portfolio, which came on July 1 last year. At that point it was down 6.8 per
cent on her initial capital.
'I first went into profit on October 5, which is the date I first met my
husband. By March 5 this year I was up by 21 per cent, or by 31 per cent on
the lowest point.'
This is good going. It has even been recognised by Analyst magazine, a trade
publication which recently ran a lengthy article explaining Mrs Cohen's
methods to investment professionals.
Unlike many private investors, Mrs Cohen has the benefit neither of great
inherited wealth, nor of funds from entrepreneurship.
She was born 55 years ago in Hackney, East London, and went to the local
state school. It took much hard work to travel from the East End to King's
College, London, where she was awarded a place to study dentistry. At that
time this was a particularly difficult feat for a poor, Jewish woman.
She met her husband, now a general practitioner, at King's and they now have
three sons, aged 30, 26 and 24.
Her career began to take its own idiosyncratic course after she left
dentistry, for health reasons, in the mid-1970s.
She now spent two years studying for an HND (Higher National Diploma) in
business studies at a local further education college. This introduced her
to archaeology and to systems analysis. From there she was launched into the
'seamless web' of human sciences, and her exploration of how humans learn by
common processes, and then come to react to events in the same way.
For the future, she is looking forward to the retirement her investment
efforts are helping to fund. She might even try to raise the money to
publish another book, which synthesises the first three and adds in her new
discoveries in chaos theory.
Whatever she does, she is unlikely to let either money or conventional
wisdom get in her way.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Battened down
for a long haul - Disappointed in UK equities, the four approach the next
quarter with caution / The Professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONDS HAVE swung into favour among our Professionals as they become
increasingly nervous about the US equity market, and batten down for a long,
slow haul in the UK.
Performances over the past quarter have continued to be dogged by the
dreadful state of Japan's equity market - now 60 per cent below its 1989
peaks. US performances have also been hurt in sterling terms by the striking
weakness of the dollar, which has tumbled by 10 per cent during the quarter.
All were disappointed that the UK equity market's honeymoon, following John
Major's general election victory, was so short-lived. Since all have
significant UK equity holdings, they hoped a post-election rally would give
a much-needed fillip to their portfolios.
In the event, the 4.6 per cent index gain over the quarter was not great
enough to eliminate the damage inflicted by falls in almost every other
market. The result was that every portfolio marked time - gaining or losing
no more than a percentage point.
Looking into the third quarter, there is a majority view that the dollar
will rally - Paul Myners, at Gartmore, predicts a rise of between 15 and 20
per cent - but no one translates this sentiment into a recommendation to buy
US equities. By consensus, these are overvalued and set to fall hard.
There is also extreme caution over the UK markets: 'It is easy to become
gloomy and pessimistic about prospects over the next few months,' says
Howard Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, cautiously pointing to an
improvement later in the year.
In similar vein, Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, warns that large cash
calls, low levels of institutional liquidity, rising unemployment and
continuing corporate 'shocks' will make the market dull short term.
All are shell-shocked by the free-fall of the Nikkei in Japan. While there
is agreement that Japanese equities now offer good value on fundamental
terms, after a 19 per cent fall on the quarter, no one is willing to predict
where the fall will end. A cut in interest rates, or a boost to public
spending, could reverse the trend, but none of our professionals is willing
yet to make fresh purchases in the market.
By contrast, Hong Kong is expected to continue roaring ahead, while
unsettled markets like Korea and Thailand are expected to recover ground,
making the Pacific region attractive for the coming quarter.
There is also a consensus that, after an awful first quarter, bonds now
offer attractive returns while inflation remains low, and equity markets
remain so uncertain.
Douglas McDougall (Baillie &amp; Gifford) plans to cut his UK equity holdings by
4 per cent to 40 per cent, forecasting 'below trend growth for a couple of
years' in the UK market. In turn, he is boosting his European and south-east
Asian equity stakes by 2 per cent apiece. He expects 'outstanding growth
prospects' in Hong Kong and south-east Asia, and is encouraged by signs of
recovery in eastern Germany: 'European stock markets in general should
benefit when eventually German interest rates decline.'
Paul Myners (Gartmore) is alone in planning to capitalise on an expected
rally in the dollar. By selling his 7.5 per cent stake in French bonds, and
adding it to the 5 per cent holding of USDollars cash, which is earning
insignificant interest at present, he is buying a large block of USDollars
bonds.
His other holdings remain unchanged, though in the UK he is shifting
emphasis to growth stocks, arguing that cyclical shares 'look very exposed'.
In Europe, where he agrees that interest rate cuts are much needed, the 15
per cent holding is also weighted heavily towards growth stocks, and to
Holland, Switzerland and France. He expects the short-term picture in Japan
to be 'dreadful', but plans to do nothing about the warrants that have cost
the portfolio so dear.
Howard Beaufort (Newton Investment Management) plans no changes to his
portfolio, in spite of his short-term gloom over the UK market.
While Denmark's assault on the Maastricht treaty has 'cast a shadow' over
Europe's stockmarkets, with a difficult summer in prospect, he thinks there
is good value to be found, particularly in France, and in 'established
growth areas' like foods and pharmaceuticals.
In the US, greatest danger comes from the risk of 'political miscalculation'
that might enable the erratic Ross Perot to 'upset the political apple
cart'. Only the Pacific rim markets - excluding Japan - remain attractive.
'Spring optimism in world financial markets has turned to summer malaise and
lethargy,' he concludes, arguing nevertheless that current uncertainties
present opportunities to invest 'in anticipation of a better close to the
year'.
Tim Howe (Singer &amp; Friedlander) has trimmed his tiny US equity stake from 5
per cent to 3 per cent, because of political and economic worries, and used
the proceeds to buy sterling cash, which now accounts for 7 per cent of the
portfolio. He is optimistic about European markets, particularly France and
Switzerland, and forecasts a strong rebound in Japan - when the market
eventually hits the floor.
Philosophical about the slump in his tiny Latin American holdings, he agrees
that these markets have 'lived up to their promise of volatility', but
remains resolute that they promise exceptional growth over the next few
years. On the Pacific region, 'the only worrying sign about Hong Kong seems
to be a complete lack of any bad news.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): How this
exercise works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise. The purpose is
to see how four professional fund managers manage a Pounds 250,000 portfolio
on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice.
In each case, the client is assumed to be either a wealthy individual or a
small self-administered pension fund; and all four emphasise that they are
investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for short-term
gain.
The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given
here were drawn up as at the beginning of this month, and will be reviewed
at the end of September.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Maastricht
upsets the apple-cart - Reaction to the treaty shows how politics can
complicate the market / Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHOOSING BETWEEN government bond markets ought to be easy, by comparison
with the complex business of analysing companies and buying equities.
In theory, government bond prices are determined by the outlook for interest
rates and inflation. As interest rates come down, bond prices rise so that
bond yields fall in sympathy. If inflation starts to rise, the real return
from bonds is eroded, so bond yields rise and bond prices fall.
However, the performance of bond markets over the past three months has
underlined the fact that nothing in the financial markets is quite so simple
in practice - not least because of the disruptive influence of politics.
The most vivid example came in Europe, where bond markets were dominated by
a single political factor: the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union
(Emu).
Following the signing of the treaty in November, bond prices in most
European markets were supported by the Maastricht factor. On June 2, this
prop was unexpectedly kicked away when Danish voters rejected the treaty in
a referendum.
In most European markets, bond prices fell sharply. The worst hit were those
where investors had invested most faith in Maastricht: Italy and Spain.
According to figures from Kemper Investment Management, Italian bonds turned
in a negative total return of 1.45 per cent during June. Spanish bonds
performed little better, with a negative return of 0.98 per cent on the
month.
Bonds denominated in Ecu, the fledgling European single currency, were also
hard hit. French and UK government bonds suffered in the immediate aftermath
of the Danish referendum, but have since recovered some poise.
Maastricht matters to bond market investors, because the treaty lays down
strict 'convergence criteria' which countries hoping to take part in Emu
must meet. For example, for a country to qualify for the next stage of
monetary union long-term interest rates should be no more than 2 per cent
higher than the average of the best three performing countries.
One argument is that Maastricht gave European governments a strong incentive
to get interest rates down and keep inflation under control - bull market
conditions for bonds. With the incentive removed, will European governments
be prepared to take the tough decisions necessary?
In countries with a strong reputation for controlling inflation, bond prices
barely twitched. For example, whether Maastricht stands or falls, the German
Bundesbank has a strong record of keeping inflation in check. Indeed, German
bonds actually gained in the immediate aftermath of the Danish referendum,
as investors switched funds out of other markets.
Italy, however, is a different matter. When the result of the Danish vote
was announced, the Italian state was without president or prime minister.
The budget deficit is still growing unchecked, and the lira is seen as the
most likely candidate for devaluation within the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The uncertain tone is likely to continue for some months. Although the Irish
people voted strongly in favour of the Maastricht treaty on June 18, a
bigger test will be the attitude of the French electorate in September. It
is also possible that Denmark will call a second referendum early next year,
to vote on a revised Maastricht treaty.
One positive impact of the Danish referendum could be to re-focus the
attention of bond investors away from politics and back to the economic
fundamentals of each market.
On this basis, many fund managers now tip German government bonds to be the
star performers of the second half of the year. German interest rates have
probably peaked, and as they come down bond yields will also fall. The
outlook for inflation is also good, so real returns should remain high.
The influence of politics can also be benign. The UK government bond market
was a clear example of this during April, when bond prices rocketed
following the Conservative election victory.
At the 10-year maturity, UK government bonds were yielding 10.25 per cent in
the week before the election. A week after the event, 10-year yields had
fallen to 9.30 per cent as bond prices rallied.
But economic fundamentals prevail in the end. At the end of June, 10-year
gilt yields stood at 9.38 per cent. In other words, bond prices are actually
lower than in mid-April.
Private investors who want to invest in international bond markets are best
advised to do so through a mutual fund. Fund managers control enough cash to
spread their risk across a large number of markets.
Big funds can also protect themselves against adverse currency movements.
Last month provided a clear lesson in how dangerous the foreign exchange
markets can be for a bond market investor. For example, a portfolio of
Australian government bonds returned almost 3 per cent during June, when
measured in Australian dollars. For a sterling-based investor, the same
portfolio would have shown a negative return of 2.5 per cent, because the
pound strengthened against the Australian dollar on the foreign exchange
markets.
But even the biggest bond funds have had a tough ride so far this year. Only
one of the 25 international bond unit trusts listed by Finstat showed a
positive return over the first half of the year - the AES International Bond
and Convertible Fund, which also invests in equity-linked instruments.
The recent political upheaval in Europe is one reason for the lacklustre
performance of most funds. But even outside Europe, bond markets have been
unkind so far this year.
For example, Japanese government bonds staged a recovery in the last three
months, but only after a disastrous performance in the first quarter of the
year. Bond prices are still not back to the levels seen in January.
US bond prices have also pushed higher over the past three months. At the
10-year maturity, US treasury bond yields are now a healthy 0.4 per cent
below the levels seen in early March. But again, the rally has only
corrected some of the damage done in the first quarter. Again, bond prices
remain significantly lower than at the turn of the year.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): A fresh use
for discarded policies - Poor cash-in values have prompted the launch of a
novel investment trust / What's new?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFINEMENT, rather than innovation, has been the main characteristic of
investments launched lately, with managers seeking to reassure
still-cautious investors of the tried and tested aspects of what is on
offer.
The flow of new savings vehicles was inhibited by the impending arrival on
the market of National Savings' First Option bond (see page 7 of this
Review).
Forewarned in the Budget of this unspecified competition to come 'in the
summer', building societies planned to retaliate once details were
announced, shying away from the idea of a pre-emptive strike at savers'
money.
Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust, due to begin dealing next week, is an
investment trust that aims to feed on the success of the secondary market
that has developed in second-hand insurance policies as a result of the poor
cash-in values offered by insurance companies.
Estimates suggest that, in the past five years, the number of people
choosing to sell their insurance policies, either at auction or to a
specialist marketmaker, rather than accept the insurance company's surrender
value, has risen from less than 100 a year to nearly 8,500, worth around
Pounds 50m.
A policyholder can make between 15 and 30 per cent more from a sale than
from cashing in with the insurance company, though sales commissions can
absorb up to one-third of this difference.
The policies, with-profits endowments, are bought by investors as
high-return investments. However, projected returns of 14 per cent and above
are usually based on the assumption that insurance companies will continue
to increase bonuses attaching to policies, whereas many have been making
cuts in the past year.
Kleinwort says the trust will buy policies direct from individuals, so
avoiding sales commissions.
Assuming unchanged bonus rates over the 11-year life of the trust, the gross
yield at the issue price would be 12.7 per cent. But the management charge
is high and calculated in an unusual way. Set at 0.5 per cent plus VAT, it
is based not on net asset value but on the original amount raised. The
charge is also to be indexed to the RPI.
Save &amp; Prosper has modelled its Capital Portfolio unit trust on
private-client portfolios already run for some years by Fleming Private
Asset Management, the stockbroking subsidiary of S&amp;P's parent Robert Fleming
group.
Investments are to be limited to between 20 and 25 well known blue-chip
shares, reflecting the group's experience that investors like to have a
clear idea of where their money is going.
For the same reason, Save &amp; Prosper plans to hold an annual meeting, at
which the investment manager of Capital Portfolio, Graham Ball, will explain
his strategy and selection of stocks. 'Investors will be able to whinge if
they are not happy,' said an S&amp;P spokesman.
Charges on the Capital Portfolio unit trust are an initial 5 1/2 per cent
and an annual 1 1/4 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000.
Stockbrokers Foster &amp; Braithwaite have launched a personal pension plan
based on a Provident Life policy and a choice of three unit-linked funds:
cash, managed and managed investment trust.
In a seeming contradiction, the firm claims that its plan gives both
investors and investment salesmen a better deal than the usual pension
policy. This is because initial commission is lower but continuing charges
are higher.
Instead of swallowing 100 per cent of the first year's premiums, as is
common with pension plans, commission and charges on the Foster &amp;
Braithwaite plan account for 22 per cent. As there is no bid-offer spread on
the units, the remaining 78 per cent is fully invested.
However, there is a continuing annual charge of 2 per cent on regular
premium policies, plus a policy charge, currently Pounds 48 a year but to be
increased annually in line with the National Earnings Index, which usually
outstrips the Retail Prices Index.
Eurotrust, launched by Henderson, is a split-capital investment trust with
25 per cent zero-coupon preference shares and 75 per cent ordinary shares.
Defining Europe as including Britain, the trust will initially be invested
12 per cent in the UK, 23 per cent in France, 14 per cent in Germany and 16
per cent in the Netherlands.
Although the past is not a guide to the future, Henderson's record of
investment in Europe, as reflected in the performance of two of its unit
trusts, has not been brilliant. According to Finstat, Henderson European
trust ranked 53rd out of 85 unit trusts in the European sector over five
years and 87th out of 124 over one year. Henderson European Smaller
Companies ranked 78th out of 85 over five years and 85th out of 124 over one
year. Henderson European Income performed more creditably, ranking 11th out
of 85 over five years and 22nd out of 124 over one year.
BNP Mortgages, a subsidiary of Banque Nationale de Paris, has launched a
loan aimed at people who are finding it difficult to sell inherited
property.
Lending up to 75 per cent of the valuation, with a maximum of Pounds
150,000, for a term of between five and 45 years, BNP says it will agree to
letting of the property on a fixed-term assured tenancy or corporate let
basis, but only if its solicitors approve the letting agreement, which must
run for at least six months.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Summertime,
and the market's not easy - So perhaps this is an appropriate moment to mark
time, and reflect on the notional portfolio's well-being - and its one
disaster / Equities: Building a portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SUMMER. . . The sun's intense light made the sea gleam as it lapped the
fine, sandy coastline. The temperature was 28 degrees Celsius - or, as I
prefer to think of it, 82 degrees Fahrenheit.
One of the most popular beaches in Poole, Dorset, was crowded - yet I was
the only customer in the ice-cream shop on the beach. A few years ago, in
similar conditions, there would have been a long queue.
This summer there are signs that many people are still suffering from the
effects of the recession, and are being cautious with their discretionary
expenditure. This does not augur well for retail sales in general, and makes
me view the stock market with caution.
In the same way that many people now appear to eat ice-creams at home,
rather than on the beach, and buy them cheaply from supermarkets, so more
people are looking around for bargains.
Perhaps this partly explains why cheap manufactured goods from abroad
continue to pour into the UK, helping to worsen this country's balance of
payments deficit. A devaluation of the pound would have helped to promote
exports and made imports more expensive. Sadly, even a realignment of
currencies has not yet happened.
Despite this, as can be seen from the table, the portfolio has performed
quite well. The takeover of Taveners by Toms Fabrikker, a Danish chocolate
and confectionery group, turned an investment of Pounds 2,450 into cash of
Pounds 5,985.
Pentland has benefited by wider recognition of its excellent management and
the company's strong brand names, such as Speedo swimwear, Pony sports
shoes, and its shareholding in Adidas (which it has since agreed to buy).
The company's strong cash holding, following the disposal of its interest in
the Reebok sports shoe company, has also helped to highlight its
attractions.
The portfolio's one disaster (so far) has been its investment in Gestetner.
Although I mentioned that this was a 'risky' investment, I had hoped that
the downside risk would be limited by the company's association with Ricoh,
the Japanese office-equipment and camera manufacturer. In September last
year, it was announced that Ricoh had acquired 24.2 per cent of Gestetner,
paying 250p per share. I felt that, if Gestetner did not perform, then Ricoh
would take appropriate action to protect the value of its investment.
The portfolio, therefore, bought 1,500 Gestetner shares at 183p each in
October. Soon after that purchase, Gestetner issued a profits warning and
the shares fell to 108p. Gestetner's results for the year to October 31,
1991, proved to be down 57 per cent over the previous year. However, the
company had shed 10 per cent of its workforce, reduced its gearing level
considerably; and I still hoped that, in the long term, Gestetner's
performance would improve.
Sadly, this does not appear to have happened. The company's interim figures,
announced on June 17, showed pre-tax profits plunging from Pounds 21.7m to
Pounds 8.2m. Although net debt was again reduced and distribution
difficulties in Europe apparently resolved, the immediate trading prospects
for the company do not look too bright, unless there is an upturn in the
economies of many of the countries in which Gestetner trades.
Although I had earlier set a 'stop loss' level of 90p for Gestetner, I
decided to cut losses sooner and so sold the portfolio's Gestetner holding
for 132p per share, immediately I read the company's interim results on the
teletext services on BBC2 and Channel 4.
Taking a five-year view, Gestetner may well be a good investment. But at
present I prefer to play safe.
There is a strong temptation to sell my investment in Pentland and keep cash
throughout the summer. I feel the US stock market has reached ridiculous
heights, looking at price-earnings ratios of American companies and future
prospects. There are warning signs, too, in the UK.
There are several companies with minimal real assets that creative
accounting and sharp PR firms have helped to hype to record levels. Their
bubbles are overdue for popping, although one suspects that some of their
directors are hoping for takeover offers before then. And if sentiment
towards the market generally takes a downturn, due to a stagnant economic
situation, then even good shares will fall with the bad.
However, the portfolio would retain its Pentland holding as the Olympic
Games coverage of Speedo and Adidas sportswear ought to boost the company's
sales. But it is prudent to set a level at which the shares will be sold,
should the market suddenly take a turn for the worse or begin a gradual
downward trend.
Pentland would be sold if the shares fell to 105p and it looked as if a
general market slide would make them fall further. The portfolio might then
consider repurchasing Pentland at lower levels.
In the spring Quarterly Review, when Fisons shares were 356p, I commented:
'The company has announced a stream of bad news this year, but has all the
bad news been discovered and released - or is there more to come?'
I mentioned that the portfolio would consider Fisons shares at around the
285p level, provided they looked as if they would not fall much further.
On June 12, Fisons warned that its interim pre-tax profits would be less
than half the Pounds 95.2m figure achieved in the first six months of 1991.
City analysts were quoted as being 'stunned by the unexpected announcement'
and Fisons shares plummeted by 100p in a day to end up at 245p. In the
absence of a bid, it looked as if Fisons could fall still further, and so
the portfolio did not acquire any Fisons shares. However, the company will
be monitored in the hope of detecting signs of either its 'bottom price' or
takeover activity, and the portfolio could possibly then acquire Fisons
shares. Perhaps the 'bottom price' (if no bid emerges) might be around
175-185p; and even at that level the portfolio would only risk buying 1,000
shares.
There are a number of 'special situations' which the portfolio will watch
over the summer months - but it is unlikely to purchase anything, as the
summer sun is likely to induce lethargy in the market; and in the run-up to
the fifth anniversary of the October crash of 1987, investors will no doubt
be reminded yet again of the need for caution. Special situations should, I
hope, still be there - at lower prices - in the winter. Currently, cash in
the building society or bank, even with reduced interest rates, still has
some attractions.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Weak figures
leave New York investors little to look forward to - Equities

REMEMBER THE double-dip? Euphoria in the wake of the Gulf war victory in
1991 briefly spurred economic activity across the US, only for stagnation to
set in soon after.
Now, there is talk of a triple-dip, with a few people on Wall Street warning
that the US economy could be going into reverse for the third time in two
and a half years.
The triple-dippers are a trifle over-pessimistic, but the lacklustre nature
of the recovery has been worrying. Gross domestic product grew by 2.7 per
cent in the first quarter, but in the wake of recent poor economic numbers,
GDP growth in the second quarter will probably be below 2 per cent.
This slowdown in economic activity has put a dampener on stock market
sentiment. During the second quarter, share prices made little ground.
As of the penultimate day of June, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
advanced just 2.6 per cent to 3,319.86, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 had
risen 1.3 per cent to 408.91.
Investors, meanwhile, lost faith in growth stocks, which helps explain why
the Nasdaq composite index, undermined by big falls in once-high flying
biotech and healthcare companies, dropped 7.5 per cent during the three
months to 558.80.
The quarter did not start as gloomily as it ended. April was marked by some
surprisingly good three-monthly corporate earnings - even Ford and General
Motors managed to post a profit - and a modest easing of monetary policy by
the Federal Resere. This, plus some encouraging numbers on retail sales and
the housing market during May, contributed to a slow, if uneven, rise in
share values. Cyclical stocks - those most likely to benefit from a recovery
 -attracted the most demand.
Yet there were hiccups along the way, including the riots in Los Angeles,
which showed that the recovery was not reaching into the nation's cities,
and the bankruptcy of Olympia &amp; York (O&amp;Y), the Canadian property developer
and a big borrower from New York banks.
By the start of June, the Dow had reached 3,400. That, however, proved to be
the limit of the market's achievements. The warning signs of a correction
had already been evident in the poor performance of the S&amp;P 500 and the
Nasdaq composite, which lagged behind the Dow throughout the quarter - proof
that confidence in the market was not broadly spread.
Over the next few weeks, the Dow dropped more than 100 points, as concern
about the economy grew in the wake of bad news on retail sales and
employment. Worst of all, the recovery in the housing market appeared to
have stalled, the result of a rise in mortgage rates during the quarter.
By the end of June, investors had little to look forward to, although weak
economic figures had bolstered hopes that the Fed might lower interest
rates. With election politics sowing uncertainty, economic growth slowing,
and no immediate interest rate cut in sight, the outlook for share prices as
the third quarter opened was none too bright.
Canada mimicked the US. Its economic recovery was sluggish, and O&amp;Y did
little to help sentiment, leaving Canadian investors hoping the US Fed would
ease policy, paving the way for lower Canadian rates. During the quarter the
Toronto Stock Exchange 300
composite index fell by 1 per cent.
Mexico suffered a big reversal, not totally unexpected given the dramatic
nature of the market's rally. The Bolsa index fell by 14.6 per cent in the
April-to-June period. Investors were concerned about the still-unsigned
North American Free Trade Agreement, the weak world economy, and the
possibility that Mexican unions might sell their big stake in
telecommunications giant Telmex.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Analysts
predict some nasty surprises among European results - Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED WEAKNESS in the Japanese equity market and Denmark's 'no' to the
Maastricht Treaty eroded gains made by continental European bourses earlier
in the second quarter.
But the overall performance for Europe was helped by the UK, which had been
given a hefty boost by the Conservative victory in the general election.
According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Europe including the UK rose
0.2 per cent on the quarter, but excluding the UK it fell 2.2 per cent.
Some analysts expect European stock markets to have a difficult time in the
third quarter. They expect some nasty surprises to emerge from the first
half results reporting season, in particular from cyclical industries, such
as bulk chemicals. Analysts have already started to downgrade their earnings
forecasts in anticipation of sharply lower second quarter results.
'People are not likely to be new investors at current levels,' says Mr Gary
Dugan, European strategist at Baring Securities. He expects a fall of 5 per
cent or more across continental bourses over the summer.
In its global strategy review for the third quarter, UBS Philips and Drew is
also negative about world equity markets, which it views as very expensive
to underlying earnings. 'Earnings cuts are likely over the summer, and
equities will continue to struggle,' it predicts.
Germany is its market of choice in this environment, because it believes the
German economy can buck the trend of slower economic growth, that German
company balance sheets remain strong, and that German companies will be the
first to take advantage when the industrial cycle finally turns up.
Mr Dugan is neutral on Germany, because the negative impact of slowing
economic growth and dimming hopes of an interest rate cut in the fourth
quarter is offset by prospects of strong import growth in the US, which will
draw in capital goods from Germany. France, on the other hand, is unlikely
to make much progress before its referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which
may not be held until September.
Goldman Sachs says that, on the premise that uncertainty relating to
European Monetary Union (Emu) is likely to remain a dominant theme over the
short term, it advises investors to opt for markets which are least
vulnerable to monetary union, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and
Switzerland.
Denmark's refusal to endorse closer European union troubled Spanish and
Italian equities, as Emu's planned 'convergence' of European economic
indicators was thrown into doubt. Emu was seen as helping to reduce
inflation in southern European economies. According to the FT-A World
Indices, Spain fell by 7.6 per cent in local currency terms, while Italy
fell by 8.9 per cent.
Mr Stephen Hughes, Spanish analyst at Nikko Europe, believes that the fall
in the Madrid stock market, fuelled by macro-economic fears and financial
problems at some well-known companies, has been exaggerated. He is cautious
of the market in the next quarter, because of the general uncertainty about
the direction of global stock markets over the summer. However, he
recommends picking up stocks on a 12-month view.
Italy was paralysed by the lack of a government until the end of the
quarter; but repeated breakdowns in Milan's new
electronic trading system, blamed on thunder storms, have also deterred
fresh investment, sending the Comit index to a low for the year.
Goldman Sachs says the short-term outlook for the market depends largely on
the prospects for budgetary control and electoral reform. 'If the
politicians begin to put their house in order, this could lead to a
sustained re-rating of Italian equities,' the broker adds.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Tokyo
languishes but the China factor helps to lift Hong Kong - Equities

THINGS COULD hardly look gloomier for the Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei
Stock Average is down more than 30 per cent since the beginning of the year,
and market participants foresee no short-term recovery.
The past quarter's bad news included worries over the stability of the
financial system, weak corporate earnings results and bankruptcies at
leading companies.
The index fell through 19,000 at the start of April, despite a 75 basis
point cut in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan on the last day
of March. Traders blamed the central bank's slow response to the weakening
economy, and the fact that that the anticipated move had already been
discounted into share prices.
Share prices weakened further as anxiety about bad loans at the leading
banks and the soundness of the financial system itself spread among
investors. The index plunged through 17,000 and 16,000 on
worse-than-expected corporate earnings forecasts by leading brokerages,
following the results season, and rumours of bankruptcies at leading
property-related companies.
Investors have remained absent from the market as the Nikkei has fallen to
its lowest levels since 1986. Forecasts of its next support level range from
14,000 to 12,000. However, analysts have become reluctant to point to a
bottom, because of investors' lack of confidence.
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Pacific Rim region, things look brighter.
Traders in Hong Kong raised their glasses in May, as the Hang Seng Index
surged above the critical 6,000 level. The Hong Kong market has seen
substantial buying by US pension funds; and recently the return of the
locals, who had been reluctant to come in due to sour memories of the crash
of 1987, has doubled daily turnover to around HKDollars 3bn.
In addition to the downward pressure on interest rates, political statements
by Chinese leaders, supporting economic reforms using capitalist methods,
have sparked a rally in China-related stocks, encouraging buying by
investors who want an indirect exposure to China's potential economic
growth.
However, the Hong Kong market remains vulnerable to political events.
Uncertainty about the renewal of China's 'most favoured nation' trading
status with the US, and the debate about the financing of the new airport,
could cause volatility as the Hang Seng index continues to test new highs.
Australian equities - after a rally in late April helped by lower
inflationary pressure and lower bond yields - remained in the 1,625 to 1,675
range for the most of May and June. Evidence of an economic recovery has
been slow to emerge, and the All Ordinaries index may remain within that
range until clear signs of a rebound appear.
Bangkok, which was hit by civil unrest, seems to offer the most potential on
the upside. Towards the end of the quarter, the SET index was more than 9
per cent off its peak at 750. 'The market is oversold,' says Mr David
Shairp, research director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, in Hong Kong.
After a firm first quarter, the SET index climbed to the year's peak of 832
at the beginning of April. However, it weakened on political uncertainty
surrounding General Suchinda Kraprayoon's government.
The market has since recovered from the 660 level, its lowest since December
1991, posted after the military crushed protests against the appointment of
General Suchinda. Efforts by financial authorities and the new government to
restore confidence in Thailand's political system and financial markets have
been welcomed by investors. Additionally, prospects of an economic slowdown
and a narrowing current account deficit point to scope for lower interest
rates, a positive sign for share prices.

7.5 per cent return / Equities

THE CONSERVATIVES' general election victory prompted an upsurge in London's
stock market during much of the second quarter. But the market had come
under hefty selling pressure towards the end of the period.
The slide accompanied disappointing news about the UK economy and some dire
news from some of the biggest companies. Notable among these was BP, where
the chairman was ousted in a palace coup amid strong hints that the oil
group's dividend would be cut for the first time since the first world war.
ICI delivered a gloomy review of prospects, causing analysts to chop their
profits estimates by up to 8 per cent.
Over the three months, the FT-SE 100 share index rose 81.1, or 3.32 per cent
(from 2,440.1 to 2,521.2).
While the Tories' win confounded many pollsters and commentators, the stock
market wasn't entirely taken by surprise. Having been in decline throughout
March, the Footsie was languishing at just below 2,400 the day before the
election. Polling day, however, brought a distinct change of heart, with
dealers scrambling to close short positions built up just before the
election when the opinion polls had pointed to a Labour win.
The following day saw the Footsie soar 136 points, with turnover reaching
the highest levels since the days before the crash of October 1987. The
euphoria lasted exactly a month, with the index climbing to a peak of
2,737.8 on May 11.
Equity market strategists spent that period reworking their end-of-year
Footsie forecasts. Many foresaw 3,000 and beyond, reflecting hopes that
emergence of the economy from the longest recession since the 1930s would be
rapid.
Events proved otherwise. Forecasts of gross domestic product for the current
year were repeatedly chopped, with zero growth now expected; while the
Danish rejection of the Maastricht accord created a mood of political
uncertainty around the European Community.
The succession of big gains by share prices coincided with a series of big
placements and a Pounds 154m rights issue from BICC. In the days either side
of Footsie's achieving its record, Lord Hanson orchestrated the placing of
the controversial 2.82 per cent stake his company acquired in ICI, and BTR
sold its 4.1 per cent holding in Pilkington. Other big post-election stake
sales included Williams Holdings' placing of the 9.9 per cent stake in
Racal. The Kuwait Investment Office sold its 10.5 per cent Midland Bank
stake into the market.
These placings, fears of more rights issues and the Government's gilts
funding programme all served to starve the equity market of new money. And
fund managers conserved their cash allocations, to accommodate a long list
of new issues in coming months - to say nothing of the latest call on BT,
which itself will account for almost Pounds 2bn.
County NatWest recently estimated that, this month alone, Pounds 4.4bn will
be absorbed by new issues. The eleventh-hour withdrawal of the GPA flotation
and the postponed flotation of 3i were symptomatic of the general unease
throughout the world's stock markets.
The outlook for the third quarter is uncertain, with the behaviour of Wall
Street and Tokyo likely to be crucial to London's performance.

THE SECOND quarter was another miserable one for equity investors, and the
choice of markets didn't matter much - provided you avoided Japan, yet
again.
The Nikkei index, which had dropped through the psychologically important
20,000 support level in the first quarter, ended the second below 16,000.
Over the quarter, Japan had a negative total return, measured in sterling,
of minus-16.2 per cent.
Most other equity markets did a lot better, although still in negative
territory. In sterling terms, the FT-Actuaries World index closed the period
at 107.87, or some 10 index points off its level on March 31. In terms of
total returns, global equity markets produced a negative 7.5 per cent for
sterling investors.
All in all, it's been a bad first half, although there were a few moderately
bright markets over the past quarter, notably Hong Kong, the UK and
Switzerland. In the last Quarterly Review, this column foresaw uncertain
times immediately ahead, and advised private investors and cautious fund
managers to stay overweight in cash. Anyone who did so was ahead of the game
at the end of June.
Why the dismal performances? In a word: uncertainty. The unexpected return
of a majority Conservative government in Britain did produce the almost
inevitable bounce in UK equities, but much of it did not hold against
continuing concern about the economy. Nonetheless, there was a positive
total return of 4.7 per cent.
On the wider European front, Danish voters' rejection of the Maastricht
treaty put a big question-mark over moves towards European monetary union, a
mood only partially relieved by an enthusiastic Irish vote in favour. France
holds its Maastricht referendum in September, amid fears that the specific
issue could be clouded by the domestic unpopularity of President Francois
Mitterrand. This is likely to keep the European equity sector uncertain over
the next quarter.
Investor confidence was not helped when a major share flotation by Ireland's
GPA Group, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was pulled at the
last minute for lack of institutional interest, particularly in the US. This
has cast a shadow over an even bigger share sale, scheduled for July 27, by
the Wellcome Trust, of a large slice of its holdings in the British drugs
company that bears its name. Wellcome is no GPA, but jumpy equity markets
would like to see the sale safely away.
The Wall Street picture seems no more secure. Election jitters are in the
air, with the maverick Ross Perot unnerving President George Bush from the
right and the Democrat, Bill Clinton, snapping from the left. The proclaimed
US economic recovery appears anaemic, or at best only modest, and Wall
Street over the last quarter moved sideways. Dollar investors saw a mere 1.6
per cent in total return.
Tokyo, measured by the Nikkei, actually chose the last trading day of the
quarter to record a three-month low at 15,785, with the few remaining
optimists there hoping for some kind of market support from the
supplementary budget promised for later in the summer.
Where do the markets go from here, amid all this political and economic
uncertainty? The big global players report that they are cutting back on
equity holdings, switching to bonds and cash. But some German houses claim
to be buying selectively in London and in a number of other European markets
 -the rationale being that lower German interest rates (when they eventually
materialise) could start off an equity buying spree in many continental
markets.
But with so much gloom and uncertainty about, it is mainly the contrarians
who see good buying opportunities at the moment. For the rest, and
especially over the next quarter, staying overweight in cash may be best for
the nerves.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): A triple-B
portfolio reshuffle - . . . in which Mr Ledger and Mr Stagge help John and
Alison beat an attack of mid-life ennui, and the birthday season looks
brighter / The Plowshares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JOHN PLOWSHARE is facing his 50th birthday. A sobering thought for anyone,
but particularly sobering when you haven't been keeping up the payments into
your personal pensions because of the effect of the recession on your firm.
The thought of getting older - can it really be half a century? - and of
getting older on less cash than he had planned, has kept John distracted and
miserable for several days.
It has finally got on Alison's nerves, particularly as she, too, has been
distracted and miserable and nobody has noticed. Her misery stems from a
feeling of guilt, that nobody has made sufficient fuss of Lucy and Toby, who
have achieved 21 and 18 respectively in the past year.
These were birthdays which, in pre-recession days, would have been marked by
the Plowshares with a fairly substantial party at the very least.
John and Alison finally meet, both distracted and miserable, wandering
around the conservatory late one evening. 'What is the matter with you?'
each asks the other. And sad stories are exchanged.
'I feel so old,' howls John, collapsing on to an ancient and uncomfortable
Rattan chair. 'I've got friends retiring at 50, but there's no way I can
even think of retiring for at least another 20 years on my current pension
provision.'
And I feel such a killjoy,' moans Alison. 'We could have done a little more
for the children with their coming-of-age birthdays, let alone for your 50th
birthday. I'm so bored with being careful with cash on a day-to-day basis.'
The only obvious source of cash is the Plowshares' savings and portfolio of
unit trusts, which they put together 18 months ago under the sensible advice
of Mr Stagge, of stockbrokers Stagge &amp; Hoppitt, and Mr Ledger, their
accountant.
Since then, they have received endless bits of paper and statements and the
odd thing to sign, but they have no clear idea of what their holdings are
actually worth.
John and Alison make an appointment, and later in the week go off to visit
Mr Stagge. At the time of sorting out their portfolios, he had recommended
that they move the bulk of their money out of the building society, where
interest rates on deposit accounts were dropping, and invest it in unit
trusts.
This appears to have been rather a good idea. To the Plowshares' surprise
and joy, their portfolios are looking extremely healthy.
increased by 29.6 per cent on an offer-to-offer basis over the 18 months.
The Plowshares' original Pounds 50,000 is now worth Pounds 64,817, and, much
to Alison's pleasure in particular, the best performing part of the
portfolio has turned out to be the Pacific Basin funds that she was
particularly keen on.
The Peps have managed a respectable performance, too. The Plowshares put a
further Pounds 6,000 each in from the building society in this tax year and
now have Pounds 24,000 invested in Peps - now worth Pounds 28,000. Beyond
that, they have Pounds 26,000 rainy-day money in the building society, which
is kept in Alison's name for tax purposes.
However, it is not all good news. Flushed with the thrill of having
increased their capital fairly easily, the Plowshares move on to visit Mr
Ledger, the accountant.
'You're not nearly up to scratch on your pensions, Mr Plowshare,' says Mr
Ledger, sternly. 'I would recommend that, as your portfolio has done so well
under Mr Stagge's care, you take your Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax
allowance out of your unit trust portfolio, before indexation, and catch up
on your premium holiday. Say, Pounds 2,000 for the last two years plus an
additional Pounds 1,800 into your pensions.'
It turns out that, at age 50, John is entitled to put 25 per cent of his net
relevant earnings from his partnership into a pension and gain 40 per cent
tax relief; so he is well within his allowances.
In fact, if he had sufficient cash, he could apply a back-tracking technique
over the last six tax years to take advantage of unused tax relief. However,
his cash-flow clearly won't allow this at the moment.
Meanwhile, Alison could also take up to Pounds 5,800 tax-free out of her
portfolio if she wished, and Mr Ledger recommends that she also put Pounds
750 into a new personal pension plan, which she can pay net of basic-rate
tax relief. Alison decides that she would like to gift Pounds 1,000 to her
daughter Lucy and Pounds 500 to Toby from her capital gain. This, it turns
out, is well within the annual Pounds 3,000 exemption for gifts, and so will
not incur any tax.
A further recommendation is not so popular with Alison. 'You could always
transfer some of your portfolio gain, or some of the building society money
over to your husband, so that he could make a further contribution into his
pension,' says Mr Ledger.
After some noisy debate, over which we will draw a veil, Alison agrees to
transfer Pounds 3,000 of the capital gain on her portfolio to John, with
which he can top up his pension - a transfer which attracts no taxation.
On their way home, Alison reflects, rather mournfully: 'I suppose I feel
like a generous sort of person now - which is some comfort. I mean, I've
given away Pounds 4,500 to my immediate family. . . But I still feel like a
killjoy.'
'And I still feel old,' adds John.
But the Plowshares are sensible people; and it doesn't take them long to
work out that the solution to this one is a party to mark all three
birthdays - and to help Alison continue to feel generous.
Help in compiling this feature was provided by SM Searle, from Gerrard
Vivian Gray, who put together the portfolio, and David Oldridge, of Hill
Oldridge, who supplied financial advice.
Who's who
The Plowshares, a couple in their late forties, live in one of the smarter
bits of North London. John is a partner in an architectural practice and
earned Pounds 60,000 last year, though this year times have proved harder
and his earnings are down to Pounds 50,000. . . Alison has a part-time job
as a receptionist for the local GP. The Plowshares have two children: Lucy,
who is 21, at university in the Midlands, and Toby, 18, about to leave
school. . . Following the deaths of John's parents and his subsequent
inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of unit trusts, a Pep each and
some rainy-day money in the building society.

NATIONAL SAVINGS products are an obvious investment for those seeking a
fixed return on their money. Since they are issued by the government, they
are completely safe and they offer attractive rates of return.
They tend to be ignored by financial advisers, because they do not pay
commission, but application forms are easy to get hold of over the post
office counter.
Fixed rates are available on Certificates - the index-linked and 37th issue
 -the Yearly Plan, Children's bonus bonds, Capital bonds, and the new First
Option bond, launched on July 7.
The First (Fixed Interest Rate Savings Tax-Paid) Option Bond carries a
guaranteed interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to 10.34 per cent
gross) on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. Tax is deducted at source, and the bond
is aimed at the country's 25.1m basic-rate taxpayers. A higher rate of 8.05
per cent net is payable on Pounds 20,000 and above.
The rate is guaranteed for a year, but National Savings can announce a new
rate of interest for new issues at any time.
The bond is part of the government's strategy to raise Pounds 28bn for the
public sector borrowing requirement.
The suitability of the fixed rate products you choose depends on your tax
status:
Higher-rate taxpayer: National Savings certificates are the best choice,
because they are free of income tax and capital gains tax. The 37th issue
certificate offers a guaranteed return of 8 per cent per annum compound if
held for five years. The minimum investment is Pounds 25 and the maximum
Pounds 7,500, although an additional Pounds 10,000 can be invested from
matured certificates of earlier issues. The return is the equivalent of
13.33 per cent to a 40 per cent payer and 10.67 per cent to a basic-rate
taxpayer.
The index-linked certificates pay 4.5 per cent per annum above the rate of
inflation, measured by the Retail Prices Index. You can hold a maximum of
Pounds 10,000, and returns are again tax-free. It is possible to hold both
sets of certificates but those wishing to choose between the two have to
make a decision on where they expect the inflation rate to be within the
next five years. If you think it will be above 4 per cent per annum, then
index-linked certificates are going to be the more attractive.
The Yearly Plan is a scheme for saving once a month for a year, in order to
buy a Savings Certificate at the end of that year. Savers pay a fixed amount
(between Pounds 20 and Pounds 400) by monthly standing order. This means
that the maximum value Savings Certificate that you can obtain through the
Yearly Plan is Pounds 2,400.
The certificate must be held for a further four years to earn the average
current return of 8 per cent tax-free per annum. Since payments in the first
year are staggered, the total return will be lower than if the investor had
placed Pounds 2,400 in the 37th issue certificates at the outset. Savers can
hold the Yearly Plan in addition to the certificates.
Non-taxpayers: Capital Bonds also offer a guaranteed return if held for five
years, but are subject to tax. Non-taxpayers will have the benefit of
receiving interest gross, because the tax is not deducted on the interest
payment. The present Series D offers a gross return of 10.75 per cent per
annum, compound over five years. The bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds
100, to a maximum of Pounds 100,000.
Basic rate taxpayers: This gap in the product range has been met by the new
one-year First Option bond. The bond pays a fixed rate of interest (see
above) net of basic rate tax on a minimum of Pounds 1,000, guaranteed for
one year at a time, although investors can hold the bond for more than a
year if they like the sound of the next annual fixed rate. Interest will be
added annually.
However, there are stiff penalties for early withdrawal. If the bond is
cashed in before the first anniversary, no interest will be paid.
Withdrawals between anniversaries will attract half interest for the period
since the previous anniversary. If you do not cash in the bond, any revised
rate will be paid automatically for a further year.
The maximum holding is Pounds 250,000. Non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax
that has been deducted ast source.
Basic rate taxpayers who want a fixed rate over a five-year period will be
marginally better off buying Capital Bonds than the 37th issue certificates,
because even after deducting 25 per cent tax, the return will be 8.063 per
cent per annum.
Children: The issue B Children's Bonus Bond pays a tax-free and guaranteed
return equal to 10.9 per cent per annum over its first five years.
These can be bought in multiples of Pounds 25 to a maximium holding of
Pounds 1,000. Adults will have to purchase the bond for children under the
age of 16, and there are no more returns after the 21st birthday.
Disadvantages: The main disadvantage with National Savings certificates and
bonds is that they do not pay an income: all of the return comes from the
increase in value on maturity. They are also inflexible - the returns cited
are only achieved if you hold them for exactly five years. If you sell them
beforehand, the returns are reduced; if you forget to redeem them on
maturity, the certificates start to earn the unattractive general extension
rate of 5.01 per cent.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Regular
payments, and no shocks - They are likely to suit people in retirement and
basic-rate taxpayers / Fixed interest 2: Guaranteed Income Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

GUARANTEED IS a comforting, if unexciting, word well suited to describing
the nature of guaranteed income bonds (Gibs).
The comfort derives from knowing that your income is fixed, and that there
will be none of the surprises (or shocks) which equity investments or
variable interest rates can produce.
Most guaranteed income bonds are offered by smaller life companies. Your
money is invested with the company for a fixed period, and in return you are
paid a guaranteed rate of interest. The best rates tend to be on bonds
paying out interest yearly, but some Gibs pay at monthly, quarterly and
twice-yearly intervals.
The rate paid depends on the amount invested and the length of time the
capital is to be tied up, usually one to five years. As with all fixed-rate
products, the attractions of Gibs depends on your view of where interest
rates are going. They will be most attractive at a time when interest rates
look as if they are about to fall, enabling you to lock into a higher rate.
The lower table shows the difference in the best rates on offer over yearly
intervals to the month of June, over the past five years. Someone who locked
into 8 per cent for a three-year bond in 1988 will have done particularly
badly; but unless interest rates rise substantially, an investor who bought
a five-year bond in 1990, at 10.5 per cent interest, looks as if he will
have made a shrewd investment.
Gibs hold out the most appeal to people who are looking to fix their income,
such as those in retirement, and are good for basic-rate taxpayers. Although
they tend to be issued by the smaller life companies, they are regarded as
safe investments. As long as the life company is a member of Lautro, the
regulatory organisation for the life industry, up to 90 per cent of the
investment will be covered under the Policyholders Protection Act.
Their closest rivals, in terms of fixed-rate investment, are gilts; but
according to Robin Bloor, of Chase de Vere, the independent financial
advisers who specialise in Gibs, for basic rate taxpayers, 'the net return
on Gibs is always better than on gilts held to redemption'.
This is because most people who buy gilts lose out on the capital gains that
can be made by knowing when to buy and sell or when to hold them to
redemption instead. In addition, the insurance companies which issue Gibs
have tax advantages which they pass on to investors in the rate of interest
paid.
Gibs are unsuitable for non-taxpayers, because basic rate tax is deducted at
source and cannot be reclaimed. A non-taxpayer seeking a fixed income will
be better off buying Capital Bonds from National Savings which, though
subject to tax, pay interest gross. (Series D is paying 10.75 per cent per
annum on maturity if held for the full five year term.)
At any one time, the different life companies offer a variety of rates, so
it is important to shop around for the best. These are tracked regularly by
Baronworth, based at Ilford, Essex, and Chase De Vere, in London.
The table above shows the best rates recently on offer. These are below the
best bank and building society rates, with which Gibs are often compared,
but deposits with banks and building societies produce variable income.
However, Gibs have an advantage over banks and building societies, because
the interest on Gibs is not grossed up for tax purposes. Your tax assessment
is based on gross income, but since the GIB is calculated on the quoted
(net) rate, your income for tax purposes will be lower with a Gib investment
than that from a bank or building society. Robert Jackson, of Baronworth,
says this is one way in which higher-rate tax payers can show reduced
income.
Most higher-rate taxpayers looking for a fixed return will more naturally be
drawn to National Savings certificates, on which they pay no income and
capital gains tax; but they could turn to Gibs once they have the maximum NS
holdings.
Gibs have a further advantage as a tax-planning tool for the higher-rate
taxpayer, because the bond defers higher rate tax liability until the end of
the term. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer and know that you will fall into
the lower rate band, Gibs can, through judicious timing, enable you to avoid
paying the higher rate tax.
A higher-rate taxpayer due to retire in, say, three years time, can buy Gibs
due to mature in four and five years time when his income falls into the
lower rate tax band, thereby avoiding paying the higher rate tax.
Most Gibs are bought by older people looking for a known, secured return;
but Mr Bloor warns that care must be taken not to fall into the age
allowance trap.
The age allowance is given to people over the age of 65, and is not payable
to those whose income exceeds Pounds 15,710 in the current tax year. Your
tax liability with a Gib is delayed until the end of the term of the bond,
when you will be assessed on five years' worth of income.
If you are near the age allowance threshold in the year when the bond
matures, you could see your age allowance eroded as a result of the sudden
increase in income. Careful planning will be needed to avoid this happening.
A series of bonds, maturing in different years, can be taken out to avoid a
lot of income falling in one year.
Investors taking out Gibs must be sure that they will not need their capital
until the bond matures. Some insurance companies will not return the
investment, and the majority that do impose steep penalties.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Short of
revolution, the soundest IOU - But remember that there's an inverse
relationship, as prices rise, gilt yields fall, and vice versa / Fixed
interest 1: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
THE 1990s may be the decade of the gilt. After years of being neglected in
favour of the cult of the equity, some have argued that a low-growth,
low-inflation economic environment is the ideal background for gilt
investors.
Gilts are merely IOUs from the government, on which interest is paid twice a
year. Their price can fluctuate in the short term, but in the vast majority
of cases, the repayment value is fixed and, short of revolution, certain.
Interest on gilts is taxable but non-taxpayers can receive the income gross,
if they buy their gilts from the post office. Any capital gains made on
gilts are tax-free.
So what factors affect the price of a gilt? First, there is the interest
rate or coupon, which is the return the gilt will pay per Pounds 100 of
nominal value. But private investors should realise that this is not the
return they will normally receive. In the vast majority of cases, the gilt
will not be trading at its face value price; instead, it will be somewhere
above or below 100.
Imagine a market with just two gilt issues; one which paid 10 per cent and
one which paid 12 per cent. If both were on offer at the face value of 100,
then all investors would obviously opt for the one which paid 12 per cent.
Its price would rise, and that of the 10 per cent gilt would fall.
An investor who bought the 12 per cent gilt for Pounds 120 would still only
receive Pounds 12 in interest. His income return, therefore, would not be 12
per cent but 10 per cent (Pounds 12 divided by Pounds 120); this
relationship is known as the running yield and can be found in the FT prices
list each day under the 'int' heading.
Gilts with the highest coupons will tend to trade at above face value; gilts
with low coupons tend to trade below face value.
The second key factor in gilt prices is the maturity date. Eventually, the
gilt will be repaid at face value (this does not apply to undated stocks, or
to index-linked). As a consequence, anyone who buys a gilt trading above
face value faces the prospect, if he holds the gilt to maturity, of a
capital loss. And those who buy gilts below face value will make a capital
gain if they hold on till maturity. This factor will limit the extent to
which gilt prices can move away from 100.
The total return thus consists of both the income stream and the capital
gain (or loss) to maturity; the combination is known as the gross redemption
yield, and can be found in the FT prices list each day under the 'red'
heading. Gilts with similar maturity dates will trade on similar gross
redemption yields.
The golden rule is that yields and prices have an inverse relationship; as
prices rise, gilt yields fall and vice versa.
A host of factors will affect the general level of gilt yields (and thus
prices). If the government has a budget deficit, it will have to issue a lot
of gilts to fund it. This will increase the supply, and as with any other
commodity, an increased supply ought to have a dampening effect on the
price.
Expectations of inflation are also important. Since the repayment value of a
conventional gilt is constant, high inflation will eat substantially into
investors' real returns. Thus, if investors expect inflation to rise, gilt
prices will fall. This will, of course, mean a rise in yields, and analysts
often talk of a real yield, that is the nominal yield minus inflation.
Real yields have been very high in recent years, as investors have demanded
a high return after their bad experiences in the inflationary 1970s.
The level of short-term interest rates in the economy also affects gilt
prices. The two are not directly correlated. But if the government cuts base
rates, the gilt market might assume that inflation will increase. Gilt
yields will have to rise (and prices fall) to compensate.
But although there can be substantial gaps between gilt yields and base
rates (over five percentage points in 1990), there have been long periods
over the last 20 years in which the difference was no more than two
percentage points either way.
The bulls' argument for buying gilts is that, despite the growing government
deficit, yields will fall (and prices therefore rise) as inflation and
interest rates are cut. Those investors who need income will also be able to
'lock in' to current rates and thus avoid the danger of reduced returns from
variable rate deposits, such as building societies.
They're in five categories
The FT prices page classes gilts in five categories:
Shorts. These are issues with less than five years to maturity; as a
consequence, the prices stay fairly close to 100.
Mediums. These are issues with between five and 15 years to run.
Longs. These are bonds with at least 15 years to maturity. Their prices are
sensitive to long-term expectations of inflation and can move quite a
distance from their face value.
Undated. These issues will never be repaid, but will pay interest
indefinitely. They thus trade entirely on a running-yield basis and are
highly sensitive to interest rate expectations. The much higher interest
rates prevailing over the last 30 years have badly affected these issues,
with prices falling to around 20 per cent of nominal value in some cases.
Index-linked. The devastating impact that inflation had on gilts in the
1970s prompted the government to produce these inflation-linked issues,
ironically just as inflation started to fall.
The repayment value of an indexed issue is linked to the level of the retail
prices index; ie, if the original RPI was 100, and the RPI around maturity
date is 200, then the gilt will be repaid at double its issue price. In
addition, there is a small coupon - 2 or 2 1/2 per cent - which increases in
line with inflation each year.
What causes some confusion is that the RPI used in the calculation is the
index eight months before issue and maturity. As a consequence, the investor
has no protection against inflation in the last eight months of the gilt's
life; this complicates the yield calculations, because the real yields will
be different on different inflation assumptions. The FT prices page shows
real yields assuming either 5 or 10 per cent inflation.
A great advantage of the index-linked gilt to the private investor is that
the bulk of the return comes in the form of capital gain, which is tax-free;
the disadvantage is that there is little to attract income-seeking
investors.
Two ways to buy them
In buying gilts, there are essentially two routes: via a stockbroker or by
the post office.
Using a stockbroker will normally be more expensive, but you may be able to
benefit from the broker's advice in choosing issues.
The post office has a restricted range of issues, and may take longer to
deliver, but charges are low: Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250 invested,
with 50p for each further Pounds 125. A Pounds 5,000 investment would
therefore cost Pounds 20.
The golden rule when buying a gilt is to remember that those trading below
par value offer a lower running yield, but present the potential for capital
gain; those trading above par value pay a higher income, but offer the
prospect of capital loss.
Taking the unit trust route
Investors who do not want the aggravation of selecting their own gilts can
instead plump for one of the bond funds run by unit trust managers.
These invest in a range of fixed-interest issues, with the aim (normally) of
providing income, and are very popular in the US, where they make up around
a third of the collective fund market.
The real question is whether the manager's expertise in selecting issues is
worth the bid-offer spread (sector average around 4.7 per cent) and the
annual management fee (usually around 0.75 to 1 per cent).
Over five years to May 1, the average UK gilt and fixed interest fund made a
return of 30.2 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested) - that is
certainly better than the return offered by most UK equity-based unit
trusts.
But Fund Research, the leading unit trust analysis group, criticised the
sector in 1991, saying that too many trusts 'have used high yields to
attract investors. It would appear that many gilt trusts are, in effect,
quasi-annuities, generating a stream of income at the expense of the initial
deposit.'
Fund Research warned that some trusts would have to cut dividends to avoid
heavy capital depreciation - a warning that was borne out by some subsequent
trust announcements.

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Disappointment
follows the brief honeymoon - But UK savers can still earn 9 per cent on
fixed income investments, with inflation only 4 per cent / Keynote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT WAS a nice honeymoon, while it lasted. But somehow the same old economic
problems have remained to perplex the new John Major government on its
return to power. So the second quarter in the financial markets ended on a
disappointing note, especially given that it had begun so ecstatically after
the unexpected outright Conservative victory on April 9.
Certainly, the month after the election was highly bullish. The London stock
market leapt back to life, fuelled by hopes that the return of the Tories
would boost business and consumer confidence and jolt the British economy
back to life. From a low of 2382.7 on April 3 the FT-SE 100 Index advanced
to an all-time peak of 2737.8 on May 11, a gain of nearly 15 per cent.
The rise in share prices was boosted on May 5 by a post-election cut of  1/2
per cent to 10 per cent in sterling short-term interest rates, reflecting
the British currency's much stronger position within the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Meanwhile, the authorities got on energetically with the task of selling the
huge volume of gilt-edged securities needed to finance the projected
government deficit. A public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn is
officially forecast for 1992-93, and even more next year. As the recession
bites deeper, moreover, many outside forecasters are increasing their
estimates of just how big these deficits will turn out to be in the next few
years.
In post-election conditions, however, the Bank of England, as the Treasury's
agent in the gilt-edged market, was able to get busy with bond sales,
starting with a Pounds 1.6bn surge on election night itself. There have
subsequently been several individual auctions of up to Pounds 2.75bn of
gilts, and it is estimated that the Bank sold about Pounds 12.5bn gross of
bonds in the April-June quarter.
The government has also given the orders for National Savings to go out on
an aggressive sales drive in the retail market place. Thus National Savings
has been pulling in about Pounds 400m a month recently, enough to embarrass
the building societies which, in a very tough housing market, are finding it
difficult to compete for funds.
But as the stock market boom continued into May, cracks began to appear in
the enthusiasm of investors. It became clear that company results were
coming in below expectations. Economic statistics were disappointing, and
the fall in the first quarter's national income turned out to have been
worse than expected at 0.5 per cent for the quarter and 1.5 per cent over
twelve months. The 'green shoots' of recovery had failed to appear. By the
end of May, the full disaster of the Canary Wharf project became apparent as
the development followed its Canadian parent Olympia &amp; York into bankruptcy.
Overseas, the Tokyo market began to resume its devastating fall, reaching a
level some 60 per cent below its all-time high at the beginning of 1990. Not
that Tokyo's agony has had much impact on markets elsewhere, and indeed Wall
Street managed to struggle to a new all-time peak at the beginning of June.
But that was only on the basis of the 30 constituents of the Dow Jones
Average, and the more broadly-based equity market US indices have remained
below their January highs.
Closer to home, German overheating remained a big problem and hopes of
further interest rate cuts within the ERM have faded badly. Then, at the
beginning of June, came a bolt from the blue: the Danes narrowly rejected
the Maastricht treaty in a referendum.
Expectations of a steady advance by European Community member states towards
monetary union were suddenly dashed. Sterling was one of the currencies to
suffer as the Deutsche Mark once again strengthened. Finally, at the end of
June, the former prime minister Lady Thatcher delivered another blow to
confidence in the pound, by attacking Maastricht and saying there could be
no economic recovery for the UK while interest rates were held so high by
the requirements of the ERM.
All in all, June was a bad month for the markets. While the currency and
gilts came under pressure, the stock market too was troubled. Over-optimism
about prospects became exposed as leading companies like ICI and Pilkington
warned that no recovery was in sight. Big new issues planned in a more
buoyant period, or postponed until after the election, arrived just as
sentiment crumbled; the Pounds 430m GPA flotation had to be embarrassingly
abandoned at the very last moment on June 18. A boardroom upheaval on June
25 at troubled BP saw the share price tumble amidst fears of a slashed
dividend. Suddenly the market began to fear a whole wave of dividend cuts as
prudent distribution came back into fashion.
By the end of the month, the Footsie index had lost about 8 per cent
compared with the May high. However, there remained a small gain on the
quarter as a whole. The rate of return - capital gain plus dividend income -
on equities for a standard rate taxpayer for the three months was about 4
per cent.
You would have done better in fixed-income securities, however. The return
on 15-year gilts was about 9 per cent during the quarter. This continues a
pattern which has been seen during the 1990s so far, that equities have
proved to be disappointing and bonds have provided a better return. But even
bonds have failed to match the outstanding investment returns which were
seen during the 1980s.
Little is likely to change. The British economy faces a long process of
adjustment to lower inflation and lower levels of private debt. The world
economy offers little hope of external assistance, with Japan running into
trouble and the United States facing its own problems of too much debt and
too little growth.
The huge selling pressure from the Bank of England in the gilt-edged market
will continue to dominate the investment scene. British companies are going
to find it very hard to earn returns on capital which could enable them to
pay the progressive dividends needed if the stock market is to perform
strongly compared with gilts. Sterling may be marginally weak against the
DM, but it is very strong against the dollar, so British companies are
losing competitiveness in dollar markets.
For the time being, the newly-elected government is under no significant
pressure to do anything about the continuing recession. The second quarter
GDP figures may show a marginal pick-up when they are eventually calculated
in September, but independent economists now calculate that the British
economy will show just about zero growth in 1992 as a whole.
The near-term question is whether the government will announce major public
spending cutbacks in order to prevent the public sector borrowing
requirement from ballooning still further. Eventually there may be a more
serious debate about whether the government should cut and run from the ERM,
Thatcher-style. If this happens, it will have very important investment
implications. But at present it is still scarcely above the horizon.
For the moment, the stock market should be treated with caution, and
investors should think themselves lucky that they can still earn 9 per cent
on fixed income investments when inflation is only 4 per cent, and on a
slowly falling trend.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (3): New sources of
profit - Corporate portfolios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the UK's largest property portfolios are in the hands of commercial
and industrial companies.
For instance, according to a recent report from surveyor Debenham Tewson &amp;
Chinnocks, the UK corporate sector owns as much as Pounds 225bn worth of
property. This compares with the Pounds 60bn total for the traditional
property investors - the institutions.
But despite the fact that, in some business sectors, property accounts for
more than 50 per cent of all tangible assets in the balance sheets, in all
too many cases it is still seen as an incidental, generating costs but with
little value, rather than as an asset which requires active management.
Attitudes are, however, changing, partly because of sheer necessity to
control costs in a continuing recession, and partly because of the evolution
of management techniques. In addition, some larger organisations are
adopting pro-active management approaches aimed not only at controlling
costs, but also at releasing not inconsiderable value, to produce a
much-needed boost to the bottom line of the corporate balance sheet.
Of the big clearing banks, Barclays reckons it is ahead of the field in this
respect. In January 1991 it set up a new company, Barclays Property Holdings
(BPH) to run its Pounds 1bn plus property portfolio.
The rationale was that the bank's very valuable portfolio should not only
generate a return, but also that property should be a source of potential
profit instead of a cost centre, says Mr David Turner, BPH managing
director.
BPH controls some 3,000 individual properties: a branch network of some
2,400, together with a core investment portfolio containing some 400
properties.
The company acts as landlord to the branches and other bank operations.
There are no formal leases; instead, BPH tenants are governed by documents
governing terms and conditions of occupancy. But in practice, says Mr
Turner, the relationship is very similar to that of any other tenant with
its landlord. Rents, fixed at market levels, are reviewed every five years.
In addition to rent, BPH also generates income through fees - again charged
at market rates - for services such as alteration to and fitting or
re-fitting of branches.
BPH will also take a developer's profit when appropriate. For example, it
developed 150,000 sq ft of offices in three buildings at Westwood Business
Park just outside Coventry, when an operational decision was taken to
re-locate 1,000 Barclays jobs.
BPH's flagship development is the 300,000 sq ft redevelopment at 54 Lombard
Street in the City of London. Here, too, Mr Turner says that BPH is building
as a developer, not as an owner occupier. The building is on time and on
budget for completion to shell and core by late April next year. The
decision to go for this type of finish was taken, says Mr Turner, on
property investment rather than occupational criteria. The bank will occupy
three quarters of the building; the remainder will be let to outside
tenants.
Careful analysis of the portfolio has also led to strategic sales, amounting
to some Pounds 40m of this so far.
In days when covenant strength is a prerequisite for property investors, BPH
is in an enviable position to do sale and leaseback transactions where the
bank is the sitting tenant - although the individual property does not fit
the company's long term investment strategy.
BPH made Pounds 24m pre-tax profit last year from a combination of rental
income and consultancy income. Consultancy, Mr Turner reckons, should
contribute a growing proportion of profits as the company offers its range
of expertise and services to outsiders in competition with firms of
surveyors, architects and other professionals at, of course, market rates.
Total staff numbers are 188 - only 12 on the investment side, the rest in
development and consultancy. There are also some 500 staff engaged in day to
day facilities management for which Mr Turner is also responsible. (This
activity, however, is subject to an on-going review, with an increasing
number of services likely to be sourced externally at a lower cost.)
Not only the clearing banks, but also several of the high street multiple
retailers are sitting on large, valuable, property portfolios. Some of these
are now looking to maximise the value of their assets, and none more so than
Boots, which formed Boots Properties in 1989 in order to increase the return
on a portfolio which represents something in the order of 60 per cent of the
group's net assets.
The company, now a separate division within the group, organised so as to
reflect the strategic individual functions of operational estate management
and property asset management, holds the freeholds or long leaseholds of
some 900 properties; last revalued (in 1989) at Pounds 889m. This compares
with a total of 2,350 properties actually occupied by the group in the UK.
As with Barclays, Boots Properties' in-house occupiers are not subject to
formal leases. Nevertheless, the occupancy agreements arranged in-house
place landlords and tenants in a relationship broadly similar to that of
their open market counterparts.
The agreements provide for reviews of the modern rent charge of one fifth of
the portfolio every year. Reviews are to reflect market rents and may be
upwards or downwards. A nine month notice provision offers the retail
occupier flexibility should he or she wish to cease trading from the
property.
Under Mr Mike Rudell, Boots Properties managing director (and a Boots PLC
main board director), the company concentrates on three areas of operation:
investment, development and finance/systems.
Mr Peter Baguley, who leads the investment team, says that great emphasis is
placed on research, using discounted cash flow techniques and a rental
forecasting model developed jointly with Jones Lang Wootton, surveyors.
In addition to such detailed, location-specific research, Mr Baguley also
believes that Boots Properties has a distinct advantage over other property
investors when making decisions to buy or sell, because it also has access
to retailer performance data. As he points out, retailer profitability
drives rental growth - a key component of property investment performance.
Boots Properties sticks to what it knows best. Investments are restricted to
the retail sector which, Mr Baguley says, is generally underpinned. Over the
last three years the company has been a net investor, committing some Pounds
40m annually. Some of the money has gone towards consolidating existing
ownerships in towns such as Canterbury, Winchester and Lincoln.
But new investments have been made in multi-occupied properties such as the
Magnolia Centre in Exmouth and retail parks in Burnley and Bromborough in
the Wirral.
In its development activities Boots Properties, with financial backing from
the group, clearly has more than a competitive edge in the current market.
Here again local market research is an essential ingredient, according to Mr
Tony Edwards, development director.
Recent completions include a 120,000 sq ft fully-let retail park at Castle
Meadow, Nottingham. And in Glasgow the former Boots the Chemist store at the
corner of Argyll and Union Streets has been redeveloped to provide new
stores for Dillons, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a small Boots branch among
others.
Last year the company was selected as developer for Caerphilly town centre
where a total of 135,000 sq ft of floorspace is planned - to include a big
supermarket, some 30 smaller shops and parking for 600 cars.
Last month Boots Properties announced trading profits of Pounds 69.5m for
the year to March; a 15.5 per cent increase on the previous year. And it
looks well placed to be in an enviable position when the property market
finally improves.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (4): DoE calls for
firm bids as the PSA goes private - Christine Moir reviews big changes in
the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Government's privatisation of the Property Services Agency is
reaching full steam. It is part of its wider goal of reducing the civil
service to a few thousand mandarins and subcontracting most executive
functions to the private sector.
By the time this report reaches the news stands, the Department of
Environment and its adviser, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloittes, will
have shortlisted a handful of companies invited to place firm bids for PSA
Projects, the PSA's building design arm.
Interest in bidding for Projects (which had a turnover of Pounds 190m last
year) was strong. Over 150 organisations, including a number of foreign
companies, explored the possibility; 90 or so requested application forms
ahead of the June 26 deadline for submitting indicative bids. Andrew Jordan
of Coopers confidently expects to be able to exchange contracts with a buyer
by October this year.
In the short term, Project's turnover may be squeezed by the cutback in
government spending, and in particular by the diminished needs of the
Ministry of Defence, but this belies the group's excellent long-term
prospects.
At present, less than 1 per cent of Project's architectural design, and
Project management work, is for clients other than UK government
departments. But in preparation for the competitiveness of the private
sector, senior management is already capitalising on its niche specialities.
Already, for instance, its expertise in building courtrooms throughout
Britain has led to contracts to design one for the Dutch government, in
Utrecht; and another for the Seychelles.
Robin Gray, Project's director of marketing, reports that staff morale is
high because of recent successes in winning design contracts against private
sector competition for such prestigious schemes as the new VAT headquarters
in Liverpool's Queen's Dock, and the Princess of Wales's conservatory in Kew
Gardens.
Private sector competition is a daily fact of life for Building Management
(BM), the main property management arm of the PSA, also on its way to
privatisation next spring.
Since 1985, following an analysis by property consultants Jones Lang
Wootton, government departments have been free to select private contractors
to carry out the regular maintenance and management of their buildings. A
number have done so on a case by case, area by area, basis.
At the end of 1991 the process of commercialisation was taken a stage
further. Building Management was divided into five separate regions and
placed under the temporary management of Bovis, which has a brief to lick
each one into commercial shape before they are sold on, individually, to
five new owners.
The upheaval has been significant, but BM has developed a real taste for
competition. Nor East, which covers the whole eastern side of the country
from the Scottish Borders down to the M25, is raring to compete for the new
opportunities in its region as the government relocates up to 30,000 civil
servants to the provinces.
The Inland Revenue plans to move to Nottingham; the new Prison Services
headquarters for 2,000 will be in Derby; the Land Registry moves to Hull;
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is planning a Pounds 60m
15-building complex outside York.
Nor East's ambitions do not stop at winning these contracts against private
sector competition. Mr Gil Sowden, Its marketing director, also declares
that it will be 'open season' against its old stablemate, PSA Projects, on
the design front.
Mr Sowden and his counterparts in the other BMs - such as Mr Mike Harrison,
managing director for Manchester, which covers the whole North West, and Mr
Jim Livingstone in Scotland - have their eyes on another goal also. They
believe they are now well-placed to win back the contracts lost to private
sector surveying firms during the experiments of the late 1980s.
Not only are they leaner and fitter - Nor East's staff is now down to 1,500
from 2,000 - but clients have wakened up to their greater expertise in
managing public buildings. 'We think our competitors did not fully
understand the demands that would be made of them by government
departments,' says Mr Sowden.
They do now. Hillier Parker, the underbidder for three early areas which
went to private firms, believes the successful firms may now regret the keen
pricing of their original bids.
Not all the advantages lie with a private sector future, however. Some of
the BM operations have already found that they will lose a certain
privileged status from next year. The Ministry of Defence, for instance, may
be prepared for its property management to go private - but not the US
defence bases in the UK. They have insisted on civil servants to manage
their buildings. In fact, 600 of the 1,000 jobs saved in BM Noreast have
merely been transferred to the MoD's Defence Works Service in Sutton
Coldfield, mainly to service US forces in Britain.
The inexorable shrinking of Britain's overseas interests has meant even
further upheavals in the 200-year-old service supplied by the PSA. Its
international arm - once the overseer of colonial mansions from the Cape to
Rajahstan by way of the Antipodes - is to close. This may be partly
balanced, however, by the fact that Projects has opened its own
international operation - mainly for Hong Kong, where it has two dockyard
contracts and hopes to be involved in the new airport.
The only part of the PSA to remain intact as a section of the Department of
the Environment is the newly renamed Property Holdings (PH): in effect, the
landlord for all government departments. Given the new freedom of each
department to choose its own architects, designers, surveyors and managers,
however, PH's role may be little more than passive.
In the next round of government restructuring, many of its staff fear not
the bracing winds of competition but the fatal chill of redundancy.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (1): Landlords must
manage to survive - Real estate seldom attracts company attention as
powerfully as human resources or capital investment. But recession has
provided an incentive for landlords, owner-occupiers, and tenants to manage
property more efficiently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER

<TEXT>
PROPERTY management, traditionally one of the least glamorous corners of the
property business, is gradually coming into its own.
It owes its increased status to reasons ranging from greater promotion by
the surveying industry, technological change, environmental standards, and
the increased complexity of building maintenance.
Its new-found prominence has been achieved against a backdrop of recession,
which provides an important incentive for landlords, tenants and
owner-occupiers to improve the efficiency of their property management.
Landlords know they need to improve their management, to protect their
rental income and retain tenants. 'Landlords are more than ever before using
every legal means open to them to ensure that rents are paid on time,' says
Clive Lewis, the chartered surveyors.
Looking further ahead, landlords are concerned that oversupply in some
markets will give tenants the upper hand. That could well lead to shorter
leases with break options, as in the US; with the result that landlords will
have to work much harder to retain their tenants.
'Poorly managed, expensive buildings will be blighted, and property managers
will have to become much more pro-active, mirroring their American
counterparts,' says Mr Tony Rinnick of Chesterton.
With falling rents, service charges are becoming a higher percentage of
total property overheads. Landlords are coming under pressure to contain
service charges, which are as high as Pounds 6-Pounds 7 per sq ft in smaller
shopping centres.
There is even greater scope for tighter property management among
owner-occupiers, who have an incentive to cut costs and extract value from
their property holdings at a time of slow growth.
At present, most UK companies give far less attention to property management
than the value of their assets might suggest. Property assets, according to
Central Statistical Office figures for 1989, account for about half of all
fixed assets held by industrial and commercial companies.
'Real estate is a factor of production, like labour and capital, and yet is
rarely accorded the same power and influence as human resources or capital
investment . . . The head of property can often be six layers or more down
from the chief executive,' said Stanhope, commenting on a report on
corporate decisions commissioned from Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
'Only on rare occasions does property receive explicit treatment in
corporate business plans. More often than not, property is viewed as
incidental, as an asset which requires little management, generates cost but
has little or no value,' says Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, in a study of 100
of the UK largest companies published last month.
It found that only 60 per cent of the largest UK companies have an estates
management department. Property is nearly as likely to be handled by a
personnel director as it is by a property director.
This inattention is potentially damaging, in the view of Ms Virginia Gibson,
of the department of land management and development at the University of
Reading. 'Managers would not consider planning without understanding the
implications for personnel and finance, yet property is often ignored or
brought into the planning process at a very late stage. This leads to misuse
of the resource and, occasionally, costly mistakes.'
Companies' inefficient use of space is reflected in the 5 per cent of
commercial floorspace they rent but do not use - which is equivalent to the
entire office stock in a city such as Bristol. Only a third of the largest
UK companies charge internal rents, and only 20 per cent have a corporate
policy on space standards, says Debenham Tewson.
Only one in five of the largest non-property companies have a comprehensive
management information system, containing information on the cost and value
associated with each building.
Even among those companies with a comprehensive information system, only 40
per cent monitor potential alternative uses or planning considerations
affecting each property.
The problems encountered in dealing with property in the private sector are
mirrored and often magnified in the public sector.
The pressure to improve property management in the public sector has been
accentuated by civil service relocations, contracting-out of services, and
the relaxation of ties between government departments and the Property
Services Agency, which has been split up and, partially, put up for sale.
The possibilities of exploiting opportunities for capital gains have been
eagerly explored by the public sector. British Rail has sold many valuable
sites, often by railway stations for redevelopment; the National Health
Service has successfully disposed of several of its large Victorian
institutions.
But recession has checked much of this activity. The difficulty of disposing
of land is making it difficult for the NHS to address inefficiency in the
use of hospital estates, highlighted by the introduction of some of the
government's reforms.
In both the private and public sectors, organisations are increasingly
contracting-out their property management. Facilities management - otherwise
known as contracted business services, or outsourcing, - is a fast growing
sector of the economy as companies try to improve efficiency and cut costs
without compromising on quality.
The chief benefit of contracting-out property management is that it relieves
companies of the burden of recruiting staff in a discipline in which it has
no expertise, allowing it to concentrate on its core business.
It can save money, because extra services need only be used when necessary,
relieving companies of the need to employ additional staff and equipment to
deal with peaks in demand. For the facility management company there may
also be economies of scale.
For example, Westminster council claims that contracting out its commercial
property portfolio to private firms - to handle items such as sales, lease
renewals, rent reviews and strategic advice - will result in savings of
nearly 33 per cent, or Pounds 700,000, over five years.
Property managers can do more than cut costs. In many instances, aggressive
property management can extract hidden values from a portfolio through
identifying and disposing of surplus property; exploiting 'marriage values'
by combining the leasehold and freehold values of a site, and arranging
sale-and-leaseback deals.
None of these measures are straightforward at a time when the property
market is mired in recession. Even the most straightforward measures, such
as sub-letting surplus space, are difficult to achieve in areas where there
is a glut of space on the market and limited demand.
None the less, if property managers can deliver on even a fraction of their
potential, they could change the perception of their industry for good.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (2): Keep the customer
happy - A look at facilities and services on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not too long ago, in the days before the term personnel manager became
director of human resources, it used to be the responsibility of the office
manager to ensure that a firm's premises were clean and functional; that the
lifts worked and the lavatories were supplied; and that any legal matters
relating to terms of occupation were drawn to the attention of the board.
Not any more.
The growth of information technology, together with the recession, has led
to companies becoming conscious of the need to monitor costs, as well as
making the best use of expensive floorspace.
Furthermore, in a highly competitive market landlords are also highly aware
of the need to keep existing tenants happy, and to attract new ones with
well-managed, attractive and value-for-money working environments.
The result is that property management and facilities management are now
among the few growth areas in a beleaguered property market.
Claims for the benefits of the services offered by the various consultants
and contractors in the property management field are becoming increasingly
extravagant. A whole new vocabulary of buzz words has developed. The hapless
and, understandably, often bewildered successor to the old-fashioned office
manager is now bombarded with offers of health checks, smart or intelligent
buildings, environmental energy audits, thermographic surveys - and so on.
Leaving aside this barrage of hype, there is a growing sophistication in the
modern methods of managing property, from both the strategic and the
occupational points of view. Moreover, there is no shortage of expertise
available to a building owner or occupier, in asset management and in cost
effective, comfortable and efficient occupation.
Traditional property management techniques have been updated constantly in
recent years with the aid of computers. And most firms offering property
management as a service now have impressive databases. Martin Clews of
Weatherall Green &amp; Smith explains that the firm's computer database includes
comprehensive details of all individual properties.
Besides basic physical information - which will include site plans and floor
plans drawn by computer aided design, and will soon include actual
photographs - all leases, covenants and other obligations under leases are
recorded, along with schedules of critical dates for such items as lease
renewals, service of relevant legal notices and other statutory matters.
Other entries will monitor planning consents and their implications; set
rolling refurbishment and/or maintenance programmes and log environmental
issues, insurance records and valuations for various purposes; for example,
a company's balance sheet, rating and insurance. There may also be schedules
for internal repairs and inspection and maintenance of plant and machinery
such as lifts, water towers, and so on.
All are part of the overall strategic management of an individual building
or a portfolio. They come up for consideration when wider issues arise -
such as whether a property should be sold, sub-let, refurbished or
redeveloped for a different use. Further strategic questions could relate to
the acquisition of adjacent land, the obtaining of more valuable consents,
or entering into joint ventures.
The manager will also be responsible for the financial tasks of collecting
rents and other dues, the apportionment of service charges, full accounting
for income and outgoings.
Alongside this strategic management, and in many cases overlapping it, is
day-to-day functioning of buildings. This is where the new discipline of
facilities management comes in.
The facilities manager is responsible for a range of services: cleaning,
maintenance, security, heating and air-conditioning, telecommunications,
computer networking, electrical and other energy supplies and, sometimes,
landscaping and space planning. These may be handled in-house by an on-site
manager.
But there is a growing trend to sub-contract some or the entire package to
outside firms. Besides companies such as BET and P&amp;O, competitors in this
relatively new field of specialisation, most of which claim to offer a
one-stop shop service, include some with connections with the larger
computer companies.
One of them, Procord, is the result of a management buy-out of a significant
part of IBM's UK property management function. The staff, led by managing
director John Jack, IBM's former UK property manager, has a 51 per cent
stake in the company; IBM retains 49 per cent.
Mr Jack says that, coming as it does from a computer-culture environment,
the firm understands the comprehensive changes in the way companies organise
their work; and the consequent use of space. He points out that, in today's
organisational 'churn,' it is invariably cheaper and more effective to
relocate people in computer-networked offices than to move work stations.
One possible solution for building owners confused by the claims and
counter-claims of property management surveyors and the new facilities
management specialists is to use both in a partnership which brings together
the two sides of the strategic and day-to-day management equation. For
example, IBM appointed Weatherall Green &amp; Smith and Procord to work together
in the letting, asset management and on-site management of 103 Wigmore
Street, a 106,000 sq ft office building in London's West End which became
surplus to IBM's requirements. Both say this has worked well.
Another consequence of the competitive, oversupplied office market in the
City is that property management surveyors and facilities managers are
finding new aspects of their roles; they now also have a part to play in the
on-going marketing effort.
David Smith of surveyor Richard Ellis cites Royal London's 220,000 sq ft
Triton Court in the City, where several measures have been taken to attract
new tenants and to retain existing tenants.
In this market, says Mr Smith, the landlord/tenant relationship needs to be
seen as that of supplier and customer. The building management team must
monitor customer feedback - and be the first to know if there are any
rumbles of complaint.
Tenants at Triton Court can now take advantage of - among other things  -
their own gym, a restaurant, a shoe-shine service. They even have a
'tenant's charter.' The aim is to keep customers satisfied.

FT  17 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: German move hits builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUILDING sectors of the stock market suffered another severe shakeout on
news of the rise in Germany's discount rate, and its implications for the
rest of Europe.
The Bundesbank's move was seen as increasing the agony for a sector already
suffering from the effect of prolonged high interest rates, falling house
prices and general economic recession.
Redland and RMC, the two building materials groups viewed by the market as
having the widest exposure to the German market, and especially to the
hoped-for rebuilding programme in east Germany, were given the roughest
ride, with Redland sliding 19 to 445p and RMC 8 to 518p.
Pilkington weak
Glass manufacturer Pilkington was another to suffer in the materials sector,
after the latest in a series of profits downgrades hit the shares. Analysts
have moved estimates for the current-year profits to Pounds 70m from Pounds
100m after talks with the company.
Yesterday, another UK broking house was said to have chopped its estimate
for this year to Pounds 50m and forecast a halved dividend. The shares,
which topped 330p in the summer of 1987, dropped like a stone to close 11
lower at 96p on heavy turnover of 6.2m.
GUS strong
Solid full-year results from Great Universal Stores sent the shares ahead in
busy turnover of 1.2m. The performance of the retail arm was particularly
impressive, with the Burberry division recovering well. Mr Ian McDougall at
Nomura said: 'This is GUS reminding the market of what it can do.' The 'A'
shares, ahead 74 at one stage, closed at 1448p, a rise of 43p on the day.
Analysts lifted profits forecasts for 1993 to a range of Pounds 454m to
Pounds 470m. County NatWest's Mr John Richards, at the bottom of the range,
cautioned that GUS had run into flat trading conditions, as had all the high
street retailers, and remained on a 'hold' stance for the stock.
Vague hints that one small building or property group was about to go out of
business caused another bout of selling. Many housebuilders were under
considerable pressure, with Anglia Secure Homes, the sheltered homes group
whose shares almost halved on Wednesday, plunging 3 more to 3 1/2 p.
McCarthy &amp; Stone, another sheltered homes company, dipped 3 to 36p.
Wilson Bowden lost 16 to 340p, Persimmon 12 to 226p and Barratt Homes 4 to
56p. Taylor Woodrow, still suffering from recent downgrades, dipped 4 to
66p.
Support from a buy note was not strong enough to lift BAT Industries
significantly. The tobacco and financial services conglomerate was up 13 in
the morning after consideration of a recommendation by Kleinwort Benson. The
house cut its estimate for full-year profits because of the slide in the
dollar but believes the stock offers dividend growth, security and improved
earnings. The rate news from Germany prompted the shares to slip back and
close only 4 up at 774p.
An announcement by medical charity Wellcome Trust that part of its
forthcoming 330m-share issue in Wellcome would be in the form of a share
swap gave an initial boost to the Wellcome share price.
The issue is expected to raise around Pounds 2.8bn, which Wellcome Trust has
said will be ploughed back into the market in order to diversify equity. BZW
Investment Management is to manage a fund worth in excess of Pounds 500m
which will in effect be created by institutions offloading blue chip stocks
in exchange for Wellcome shares. The stock was up 5 before the announcement
of the rise in German discount rate. Then, it fell to close a net penny off
at 877p.
Good support from one influential UK broking house drove Guardian Royal up 7
to 144p on heavy turnover of 5m. Legal &amp; General advanced 11 to 365p after
announcing a change in accounting policy.
Lasmo remained under the lash in an othwerwise calm oil sector, as worries
about the recent falls in oil prices and the dollar compounded fears about
the dividend. Specialists said they expected the group to pay the interim
but the final was under scrutiny. Lasmo's interim results are expected on
July 29. The shares dropped 12 to 144p and some dealers fear they may test
the 100p mark last seen in 1986.
Positive recommendations from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and County NatWest helped
British Land gain 5 to 193p on 1.5m shares traded.
A stock overhang and currency considerations depressed Grand Metropolitan,
the shares falling 11 to 457p.
ICI, which reacts to strength in the D-Mark, gained 16 to 1168p. The shares
also continued to benefit from a positive approach from one agency broker.
British Vita, also exposed to Germany, firmed 4 to 254p.
Yorkshire Chemicals rallied 15 to 319p ahead of first-half results due in
early August.
Troubled Worth Investment Trust saw heavy volume overnight as one
marketmaker took on 2.8m shares, a 9 per cent stake, at 14 1/4 p and placed
the majority at 14 1/2 p in two blocks. The share price remained unchanged
at 15p.
Disappointing figures from package holiday group Owners Abroad were
compounded by admissions of discounting by the company management,
indicating that the much-touted industry price war might be taking its toll.
The shares retreated heavily but recovered to close only 2 off at 64p. Rival
operator Airtours tumbled 10 to 205p.
Heavy trade in Forte saw nearly 6m dealt and the stock eased a penny to
162p. Rank Organisation, having fallen more than 20 per cent in the past six
weeks after a series of downgrades, rallied 13 to 607p.
Textiles and specialist castings manufacturer Hicking Pentecost jumped 11 to
130p after a bullish agm.
Associated British Ports tumbled 26 to 320p after the company warned that it
expects to make provisions of about Pounds 10m against the value of its
property development portfolio.
The slide in Alexander Proudfoot continued. At the day's worst, the stock
was down 27 following an agency cross of 600,000 shares at 150p. Buying from
two company directors helped to stabilise the shares, which were eventually
a net 22 off at 172p.
A profits upgrade boosted Siebe, which finished 14 to the good at 680p.

FT  17 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF the increase in German discount rate led to a sharp retreat in stock
index futures after a strong performance early in the session, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Speculation that there would be no rise in German interest rates, coupled
with favourable corporate news, brought a firm opening in the September
contract at 2,504.
It continued to move forward for the rest of the morning session, unaffected
by the release of economic data at 11.30am, and pulled the underlying cash
market higher. By 1pm the contract was trading at 2,537.
The lunchtime news from the Bundesbank disappointed the market, leading to a
sharp fall in the contract to 2,489 by 2.30pm. Bargain hunters towards the
end of the session, however, helped September rally from the day's low and
it closed at 2,506, up 2 from its previous close and around 5 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover, at 10,066
contracts, was an improvement on recent levels.
In traded options, volume soared to 41,528 contracts, with the FT-SE option
recording a total of 16,628 trades ahead of today's expiry. Asda was the
busiest stock option with 5,027 lots transacted.

FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei mirrors decline
in futures market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS circulated, share prices fluctuated and the Nikkei average finally
closed lower after small-lot activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished below 17,000 for the first time since last Friday, down
129.26 at 16,987.66. After opening at the day's high of 17,097.65, the index
slowly sagged, mirroring a decline in the futures market. It hit a low of
16,917.70 later in the morning.
Volume dropped to 160m shares from 255m and falls led rises by 629 to 255,
with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost
8.30 to 1,290.54, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 4.51 to
1,012.69.
Rumours that the new securities watchdog, Japan's version of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, was scheduled to investigate the
manipulation of futures markets by investment trusts unnerved market
participants. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said: 'Market sentiment remains
very fragile, and anything could undermine share prices.'
Construction and housing-related issues were weak on reports that a small
unlisted property developer, based in Tokyo, had gone bankrupt.
Daito Trust Construction fell Y340 to a year's low of Y3,820. Traders said
investors had started to take profits on the stock, which had been firm
previously on prospects of favourable earnings. Misawa Homes declined Y15 to
Y920 and Daikyo closed Y5 down at Y686.
Dealers continued their efforts to generate activity by trading new
Aids-related issues. Sumitomo Chemical gained Y1 to Y451 in active trading,
along with Nippon Zeon, which advanced Y6 to Y660, and Calpis Food Industry,
up Y40 at Y1,370. However, Meiji Milk Products receded Y16 to Y979 and
Mochida Pharmaceutical relinquished Y30 to Y3,700.
High-technology shares lost ground on profit-taking. Toshiba, the most
active issue of the day, dipped Y4 to Y660 after gains earlier in the week
on small-lot foreign buying. Hitachi retreated Y8 to Y796 and NEC finished
Y18 down at Y851.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 160.44 off at 19,450.91 in volume of 11.2m
shares. Textile company Daiichibo weakened Y22 to Y115 on reports that a
subsidiary had failed to honour a bill. Daiichibo said it would cover the
losses by selling property in central Osaka.
Roundup
AMONG Pacific Basin markets, Seoul recorded a 4 1/2 -year low while Hong
Kong's strength continued.
SEOUL closed above intraday lows on late-buying by institutional investors
and the composite index was finally 2.58 off at 511.61. Turnover was thin at
Won108.85bn. Declines exceeded rises by 507 to 201.
Daewoo Group subsidiaries were active, with Daewoo Co rising Won200 to
Won10,400 and Daewoo Heavy Machinery gaining Won200 to Won10,700.
HONG KONG ended at a record high but early gains were trimmed as investors
took profits late in the session. The Hang Seng index added a net 37.07 at
6,162.53 in turnover of HKDollars 4.20bn.
Banks were the best performers, Hang Seng Bank rising HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 53 and HSBC 50 cents to HKDollars 53.
NEW ZEALAND set a 1992 high in heavy turnover with Telecom leading the way.
The NZSE-40 index was ahead 6.69 at 1,589.23 after advancing from a day's
low of 1,576.83. Turnover came to NZDollars 30.6m.
Telecom, which gained 4 cents to NZDollars 2.26, has so far risen 7 per cent
this week.
MANILA reversed three days of declines, helped by a rise in PLDT shares in
the US. The composite index rallied 23.09, or 1.6 per cent, to 1,451.50 in
turnover of 114m pesos. PLDT climbed 15 pesos to 1,020 pesos.
BANGKOK saw active buying of finance and property shares as the SET index
rose 8.51, or 1.15 per cent, to 750.38 in high turnover of Bt9.82bn.
Bangkok Land advanced Bt7 to Bt147 after the company said it was interested
in applying to build a mass transit system in Bangkok.
SINGAPORE was widely lower on selling by institutional funds. The Straits
Times Industrial index fell 18.54, or 1.25 per cent, to 1,462.61 in volume
of 34.1m shares, against a previous 67.8m.
OCBC Foreign lost 40 cents to SDollars 13.30, DBS Foreign 20 cents to
SDollars 13.30, Sembawang Shipyard 25 cents to SDollars 7.25 and Keppel 15
cents to SDollars 7.
TAIWAN wavered narrowly to finish mixed as many investors stayed on the
sidelines. The weighted index eased 2.83 to 4,349.68. Turnover rose to
TDollars 22.4bn from TDollars 19.35bn.

FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv congratulates Labour on its
victory - Hugh Carnegy describes the boost for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The morning after Israel's general election on June 23, the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange (TASE) reacted as if bucket loads of mannah had just fallen from
heaven.
Prices shot ahead by more than 7 per cent in the first session in record
volume. Three weeks later the market remains starry-eyed about the prospects
for the economy under the new government. At yesterday's close the blue chip
index had risen a further 2.84, or 1.8 per cent, on the day to 160.60,
compared with 137.22 on the eve of the election.
The fact that the election was won by Labour, historically the party of
state socialism in Israel, caused investors no pause. They are convinced
that modern-day Labour will accelerate the process of deregulation
(foreigners are now free to invest on the TASE) that moved slowly under the
previous Likud government.
Mr Saul Bronfeld, the TASE chief executive, says: 'Today Labour is supported
more by the middle classes and the business sector, while the Likud tends to
represent the less privileged parts of society, so the old labels are really
very misleading.'
The markets also believe Labour will restore battered relations with the US,
allowing the release of Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees, which are seen
as vital to generating long-term growth in the immigration-burdened economy.
If welcoming a Labour government seems paradoxical, there is another
apparent contradiction in the performance of the TASE. Even before the
election, the market had been on a marked upward swing for three full years
 -interrupted only during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91 - in spite of the clear
strains that mass immigration from the former Soviet Union was placing on
the economy. Per capita growth has been negligible, unemployment is at
record levels and the all-important export sector has been performing
sluggishly.
Again, Mr Bronfeld says there is no contradiction in this. TASE-listed
companies have benefited from the growth in domestic demand, from falling
labour costs associated with rising unemployment and by a government-backed
trend of declining real interest rates. According to TASE figures, average
return on capital among listed industrial companies rose from 1.3 per cent
in 1988, to 9.4 per cent last year. In the first quarter of 1992 the figure
was up to 14.4 per cent.
There is another factor at work, however, which distorts TASE performance
and may be engendering unrealistic overvaluation of some companies. The
share market is relatively small, with a market capitalisation of Shk55bn
(Dollars 22.9bn). The government bond market is worth Shk66bn and private
bonds Shk10bn.
On the equity market, what is traded is only a small part of the total as
ownership of the majority of shares is closely held. Mr Mark Meiras, an
indepen-dent analyst, says that even the record turnover in June represented
only about 3 per cent of all shares changing hands annually, compared with
four or five times in other world markets.
Meanwhile, says Mr Meiras: 'There is a hell of a lot of money flying about.'
Israel's providential funds, now less bound by regulations to invest in
government securities, have assets of Shk60bn, of which only Shk3bn are in
equities.
Last year was a record for new share issues on the TASE, totalling Shk1.9bn.
Already this year, new issues have passed Shk2bn, as the government has at
last begun to float shares in state companies such as Bezeq, the telecoms
monopoly, and Israeli Chemicals. 'But supply still nowhere near satisfies
demand,' says Mr Meiras.
The market's hope - and expectation - is that the new government will
accelerate privatisation issues to soak up some of this demand. State
holdings in the utilities, companies such as the El Al airline, and the oil
refineries and the country's four big banks, could be worth several billion
shekels.
The more worrying trend as far as the TASE is concerned is a growing
tendency for Israel's star high-tech companies, such as Scitex, the computer
printing specialist, and ECI Telecom, to prefer North American exchanges
where their main markets lie. Israeli companies raised more than Dollars
500m in New York issues last year.
Mr Bronfeld admits this is worrying for the TASE. He is therefore trying
hard to persuade companies such as Tadiran, an electronics maker, and Zim,
the government-controlled merchant shipping concern, to balance their plans
for a New York listing with a dual listing in Tel Aviv.

FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent weakens on discount
rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK's 0.75 point rise in the discount rate was a quarter- point
more than expected, hardening one of the softer options available to the
German central bank which yesterday repeated its concern about German
monetary growth, and the accompanying inflation threat.
The move came in the early afternoon, and most bourses responded by marking
share prices down, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed higher ahead of the Buba decision, the DAX index rising
5.91 to 1,740.53, but an hour later most blue chips were showing losses of
0.5 to 1 per cent since the end of the session.
Earlier, short-covering and a rally in car stocks underpinned the market, as
volume rose from DM3.9bn to DM4.1bn. Among car stocks, recovering from fears
of higher German petrol taxes, BMW jumped DM9.50 to DM579, and Volkswagen by
DM5 to DM380.70. After-hours losses were DM4, and DM3.20 respectively.
Other notable movers were the steel group, Thyssen, up DM3.90 at DM233.50,
and the retailer, Ava, down a net DM28 at DM625. Thyssen rose on Germany's
planned DM170bn transport revolution, and hopes that construction of the
Transrapid magnetic train system would finally start soon.
Ava fell as it went ex-dividend. There was talk that Ava's relationship with
its biggest shareholder, Asko, and cautious prospects at its biggest
competitor in food hypermarkets, Allkauf, were also behind the drop.
PARIS reflected volatility in the bond market which promptly fell after the
Bundesbank raised its discount rate but then immediately bounced back to
earlier levels. The CAC 40 index went as low as 1,844.95 and as high as
1,869.23 before closing 2.03 lower at 1,851.23 in moderate turnover of
FFr1.87bn.
Total was the day's most active stock, adding FFr6 or 2.5 per cent to
FFr245.
Michelin was also firmer, adding FFr6.20 or 3 per cent to FFr213.70. Dealers
said the stock rose following the pleasing second quarter results from
BFGoodrich, one of Michelin's competitors in the US. BFGoodrich said it
expected growing demand for its products, which include aircraft tyres.
MILAN started the new account on a weak note as many stocks, including Fiat
and Generali, went ex dividend. But a firm official closing by Generali
lifted the market later. By midday, however, volume dried up as dealers
closed their positions ahead of the Bundesbank's news conference. The market
was closed by the time the Bank of Italy announced that it was raising
interest rates, but Italian shares traded in London fell. The Comit index
rose 1.23 to 446.65 in turnover estimated at less than Wednesday's L127bn.
Fiat dropped a net L11 to L4,970 while Generali rose a net L548.36 to
L28,250 and hit L28,500 after hours. But both stocks came off in the
afternoon in London, with the car company being quoted at L4,930/4960 and
the insurer at L27,900/28,100.
AMSTERDAM weakened after the German announcement. The CBS Tendency index
closed down 0.5 at 121.3, having earlier seen 122.6.
In the market, activity was generally negative with the exception of ABN
Amro up 60 cents at Fl 45.60, CSM up Fl 1.80 at Fl 93.30 on Wednesday's news
that it is to acquire a US bakery group and Heineken reaching an all-time
high of Fl 173.70, up Fl 1.20.
Elsewhere Elsevier remained under selling pressure, losing Fl 1.90 to Fl
105.80 while Borsumij put on Fl 1 to Fl 58 after announcing the purchase of
a unit of Van Ommeren, 30 cents weaker at Fl 37.40.
ZURICH turned negative after the Bundesbank move, and then recovered half of
its losses, having moved in a relatively wide trading range. The SMI index
of leading shares closed 5.7 lower at 1,838.7, 16 points below its high for
the day but 16 points, too, above its low.
There was weakness in banks, with CS Holdings, SBC and UBS all down by a
little under a percentage point. Banks had been looking for further declines
in short-term interest rates and, at least on the day, this had come into
question.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank, however, said that markets had
not yet come to terms with the threat of further weakness in the dollar,
could pose a problem to Nestle, and other big dollar earners like the Swiss
pharmaceutical groups.
MADRID had a hectic day with the general index closing 2.19 lower at 228.88
in moderate volume of Pta11.5bn. Construction stocks went against the trend
in a technical rebound after several days of steep declines.
Telefonica weakened Pta10 to Pta1,070 with a heavy 1.6m shares traded.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop recovery spreads gloom
among Greece's olive groves - A glut that is hitting prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY GREEK olive oil producers, facing slack demand this year, have resorted
to doing their own marketing. Farmers have gone direct to the consumer,
selling oil door-to-door in 20-kilogram tins, at prices that barely meet
production costs.
Output in the 1991-92 season returned to average levels after a shortfall in
1990-91, the result of a prolonged drought. According to the Agriculture
Ministry, total production reached about 320,000 tonnes, compared with only
197,000 tonnes the previous season.
The increased production meant that farmers in Crete and the Peloponnese,
which normally account for almost two-thirds of Greek output, were left with
about 160,000 tonnes of oil that seemed unlikely to find buyers.
Producer prices collapsed earlier this year, falling from Dr1,200 (Pounds
3.40) to Dr600 a kilogram for extra virgin oil. 'This is around cost price
for a farmer who does most of the work with his family. Producers who hired
pickers last winter have come out with losses,' says a government
agricultural officer in Sparta in the southern Peloponnese.
There are an estimated 400,000 olive farmers in Greece, most of whom
cultivate small orchards, with assistance from their families at harvest
time. A labour shortage in the countryside means that larger producers must
pay high daily rates to itinerant pickers.
Early forecasts suggest that this winter's olive crop will match last
year's, and growers fear that they will again have trouble finding
sufficient customers.
However, this month the European Community came up with an intervention
price of Dr587 a kilogram for top-quality oil, enabling producers to recoup
outlays by selling their produce to the co-operatives before the next
harvest.
At the same time, exports have picked up slowly as Italian buyers, taking
advantage of the price slump, resume large bulk purchases. Greek oil exports
are volatile, but have averaged about 70,000 tonnes annually in recent
years.
Greek producers complain that most of the high quality oil is mixed in Italy
with small amounts of local oil and exported to northern Europe and the US
as Italian.
'The best Greek oil compares for quality with oil from Tuscany. But not
enough effort is made to market it,' says Mr Julian Cassaveti of Harvest
Commodities, an Athens-based analyst.
A new law that comes into effect with this year's harvest, requires all
Greek oil to be sold with a label showing its region of origin. This, it is
hoped, will have the dual effect of discouraging local merchants from mixing
Greek oil with cheaper Spanish imports and encourage a new approach to
marketing.
The farmers carrying cans of oil to city apartment blocks may have taken the
first step. But, says Mr Giorgios Economou of Sevitel, an oil exporters'
association: 'We have to make the switch to bottled oil with labels of
origin and do more work on finding distributors abroad.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Growers approve cut in
Colombian coffee price
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTRAORDINARY National Coffee-Growers' Congress yesterday approved a 10.5
per cent cut in Colombia's coffee producer price, coffee officials said,
reports Reuter from Bogota.
Mr Jorge Cardenas, general manager of the National Coffee-Growers'
Federation, said the congress approved a reduction in the internal price to
85,000 pesos (Pounds 70) per load of 125 kg from P95,000.
It is the second reduction this year in the price paid to Colombian
producers for their coffee, following a 5 per cent cut in February.
The reduction was part of a package of measures approved by the congress to
counter a financial crisis in the National Coffee Fund, which finances the
purchase of coffee in Colombia. Mr Rudolf Hommes, the finance minister, said
earlier that the fund could become insolvent next year unless urgent
measures were taken.
Mr Cardenas said the reduction in the producer price would save Dollars 150m
of the fund's present Dollars 500m imbalance.
The congress adopted a package of measures proposed by the National
Coffee-Growers Committee with a few amendments, coffee industry officials
said.
The plan finally adopted calls for 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) to be
taken out of coffee production in the next year and aims to ultimately
eradicate up to 100,000 ha. Producers who participate will receive
compensation of 1m pesos per hectare, according to the final document. Where
possible, farmers will substitute other crops.
Producers who wish to uproot their plantations for sanitary reasons will
receive P350,000 a hectare in compensation.
A programme to promote the renovation of coffee plantations will be
suspended and the government will ask financial institutions to make loans
available for diversification, the document said.
The National Coffee-Growers' Federation will cut its costs by a real 20 per
cent next year through adjustments to programmes and staff reductions. The
National Coffee Fund will postpone or suspend new investments. Regional
coffee committees have committed themselves not to promote new sowings of
coffee or the modernisation of plantations.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farming has low profile on
Clinton agenda - The US presidential nominee's rural record is comparatively
sparse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VICTORY for Governor Bill Clinton in November's US presidential election
could either mean a more confrontational approach with the European
Community over farm trade or far-reaching changes in the US farm programme
to defuse the current stalemate in the Uruguay Round.
The Democratic party platform gives little hint of the direction a Clinton
Administration would move on farm policy. It took a bloody,
behind-the-scenes battle to produce a two-paragraph mention of 'agriculture
and the rural community' and it offers only one clue - a reference to
'family farmers' who must get 'fair prices' for their products is a bow to
the liberal wing that backed the unsuccessful campaign of Senator Tom
Harkin.
Senator Harkin has long pushed for higher price support loans to cover the
cost of production, large acreage set-asides, lower government subsidies and
a system of supply-management like the one which the EC has been developing.
The platform takes a swipe at the 'inattention and hostility' that has
characterised Republican farm and rural policy, its 'staggering' costs, and
'its total failure as demonstrated by the record number of rural
bankruptcies'.
Just as opaque as the platform is the Clinton campaign position paper on
trade and agriculture. It misses few of the cliches of the past decade,
promising to open new markets for US farm goods, bring down unfair trade
barriers, and 'stick up for farmers at the negotiating table'. It vows
aggressive use of the Export Enhancement Program - an export subsidy scheme
developed to challenge the EC's subsidies.
'When foreign competitors use export trade to gain unfair advantage, Bill
Clinton won't just stand by and watch - he'll guarantee a level playing
field,' it says.
The position paper is more specific on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which the governor has supported - provided it is 'the right kind
of Nafta,' protecting environmental, food safety and labour interests. The
paper promises to ensure that Mexican citrus and vegetable farmers do not
undersell US farmers 'through cheap but environmentally hazardous methods'.
In its recent 'Putting People First' economic strategy, the Clinton campaign
struck out unequivocally about one cut to be made in the US farm budget -
subsidies for honey producers - at a savings of Dollars 20m a year.
As is usual in the case of presidential campaigns, the candidate is being
bombarded with position papers and advice. The governor has praised a
transition document, prepared by some of the party's well-known liberals and
moderates. The Citizen Transition Project includes Mr Mark Green, consumer
advocate; Ms Madeleine Kunin, former governor of Vermont; and Mr Harvey
Gantt, unsuccessful senatorial candidate for North Carolina.
The idea of the paper is patterned after the conservative blueprint produced
in 1980 by the then-obscure Heritage Foundation and embraced by the Reagan
Administration.
One of the co-authors of the paper's farm section is Mr Mark Richie, a farm
activist and a significant force in the opposition to the US farm proposal
in the Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement. A strong
indictment of the Reagan-Bush farm policies and their effect on small and
medium-size producers, the transition paper lays the philosophical
groundwork for a supply-management programme and the 'de-intensification of
production' to preserve the environment and produce safer foods.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it says, should be encouraged to
enforce rules already on the books and to define others more precisely in
order to curb subsidies and dumping. Failure to do this has driven prices
down and thrown farmers off their lands the world over.
The Gatt would also be encouraged to use its Article XI to require countries
using import controls to link them with internal production controls. 'This
linkage, which depends upon supply management to generate a balance between
production and consumption, is intended to ensure non-discriminatory
treatment for all producers and fair trade. Yet almost all major countries
ignore this rule,' the paper says.
Although he comes from a rural state, Governor Clinton's record on
agriculture is comparatively sparse. By inclination, he is almost
obsessively centrist. He has had close ties with a giant poultry producer in
his state, but he has also taken a number of steps to save farmers from
bankruptcy.
Mr Harvey Jo Sanner, an Arkansas farmer and a long-time supporter of
Governor Clinton, said the governor understands the need for higher grain
prices and 'wouldn't mismanage the farm programme to drop down the prices'
as have the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
His 'partner' in the campaign - Senator Al Gore, his vice presidential
choice - supports programmes to expand the number of commercially viable,
family-sized farms and land set-aside programmes for both conservation
purposes and to provide a better balance between production and demand.
Neither candidate is known to have advocated the import controls thought
necessary to keep prices higher.
Whatever policy would be pursued if Governor Clinton is elected depends
largely upon the recommendations of his cabinet. Speculation is rife about
who could be chosen. Retiring Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota is being
pushed for agriculture secretary, and Mr Robert Strauss, the US ambassador
to Russia, is talked of hopefully to once again serve as US trade
representative. It is felt that if anyone can wrap up the Uruguay Round, he
can.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market confused over level of
Russia's base metal exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S ATTEMPTS to change the way base metals are exported this year have
created greater confusion and uncertainty among traders, who have no clear
idea about how much metal is being produced and shipped, reports Reuter.
The consensus is that exports will be below 1991's record levels, but
estimates of totals vary because shipments to the West in the first half of
the year have been erratic.
Yesterday, Mr Vitaly Shevelyov, deputy director of Raznoimport, said in
Moscow that Russian exports of aluminium and nickel were currently 25 per
cent down on year-ago levels.
'They could be 25 per cent down - why not? - or I would not be surprised if
it was 10 per cent higher,' a physical trader commented.
Last year, shipments of Russian aluminium totalled about 800,000 tonnes,
while the West bought some 115,000 to 120,000 tonnes of nickel.
This year Russia has set a target for its aluminium exports of 615,000
tonnes, while nickel shipments are expected to drop to about 100,000 tonnes.
But many traders see a different picture. 'There are infrastructure
problems, no money to buy spare parts for plants. Exports could fall by as
much as 50 per cent this year to nearer 400,000 tonnes,' one said.
A physical metals merchant estimated that only about 40 to 50 per cent of
last year's total metal exports will eventually come out.
However, Raznoimport's Mr Shevelyov, while giving no figures, said that
metals output was the same as last year.
Russian marketing officials in London agreed, but said exports might fall.
One marketing agency said, 'We (ourselves) expect to export around 100,000
tonnes of aluminium this year, much the same as last year. That includes
around 40 per cent of LME 99.7 (per cent purity) metal and other ore grades
from 99.5 down to 99 per cent (non-LME).'
Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst with Metals and Minerals Research Services,
estimated that exports were slightly lower in the first half of this year
'because of the bureaucratic jumbles in January and February . . . But they
are likely to be higher in the second half as they need the revenues'.
In January, Russia imposed new licensing procedures and export tariffs on
base metals, as well as allowing plants and producers to market their own
output if they wished. This had mixed results: the tariffs were revised
several times, barter increased and many different organisations appeared to
market metal and by-pass old centralised agencies.
'The switch to capitalism caused more problems . . . metal and money has
simply been lost,' one trader said.
A physical merchant added, 'It's very hard to get real deals done.
Transportation is a nightmare. You're not having alumina go into the plants
and you're not getting metal coming out . . . We are buying aluminium from
different people, different organisations and different smelters.'
Latest moves by Russia are designed to bring some order into this chaos.
From July 1, organisations wishing to export non-ferrous metals have had to
register with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. But traders doubt
if this will help.

The technical correction that has been under way in the London Metal
Exchange TIN Market over the past week continued yesterday when the cash
price fell by another Dollars 175 to Dollars 6,820 a tonne. Dealers said the
fall, which took the fall over the last six trading days to Dollars 340 a
tonne, was also influenced by Chinese and Brazilian selling. For NICKEL, in
contrast, Chinese buying was an underpinning factor as the cash price
regained another Dollars 70 of its recent fall to reach Dollars 7,495 a
tonne. The GOLD price maintained this week's uptrend with a 70 cent rise to
Dollars 352.55 a troy ounce. At the London Bullion Market's morning fixing
it had reached a 5-month high of Dollars 353.15 an ounce, prompting one
dealer to comment: 'People are looking for excuses to hold gold whereas
before they were looking for excuses to sell it'. At the London Futures and
Options Exchange COCOA was back on the downward path, with the September
delivery position closing at Pounds 584 a tonne, down Pounds 13 on the day.
Dealers said trading was subdued and thought the market was set for a period
of consolidation after retreating Pounds 48 from Monday's 2 1/2 -month peak.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: NationsBank turns in 22%
income rise

THE recovery trend in US banking continued yesterday when a 22 per cent rise
in net income was reported by NationsBank, the large south-eastern regional
group formed last year by the merger of C&amp;S Sovran and NCNB.
Yesterday's bank results also included a 65 per cent jump in net profits at
the Chicago-based Continental Bank and a profitable quarter for the
Connecticut-based Shawmut National, compared with a loss in the second
quarter of 1991.
NationsBank's net profit was Dollars 251m in the second quarter, up from
Dollars 206m in the same period last year. Earnings per share were Dollars
1, some 14 per cent higher than the 88 cents of a year ago.
The bank, the fourth biggest in the US with Dollars 111bn of assets and more
than 1,800 offices in 10 states, said net loan write-offs were Dollars 141m
in the quarter, down significantly from Dollars 262m a year ago.
Second quarter bad debt provisions were almost halved year-on-year, from
Dollars 294m to Dollars 150m. Non-performing loans declined by Dollars 126m
during the quarter, to Dollars 1.76bn.
At Continental Bank, second quarter net earnings totalled Dollars 51m, up
from Dollars 31m a year ago. On a per share basis earnings were 78 cent
against 41 cents.
Although net interest revenue was unchanged at Dollars 119m, Mr Thomas
Theobald, chairman, said reduced operating expenses and lower bad debt
provisions contributed to the profits rise.
Continental Bank's provisions were Dollars 25m against Dollars 63m in the
second quarter of 1991. Operating expenses dropped by 16 per cent to Dollars
134m in the quarter.
Shawmut, an indicator of the state of the New England economy, recorded an
Dollars 8.6m net profit in the quarter, compared with a Dollars 58.7m loss a
year ago. Earnings per share were nine cents against a loss of 81 cents.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest to securitise loans
to companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster is set to become the first UK bank to securitise loans
made to companies, taking the assets off balance sheet and increasing its
capacity to lend.
The bank yesterday announced a Dollars 500m US commercial paper programme
which will be backed by participations in syndicated loans and revolving
credit facilities to European companies.
The commercial paper will be issued through a special purpose company,
Thames Funding, based in Delaware. The company will buy loan participations
from NatWest, via another Cayman Islands subsidiary, and will fund the
purchases by issuing asset-backed securities.
Securitisation has been used by UK banks to take mortgage loans off balance
sheet. Earlier this year the Bank of England issued guidelines for the
securitisation of credit card loans.
Mr Malcolm Veale, head of securitisation at NatWest, said the programme
would provide floating-rate dollar funding at a level close to the London
interbank offered rate.
In addition, by taking the loans off balance sheet, NatWest liberates
capital which can be used to make new loans. Mr Veale said that the bank
currently has surplus capital but was making a long-term commitment to
securitisation as a method of funding.
NatWest has not identified which loans will be securitised. Mr Veale said
companies had raised no objections during informal discussions.
Paper issued by Thames Funding will carry top A1/P1 credit ratings from
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, because all of
the underlying loans are to companies which also carry a top rating. It is
likely NatWest will securitise low-margin loans to big companies, signed in
the late-1980s when lending margins were very tight.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Gefco launches Pounds 100m 15-year
Eurobond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEFCO, the UK government-backed export finance agency, took advantage of the
relieved tone of the sterling bond market yesterday to make an opportunistic
Pounds 100m 15-year Eurobond issue.
Long-dated UK government bonds rallied in the afternoon as dealers expressed
relief that the German Bundesbank had decided not to increase its Lombard
interest rate. Such a move could have led to higher UK interest rates.
The bonds issued yesterday carry a coupon of 9 1/4 per cent and were
re-offered at a fixed price of 99.436. At this level the yield was 30 basis
points more than long-dated gilts. The benchmark in the sector, a Pounds
500m European Investment Bank issue, trades at around 32 basis points.
The bonds sold almost exclusively to UK institutional investors, although
the deal was structured in bearer, Eurosterling form.
Turkey continued its international borrowing programme by launching a
Dollars 200m five-year issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley International.
The issue is Turkey's second visit to the Eurodollar sector, following a
Dollars 250m five-year issue, with a put option after three years. The
country has also borrowed in the US and Japanese domestic markets.
The earlier Eurodollar deal was bid yesterday at 230 basis points over US
Treasury bonds. The new bonds will be priced at a lower yield spread,
210-220 basis points, despite the longer maturity of the bonds.
The pricing was seen as aggressive by some firms, although the lead manager
argued that the new bond would still yield substantially more than the
outstanding paper due to the steepness of the US Treasury yield curve.
Syndicate officials also grumbled that underwriters' fees of  3/4 per cent
were shaved to a level which did not reflect the risk of underwriting the
bonds. Morgan Stanley noted that Turkey was an OECD country and now carries
an investment grade credit rating. The deal will be priced today.
Borrowers from the emerging markets of Latin America look set to launch
another wave of international bond issues following several weeks of only
light issuance.
Yesterday, Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company, launched a Dollars
140m two-year floating rate note issue, lead managed by Chase Investment
Bank. The deal is the first substantial floating-rate issue by a Latin
American borrower since the debt crisis of the early 1980s. The proceeds of
the issue will be used to refinance a Dollars 250m fixed-rate issue called
by Petrobras earlier this year. The bonds fall due for repayment on August
3. The rest of the call will be refinanced out of cash flow.
The paper pays a healthy 425 basis points over the six-month London
interbank offered rate.
The flow of issues by Brazilian issuers is likely to be staunched by new
government regulations which will restrict international borrowings to
maturities of three years or more. Today, Argentina Telecom is expected to
launch a Dollars 200m five-year fixed-rate issue via J. P. Morgan.
Telefonica, another Argentine telecommunications company, is preparing to
raise international funding, with bankers expecting a three-year issue via
Lehman Brothers.
On Monday, Argentina's credit rating was lifted by two notches to B1 - still
four notches below investment grade - by Moody's Investors Service, the US
rating agency.
Next week, Banco de Chile, the country's largest private sector bank, is
expected to launch a Dollars 75m issue - the first international issue by a
Chilean borrower since the debt crisis of the 1970s.
Shares in Thermo Electron, the US technology company, stabilised yesterday
following the launch of a Dollars 200m five-year convertible bond issue on
Wednesday. The shares fell Dollars 2 5/8 on the day of issue, widening the
conversion premium on the 4 5/8 per cent bonds from an unusually low 14 per
cent to 22 per cent. Lead manager Lehman Brothers yesterday quoted the bonds
at 102, from an issue price of par.

RICOH, the Japanese office equipment manufacturer, yesterday announced that
it would acquire SMO Bureautique, a distribution subsidiary of Metrologie
International, the French electrical equipment company.
Ricoh's Fr202.5m (Dollars 49m) purchase follows that by Canon, another
Japanese office supply maker, in establishing independent manufacturing and
distribution operations in France.
The move comes at a time when Japanese companies are refocusing their
investments towards core domestic businesses. Overseas acquisitions by
Japanese companies have declined sharply as the fall in the stock and real
estate markets have squeezed companies' cash flow.
Ricoh said the move was strategically important, as a quarter of its sales
in Europe was generated in France. Its production line in Colmar, Alsace,
has been manufacturing photocopiers, facsimile machines and other office
equipment since 1987.
Ricoh said there would be no drastic restructuring of operations at SMO
Bureautique, which employs over 800 staff.

GENERAL Electric, the US group with interests ranging from power systems to
financial services, turned in an 8 per cent improvement in second quarter
earnings, in line with expectations, but said it would halt its Dollars 10bn
stock buy-back programme at the Dollars 5bn level.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company would complete the stock buy-back
programme before the end of the year. 'By taking this action during this
uncertain economic period, the company assures its triple-A debt rating and
maintains the financial flexibility to take advantage of global recovery
opportunities.
'The company will, however, continue to repurchase on an ongoing basis
shares required for employee programmes. These purchases should amount to
approximately Dollars 400m annually,' he said.
He added that GE had no plans for any significant acquisition.
For the second quarter, net earnings totalled Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars
1.42 a share, against Dollars 1.13bn, or Dollars 1.30, in the same period of
1991. Consolidated revenues advanced 4 per cent to Dollars 15.4bn from
Dollars 14.8bn.
Net earnings for the first six months of 1992 rose 7 per cent to Dollars
2.274bn from Dollars 2.130bn. Earnings per share were 9 per cent higher at
Dollars 2.65 against Dollars 2.44.
Consolidated revenues were up 3 per cent at Dollars 28.9bn from Dollars
28.1bn.
During the quarter, GE's operating margin slid to 12.6 per cent from 12.9
per cent in the 1991 second quarter. The decline reflects significant
pricing pressures.
Earnings from GE's financial services grew 24 per cent, thanks to
double-digit increases at GE Capital, its main asset-holding arm and Kidder,
Peabody, its stock-broking arm.
The company said its NBC television network also recorded double digit
growth.
GE will increase its quarterly dividend by 7.3 per cent, or 4 cents a share,
to 59 cents effective with its September third-quarter dividend.

SAMSUNG, South Korea's largest conglomerate, has purchased Werk fur
Fernsehelektronik (WF), a leading electronics company in the former East
Germany, for Dollars 20m.
Berlin-based WF will be managed by Samsung Electron Devices (SED), the
cathode ray tube subsidiary, in what is the first acquisition of an east
German concern by a South Korean company.
WF employs 1,220 people and produces 1.2m colour television tubes annually.
SED will invest an additional Dollars 120m in WF to increase its annual
production of colour television picture tubes to 2.5m by 1997. The European
demand for colour television tubes is 20m.
Samsung has colour television factories in Portugal and Hungary and
manufactures microwave ovens, VCRs and facsimile machines in the UK, VCRs in
Spain and refrigerators in Czechoslovakia. Samsung provides colour
television tubes to European electronics makers.
Samsung acquired WF from the Treuhandanstalt in competitive bidding against
Philips of the Netherlands, Thomson of France and Toshiba of Japan.
Treuhandanstalt agreed that Samsung would not have to assume any of WF's
debts and the German government promised to help provide investment for the
installation of a new assembly line.

GANNETT, the US publisher of 81 daily newspapers, including USA Today, said
a recovery in advertising revenues helped it to a 4 per cent rise in net
profits for the second quarter of 1992.
The Virginia-based company said that its second-quarter net profit was
Dollars 98.74m, while earnings per share had improved 13 per cent to 69
cents.
Gannett said that its second quarter operating revenues were 2 per cent
higher at Dollars 892.1m.
Operating income for the quarter was, meanwhile, 9 per cent up at Dollars
176.7m.
The company said that its newspaper publishing earnings rose mainly due to
higher advertising and circulation revenues, along with significantly lower
newsprint costs.
At USA Today, the national daily, paid advertising pages increased by 3 per
cent during the quarter.
Broadcasting revenues were unchanged at Dollars 97.5m as the revenues from
Gannett's 10 television stations increased by 2 per cent while revenues from
its 15 radio stations declined.
Revenues from outdoor advertising division, the largest such company in
North America, fell 4 per cent to Dollars 66.8m in the quarter.
For the first six months of 1992, earnings per share were 16 per cent higher
at Dollars 1.07.
Net income was Dollars 154.2m, compared with Dollars 145.1m in the first
half of 1991 while operating revenues were 1 per cent better at Dollars
1.7bn.

18% in quarter

PROFITS from the gold operations of Anglo American, the world's largest
producer, dropped by 18 per cent during the June quarter following lower
contributions from Freegold and Western Deep Levels.
Although gold production rose fractionally to 63,799kg from 63,490kg the
previous quarter, total working costs were 2.6 per cent higher at R1.72bn
(Dollars 628m) compared with R1.67bn last year. The average rand gold price
received was 2.2 per cent lower at R32,749 per kg compared with R33,483 per
kg. Profit after capital expenditure fell 17.7 per cent to R137.4m from
R167m last year.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division, said the main
issue facing the group was to deal with problems at Western Deep Levels
where a string of mine accidents claimed 46 lives this year, disrupting
production and sapping the morale of the workforce.
Available profits at the mine dropped by 35 per cent to R10.9m from R16.8m
last quarter and R30.1m in the June quarter last year.
Although monthly gold production improved steadily - quarterly production
was 1.1 per cent up at 9,096kg over the March figure - the catalogue of
accidents meant the mine was still some way off good health. Gold production
in the June quarter last year was 10,430kg.
Western Deep Levels is the deepest gold mine in the world, with mining down
to depths of 3,800m below the surface. Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director,
said a number of steps were being taken to improve safety He said the mine,
where two thirds of the deaths have occurred, had a safety record last year
above the industry average.
The other mine to suffer a significant fall in profits was Freegold where
available profits dropped to R61.8m from R81.7m.
Mr Hewitt said this was a result of gold production dropping slightly to
28,059kg from 28,337kg, a lower gold price of R32,863 per kg and working
costs rising by 4 per cent to R819m from R789m.
Available profits at Vaal Reefs were unchanged at R48.6m.
Elandsrand had a very good production quarter, lifting production by 11.6
per cent to 4,852kg from 4,104kg while profits at Ergo dropped to R5.1m from
R7.5m.

<TEXT>
GENGOLD, the gold arm of South Africa's Gencor group, has been forced to
mothball the developing Weltevreden mine and shelve plans to deepen a shaft
at Winkelhaak because of a weak gold price.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said work had been stopped at Weltevreden
because the gold price was 41 per cent lower than envisaged when the project
was undertaken. He said a price of R45,000 (Dollars 16,304) per kilogram
would be needed to restart the project. The current price is under R31,000
per kilogram.
Mr Maude said the Winkelhaak shaft would be viable at a gold price of
R32,000 a kilogram. The price, however, was weakening.
The average price received by group mines in the June quarter was R32,071
per kilogram.
Previously announced plans to merge Winkelhaak and Kinross Gold Mines would
be delayed.
A feature of the group's results for the quarter was the substantial
contribution to profits from hedging. Mr Maude said the group had made
hedging profits of R16.8m during the quarter from the forward selling of
nearly 147,000 ounces of production.
He added that hedging profits had accounted for about one third of the 5 per
cent improvement in group after-tax profits, to R70.6m compared with the
previous quarter. Gengold mines hedge up to 20 per cent of production.
The R1.3bn first-phase capital programme for Oryx mine in the Orange Free
State is continuing.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Equitable Life sets share price
at Dollars 9 each
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITABLE Life, the large but troubled US insurance company, yesterday
finally set the price at which it is selling shares to investors at Dollars
9 apiece.
This is well below Equitable's initial expectations of Dollars 11 to Dollars
14.
The flotation of 43.5m shares is the final step in a lengthy conversion
process, transforming the Equitable from a mutual insurance company
(controlled essentially by its policyholders) to a conventional
shareholder-owned business.
The Equitable conversion is the largest demutualisation scheme to have taken
place in the US.
The first step in the demutualisation process took place last July when Axa,
the French insurer, agreed to invest Dollars 1bn in the Equitable in return
for a large minority stake in the US insurer when conversion took place.
The size of that stake depended on the price at which shares were floated;
yesterday's decision means that Axa will get 49 per cent of the common
stock.
Equitable's policyholders, who received a 'free' handout of shares in the
demutualisation process, will own about 19 per cent of the equity.
The flotation of shares to outside investors will raise only Dollars 361m.
Of this, Dollars 220m will go to pay dividends and expenses, and Dollars 72m
will fund cash payments and policy credits for policyholders.
About Dollars 69m will be used to increase Equitable's statutory surplus.

COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, yesterday unveiled a 33
per cent improvement in second-quarter net earnings, on sales which rose 19
per cent.
Net income was Dollars 124.4m in the three months to June 30, on sales of
Dollars 1.8bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 93.3m on sales of Dollars
3.4bn the previous year.
Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 75 cents from 66 cents. There were
more shares outstanding in the latest quarter.
Earnings before interest and taxes advanced 25 per cent in the quarter to
Dollars 204.5m.
The results were in line with expectations, and shares in Colgate-Palmolive
held steady on Wall Street at Dollars 53 1/8 at midday.
For the first half of 1992, net income grew 29 per cent to Dollars 238.2m on
sales up 14 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn. Earnings per share stood at Dollars
1.49 compared with Dollars 1.31. Earnings before interest and taxes grew 22
per cent to Dollars 396.4m.
Mr Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive, said the company's gross
profit margin improved to 47.1 per cent from 45.5 per cent in the 1991
second quarter. He attributed the improvement to a growing proportion of
high-margin personal care business and production efficiencies.

ZENITH Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, reported a
second quarter loss of Dollars 15.2m, or 52 cents per share, on sales of
Dollars 280m.
This is an improvement over the same period last year, when losses were
Dollars 26.9m, or 92 cents, on sales of Dollars 275m.
Royalty income of Dollars 13m this time helped boost results. Mr Jerry
Pearlman, chairman, said the royalties came from colour TV and VCR
manufacturers taking licences on Zenith's tuner technology. Zenith holds
patents on most of the cable-compatible TVs and VCRs on the US market.
The results, however, were affected by delays in shipments of the company's
new flat tension mask monitors, or flat screens, due to start up problems
and customer requests for upgrades. While consumer electronics shipments
increased in the quarter, lower prices on colour televisions hurt margins.
Although the company has implemented cost-reduction programmes, it expects
another full-year loss.
For the first six months, losses were Dollars 43.8m, or Dollars 1.50,
compared with losses of Dollars 50.6m, or Dollars 1.77, last year.

RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the large RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group,
is to begin manufacturing cigarettes in Russia.
The US group announced it had reached a partnership agreement with AS-Petro,
a Russian cigarette manufacturer.
It claims that this is the first large investment by a foreign company in a
private cigarette enterprise in Russia.
RJR said it would make a 'substantial investment' in new equipment for the
factory, but disclosed no figures. It said that after the new machinery was
installed, RJR-Petro's annual production capacity would rise to 22bn
cigarettes, to make it Russia's largest cigarette producer.
American-blend brands 'will be phased in as component sourcing is resolved'.
The former Soviet Union is seen as one of the biggest potential new markets
for US cigarette manufacturers, which face steadily declining demand in
their home market.
An acute cigarette shortage in Russia two years ago was eased by emergency
imports from the West, but RJR estimated yesterday that an annual shortage
of 100bn cigarettes still existed.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications and computer
group, yesterday reported a 3.5 per cent increase in second quarter net
income. It said its credit card, launched in 1990, had moved into profit for
the first time in June.
Mr Alex Mandl, chief financial officer, said the group was targeting 'strong
earnings for the second half and 1992'.
AT&amp;T reported net income of Dollars 961m, compared with Dollars 928m in the
same period of last year, when the figure included an Dollars 87m, or 7
cents-a-share, after-tax gain from the sale of its stake in Sun
Microsystems, the computer manufacturer.
However, earnings per share were unchanged, at 72 cents, between the two
quarters because of the issuance of more AT&amp;T shares. Revenues rose from
Dollars 15.72bn to Dollars 15.84bn.
The group's telecommunications services revenues grew Dollars 215m, or 2.2
per cent, to Dollars 9.85bn, while long-distance calling volume rose more
than 6 per cent. The gains were concentrated in business services.
The AT&amp;T Universal card, a credit card which can be used for general
purchases as well as phone calls, was a big contributor to a 43 per cent
jump, to Dollars 425m, in financial services revenues.
AT&amp;T said it was now the third-largest credit card issuer in the US, with
9.5m accounts and 14m cards issued. At 2 per cent its delinquency rate was
well below the industry average.
The group's revenues from products and systems dropped 5 per cent to Dollars
3.84bn. Network communications sales declined as US customers deferred
purchases, while consumer product and large business phone system sales were
flat.
NCR, the computer group taken over by AT&amp;T last year and merged with its own
computer operations, suffered from the weakness of the computer market,
particularly in Europe and east Asia. However it continued to report strong
orders in the US.
Although it made operating income of Dollars 98m, AT&amp;T acknowledged that, on
a like-for-like basis, NCR's revenues probably declined slightly in the
quarter, compared with the independent company's figures in the second
quarter of last year.
For the first six months, AT&amp;T made net income of Dollars 1.84bn, or Dollars
1.39 a share, compared with income of Dollars 1.67bn, or Dollars 1.31, last
year. Revenues rose slightly from Dollars 31bn to Dollars 31.2bn.

THE HALCION sleeping pill controversy continued to take its toll on Upjohn,
the US pharmaceuticals group, which posted essentially flat second-quarter
earnings.
Upjohn had warned Wall Street that its second-quarter profits would be flat
or below the previous year's performance. Shares in the company added
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the three months to June 30, net earnings were Dollars 129.9m, or 72
cents a share, against Dollars 127.5m, or 70 cents, in the same period of
1991. Sales rose 3 per cent to Dollars 883.6m from Dollars 859.4m.
Sales of Halcion dropped 50 per cent in the 1992 second quarter. Halcion was
the world's fastest-selling sleeping pill, and one of Upjohn's main
money-spinners, before concerns about possible side-effects sparked an
international debate.
Net earnings in the 1992 quarter were helped by a lower tax rate. The
company's operating income fell almost 5 per cent, to Dollars 160m from
Dollars 168m, while pre-tax income eased to Dollars 171m from Dollars 175m.
Upjohn said sales of its Rogaine hair-loss treatment also fell in the
quarter, as did sales of its Ansaid non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent. The
declines were offset by higher sales of Upjohn's Xanax anti-anxiety drug and
its Provera progestational drug.
Upjohn is stepping up its efforts to get new products on the market to
offset the impact of several of its important drugs losing their patents in
the next two years.
For the first half, net income was Dollars 273.6m, or Dollars 1.52 a
share,compared with Dollars 260.8m, or Dollars 1.43, a year earlier. Sales
rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from Dollars 1.66bn.

cent improvement in underlying second-quarter net income, to Dollars 213.8m,
or 43 cents a share, from Dollars 193m, or 39 cents, a year earlier.
Earnings in both years were distorted by special items which brought
reported 1992 second-quarter net income to Dollars 329.5m, or 66 cents,
compared with Dollars 206.9m, or 42 cents, last year.
The latest quarter included an extraordinary gain of 23 cents a share. A
year earlier, net earnings included one-time gains of about 3 cents a share.
Revenues rose to Dollars 2.18bn from Dollars 1.88bn.
For the first half, Waste Management had net income of Dollars 450m, or 91
cents, on revenues of Dollars 4.2bn, compared with earnings of Dollars
372.6m, or 76 cents, on revenues of Dollars 3.63bn in the first six months

Stripping out one-time items, the company said its first-half net earnings
rose 13 per cent to Dollars 405.9m, or 82 cents, from Dollars 358.6m or 73
cents.

PHILIP Morris, the cigarette, food and beer manufacturer, reported a 19.6
per cent increase in second-quarter after-tax profits to Dollars 1.35bn.
The double-digit advance was scored on a 2.6 per cent increase in revenues,
to Dollars 15.2bn. It takes Philip Morris's net profits for the first half
of 1992 to Dollars 2.45bn. In the same period of 1991, it made Dollars
2.05bn - ahead of an accounting change charge.
Mr Michael Miles, chairman, said: 'We expect the company's strong net
earnings trend to continue for the remainder of the year.'
On the tobacco front, Philip Morris saw second-quarter operating profits
rise 13.6 per cent to Dollars 1.96bn, on revenues of Dollars 6.57bn, with
international tobacco operations chipping in Dollars 499m against Dollars
435m.
Cigarette volume was down 2.3 per cent at Dollars 163.2bn. The company
blamed this on delayed shipments to Russia 'pending the resolution of
financing arrangements'.
Although Philip Morris's share of the domestic premium brand market slipped
to 36.6 per cent, from 37.2 per cent, its total domestic market share
improved from 44.6 to 45 per cent year-on-year.
In the food division, operating profits were 7 per cent higher at Dollars
845m, on revenues of Dollars 7.33bn, against Dollars 7.24bn, with the
international side contributing Dollars 238m compared with Dollars 201m.
Beer profits were Dollars 115m, against Dollars 103m, on sales of Dollars
1.16bn.
The company bought in 11.6m shares at a cost of Dollars 870m during the
quarter.

UNISYS, the long-struggling and heavily debt-laden US computer manufacturer,
yesterday continued its turnround by reporting a third consecutive
profitable quarter and its highest gross profit margins in three years.
The company reported net income of Dollars 105.4m, or 45 cents a share. That
compared with a loss of Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 8.24 a share, a year ago
when the company took Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring charges.
Revenues dipped from Dollars 2.20bn to Dollars 2.09bn but the company said
the earlier period included Dollars 63m of revenue from a subsidiary which
has since been sold.
Mr James Unruh, the chairman, said the results 'exceeded our expectations,
with all major operating units meeting or exceeding their key goals for the
quarter, despite a mixed economic environment.
'Second-quarter cash flow from operations exceeded Dollars 275m and the
operating margin of 9.7 per cent was the highest in nearly four years.'
The company, he added, was ahead of schedule in its plan to reduce costs and
expenses by Dollars 800m by the end of this year. Operating expenses in the
second quarter were 11 per cent below the same period of last year.
Total debt net of cash declined by more than Dollars 250m during the quarter
to Dollars 2.1bn.
The company said orders declined slightly in the period, compared with a
year ago, with strong gains in US information systems partly offset by a
decline in European orders.
Mr Unruh said the US information systems business had recorded its strongest
second-quarter gain in orders in four years.
'However, we continue to remain cautious about economic conditions in Japan
and Europe,' he added.
For the six months the company reported net income of Dollars 153.7m, or 56
cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 1.4bn. or Dollars 9.03 a
share, last year.

FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Peat Marwick begins KIO review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent

<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, confirmed yesterday it has begun an
assessment commissioned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) into the
agency's Spanish investments and said it expected the first stage of the
study to be complete in three months.
A spokesman for Peat Marwick, which is KIO's auditor in both London and
Spain, said the assessment would examine 'the nature and performance' of
KIO's investments in Spain, controlled by Torras, the agency's Spanish
holding company.
Peat Marwick said the assessment would not initially include recommendations
to KIO on its investment strategy in Spain, but that 'we can put
recommendations in, as requested, along the line'.
The Kuwait government announced on Wednesday that Peat Marwick would
undertake the study of KIO's Spanish holdings following a high-level meeting
of the state's ministers and senior KIO executives - a move designed to
quiet growing criticism in Spain and Kuwait over KIO's handling of the
Ercros crisis.
Ercros, the KIO-controlled Spanish chemicals group which employs more than
10,500 workers, owes Dollars 2.15bn and KIO's refusal to make new funds
available to the group without assistance from creditor banks and the
Spanish government raised a storm of criticism in Madrid.
Peat Marwick said the full assessment of Torras' holdings would take 'some
time' longer than the initial three months. The firm said there were no
plans as yet to broaden the assessment to include any other of KIO's
estimated Dollars 35bn international investment portfolio.

<TEXT>
MR GASTON Bastiaens has quit as director of the Consumer Electronics
division and general manager of the Interactive Media Systems group at
Philips, the consumer electronics company.
Mr Bastiaens, aged 45, who has been with Philips for 21 years, is joining
Apple Computer in September, where he will head the US company's new
consumer electronics products division.
At Apple, which he will join as vice-president and general manager of its
Personal Interactive Electronics (PIE) division, Mr Bastiaens will be
responsible for the development and marketing efforts of Apple's new class
of personal electronics products incorporating digital information.
Mr Bastiaens was the driving force behind Philips' compact disk interactive
(CD-I) business, a multimedia product which is one of three business areas
the group is counting on to generate consumer interest and revive its
flagging fortunes in the consumer electronics market.
Multimedia, such as CD-I, is a new technology which combines video, text,
data and sound. Electronics companies expect multimedia to sprout new
electronics products and form a large market.
Mr Bastiaens will look into the possibility of making Apple media products
compatible with CD-I, Apple said.
Representatives at Philips expressed their regret at Mr Bastiaens' move but
said a replacement had been found.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Painting each other in the worst possible
hue - Kalon's bid for Manders has sparked off a battle in the paints
industry
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY PETER PEARSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KALON might mean 'beautiful' in ancient Greek, but to Mr Roger Akers, chief
executive of Manders (Holdings), the paints, inks and property group, it is
more likely to mean the opposite.
The recent intrusion of Kalon Group into his life was at best 'bloody
inconsiderate'. He had just started a Caribbean holiday when news of its
hostile bid for Manders brought him straight back to the UK to fight for his
company's independence.
On the face of it, he and Mr Roy Amos, Manders' chairman, have something of
an uphill struggle.
Kalon, the Yorkshire-based paint maker, opened its 8-for-3 Pounds 91.5m
paper offer with a blistering comparison of Manders' management record
versus its own. By many measures from earnings growth to cash generation,
the bidder has far out-performed its target.
The man behind Kalon's performance, Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director
since 1988, has reaped personal rewards. He was awarded a Pounds 745,300
bonus last year for Kalon's steep rise in earnings per share between 1989
and 1991.
The companies have pursued sharply different tacks. While Kalon was
stripping itself back to its core paint business, Manders spent Pounds 23m
(net of disposals) in building up three areas - paints, inks and property.
Some Pounds 14m went on buying the remaining leaseholds in the Mander
Centre, an office and retail development in Wolverhampton, and about Pounds
4m refurbishing it.
Paint manufacturing plants, often 30 to 40 years old, have been updated and
productivity has 'shot up'; distribution and trade depots have been
revamped, often moving to edge-of-town sites. Inks have been rationalised
from nine factories to three. Acquisitions have made Manders the market
leader in liquid inks for food packaging.
Manders' 'long and expensive' modernisation is over, Mr Akers says, and the
group is now poised to benefit. Kalon argues, though, that the strategy has
over-stretched Manders' finances and management.
It points out that Manders' earnings per share last year were lower than in
any year since 1987, its borrowings rose to Pounds 33.3m from Pounds 13.4m
in 1987, and pre-tax profits at Pounds 6.04m were less than 1988's Pounds
6.12m.
Although Manders had been 'neglected until 1986' when Mr Akers arrived, 'it
is more than just a paints company like Kalon', he says. Inks account for
more than 40 per cent of turnover, and the Mander Centre is valued in
Manders' 1991 accounts at Pounds 57.5m.
Mr Akers questions the depth of Kalon. 'Imagine it as a navy with one
battleship, and us as a navy with three cruisers,' he says. 'If they lose a
ship, they are dead in the water - we can lose a cruiser and still have two
left.'
Kalon says it would sell the Mander Centre and has no particular plans for
the inks division. What it really wants - and perhaps needs, to maintain its
progress - is the paints side.
It has emphasised that a combined group would gain from: the integration of
four factories into three in paint production; of two factories into one in
industrial coatings and of two head offices into one; from rationalised
usage and stronger purchasing power in raw materials; from increased market
share (the two companies, it says, have complementary strengths in trade and
retail paints); and from an enlarged customer base in decorative sundries
and wall coverings.
Manders is relying on two defensive strategies. First, it is pushing - with
cross-party, though mainly Labour, support - for the bid's referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. So far 62 MPs have signed a Commons
motion.
Kalon argues the takeover would only boost its market share from 16 per cent
to 23 per cent of the whole decorative paints market, making it fourth
behind ICI, Crown Berger and Akzo. But Manders says the merged group would
have 75 per cent of the own-label market.
Second, Manders acknowledges its profits have lagged behind the bidder's.
But it says Kalon's were inflated by 'windfall' profits in 1990 and 1991
which boosted its share price and gave it the springboard to launch the
paper bid.
Manders ascribes Kalon's 57 per cent rise to Pounds 9.22m in 1991 to several
factors: the decision of ICI, the market leader, to raise its paint prices
by about 10 per cent, which boosted all paint prices; recession, which
encouraged people to trade down to own-label paints; and the fall in the
price of raw materials.
Manders argues that the 'circumstances are unlikely to coincide again'.
Kalon claims, though, that its ex-factory paint prices increased in the
first quarter of 1992 despite the Paintmakers Association figures which show
a 5 per cent fall.
The own-label market is one key to the bid battle. Too late to gain from the
windfall profits, Manders bought Windeck Paints, second only to Kalon in the
sale of own-label paints to DIY chains, for Pounds 5.66m last December.
Mr Akers says an 'unbacked' Windeck, with about 16 per cent of the own-label
market, was 'no danger' to Kalon which controls 60 per cent. But under
Manders, Windeck is a threat. He claims Kalon did not know Windeck was for
sale, that it would only have acquired it to close it, and even suggests
that Kalon's failure to buy Windeck led to the current bid.
Mr Hennessy counters that Kalon did not buy Windeck because its paints did
not comply with the BS5750 standard. Manders has improved the plant and
applied for certification under the standard.
Manders argues, moreover, that Kalon has underestimated the potential loss
of busi-ness across own-label, trade and retail paints after inte-gration.
It cites the fall in combined market share at Crown and Berger after they
merged.
While the two sides argue the toss about the outlook for paints, Manders
shareholders are left with a straight choice. They can remain loyal to a
management which says it can now produce profit growth across all its
divisions. Or they can back a management trying to build a paints company
that can compete in a rapidly consolidating market.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Late bookings cloud Owners Abroad forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE BOOKINGS by holiday-makers have made it impossible to forecast
full-year tour operator profits, Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest
travel company, said yesterday.
Although bookings have improved in the past few weeks, the expected
post-election boom has not materialised. The 1992 package holiday market is
likely to be between 6 and 8 per cent bigger than last year, but there are
still 500,000 holidays too many on sale, Mr Howard Klein, chairman, said.
Owners Abroad has already cut 100,000 holidays from its programme and is
looking at the possibility of further reductions. Mr Klein said that, as in
any other retail business, there was bound to be further discounting, but he
did not expect the industry to engage in large-scale price-cutting during
the peak season, which begins next week. 'We are not in a late 1980s price
war,' he said.
The company announced a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax losses from Pounds 21.4m
to Pounds 27.2m for the six months to April 30, which was higher than City
expectations.
However, interim results provide little indication of prospects for the year
as a whole because the first half includes only 25 per cent of annual
bookings. The annual overhead charge, on the other hand, is spread evenly
through the year. In addition, the company does not record profits from a
package tour until the holidaymaker actually departs.
The company has sold over 1.8m charter-based holidays so far this year, 17
per cent up on 1991. It has sold 80 per cent of its summer programme and 91
per cent of its July holidays.
Full-year results would depend on the prices it was able to obtain for the
remaining 20 per cent of its summer holidays. 'Discounting has meant that
margins have come under pressure,' Mr Klein said.
The company has net cash of more than Pounds 100m. It expects to have
average annual net cash of about Pounds 50m - the first time it has been
cash positive throughout a financial year.
Turnover was up 29 per cent at Pounds 185m. There was an exceptional item of
Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 610,000) to take account of the introduction of three
new aircraft at the Air 2000 subsidiary.
Fully-diluted losses per share were 14.04p (14.66p).
The interim dividend is increased by 8 per cent to 0.9075p.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hampson shows 20% decline to Pounds 4m but
maintains pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMPSON INDUSTRIES, the precision engineering, aluminium refining and home
products group, saw annual profits drop nearly 20 per cent but had reached
the 'nadir of its fortunes' according to Mr John Wardle, chairman.
On turnover of Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 78.5m), pre-tax profits for the year to
end-March were Pounds 4.06m (Pounds 5.04m) - higher than market expectations
and helped by a seasonally favourable second half. At the halfway stage the
West Midlands-based group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.62m.
Mr Wardle said profits would not decline further in the current year and the
dividend, maintained at 2.373p via a same-again final of 1.773p, would not
be cut.
Earnings per share were 3.65p, against 4.55p last time.
Trading conditions in the current year have not improved and Mr Wardle made
clear 'the recession is very firmly with us.' The experience of April, when
pressure on margins was relieved, has not been repeated.
Mr Wardle's expectation that current year profits will increase is partially
based on the fact that in 1991-92 loss-making subsidiaries in the printing,
printing machinery and packaging sectors have either been eliminated or
sold.
With the exception of the carrying cost of some residual borrowings of the
Kenmart operation, consequent charges have been absorbed in the latest
figures.
At the same time, the performance of the precision engineering units,
largely involved in the refurbishment of aircraft with British Aerospace as
a main customer, has been and is likely to remain strong. The order book is
full for the next three years.
Precision engineering played a notable role in stabilising the figures: its
proportion of profits rose to 56 per cent (46 per cent). By contrast
aluminium refining was depressed, with 5 per cent against 14 per cent, and
looks likely to remain that way.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MSC takes Peel back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEEL HOLDINGS, the property company, yesterday reported a return to profits
after taking in a 10 months contribution from the 68 per cent stake in the
Manchester Ship Canal Company, which it bought in May last year.
Mr John Whittaker, chairman, said the property recession had been deeper and
longer than could ever have been expected. Nevertheless, the group sold
properties worth Pounds 88.2m at a profit of Pounds 1.3m over book value
before expenses.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 turned round to Pounds 7m, from
losses of Pounds 8.48m which included exceptional provisions of Pounds
6.21m. Earnings per share were 8.12p (losses 5.7p) and the dividend is held
at 3p with a final of 2p.
Fully diluted assets per share rose from 289p to 306p.
Mr Whittaker said that when the property market was approaching its peak in
1989, Peel had taken two steps that recognised the market was overheating.
It desisted from new speculative development and started a property sales
programme. 'Both these decisions were, as events unfolded, extremely well
timed as the failure of so many companies in the last two years has been
caused by the evaporation of cashflow,' said Mr Whittaker.
Net debt at the year end was Pounds 335.1m, giving gearing of 110.7 per
cent, down from 132.7 per cent. The group intends to sell properties to
reduce net debt to about Pounds 310m but, in view of the relative strength
of the retail investment market, a selective sales approach was to be
adopted.
Manchester Ship announced that a professional valuation of its lands near
Ellesmere Port and Warrington, which might be used as dredging deposit
grounds, had given rise to a surplus of Pounds 11.6m over book values. That
would be incorporated into the group's accounts at end-December 1992.
It also said that Cawoods Container Services, which currently operated at
the Ellesmere Port container terminal, had given notice of its wish to
withdraw.
Manchester Ship received net income of Pounds 640,000 from this operation in
1991. Negotiations for the early termination of the agreement had resulted
in exceptional net income of Pounds 2.43m being included in the group's
revenue account for the 1992 first quarter.
This had the effect of increasing shareholders' funds at March 31 to Pounds
153.9m, against Pounds 137.3m at end-December.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Strong second half boosts GUS - Cautious
outlook despite improved all-round performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT UNIVERSAL Stores, the mail order, financial services and property
company, yesterday beat market expectations with a 4.7 per cent profit
increase after a strong second half.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 438.6m to Pounds 459.2m in the year to
March 31 on turnover ahead 2.9 per cent at Pounds 2.6bn.
After stripping out gains from property trading of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds
12.2m) and exceptional items of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 7.3m), operating profits
increased by 5.3 per cent to Pounds 441.5m.
Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman, said all divisions performed well though
the company remained cautious about the economic outlook. 'Things are a
little better,' he said.
Second half profits of Pounds 272.6m compared to the interim figure of
Pounds 186.6m, when turnover was almost unchanged at Pounds 1.17bn.
Home shopping, which includes the Great Universal and Kays mail order
businesses in the UK, increased trading profits by 5.7 per cent to Pounds
195.5m, helped by cost cutting.
Burberrys recovered from a weak first half to lift profits 11 per cent to
Pounds 32.3m, helped by licensing income in Japan and the US.
Overseas retailing improved by 41 per cent due to a strong performance in
South Africa and a small profit, compared to a loss, in Canada.
The financial division saw profits fall slightly from Pounds 140.8m to
Pounds 139.3m. This included investment income, which the company did not
reveal, on its cash and bank balances which increased from Pounds 474m to
'about Pounds 590m', Mr Pugh said.
Property rentals on the company's 1,200 sites increased by 5.2 per cent to
Pounds 62.2m. Property investments were revalued at only 2 per cent below
last year's figure.
Earnings increased by 3.38p to 125.1p.
An improved final dividend of 27.25p is proposed, to make a total of 40p
(37.5p).
COMMENT
Yesterday's 43p rise to Pounds 14.48 in the A shares is fair reward for good
results. But it also reflects the market's renewed, and presumably fickle,
enthusiasm for defensive stocks. GUS supporters pointed to
lower-than-expected property revaluations and the trading statement that the
first two months are ahead of last time. But the 2 per cent mark down
follows a 15 per cent devaluation last year, and one wily analyst pointed
out that GUS usually comments on the first three months of trading. Perhaps
June was not so good. Profit forecasts of Pounds 460m 'clean' put the shares
just shy of 12 times, suggesting further headway from here may be hard work.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Proudfoot shares fall further amid trading
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Alexander Proudfoot, the management consultant, tumbled again
yesterday in the face of continuing nervousness about its trading outlook.
The shares lost 22p to 172p and have now fallen by more than 50 per cent
since the annual meeting at the end of May.
At the meeting, Proudfoot released a gloomier than expected trading
statement. Invesco MIM, Proudfoot's former majority shareholder, also sold
its remaining stake. Lord Stevens is chairman of Invesco and Proudfoot.
However, the slide seemed to be halted by news yesterday that Proudfoot had
bought back 100,000 shares in the market. Two directors also made small
purchases.
Yesterday's fall, as with that on Wednesday, was prompted by a large block
of shares changing hands below market value - 600,000 sold at 150p - sending
the price just below that level before it recovered.
Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, has continued a series of meetings with
institutional shareholders. Institutions are happy the company is
financially sound, with net cash of more than Pounds 20m; but they are
concerned that Proudfoot did not report earlier that trading was likely to
deteriorate.
'The market is in the mood to let its imagination run riot,' one
institutional shareholder said. He said the sudden departure earlier this
week of chief executive Mr Thomas Huhn was not a cause for concern, but the
timing had been unfortunate.
Proudfoot has bought back nearly 2m shares since the annual meeting, leaving
just over 61m in issue.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington shares drop 11p on fears of
gloomy statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Pilkington, the glass group, fell 11p to 96p yesterday, following
a 6p fall on Wednesday, as stockbrokers anticipated a gloomy statement from
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, at next week's annual meeting.
One said: 'We are looking for a grim statement, life is extremely tough for
Pilkington.' The group cut its dividend in June when it reported profits of
Pounds 77m for the year to end-March, after exceptional costs of Pounds 37m,
down from Pounds 151.6m the previous year. Even so the company had to draw
on reserves to pay the dividend.
The shares have not been this low since the end of 1985, before BTR, the
industrial company, bid for the group in 1986 at a price equivalent to
180.6p. Pilkington's shares have fallen from a peak this year of 164p in May
when the stock market was enthusiastic about prospects for economic recovery
after the Conservative election victory in April.
A number of analysts have downgraded forecasts for the company's
current-year results. Yesterday Kleinwort Benson was reported to have cut
its forecast of pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993 to Pounds 50m.
Other brokers said this forecast had not been sanctioned by the company.
Other estimates are in the Pounds 60m-Pounds 70m range.
When the company reported annual profits in June, Sir Antony said he could
not see any sign of an end to the recession. Pilkington's main customers are
the building and automotive industries, both badly hit in the recession.

<TEXT>
QUALITY CARE Homes, a north-east England-based company which owns and
operates nursing homes for the elderly, yesterday placed 3.6m shares at 136p
raising Pounds 4.05m.
Most of the shares were taken up by institutions.
The company, until now entirely owned by founder and managing director Mr
Duncan Bannatyne and his family, has applied to join the main market.
Dealings are due to start on Thursday.
The placing comprises 27.2 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital and
gives the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 18m.
It is forecasting pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 1.75m in the year
to end-October. In the first six months turnover was Pounds 2.77m, against
Pounds 3.32m in the full year to end-October 1991.
The company has expanded rapidly since opening its first nursing home at
Darlington in 1987.
It has 11 freehold nursing homes providing 540 beds. It aims to have 20
homes, with 1,000 beds, by the end of 1994.
Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said the group generated quite strong cash
flow but saw the proceeds of the share sale as a means of financing capital
expenditure on new homes.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Royal Mint exceeds targets with Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Mint exceeded sales and profits targets for the 1991-92 year
despite recession and strong competition in overseas markets.
Mr Anthony Garrett, chief executive, said in the Mint's annual report that
it was 'a highly satisfactory year' given the depressed economic conditions,
but because of low demand for coins in the UK, sales dipped from the
previous year's record Pounds 108.3m to Pounds 83m, while operating profits
were down from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 11m.
However, he regarded a return on sales of 13.3 per cent and a real return on
current cost assets of 20 per cent as creditable in the circumstances.
The Treasury received a dividend of Pounds 10m, compared with a record
Pounds 14m the previous year.
Exports of circulating and collector coins to 58 countries amounted to
Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 58.9m) included the first exports to eastern Europe
since the 1930s.

FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chequers asks for suspension of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Chequers Group, the renovation contractor, were suspended at 4p
yesterday at the company's request pending clarification of its financial
position.
Chequers, formerly known as Dean &amp; Bowes Group, warned in May that its
financial and trading position had materially worsened and it was only able
to keep trading with the support of its bankers, Barclays.
The group also announced yesterday that it had begun legal proceeding
against Mr Stephen Dean, its former chairman and chief executive, who
resigned in February.
Mr Philip Sims, who took over as chairman and chief executive, said one writ
referred to a compensation payment of Pounds 200,000 made to Mr Dean which
did not receive shareholders' authorisation.
Another writ referred to Mr Dean's failure to complete the acquisition of a
loss-making subsidiary of Chequers, Platonoff Harris, the small Cambridge
joinery business.
Mr Dean said last night he had not yet received any writs, but they would be
strenuously defended. He added: 'I strongly deny there is any basis for a
claim against me.'
He said his compensation payment had been approved by the board, which was
advised by the company's lawyers that it did not need shareholders'
approval. In any case, all shareholders had been informed about it in a
subsequent circular.
The acquisition of Platonoff Harris, he explained, had not been completed on
the advice of his lawyers, following a change in information regarding the
business.
Mr Sims said he was involved in talks with other parties which might lead to
an offer being made for all or part of Chequers. At its suspension price,
the group had a market value of Pounds 800,000.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Board faces tough questions: MGN shareholders claim 'buckets
of whitewash' were thrown over directors' roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Mirror Group Newspapers was yesterday accused of trying to
whitewash the Robert Maxwell affair and of being tainted in the public eye.
The accusations were made at the first annual meeting of MGN since last
year's flotation. The meeting was held against a background of overall
losses of nearly Pounds 500m and what was described as probably the largest
fraud this century.
The claim that 'buckets of whitewash ' had been thrown over the role of the
MGN board came from Mr Joseph Grizzard, a shareholder and former MGN
director in the pre-Maxwell days. He said the board had made it all look
like an unfortunate accident which had been beyond the control of all the
directors.
Mr Trevor Davis, a Daily Mirror journalist, warned that the members of the
board would continue to be hounded by questions about what they knew. 'In
the public eye they are tainted and they should go,' he said. But in spite
of tough questions - more than 80 per cent from employee shareholders - the
three-hour meeting was generally low-key. Card votes were forced on
accepting the financial accounts and reappointing Mr Roger Eastoe and Mr
Bernard Tominey as directors but the outcome was never in doubt. The lowest
vote in favour was 99.72 per cent of votes cast.
The board was supported by Mr John Talbot, administrator to the private
Maxwell companies, who holds 54 per cent of MGN and most of the proxy votes.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman, said: 'You may as shareholders hang whom you
like but the group still has to be managed and run.'
He also admitted the board had been advised that there could be claims
against the company because of circumstances surrounding the flotation and
subsequent events. 'If such claims were successfully established, the
company might have claims against certain of its professional advisers,' Sir
Robert said.
Sir Robert said he expected the shares, suspended at 125p since December,
would be relisted today. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel,
said the share price could fall today to 50p-55p.
Sir Robert confirmed that Mr Alan Stephens, the company secretary, and Mr
Robert Gregory, director of human resources, were subject to internal
disciplinary proceedings although no illegality was alleged.
Mr Rupert Allason, the Conservative MP for Torbay who said he was the last
man to receive a writ from Robert Maxwell, said the board should resign.
'How are cronies of Robert Maxwell still on the board? It is an insult to
see them there,' he said to cheers.
But Sir Robert emphasised that the board had exposed in the frankest way
possible the effects of the frauds and what had been done to give MGN a good
future. 'We have told the story warts and all. We must now build on what we
have,' he said.

FT  17 JUL 92 / High returns from a steep slope: Rich pickings from the US
yield curve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Europe is nervously eyeing the higher German discount rate, US
financiers are rejoicing in exceptionally low short-term interest rates.
Since US long-term rates remain high, the 'yield curve' which plots the
pattern of interest rates is the steepest in living memory - and it is
proving a godsend to financial institutions and others with the capital to
exploit it.
The yield curve, a graphical depiction of interest rates on securities with
varying maturities, has steepened sharply in the past year for two reasons -
concern about the massive US budget deficit, and fear that the Federal
Reserve's easing of monetary policy might revive inflationary pressures in
the economy.
Consequently, Treasury investors have been reluctant to push long-term
yields down as far or as fast as short-term returns. The market believes the
Fed has dropped its inflation guard, and has decided to do the Fed's job of
damping inflationary pressures with relatively high long-term rates. Mr
Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities in New York, says: 'The
market has its foot on the brake harder than the Fed has its foot on the
accelerator.'
By keeping its foot on the brake, the market has held the yield on the
30-year bond at 7.7 per cent, while the Fed's accelerator has pushed the
yield on three-month Treasury bills down to 3.3 per cent. The spread between
the two of 440 basis points is unprecedented. The previous record spread was
200 basis points in late 1976 and early 1977.
While the stubbornly steep yield curve has annoyed the Fed, which wants
lower rates at both ends of the market to stimulate economic activity,
financial institutions have rushed to take advantage of the wide spread
between short and long rates.
Commercial banks have been keen manipulators of the steep yield curve, as
shown by their active buying in the past year of longer-dated Treasury
securities.
Banks have borrowed in the short-term Fed funds market, where rates on
interbank loans range from below 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, to pay for
three-year to seven-year Treasury notes that yield between 4.7 per cent and
6.3 per cent. Wall Street's securities houses have also reaped the rewards
of lower funding costs. Like banks, they have been borrowing short to buy
long.
One chief financial officer (CFO) at a big Wall Street bond house agrees the
best way to exploit the steep yield curve is to fund short. 'You buy
one-year US government securities and fund them overnight in the repo
(repurchase) market, using the government securities as collateral,' he
says, thereby exploiting the 200 basis-point spread between the rate on the
one-year notes and on the overnight loans.
The CFO says the yield curve is so steep that 'it's desirable to fund short
regardless of maturity'. The risk of doing so, of course, is that short-term
interest rates could climb sharply over the next year and wipe out the extra
yield available on the longer-dated asset. That, however, is unlikely in the
current economic and political climate.
Few expect interest rates to go up for at least six to 10 months. 'It's as
close to being without risk as you can get', says the Wall Street CFO.
Institutional investors have also been able to take advantage of the steep
yield curve, although rather than raising interest rate risk by switching
between the bottom and the top of the curve, investors have concentrated on
the smaller, but still profitable, spreads between securities closer
together on the yield curve.
Mr Michael Gray, fixed-income portfolio manager at Fidelity, the biggest US
investment fund group, says it makes sense to switch into longer-dated paper
if you think short-term interest rates will continue to decline. He says:
'You can extend your duration modestly, but not increase the risk because of
the steepness of the yield curve.'
Fidelity's quantitative research department has calculated the financial
impact of a Treasury fund switching out of 6-month bills (yielding 3.32 per
cent) into two-year notes (yielding 4.23 per cent) for six months. Instead
of earning a 1.65 per return on the bills, the fund would enjoy a 2.75 per
cent return, a 110 basis points difference. For a Dollars 100m fund, that
would bring in an extra Dollars 1.1m.
Moreover, the additional risk taken on by moving up the yield curve is not
particularly great, calculates Fidelity. The fund would only lose out if
interest rates rose 85 basis points during the period.
Economists believe the steep yield curve is here for some time. Mr Steve
Slifer, chief bond economist at Shearson Lehman, says the curve will not
flatten until the market is convinced that the Fed has stopped easing.
Such a shift in sentiment will not happen until the economic recovery has
built up a clear head of steam, which means the yield curve will probably
continue to look more like a mountain incline and less like a hilly slope
well into next year.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Wellcome Trust in share reinvestment offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, is offering to buy a range of shares in
other companies from institutional investors who apply for the shares in
Wellcome, the drugs group, that the Trust is selling. The Trust said
yesterday it would reinvest at least Pounds 500m (Dollars 955m) of the
proceeds of the Pounds 3bn sale of Wellcome shares in an index fund.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, the stockbroker, is offering a special
dealing facility to institutional investors, in the UK or elsewhere, wishing
to sell UK shares which could go into the Trust's index fund.
BZW Securities will pay cash for the shares offered to it, at prices
prevailing when the temder offer of Wellcome shares closes. However,
institutions applying for Wellcome shares are likely to have priority in
selling to BZW Securities up to the level of their allocation of Wellcome
stock.
The news pleased the stock market anticipating the reinvestment of the cash
proceeds of the Wellcome share sale. The market reversed an early fall after
the Wellcome announcement, but dropped when German interest rates were
increased. Wellcome shares closed at 877p, down 1p.
The Trust is aiming to sell 330m shares in Wellcome, reducing its stake from
73.5 per cent to 38 per cent, raising about Pounds 3bn from the sale. This
will be reinvested to give a more diversified portfolio with a higher
income.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Trust, said yesterday he was 'encouraged by
the indicated demand to date' for the Wellcome shares on offer.
An international tender which opened on July 6 is expected to close next
Friday, after which a strike price will be fixed. Estimates suggest that
bids made so far amount to around two-thirds.
The Trust's concern is over the difficulty of reinvesting Pounds 3bn in the
stock market without incurring large costs, or seeing the stock market move
against it.
By buying shares from institutions to put in the index fund the Trust will
be reinvesting some of the money immediately. Settlement for the sale to BZW
Securities and the Wellcome tender will be the same day.
Mr Simon de Zoete of BZW Securities, said the offer would 'create a
cost-effective mechanism for the Trust to reinvest its money. As a
by-product it will create liquidity for people who may or may not wish to
apply for Wellcome shares'.
The Trust has appointed BZW Investment Management to run the indexed portion
of its investments. BZWIM manages Pounds 11bn of indexed funds. The Trust
has appointed J. Henry Schroder Wagg to advise it on the selection of
investment managers.
The Trust, with the help of JHSW, is drawing up a shortlist of fund managers
for a 'beauty parade' in October, and is likely to appoint five or six
managers. The Trust's four existing investment managers - Morgan Grenfell,
James Capel, Henderson Administration and Fleming - will be on the
shortlist.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: Bankruptcy facing BCCI customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms PAMELA PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While efforts are being made on behalf of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International shareholders to mitigate their losses, there are many like
myself who personally guaranteed their company overdrafts and are now being
pursued by the BCCI liquidator, Touche Ross, with personal bankruptcy and
loss of our homes.
I ran my company on a professional basis and within the terms of our loans.
In our particular circumstances we had a negligence case against BCCI, but
owing to the bank's demise we are unable to pursue it.
Through our professional advisers, we have submitted to Touche Ross our
sworn statements of affairs which are evidence of our means. While these are
less that the total indebtedness, they do reflect the true situation. The
response from Touche Ross, however, is no negotiation and a demand for full
and immediate repayment within seven days or it will pursue for repossession
of our home and place us in personal bankruptcy.
If Touche Ross proceeds with personal bankruptcy petitions and repossession
of our home, it will achieve less than the offer on the table. Where is the
logic? Where is the moral code? Our professional advisers are appalled by
Touche Ross's stance.
I do not believe that Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi would support such an
approach, nor do I believe those who are in a position of influence in the
UK will allow such actions to continue.

Sir, Michael Dixon's article on executive recruitment (July 15) questioned
what the thousands thrown out of work, mostly through no fault of their own,
are doing. Judging by the experiences of a former colleague they are the
recipients of countless standard rejection letters having an instantly
recognisable format.
The receipt of so many similar letters has prompted us to compose a standard
letter of application, so far not seen in the text books, but designed to
save a great deal of time and trouble, expectation and disappointment in the
present climate.
'Dear Sir or Madam

In order to save you the bother of writing to inform me that there were a
number of candidates whose qualifications and experience more closely met
your client's requirements and that my application was not successful, I
have definitely decided not to apply for the above advertised position.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: Still a place in the market for credit card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your suggestion that credit cards are likely to be replaced by debit
cards (FT Survey of credit and charge cards, July 15) is not borne out by
the facts.
The UK credit card market is clearly a mature market and unlikely to repeat
the high rates of growth seen in the 1980s. Nevertheless, the use of credit
cards continues to grow. While the introduction of annual fees by most
issuers has reduced the number of cards in issue, there is no evidence that
it has reduced the number of card-holders. The value of payments made by
credit card was Pounds 12.67bn in the first five months of 1992, 7 per cent
higher than in the same period in 1991.
In comparison, the debit card market is a growth market. The value of debit
card payments almost doubled between 1990 and 1991. However, it still has a
long way to go before it catches up with the credit card market. The amount
spent on credit cards was three times the amount spent on debit cards last
year.
Most consumers see debit cards as a replacement for cheques and cash and
complementary to credit cards, this being reflected in different patterns of
spending. The average credit card spend is Pounds 45 compared with Pounds 27
on a debit card. Elizabeth Phillips,
director,
Credit Card Research Group,

FT  17 JUL 92 / Reliable Scot resists hammer horror tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A deceptively simple choice will lie before Mr John Smith when he becomes
leader of the Labour party by acclamation tomorrow afternoon. Will he oppose
the government, or will he support it? Silly question, you might say. The
task of the leader of the opposition is to oppose. Yes, but there is
opposition and opposition. There is skirmishing on the periphery of what the
administration is doing and there is an att-empt to bring the entire
ed-ifice crashing down in a single act of wild and glorious destructiveness.
The temptation to have a go is strongly felt in some sections of the Labour
party. If he were to succumb Mr Smith would need to pick up only one weapon,
a sledgehammer labelled 'leave the exchange rate mechanism'. With that
fearsome object held high above his head he might stand a chance of
transforming himself from a plain Edinburgh brief into the Arnold
Schwarzenegger of British politics. 'Withdraw]', he could snarl. 'Devalue -
and end the recession.' In one or two swift but irresponsible phrases he
could thus attack the foundations of the government's strategy for the
management of the British polity over the next five to 10 years. A tacit
alliance between the anti-Europeans on the Conservative back-benches and the
principal opposition party might be unholy, but it would certainly frighten
Mr John Major.
The prime minister can relax. It would be contrary to what is known of Mr
Smith's character for him to do any such thing. Before the election, when he
was shadow chancellor, he was wont to remark that his determination not to
devalue if Labour came to power was for him a matter of honour. His
commitment to the principal proposition put forward by Mr Major - that
Britain should be at the heart of European affairs - is absolute. The prime
minister and the chancellor have pledged the most valuable assets they
possess, their reputations, to the maintenance of Britain's position within
the ERM at existing parities. This undertaking is closely bound up with
their public support of the Maastricht agreement. It is a government package
deal. If Mr Smith remains true to himself, it will enjoy the broad support
of the opposition
There is, however, a disputed ingredient. The prime minister appears to be
willing to sit out a recession for as long as it takes to approach zero
inflation. Mr Norman Lamont warned Conservatives of this on Wednesday. Take
his warning seriously. He did not waver from his anti-inflationary
hawkishness last year, when the election lay in the future. There is no
reason to believe that he will be budged now, when the electorate need not
be troubled for another four or five years. The implications of this are
beginning to be understood as people awaken from the shock of discovering
that the post-election stock exchange bubble has burst. Bottom lines
continue to sink. Businesses continue to go bankrupt. Jobs remain difficult
to get. Although the rate of increase in unemployment slowed last month, the
total is still rising. Mr Major and Mr Lamont sit, arms folded, watching
inflation fall.
Mr Smith can hardly be seen to be conniving in a policy that says nothing
about bringing unemployment down in double-quick time. No Labour leader
could do that. He has therefore prepared an escape hatch. This is to argue,
as he did when addressing Labour members of the European parliament in
Strasbourg last month, that the ERM is 'a fixed, but adjustable, system'
which does not preclude 'the possibility of a general realignment'. He
appeared to favour an EC-led German revaluation, as does Mr Neil Kinnock, on
the grounds that Bonn's reunification costs should not fall as a monetary
surcharge on the rest of Europe. The payoff for a higher D-Mark, he
believes, could be a general reduction in interest rates, and a reversal of
the present deflationary bias of the ERM.
The new Labour leader is aware that France is implacably opposed to this
line, but he can reasonably hope that Paris will be more amenable after the
Maastricht referendum in September. He may then float the notion that
general realignment (ie a German revaluation) can be sold to the French as a
part of the post-Maastricht convergence process and therefore as a step on
the way to economic and monetary union. If the pieces fall into place he
will be in a position to attack the government fairly vociferously in the
autumn.
Mr Lamont has already made a pre-emptive strike. Last Friday he said of a
German realignment: 'No country in the ERM is looking in that direction. The
issue is simply not on the agenda.' The reason was pure Lamont: 'The shock
we are facing is not that of German reunification - it is the shock of
trying to get an inflation rate comparable to that of Germany. Our other
European partners recognise this.'
I will not attempt to choose between Mr Lamont's economics and Mr Smith's.
Economists in general are gradually being unmasked as doctors were before
them: their reputations are built on what they get right, but they really
know very little about what determines many of the key variables upon which
they are so quick to pronounce.
In political terms, there is the world of difference between supporting
membership of the ERM while calling for a realignment and demanding a
unilateral British devaluation within the ERM. The first is what a
responsible, nay respectable, opposition leader would choose. It nicely
bridges the gap between Labour's pro- and anti-Europeans, thus confirming Mr
Smith's reputation as a man who can be relied upon to find the centre of
gravity of his party and place himself there. The second might smash the
government, but it would risk Mr Smith's reputation as the essence of
reliability and leave Labour open to the charge that it had changed its mind
again.
None of this tells us anything about Labour's long-term prospects, which
will doubtless be extensively analysed after tomorrow's leadership election
ceremonies are over. The truth is that nobody can say where British politics
will stand in 1996 or 1997. Mr Smith may succeed in seducing Mr Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats over to Labour, or the two parties may conclude
a pact, or they may continue to battle against one another and thus deny
both of them the fruits of office. Or Mr Major and Mr Lamont may fail, and
fall. Who can tell? With Mr Major's government still increasing in
popularity, the matter seems of little moment.
What does matter is that a credible Labour opposition will confront the
government when parliament returns from its lengthy summer break in
mid-October. It could launch a strong verbal onslaught on the Conservatives,
whose majority is only 21. Mr Smith may not be ruthless or reckless enough
to attempt to frustrate the government, but he should be able to get a few
laughs in the Commons and perhaps influence public opinion. Her Majesty's
Loyal Opposition will be back in business.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Leading Article: From fraud to farce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COURT of Appeal's decision yesterday to clear the four corporate
financiers who were convicted for lying about the outcome of the Blue Arrow
rights issue in 1987 can only be construed as a serious blow to the
credibility of Britain's system of criminal justice in its handling of
wrongdoing in the City. That much is clear, even before the detailed
explanation of the Appeal Court's reasoning emerges in public. In the wake
of the hopelessly unsatisfactory outcome of the Guinness trials and a whole
series of setbacks for the Serious Fraud Office, it is legitimate to ask
whether such farcical proceedings should not be dispensed with. At the very
least, some radical reconsideration of the way the law applies to the City
is called for.
For all its many merits, the 1986 Roskill Committee report tended to divert
the argument about fraud trials on to the question of jury competence in
technical financial matters. Yet the Blue Arrow defendants' case in the
Appeal Court was directed more at the competence of the judge and
prosecuting counsel. In essence, it asserted that the trial was unfair
because of the weight and complexity of the case that the prosecution chose
to put before the jury, and because the judge had instructed the jurors to
ignore 75 per cent of the evidence they had heard - this, incidentally, in
the course of one of the longest and most expensive trials in history.
Better ways
It was not, admittedly, reassuring that the jury's verdict in the Blue Arrow
trial appeared to fly in the face of the summing up of Mr Justice McKinnon.
But nor does it follow from this that the jury failed to grasp the issues.
In the final analysis, all fraud trials require the jury to make a judgment
about whether people are telling the truth. There may be better ways of
eliciting the truth than those that prevail in British courts; but there are
good grounds for thinking that Roskill's proposal to hand the job to a
judge, supported by expert lay assessors, would be worse.
The most likely people to fill the role of expert assessors would be
lawyers, accountants and City practitioners of one kind or another. They
would be less than human if they did not identify more closely with City
people in the dock than a jury would be inclined to do. They might well
weigh, consciously or subconsciously, the implications of convicting a City
figure for their wider business interests. The Roskill solution would simply
be a retreat back towards the club ethic under a legal guise.
Obvious victims
The more fundamental question concerns the appropriateness of criminal
proceedings in dealing with the City's particular forms of white-collar
crime. Clearly where there are obvious victims, as in the case of the
Maxwell pensioners, jury trial is the correct answer. In less clear-cut
cases it has been suggested that civil rather than criminal proceedings
might be more appropriate. Yet civil remedies inevitably raise difficulties
where, as in insider dealing scandals, the losses may be difficult to
establish. So, too, in cases where markets have been rigged, although it is
not always impossible: injured parties have successfully sought redress over
Guinness's takeover of Distillers and the Blue Arrow rights issue.
The more important question is whether crimes in which there are no
immediate victims with quantifiable losses merit a jail sentence at all. The
chief damage at Guinness and Blue Arrow, apart from the financial losses for
which people successfully sought redress through civil proceedings, was
potentially to the employers of the individuals who stood in the dock and to
the integrity of London markets. There is room for debate whether heavy
fines and disqualification procedures which deprive wrongdoers of their
former livelihoods may not be sufficient deterrent against such activity.
Either way, effective justice is most unlikely to emerge from trials that
take place years after the event and in which the charges are both excessive
and absurdly complex. Speed must be the essence of whatever system is put in
the place of the absurdly expensive and arbitrary circus that now dictates
the fate of those involved in City and business scandals. The government
should put the job in hand.

ONCE again we arrive at The First Night Of The Proms. The 98th season begins
with a live relay from the Albert Hall (7.30 Radio 3 and BBC2) of Verdi's
Requiem. Andrew Davis conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Singers,
the London Symphony Chorus and the BBC Symphony Chorus, and an international
band of soloists led by Susan Dunn.
It looks like Mavis Nicholson benefit night, and why not? Channel 4 begins
evening repeats of her daytime programmes. In With Mavis (8.30) starts with
an interview about Alzheimer's disease. Then at 10.00 the estimable
Nicholson presents the 2-hour Radio 2 Arts Programme which features Meredith
Edwards talking about his career in films.
It looks as though Nick Utechin, the new producer of Any Questions, is doing
the business: at the time of writing, his panel contains not a single MP,
which is what listeners so often plead for (8.05 Radio 4). BBC2 repeats Alan
Bennett's award-winning drama A Question Of Attribution, featuring Anthony
Blunt and the Queen, played by Prunella Scales.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: Le Chevalier d'Almedo - Avignon Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year's Avignon Festival opened with the Papal Palace looking like a
field of wheat ready to be harvested. Surely, I thought, they cannot be
reviving Oklahoma in the Cour d'Honneur?
No, not quite - massed ears of golden corn waving in the breeze are what
Llouis Pasquale sees as an appropriate setting for a revival of Lope de
Vega's play about two unfortunate well-born young lovers called Le Chevalier
d'Almedo.
Pasquale grew up in a small Spanish village in Catalonia where his father
was the baker. Filial piety may therefore have influenced the choice of this
background, sumptuously implemented by designer Ezio Frigerio. At first
glance, it is an odd setting for a tale where all the intrigue takes place
inside Don Pedro's house.
But in the event, the Van Gogh-like field of corn gives the play a much
needed earthiness, compensating for its total reliance on the artificial
Spanish 16th century codes of honour that governed the behaviour of the
principals.
Although the villain is called Don Rodrigo, we are a long way here from the
rhetoric of Corneille's Le Cid. Lopez's characters - Spanish nobility and
their servants - do not indulge in those long outpourings beloved of their
French counterparts. Although they speak their thoughts aloud in verse, they
do so with simple-minded directness. The new French translation by the poet
Zeno Bianu captures well this basic verse-dialogue. The characters act more
than they talk, impulsively as the blood dictates, and the action moves
rapidly forward.
Four magnificent horses are the other great feature of the production. The
hero Don Alonso appears at the start astride one of them, declares his
infatuation with Dona Ines and canters off, only to return on foot to
discuss with his servant how he may win her. By her father's design, she is
already betrothed to Don Rodrigo. The hero then finds, wandering through the
fields, one of those old women who for a small fee are prepared to pass
messages between lovers, personages without whom Spanish drama of this
period could surely hardly exist.
By a quirk of casting, the lively Fabia of Evelyne Istria is in this
production of the same generation as the Dona Ines of Isabelle Candelier,
matching her wilful innocence with the corrupt wisdom of experience. Soon
she has wormed her way inside the house, surreptitiously passing on a billet
doux from Don Alonso, and the creaking mechanism begins to unwind.
The old woman and her confederate, Tello, Alonsos's valet (Jean-Michel
Dupuis) attack their roles with vigour. At one point they are disguised in
clerical garb and spout Latin as the heroine purports to take the veil.
Their solid vulgar presences tend to eclipse those of the ethereal lovers.
Alonso is played by Jean-Marc Barr, the Franco-American actor who appeared
with Vanessa Redgrave in Orpheus Descending.
The star of the evening is undoubtedly the production. Pasqual weaves the
stagey events of the piece - a multiple duel, a ghostly haunting, a
conversation through a grille, a bullfight offstage, a royal visitation -
into a visually satisfying rural tapestry. Luckily Pasqual believes in the
fatality of the play and communicates that belief uninhibitedly.
Le Chevalier d'Almedo opened at the Papal Palace in Avignon and will be
performed at the Odeon-Theatre de l'Europe in Paris from November 5.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Technology: Olympic chips go for the gold - The race to
build mega-memory devices and asks what advantages they will bring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international team of some 200 semiconductor engineers is gathering in
East Fishkill, about 70 miles north of New York, to begin one of the most
ambitious projects in the history of the chip industry.
This elite group, drawn from the ranks of International Business Machines,
Toshiba and Siemens, is to develop a 256 Mbit dynamic random access memory
(D-Ram) - a data storage device for use in 21st century computers.
The 256 Mbit memory chip is the next grand challenge of semiconductor
engineering. It represents a 16-fold increase in the storage capacity of
memory chips and promises to transform computers into talking, thinking,
listening machines that are different from anything that has gone before.
First, however, several critical technology hurdles must be overcome at an
expected cost of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). Hence the decision announced
earlier this week by IBM, Toshiba and Siemens to share their expertise and
divide the huge costs and very significant technological risks of this
project.
The costs will be 'generally shared' among the three partners, said Jack
Kuehler, president of IBM. But there is far more than money at stake. For
each of the participants, success is critical to their ability to remain
leaders in the global electronics market.
'Time to market is the key issue,' explains Kuehler. These champions of the
chip industry have entered a race against world-class competitors from the
US, Japan and Korea. And the company that brings 256 Mbit D-Ram technology
to market first stands to reap huge rewards.
This semiconductor 'Olympics' will test technological strength and financial
staying power, with only the best in the world qualifying. The chipmakers
are 'going for the gold', but if today's dismal D-Ram market is any
indication, they cannot be sure of winning many profits from the sale of
this future generation of memory chips. Currently, D-Ram prices are slumping
and supply is outstripping demand.
Why then pursue the 256 Mbit goal? The big payback may not come until long
after this race is run. Like Olympic champions who are showered with
lucrative commercial endorsements after the games, the winners of the 256
Mbit event hope to create technology that will reap long-term benefits.
The D-Ram is a 'technology driver'; a proving ground for new generations of
semiconductor production technology. The semiconductor structures,
production tools and processes needed to cram 256m memory cells on to a
silicon chip will go a long way towards enabling the development of logic
chips, such as microprocessors, that are vastly more powerful than today's
most advanced devices.
'Today we have the capacity to build chips with 2m or 3m circuits. What we
are aiming for is a chip with more than 256m transistors,' says Michael
Attardo, IBM vice president and general manager of technology products.
These 'megachips' will combine logic and memory functions on a single chip,
he predicts. 'We are talking about a mainframe computer on a single chip; a
single chip solution.'
If a pocket-sized IBM mainframe does not sound appealing, think again.
Megachips will make computers 'much, much more friendly,' Attardo maintains.
The 256 Mbit technology will 'overcome the barriers to enable computers to
pervade the masses'.
Can shrinking semiconductor circuits really change the world? History
provides some powerful examples of the impact of chip technology
breakthroughs. The 64 Kbit (64,000 memory cells) D-Ram, along with early
microprocessor devices, spawned the personal computer.
Today's 4 Mbit and 16 Mbit memory chips, together with 16 bit
microprocessors, provide the power for notebook-sized computers. Less
well-recognised are the contributions of semiconductor technology in other
types of 'hidden' applications; inside cars, domestic appliances, medical
instrumentation, factory robots, telecommunications equipment and a myriad
of consumer electronics products.
By shrinking semiconductor circuits to less than half of their current size,
chip makers will be able to make a quantum leap forward in the level of
computing power that will fit into a matchbox.
The initial impact, however, will inevitably be in the computer field.
Higher capacity D-Rams will enable low-cost computers to handle more
sophisticated software, the coded instructions that control electronic
'brains'. Complex tasks such as speech recognition and electronic vision
which currently require high-priced computer power, and even then frequently
fail to live up to expectations, could become an everyday reality.
Thus the 'personal computer' of the future will probably speak and be spoken
to. The familiar computer keyboard may become an anachronism; something that
you might choose to use when composing a written communication, but
certainly not the primary man-machine interface.
Yet several technological barriers still stand in the way. The most
challenging is to shrink semiconductor circuit elements. The 'line width',
the critical dimension of micro-miniature circuit patterns on a chip, must
come down to 0.25 microns ( a micron is a millionth of a metre), or about
1/300th the thickness of a human hair.
Today's most advanced optical lithography systems, in which circuit patterns
are imprinted on silicon using a photographic-like process, are capable of
getting down to line widths of about half a micron.
Until recently, many semiconductor researchers, including those at IBM,
thought that it would be necessary to switch from optical lithography to
X-ray lithography to create the minute circuit elements of a 256 Mbit D-Ram,
greatly increasing the cost of manufacturing.
The latest research suggests, however, that it may be possible to fabricate
all but a few critical levels of the chip's structure using highly refined
optical methods. This is what the IBM-Toshiba-Siemens team aims to do.
Another crucial issue will be to ensure the intrinsic reliability of the
semiconductor device as the size of individual transistors shrinks to the
thickness of a few atoms.
The physical and electrical properties of such finely carved materials have
been explored in laboratories but never before tested in a commercial
product. There is also the challenge of avoiding defects. Although today's
most advanced semiconductor plants are far cleaner than any surgical
operating room, the chip plants of the future will have to be 100 per cent
cleaner.
This will probably mean isolating equipment from human contact, which will
require higher levels of automation. IBM believes that it will take four to
five years to overcome these challenges and to develop a 'production ready'
256 Mbit D-Ram.
Only then will decisions be made about where and by whom the new generation
of chips will be put into volume production. Building a plant to manufacture
256 Mbit chips is expected to cost in the region of another Dollars 1bn.
Yet the 256 Mbit D-Ram is not the end of the story. Already, IBM and other
chip makers have begun work in their laboratories on a 1 Gigabit D-Ram, with
four times as much storage capacity again. The relentless pace of
semiconductor technology progress demands that chip makers work on several
generations of devices at once.
Thus, the 16 Mbit D-Ram has only recently gone into full-scale production,
while 64 Mbit D-Rams are in the later stages of development. The 256 Mbit
D-Ram development project has been initiated, yet research on a 1 Gbit chip
is already under way.
The financial and technological risks are enormous. 'To be competitive we
cannot afford to wait until the development of one generation is complete
before starting another,' Kuehler explains. Neither can IBM and its partners
wait until the chip design is complete before constructing a new plant for
the next generation of chips. 'To stay in the race we have to commit to
using certain types of production tools even before we have completed
development,' adds Attardo.
Finding partners to spread the risks has become imperative. The ability to
find the right partners and manage high-risk joint development ventures may
well become the critical skill of the semiconductor industry of the next
century.

<TEXT>
Scientists at PA Consulting Group's Cambridge laboratory have developed a
fast, simple and cheap way of detecting poisons in water.
The method, called MUVS sensor, can tell in less than 15 seconds whether
even a minute quantity of toxic contamination is present.
The MUVS sensor works by shining ultraviolet light on micro-organisms such
as yeast. When the yeast are healthy they block most of the light, but if
they become ill because of exposure to a toxin, they become more
transparent.
All that is needed to measure whether water is contaminated is yeast, a
strong ultraviolet lamp and a light meter. The sensor can detect a wide
range of potentially poisonous materials including toxic metal residues and
PCBs.
'The most immediate application of this sort of technology is in water
monitoring,' said William Bains, who developed the sensor. PA Consulting:

Blueprints used during the building of a plant are notoriously inaccurate
because design changes made during construction are seldom recorded.
This means that when the time comes for maintenance and repairs, or the
addition of new buildings and equipment, it is often necessary to measure
and re-draw the plant and equipment - which is both time-consuming and
costly.
But Blom, a Norwegian company, has developed a software program which
converts photographs of a plant into up-to-date engineering drawings. First
the plant and equipment is marked and systematically photographed.
Then the images are processed and, using the marks as anchor points, an
accurate three-dimensional engineering database is generated. Blom: Norway,

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crispin Davis (right) is a man on the fast track. Having joined Guinness
just two years ago, he has been elevated to the main board at the tender age
of 42, which makes him far and away the youngest executive director of
Britain's fifth biggest company.
Davis is one of those marketing men who learnt their trade at Procter &amp;
Gamble's marketing school. Having joined P&amp;G after Oxford as an assistant
brand manager, he rose rapidly through the ranks and by 1978 was marketing
director of the US consumer product giant's UK operations. During his time
there he was responsible for establishing Ariel washing powder and Pampers
disposable nappies as market leaders.
After a stint in the US, where he rose to be vice-president of the foods
business, he was headhunted to run the European region of Guinness' United
Distillers business. Tony Greener, who recruited him, has gone on to be
Guinness' chief executive and the rapid promotion of Davis, currently
managing director of United Distillers, suggests that he is being groomed as
a possible heir apparent.
Guinness also announced yesterday that Austrian born Helmut Sihler, who
retired as chief executive of Henkel Group last year, has been appointed a
non-executive director. There is a certain irony in this appointment given
that when Crispin Davis was running P&amp;G's German operations his biggest
competitor in detergents was Henkel's Persil.
*****
Steve Bedford, 36, group development director at STOREHOUSE, has been
elevated to the board of the retailing conglomerate. His appointment
reflects the growing influence of David Dworkin, the company's chief
executive, as he builds a board of directors in his own image.
Bedford and Dworkin worked closely at BhS where they wrought a radical
cultural revolution helping to restore the struggling variety chain's pride
and profitability. It is now hoped that the duo can perform a similar trick
on some of Storehouse's other laggardly performers, such as Habitat and
Mothercare.

Lord Howe, Britain's former foreign secretary and deputy prime minister, has

admired of the big US money centre banks.
The council, which is chaired by former US secretary of state George Shultz,
advises Morgan's senior management on matters of international concern and
interest. It meets approximately once every eight months, so it is not going
to require a lot of Lord Howe's time. Even so, there is a certain kudos
attached to membership of the council, whose 23 members range from
ex-Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl to Peugeot's Jacques Calvet. Lee Kuan

council.
Apart from Lord Howe, the only other British member of the council is Sir

FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: No 'aircraft claim' immunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT AIRWAYS CORPORATION v IRAQI AIRWAYS AND ANOTHER Queen's Bench
Division (Commercial Court): April 16 1992
AN OVERSEAS state-owned company, properly served at its UK address with
proceedings for delivery up of civilian aircraft removed from a foreign
airport in a military attack, is not immune from the jurisdiction of English
courts if the aircraft, though removed on government instructions, were to
be put to commercial use.
Mr Justice Evans so held when refusing an application by the first
defendant, Iraqi Airways Co, to set aside judgment obtained against it by
Kuwait Airways Corporation for delivery up of commercial aircraft and
damages. A judgment against the second defendant, the Republic of Iraq, was
set aside on the ground of invalid service of the writ.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2 1990. Kuwait airport
was occupied by Iraqi military forces. At the airport were 15 aircraft owned
by Kuwait Airways. Five were removed by the Iraqi air force.
The remaining 10 were civilian airliners. They were flown to Iraq on August
6-8. There they remained in the custody of Iraqi Airways.
When military attack on Iraq became imminent in January 1991, six of the
aircraft were flown to Iran and interned. The remaining four were destroyed
by raids on Iraq.
The present action was begun by writ issued on January 11 1991. Kuwait
Airways claimed delivery up of the aircraft and damages for unlawful
interference.
Judgment was entered in default of appearance against Iraqi Airways and the
Republic of Iraq. Damages were assessed at Dollars 489.455m. Summonses were
issued in which the defendants claimed extensions of time within which to
give notice of intention to defend, and challenged the validity of service.
Execution was stayed.
Iraqi Airways claimed immunity under section 14 of the State Immunity Act
1978.
It was common ground that Iraqi Airways was a 'separate entity' for the
purposes of section 14(2), which provided that a separate entity was immune
from jurisdiction if the proceedings related to exercise of sovereign
authority and 'the circumstances are such that a state . . . would have been
so immune'.
The scheme of the Act was such that a state had general immunity, except as
provided in Part 1 of the Act which included, by section 3, 'commercial
transactions'.
The government of Iraq had identified the 10 aircraft as required for
civilian operation by Iraqi Airways.
There was no evidence to justify a finding that the purpose was governmental
rather than commercial.
Iraqi Airways was not immune by reason of section 14(2).
Kuwait Airways submitted that Iraqi Airways had lost its immunity by
submitting to the court's jurisdiction under section 2 of the Act.
Section 2(3) provided that a state was deemed to have submitted if it had
taken any step in the proceedings. By subsection (4), that did not apply to
'any step taken for the purpose only of - (a) claiming immunity'.
Kuwait Airways asserted that Iraqi Airways had taken steps beyond those
taken for the purpose 'only' of claiming immunity, because it issued a
summons and applied for stay of execution, and included in its present
application grounds other than state immunity, ie objections to service, and
forum non conveniens.
The applications were in substance objections to exercise of jurisdiction,
and were alt-ernative to the claim for state immunity. The section was not
intended to make it compulsory that the immunity claim could not be heard at
the same time as and in conjunction with other objections to jurisdiction.
The next issue was whether Kuwait Airways's claim was justiciable in English
courts.
Iraq Airways relied on the principle in Buttes Gas (1982) AC that 'the
courts will not adjudicate upon the transactions of foreign sovereign
states'.
The authorities showed that certain issues could not be adjudicated, because
the process of investigation and judgment would take the court into areas
which the law recognised as the proper and sole concern of the government
and of foreign sovereign states.
The submission necessarily failed in proceedings where the court had
jurisdiction under the State Immunity Act because their subject-matter was a
commercial transaction. There was no bar to jurisdiction over issues in
respect of which Iraqi Airways was not entitled to state immunity.
The United Nations had established a compensation commission to consider
claims against Iraq for damage and loss caused by the invasion of Kuwait.
Iraqi Airways submitted that by analogy with the forum non conveniens
principle under-lying Spiliada (1987) 1 AC 460, the court should refuse
jurisdiction in favour of the commission.
The submission failed. There was no suggestion in the Security Council
resolution that it excluded the jurisdiction of municipal courts.
Iraqi Airways relied on Dallal (1986) 1 All ER 239, where Mr Justice
Hobhouse held that the court should recognise the competence of an
arbitration tribunal established by treaty and authorised by municipal law
with regard to nationals.
In the present case, there was no international forum equivalent to an
arbitration panel; there was no relevant municipal law; and there was no
exclusion of municipal law remedies.
The objection to jurisdiction was rejected.
Before August 2 1991, Iraqi Airways carried on business at premises in
Regent Street, London. The manager was transferred to Baghdad in October
1990. When he left, Mr Dinha Isaac, an accountant employed at the office,
was left in charge.
The writ was served on Mr Isaac at the Regent Street premises on January 11
1991.
Section 695 of the Companies Act 1985 provided for service of documents on
an 'oversea company' at the registered address, by leaving them at 'any
place of business established by the company in Great Britain'.
By section 744, 'oversea company' meant '(a) a company incorporated
elsewhere than in Great Britain'. By RSC Order 65 rule 3, personal service
could be effected by service on the 'clerk, secretary, treasurer or other
similar officer'.
Iraqi Airways was established by Law No 108 of September 26 1988. Article
(1) provided that it was a 'state-owned entity having a judicial personality
and operated on profit and loss basis'.
There was no doubt that Iraqi Airways was a 'company' incorporated by
statute in Iraq. Mr Isaac was the 'acting manager' of its business at the
Regent Street premises. Service was effective.
Ex parte leave to serve concurrent writs on the Republic was granted on
January 11 1992.
Service was to be effected in accordance with section 12(1) of the State
Immunity Act 1978 and RSC Order 11 Rule 7.
Section 12(1) required that a writ should be served by being transmitted
through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the defendant state. Service was effected when the writ was
received at the Ministry.
On January 12 1991, the FCO closed the British Embassy in Baghdad. Iraq
broke off diplomatic relations as of February 6. The Iraqi Embassy in London
continued functioning and on January 15 it was recognised as a diplomatic
mission.
The documents were served on the Embassy in London and were received by an
accredited diplomat.
Kuwait Airways contended that service took effect as service on the
Republic.
Service under section 12(1) was effected by transmission 'to' the Ministry
and took effect when the document was received 'at' the Ministry. In no
sense was a diplomatic mission in a foreign state the same as the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of the sending state.
For Kuwait Airways: Anthony Clarke QC, Rosalyn Higgins QC and Joe Smouha
(Clyde &amp; Co).
For Iraqi Airways and the Republic: Richard Plender QC and Stephen Nathan
(Landau and Scanlan).

FT  17 JUL 92 / Management: Take your partner - Strategic alliances between
companies are in vogue but Christopher Lorenz warns they can bring problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strategic alliances are seen almost universally these days as a 'good thing'
 -like motherhood. But they are just as hard work. And they are by no means
for everyone. These may seem truisms, but they need saying after this week's
declaration by Jack Kuehler, president of IBM, that 'you are going to see
more and more alliances. They are the way of the future'.
As part of its rejuvenation programme, IBM is signing up a remarkable number
of partners. But the computer giant is far from alone in its enthusiasm. Its
new Dollars 1bn joint venture with Toshiba of Japan and Siemens of Germany
to develop advanced memory chips was unveiled on the same day as a Dollars
700m deal between Japan's Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices, a Silicon
Valley chip-maker.
In a far from unusual week towards the end of June, no less than seven
important international alliances were either unveiled for the first time,
or strengthened further. They included: Electrolux and AEG (in household
appliances); an Italian and a Japanese steel company; Renault and Volvo; IBM
and Toshiba (in a different deal); Toshiba and Apple; Olivetti and Digital
Equipment; Philips and JVC.
Such activity, say business academics from Harvard and elsewhere, is
creating a 'borderless world' in which companies change shape constantly in
response to shifting circumstances. Rather than trying to do everything
themselves, or just subcontracting selected work to each year's lowest
bidder, they strip themselves back to the core - and sometimes beyond it -
putting even prized activities into partnership with other companies which
are often their rivals. Some of these partnerships endure, but most change
with the wind - or, as in chips, with the shifting pace of technology and
competitive actions.
In an era of fast-moving global competition, the apparent attractions of
this strategy are obvious. High development and production costs (and risks)
can be shared, as in this week's IBM deal. Critical 'time to market' can be
saved. Scarce human skills can be pooled. Access can be gained to difficult
markets and distribution channels. Individual product gaps can be filled,
and the scope of product lines broadened immensely.
On top of these advantages, alliances can be used as a politically
acceptable precursor either to acquiring a new business, or to exiting from
an old one - you merely sell it to your partner. Philips is an arch
practitioner of this tactic.
So why the doubts?
Part of the answer is provided by Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle. 'I
don't share the euphoria for alliances and joint ventures', he said last
month. 'First, very often they're an excuse, and an easy way out when people
should do their own homework. Secondly, all joint ventures create additional
difficulties - you share power and cultures, and decisions take longer.'
Hence Nestle's very sparing use of alliances: its two main ones are with
Coca-Cola in canned coffee and tea, and with General Mills in the breakfast
cereals market.
In both cases, Nestle is gaining valuable learning - a key to any alliance -
as well as saving time and getting access to new markets. It is acting from
positive motives, like most Japanese companies.
By contrast, the motivation of many western companies which enter alliances
 -especially with Far Eastern partners - tends to be negative, or at least
defensive. They seem to believe that strength can be created out of
weakness.
It seldom can, unless the weaker company uses the relationship not just to
fill an immediate product gap, but also to revitalise its technology or
other skills. Such learning is hard to accomplish. So is the necessary
building of walls around the know-how that one wants to protect from one's
partner. With its recent sub-contracting of small engine design to Yamaha,
Ford could lose as much as it gains.
A more blatant case of co-operation out of weakness has been McDonnell
Douglas' desperate bid to stay in the commercial aircraft business by giving
Taiwan technology in return for massive subsidy.
The many pitfalls which confront international alliance partners, both weak
and strong, have been the subject of several studies by consultants at
McKinsey &amp; Company. One of them, by two Germans, warns that co-operation may
be part of a strategy, but that it is not a strategy in itself. 'If managers
focus on it to the exclusion of all stand-alone possibilities, they become
vulnerable,' say the authors.
Other McKinsey studies ram home the counter-intuitive point that it is a
mistake for a strong company to ally with a weaker one. The latter often
becomes a drag on the venture's competitiveness.
The latest research, to be published in the next issue of the McKinsey
Quarterly, is even tougher. Focusing especially on alliance strategies for
companies that are European 'national champions', it concludes that:
For weak companies, alliances are not a way to avoid sale. Defensive
alliances complicate or even prevent an eventual sale.
'Trojan horse' worries are justified, since most alliances are temporary,
and end with acquisition by the stronger (or strongest) partner.
Pursuing multiple alliances is a dangerous approach for European national
champions which are simultaneously taking steps to improve their core
businesses or which have little past experience with alliances. Succeeding
at even one takes a lot of time and effort.
There is a further problem with the attitude of most western companies to
alliances. Most see each deal individually, rather than as part of a
network. Thus AMD, in its trumpeting of this week's agreement with Fujitsu,
seemed to take little account of the Japanese company's extensive network of
relationships with western companies, including ICL, Siemens and Amdahl.
Does it understand how it features, and could be manipulated, in Fujitsu's
global battle plan against IBM?
Equally, does IBM really understand where it figures in Toshiba's strategy
of partnerships with all and sundry? The same applies within the US itself,
to IBM's place in Apple's growing spider's web of relationships - and vice
versa.
Alliances may give companies unprecedented flexibility. But, by the same
token, they render them unstable. To revert to analogies from personal life,
it is far easier to control one's destiny if one has just a couple of
mutually compliant lovers than if one tries to run a series of
ever-changing, one-night stands. For most companies, Nestle's conservatism
is a better model than IBM's promiscuity.

FT  17 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Go east, honourable members - David
Owen recently found the following letter in a Whitehall litter-bin, written
on notepaper from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, which offers this
advice to the prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Might we respectfully propose an answer to the problem of Canary
Wharf's future that we think would produce a felicitous outcome for you, us
and Britain as a whole.
We believe the government should buy this luxurious and strategically
located development, uproot parliament and transfer the heart of Britain's
democratic process from Westminster to Docklands.
It is a radical proposal, we think you will agree, but one made in the
spirit of the government's own suggestion of relocating a large contingent
of civil servants to east London.
Allow us to enumerate the arguments we feel sure will overcome your
understandable reluctance to desert the pomp and circumstance of
Westminster. (You should be assured that technical wrinkles such as the need
to provide adequately proportioned debating chambers would not pose a
problem to the site developers.)
First, cost. Not to put too fine a point on it, this unique and
world-renowned complex would be available at an absolute snip.
Administrators are a prime source of bargains for those with liquid
resources, as your advisers will confirm. Why not act now to take advantage
of what we can safely say would be a never-to-be-repeated offer?
Of course, the Treasury would not be the Treasury if it did not hesitate to
sanction the unbudgeted expenditure. But we are sure they can be convinced
of the long term advantages of what we propose - particularly if it is
intimated the development could be sold and leased back at a fat profit when
the property market improves. Equally, the government should have little
difficulty demonstrating it had fulfilled its undertaking to secure value
for money for British taxpayers.
The financial argument is particularly persuasive if you take into account
certain spin-off benefits. Consider, for example, how many lobbyists and
other assorted hangers-on would wish post-haste to follow the government to
Docklands. There would be ample surplus space to rent to these captive
clients at highly advantageous rates. Our specialists would be delighted to
advise on how to exploit this opening most effectively.
Meanwhile, the Palace of Westminster could be reconfigured forthwith as an
admission-charging museum, complete with refreshment and leisure facilities.
In truth, it is much better suited to this role than to its present function
and the burger franchise alone would be worth a small fortune. A
strongly-branded selection of quality products, ranging from Speaker's
Choice malt whisky to House of Commons fudge, is already available on the
premises, as you will be aware. Think of the revenue-generating potential of
marketing these to a wider audience] It is a moot point whether the upper
chamber should remain in situ to entertain visitors.
With time and a little work, one section of the building - perhaps the press
facilities - could be converted into a luxury hotel. Once the complex was
ticking over satisfactorily, it would be a clear candidate for
privatisation.
This brings us to our second point: the move to Docklands would be extremely
popular with MPs. At a stroke, all hard-working parliamentarians would be
whisked from the cramped mock-gothic squalor in which most now toil to
comfortable, state-of-the-art new offices.
We need hardly remind you of the recent parliamentary early day motion (copy
enclosed) recognising 'the severe restrictions the 19th century Palace of
Westminster places on the provision of modern, efficient facilities for
members of parliament'. This had been signed by more than 140 MPs at our
last count - a sizeable protest vote by any standard.
It is true the motion urges the leader of the House to 'lease additional
accommodation in Westminster' (our italics). But we are confident this is
because it did not occur to most honourable members that a move further
afield was possible.
A third consideration is that we can think of few surer ways to ensure
Docklands flourishes - a happy state of affairs that could hardly fail to
reflect favourably on the government.
You will understand what we mean by suggesting that MPs will not be content
to labour long in a new location without satisfactory local amenities. Their
presence will certainly ensure that more high-class restaurateurs and trades
people consider opening up in the area.
In fact, what would probably happen is that sufficient advisers, observers
and consultants would follow on the politicians' coat-tails to create a
veritable parliamentary village in Docklands. Add a few civil servant
refugees from Marsham Street and you would have the nucleus of the sort of
self-contained administrative centre favoured by thrusting young nations
like Brazil, Australia and Nigeria.
Of course, with all these groups heading east, it would be much easier to
justify picking up the entire bill for the Jubilee Line extension, as the
government might well be obliged to do if it accepted our proposals. In any
case, the Pounds 400m private-sector contribution originally promised would
have been spread over more than 20 years and is therefore considerably less
substantial than it might at first appear. It is also worth observing that a
large contingent of journalists would be dependent on the extension to
facilitate their commuting. Dare we suggest that favourable coverage of the
change of tack might be easier to engineer under such circumstances?
Finally, there is the question of prestige. It is clearly vital that an
institution as valued and venerable as the British parliament should move to
a suitably eminent location if it is to move at all.
In this respect, Canary Wharf can scarcely be beaten: what could have more
cachet, after all, than permanent stewardship of Europe's largest
development? If we may permit ourselves a self-serving observation, the move
also has much to recommend it on aesthetic grounds. Next to the strong,
simple contours of the Canary Wharf tower, Big Ben appears spindly,
ill-proportioned and distinctly over-ornate.
Of course, many MPs will nevertheless have formed a sentimental attachment
to the famous clock tower. Might we suggest therefore that a
strategically-positioned replica could speed their settling-in We are
advised that a fully functioning bell-chime could be installed in such a
replica at reasonable cost. Whether this would have quite the resonance of
its Westminster prototype, however, could not be guaranteed.
Yours etc,

FT  17 JUL 92 / Management: Customers form queue for chips in newspapers -
How a UK company seeks success through direct sales of personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The assembly line machinery comes from Taiwan, as do the printed circuit
boards, but the finished computers are British. They are designed and built
in a low rise development that would not seem out of place in California's
Silicon Valley, but is actually only a hundred metres from London's busy
North Circular road.
The manufacturer is Elonex, a six-years-old privately held company which is
confounding those who doubt that the UK has a future in the personal
computer business.
It is already sixth in the UK with a 4.6 per cent market share behind IBM,
Compaq and Apple of the US, Olivetti of Italy and Britain's Amstrad.
According to Romtec, the market consultancy, Elonex is the UK number one in
direct PC sales, made through newspaper advertisements, mail order or
personal recommendation without recourse to distributors or retailers.
Direct sales is the fastest growing segment of the PC market in the UK,
echoing a trend in the US where computers are increasingly being sold on
price alone. All the established manufacturers are having to deal with this
rapidly expanding, low-priced end of the market where there is little
difference between machines and where gross margins are wafer thin.
While the big companies struggle to find new strategies, Elonex has managed
to grow and increase profitability through the recession. It is now
increasing its profits at 25 to 30 per cent and last year it made some
Pounds 10m pre-tax profit on sales approaching Pounds 60m.
Elonex's trading performance is not in itself enough to worry the PC
industry's larger players. What should be giving executives at IBM, Compaq
and even Dell - the US pioneer of direct selling - restless nights is the
way Elonex seems to be able to master the fast-changing rules of the
personal computer game.
Elonex applies three fundamental principles.
Cost of sales is kept as low as practicable. Israel Wetrin, the company's
managing director, studied electronic engineering at London University and
spent time as a general dealer in Taiwan. He started the company selling
clones built by the Taiwanese company Copam from his North London flat.
Prudent habits have stuck. He keeps cost of sales between 8 and 10 per cent
of turnover and makes a net profit of between 10 and 17 per cent. Margins
are fixed: savings in the costs of components are passed directly on to the
customer. 'This way we can put pressure on the big boys,' Wetrin says.
'Unless they can reduce their cost of sales from 40 to 10 per cent, they
will never make it.'
Comparisons are always difficult but one of Compaq's new low-cost range at
Pounds 1,045 in the UK is still substantially undercut by a Pounds 835
Elonex with more features.
Components are bought at keen prices. The bulk buying power of the large PC
manufacturers is largely a fiction, it seems. The company is currently
producing only 7,000 machines a month but Wetrin says: 'Our purchasing power
is about the same as IBM or Compaq. The only component larger companies can
buy more cheaply is the microprocessor.' Labour costs, for small or large
companies, typically work out at only about 5 per cent of total
manufacturing costs.
Products are designed to give a competitive edge. Achieving product
differentiation is hard at the low-cost end of the market. Elonex installed
semi-automated Taiwanese manufacturing equipment but reckons it has little
now to learn from Taiwan. The Taiwanese mass produce identical systems; each
Elonex computer is built to a customer's specification, typically within
five days.
It has established a research facility in Santa Clara, California, and has
built relationships with the key component suppliers. It claims a good
relationship with Intel, the US semiconductor company which supplies the
majority of the microprocessors used in PCs.
The Elonex philosophy is well illustrated in the company's product strategy.
The current range comprises chiefly desktop models and network servers,
which, some might argue, represent yesterday's technology. The excitement in
the industry is now focused on laptop and notebook PCs.
Desktop systems are selling well, however; the evidence is the Elonex
despatch centre where lorry loads of boxed systems addressed to blue chip
customers leave every night.
Elonex supplies a notebook made by another manufacturer but is about to
launch its own design. Wetrin dismisses most of the currently available
machines as poor on reliability and battery life. The new systems, scheduled
for the end of August, will run for 14-18 hours on one battery charge
through a novel choice of display screen options.
Elonex is already established in France, Belgium and Israel and will open in
Germany this year. Wetrin sums up his strategy: 'We are genuine with our
customers and we pay our suppliers on time. We are the ones who worry Dell
and Compaq so we must be doing OK.' The success of Elonex may represent the
beginning of a new era for British personal computers. Just behind it in
market share is Opus Technology, a tiny company with British Rail as its
largest customer, which is also profiting from the shift among customers to
direct sales.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Manual workers' pay deal agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders representing 900,000 local government manual workers, the
biggest bargaining group in Britain, yesterday claimed a 'major
breakthrough' in improving the status of the mainly part-time manual
workers.
Employers and union leaders agreed a pay deal giving most workers a 4.1 per
cent rise with 4.4 per cent for the lower-paid. For full-time manual
workers, that means a weekly increase ranging from Pounds 5.69 to Pounds
6.44.
Union leaders were keen to emphasise the non-wage benefits, which include:
From January 1, the 540,000 part-time workers will have full access to the
local-government sick pay scheme.
The employers, balanced between Tory and Labour authorities, will examine
moves towards single-status for all town hall employees and to establish a
joint working party on equality.
The employers have also agreed to review how to improve the training
opportunities of the manual workers.
Mr Roger Poole, of Nupe, the public-services union, and leader of the union
side, emphasised also that the employers' side - including the Conservatives
 -had committed themselves to maintaining and improving the collective
bargaining institutions of local government with 'careful and comprehensive
consultation'.
Some local authorities have been dropping out of parts of the bargaining
machinery they have found to be inflexible.
The London borough of Harrow recently withdrew from the manual workers'
negotiating machinery, while several local authorities have withdrawn from
central bargaining with their white-collar emp-loyees
However, yesterday's deal is unlikely to lead to many more authorities
withdrawing on the ground that they cannot afford to pay what has been
agreed.
The pay deal adds 4.1 per cent or Pounds 183m to the pay bill, although it
excludes the 0.2 per cent of the pay bill from extending the sick pay
scheme.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: 10 local authorities told to
account for labour organisation losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE government yesterday told 10 local authorities to account for losses
incurred by their direct labour organisations last year, which may lead to
the contracting-out of their work to the private sector, Andrew Adonis
writes.
Among the councils the greatest losses were incurred by Tower Hamlets in
London, Halton in Cheshire and Gillingham in Kent.
The government's action is seen as a warning to all authorities whose DLOs
are performing poorly. Private businesses are concerned that without
effective monitoring, competition for contracts under the government's
compulsory competitive tendering legislation will be biased against them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Scottish Labour MPs staged a protest in the Commons yesterday
over what they claimed were government plans to privatise the Scottish water
industry.
Led by Mr George Galloway (Glasgow Hillhead), the group blocked the removal
of the Commons mace as the House was adjourned at 3pm for the three-month
summer recess.
Attempts were made by officials to order the press out of the gallery, but
journalists refused to leave.
The 18-minute demonstration ended after an assurance that Mr Tony Newton,
Leader of the House, would meet the group to discuss their grievances.
The other MPs involved were: Mr John McAllion (Dundee East), Mrs Irene Adams
(Paisley North), Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) and Mr Dennis Canavan
(Falkirk W) - all members of the 'Scotland United' group which campaigns for
devolution.
The Serjeant-at-Arms, Sir Alan Urwick, hurried to the chamber and after
lengthy negotiations the MPs left, promising the campaign for a Scottish
parliament would continue.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers rebuff local-authority
cash plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS yesterday rejected outright the Pounds 45.5bn estimate from the
local-authority associations for local-government spending next year.
At the twice-yearly meeting between local-authority associations and
ministers from the main departments with related responsibilities, Mr
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said the proposed increase in
spending was 'out of the question'.
The picture for comparing local-government spending this year and next year
is complicated by the local authorities' loss of responsibility for further
education and their gaining responsibility for community care.
Mr Howard said that taking account of those changes, the bid represented an
increase of 13 per cent over what the government thought authorities should
be spending this year - Pounds 41.8bn. The rise is smaller, however,
compared with the Department of the Environment's estimate of what they will
actually spend this year - Pounds 43bn.
Ministers are anxious that the council tax in April next year is not
accompanied by the high increases in local tax bills that greeted the poll
tax. They are clear, however, that they will use the stricter regime for
limiting or 'capping' council spending which is now in place, to prevent
bills rising steeply, rather than simply using central government grant to
prevent a sharp increase in the local funding element.
Instead, within a tight overall spending limit, they are likely to
concentrate on a generous transitional relief scheme for the council tax.
Local-authority leaders left the meeting unconvinced by the government's
argument. Mr John Chatfield, leader of the Association of County Councils,
said he did not believe the associations' bid was 'out of perspective with
the government's own plans for an 8.2 per cent rise in public spending next
year'.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities,
warned that unless the government changed its mind, councils would not be
able to maintain services and meet their new, government-imposed demands.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott hopeful of extended fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, tried to inject a dose of
excitement into Labour's leadership contest yesterday by claiming he could
force a second ballot for the deputy leadership.
Speaking after Nupe, the public-sector union, said it would back him in
Saturday's contest, Mr Prescott said his calculations showed that Mrs
Margaret Beckett, the clear favourite for deputy leader, may not win a
majority in the first ballot.
However, he acknowledged that Mrs Beckett was easily the most likely to win
a second ballot. Nupe has also announced that it will back Mr John Smith,
shadow chancellor, for Labour leader.
The latest events in the leadership contest came as nominations closed for
the party's shadow cabinet elections next week - set to be a far less
predictable poll. A record 54 nominations have been received for the 18
places.
Mr Prescott has won the support of unions representing about 11 1/2 per cent
of the electoral college. Mrs Beckett has about 25 per cent and Mr Bryan
Gould, shadow environment secretary and the final challenger for the deputy
leadership, has just 3 per cent.
Mr Prescott's calculations show him and Mrs Beckett each winning a further
12 per cent from Labour MPs but he belives some MPs are switching
allegiances. He also disputes claims that Mrs Beckett has an overwhelming
lead among the constituency section of the electoral college.
Mr Prescott believes he has drawn more votes from northern constituency
parties and Mr Gould more from southern areas - a distinction he claimed may
have biased estimates of his support. It is unclear how many of Mr Gould's
supporters would switch to Mr Prescott in a second ballot.
Mrs Beckett's total share of the vote would be a few percentage points
either side of 50 per cent, Mr Prescott predicted. 'It is open. Nobody can
tell. It will be done on the floor on the day,' Mr Prescott said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday announced a joint
environmental policy conference with the Green party, designed to show the
spirit, 'of the new politics' involving co-operation between opposition
parties.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Sharp rise in Lloyd's open years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market unable to close
their accounts nearly doubled last year, it emerged yesterday.
The increase, from 53 to 103, is further bad news for Names - the
individuals whose capital supports underwriting. They are unable to resign
their membership of Lloyd's if they are members of syndicates with 'open
years'.
Lloyd's reported its worst-ever losses of Pounds 2.06bn last month for the
1989 year.
The market's governing council faces fierce criticism from dissidents at an
extraordinary general meeting scheduled this month.
Syndicates - annual joint ventures of Names - leave their accounts open when
there is uncertainty about the size of future claims. Those specialising in
US long-tail liability business, in which claims are made sometimes many
years after the inception of the policy, have been worst affected.
Last year 68 of the 401 syndicates trading in the 1989 year left their
accounts open, bringing the total of open years to 162 compared with 97 for
the end of the previous year. At the end of 1991 a total of 103 syndicates
had one or more open years, compared with 53 at the end of 1990.
Officially, Lloyd's is optimistic about the trend in US court cases, where
insurers are contesting their liability for the cost of cleaning up polluted
sites and removing asbestos from buildings.
Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents more than 9,000 Names, said the news underlined the importance of
the Lloyd's initiative to set up Centrewrite, a reinsurer which ultimately
hopes to be able to offer to assume the open-year liabilities of Names for a
premium.
Separately, Lloyd's said yesterday that its council had approved in
principle a measure allowing syndicates to make more use of reinsurance
policies offered by companies trading outside Lloyd's.
The change would allow syndicates to increase their capacity to underwrite
new business in a market where rates are increasing sharply.

FT  17 JUL 92 / European TV chief is ousted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francis Baron, chief executive of the European Television Networks (ETN),
the former satellite television division of WH Smith, has been ousted from
his job.
Mr Baron had been responsible since 1984 for WH Smith's foray into
television until last year, when the cable and satellite channels were sold
to Capital Cities/ABC of the US, and Canal Plus and Compagnie Generale des
Eaux. The channels include The European Sports Network; Lifestyle, aimed
mainly at women; Kindernet, the Dutch-language children's channel; and Cable
Jukebox, a music channel.
There have been disagreements about the direction of the company, with
important decisions being delayed. It is believed that Mr Baron called a
shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to try to resolve the deadlock.
One issue is likely to have been Mr Baron's fight to win equal access to
television sporting rights. Formal complaints have been made to the European
Commission against the European Broadcasting Union, which buys exclusive
sports rights for Europe's public-service broadcasters. Mr Baron has been
fighting for equal access to coverage of the Barcelona Olympics. Canal Plus,
which owns 25 per cent of ETN, is a member of the EBU.
There was also a difference of approach on strategy. Mr Baron has pioneered
the creation of a pan-European network of sports channels. Canal Plus, the
subscription television channel, has tended to expand by setting up separate
ventures in individual nations.
Mr Richard Spinner, an executive of Capital Cities/ABC, and senior
vice-president and managing director of CC/ABC's European operations, has
taken over as chief executive of ETN. 'The future is extremely exciting,
both long and short-term and ETN will be an aggressive player in the
marketplace,' Mr Spinner said.

FT  17 JUL 92 / RUC to counter terrorist funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Ulster Constabulary is to plough more resources into investigating
the financing of terrorism in Northern Ireland.
In his annual report, Sir Hugh Annesley, the Chief Constable, said that,
while significant progress had been made, he intended to assign additional
manpower to the force's Anti-Racketeering Unit.
Republican and loyalist paramilitary rackets raise millions of pounds each
year for terrorist campaigns.
The RUC have already closed dozens of Ulster drinking clubs, regarded as
fronts for paramilitary organisation.
Officers have also seized thousands of videotapes suspected of being used to
raise funds through illegal copying operations.
In the report, released yesterday, Sir Hugh said the 94 people killed in the
past year as a result of terrorism was the highest number for a decade.
He said republican and loyalist gangs had demonstrated that they could match
each other in 'hate, blind bigotry and sectarian savagery'.
Sir Hugh said the recruiting of young people into terrorist organisations
remained a difficulty.
In the past five years, over 200 people under the age of 17 had appeared in
court.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Wage inflation shows sharpest fall for 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAGE inflation as measured by changes in average earnings has fallen at the
sharpest rate for 10 years, according to government figures published
yesterday.
The Department of Employment said that the index of average earnings across
the economy had risen in the year to May by an underlying 6.5 per cent,
after 7 per cent in April and 7.5 per cent in the previous month.
This is the first time the year-on-year increase has fallen by a full
percentage point in any two-month period since July 1982. The May figure is
the smallest annual increase in average earnings for 25 years.
The fall is largely the consequence of the downward pressure on wage
settlements over the past year. It will be welcomed by the government, which
sees lower wage inflation as helping industrial competitiveness and so
paving the way for recovery.
The year-on-year increase in average earnings would have been even lower but
for buoyant overtime payments which in recent months have pushed up wages in
some parts of manufacturing. In May, overtime working in the manufacturing
sector totalled 11.26m hours a week, the highest figure since November 1990.
Within manufacturing, the year-on-year increase in earnings was 6.5 per cent
in May, down from a revised 7.5 per cent in April and 8 per cent in March.
In services, the figure was 6.5 per cent, compared with 7 per cent and 7.25
per cent in the two previous months.
The fall in wage inflation was reflected in figures for unit wage costs in
manufacturing. In the three months to May, wages per unit of output were 2.8
per cent above the corresponding figure 12 months earlier, the lowest
increase since 1989. In the three months to February, the equivalent
year-on-year figure was 4.1 per cent.
Manufacturing output per person between March and May was 4.5 per cent up on
the same period a year earlier. In the three months to February, the
corresponding figure was 3.2 per cent.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Met Office claims an 84% accuracy rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 84 per cent of public weather forecasts were accurate in the year
to March 1992, the same level as the previous year, the Meteorological
Office said yesterday.
The accuracy rate is helped by good weather and 1991 was the warmest year on
record, the Met Office said.
Since it failed to predict the hurricane that swept parts of the UK in
October 1987, the Met Office, a government agency funded mainly by the
Ministry of Defence, has invested heavily to improve its forecasts'
accuracy. Its new forecasting model, launched in the past year, which brings
together weather forecasting and predictions of global climate change, cost
Pounds 5m.
The Met Office cost the taxpayer - through the MoD - Pounds 71.1m in the
year to March 1992, compared to Pounds 58m the year before. Professor Julian
Hunt, the chief executive appointed in January, said: 'The government now
wants to see the net cost of the Met Office reducing.'
The MoD has set a target of an annual cut in the Met Office's net operating
costs of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent - around Pounds 1m - in each of
the next five years. The Met Office plans to cut 200 staff based at MoD
sites, from its present staff total of 2,500.
Prof Hunt said that as well as cost control, the Met Office needed to
concentrate on presenting weather information more clearly. The Met Office
has found the proportion of people who can remember television weather
forecasts that they have just seen is 40 per cent or lower.
'We also find it disappointing that despite our severe weather warning
forecasts just as many high-sided vehicles are blown over as ever,' Prof
Hunt said.
The Met Office's total costs in the year to March 1992 were Pounds 122m,
almost half of which was staff costs. This compares with costs of Pounds
110.2m in the previous year. The costs were partly offset by Pounds 44.9m
from selling forecasts to other government departments and businesses, a
rise of Pounds 4.9m on the previous year. The income included Pounds 13.9m
from television, radio, press, shipping and energy companies.

Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said: 'The Employment

FT  17 JUL 92 / Hoteliers expect delay in upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING number of hoteliers believe that the economic downturn has ended
but most think their industry will not achieve full recovery for a year or
longer.
A survey by the Horwath leisure industry consultancy, published yesterday,
found that 38.2 per cent of hotel general managers, who were questioned in
the last week of June, thought the recovery had begun, compared with 23.2
per cent three months earlier.
The proportion of managers who believed that the hotel industry downturn was
still continuing dropped from 76.8 per cent in the first quarter to 61.8 per
cent.
The hoteliers have become more pessimistic, however, about the time it will
take for full recovery to be achieved.
The proportion of hoteliers who thought that it would take 12 months or more
has risen from 81.9 per cent to 84.1 per cent.
More than 80 per cent of them said they did not expect to increase their
room tariffs this year.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Small increase in jobless revives recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALLER rise than expected in unemployment last month has revived cautious
hopes about a recovery later this year.
Government statistics published yesterday show that seasonally adjusted
unemployment rose by 7,000 in June, the smallest increase for two years. It
was the 27th consecutive monthly rise and brought the number registered as
unemployed to 2,722,700, the highest total since August 1987.
The rise followed a revised increase of 20,400 in May, and one of 42,600 in
April. During the three months to June, the average monthly increase has
been 23,300, the smallest recorded for any three-month period since
September 1990.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the news was encouraging.
She added: 'We all know that the improvement in the employment situation
lags recovery, but this time there will not be such a long lag as in the
1980s.'
The Treasury said the figures were 'a clear sign that increases in
unemployment are abating' but the Labour party said there was 'no immediate
prospect of a reduction in unemployment and the misery this brings'.
Ignoring seasonal fluctuations, unemployment fell by 29,701 to 2,678,191.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 9.6 per cent, the same as in
May. Out of the 7,000 extra people added to the adjusted jobless total, just
over half were in the south-east, including Greater London.
The 3,600 addition for the south-east pushed the unemployment rate for the
region to 9.2 per cent, up 0.1 of a point on May.
While most other regions saw small increases in jobless totals, the east
Midlands and north-west England registered slight falls, of 200 and 300
respectively.
The Employment Department also reported that registered workers - including
people in employment, the self-employed and those in the armed forces and on
government training programmes - totalled 25.56m at the end of March.
Although that was 64,000 down on three months earlier, the reduction in
employment was the smallest quarterly fall since mid 1990.
While the number of workers in manufacturing showed a fall of 73,000 in the
first quarter to 4.6m, those employed in services rose by 68,000 to 15.7m.
That was the first quarterly rise in service employment since the second
quarter of 1990.
Unfilled vacancies at government JobCentres fell by 5,100 in June to
109,500.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Performance pay's value is questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE value of performance-related pay to employers and employees has been
called into question by a poll of 1,600 British Telecom managers.
The poll, conducted by the Society of Telecom Executives, the union
representing 25,000 managers and professionals in the industry, found that
only 7 per cent of the sample thought PRP schemes improved their
performance.
Some 66 per cent of the sample thought that performance pay was applied
unfairly, and more than 70 per cent thought that bonuses were arbitrary and
that they undermined teamwork.
The Society of Telecom Executives said the survey found that women fared
less well under performance pay systems than men, even when they were
meeting the same targets of performance standards.
The survey also found that more than 70 per cent of BT's managers suffer
from work-related stress, while some 57 per cent suffer from low morale.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, is putting pressure on China to
resolve a list of trade disputes by mid-August, well ahead of an October 10
deadline set last year.
Mr Michael Moskow, deputy US trade representative, said yesterday that Mrs
Hills had given the Chinese government a list of trade issues she wants
resolved during talks in Beijing starting on August 17. Otherwise she will
publish a list of potential sanctions and begin public hearings.
President George Bush, who has been portrayed as being soft on China, could
gain politically should the US retaliate in October or win substantial
concessions from Beijing.
It is usual to begin any retaliatory process once a deadline has passed.
However, Mr Moskow said a similar threat produced an agreement with Beijing
on intellectual property rights earlier this year.
He said the two sides had narrowed their differences but that 'a substantial
gap' remained.
Beijing has agreed not to enforce unpublished trade regulations against
foreign importers and to prepare a comprehensive list of restrictions, bans
and quotas.
It will also eliminate its import substitution policies 'over time'. But it
has not agreed to end import licencing or bans on specific US products.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Japan to import US-made Toyotas
</HEADLINE>

   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, Japan's biggest car maker, is to start importing US-made Toyota cars
into Japan next month.
The move is important symbolically as an effort to reduce Japan's huge trade
surplus with the US, particularly given Toyota's huge market power in Japan,
where it claims 42 per cent of car sales. It will also help Toyota meet a
growing domestic demand for estates (station wagons).
Toyota will import the right-hand-drive version of its Camry Wagon,
manufactured at its plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, to be sold domestically
as the Scepter.
The company has set an ambitious sales target of 700 units a month. It will
compete against Honda's US-made and designed Accord Wagon, whose sales have
averaged 836 a month this year.
Nissan said yesterday it would next year start importing to Japan a small
wagon to be manufactured at its Mexican assembly plant.
Honda remains the leader in so-called reverse imports, with average monthly
imports of 1,146 units of three different models of the Accord. The cars
tend to be sold as premium products without the extensive discounting now
available on domestically-made models.
Nissan has been selling an average of 192 UK-made Primera models, while
Mitsubishi has sold 46 US and Australian-made models each month. Mazda has
sold about 160 US-made cars bearing the Ford marque each month. Ford owns a
24 per cent stake in Mazda.
Total sales of imported vehicles in Japan in the first six months of the
year came to 85,129 units, down 12.7 per cent from a year ago. European
marques were hit hardest. Sales of BMW and Mercedes have held up fairly
strongly, the companies claiming 17.18 and 19.12 per cent respectively of
the imported market.
Sales of Volkswagen-Audi vehicles, however, have slipped by 20 per cent,
although the company has managed to retain its position as the leading
importer, with 21.36 per cent of the market.

ISRAEL and the seven members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta)
yesterday reached a free trade agreement after 13 months of negotiations.
The agreement will be signed later this year and is expected to come into
effect on January 1, 1993. Customs duties and other trade barriers will be
abolished for industrial and processed agricultural goods, fish and other
marine products. Israel has also negotiated better terms for trade in farm
products with individual Efta countries.
The deal will end the discrimination against Efta exports to Israel when
compared with exports from the European Community and the United States,
which already have free trade pacts with Israel.
Efta was anxious for a quick agreement to avoid the 'negative effects' on
trade of a tariffication scheme introduced by Israel in September 1991.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Unabashed Perot cuts his Dollars 10m losses and runs: The
would-be candidate made a difference before concluding he could not win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE end for Mr Ross Perot, when it came, really was quick, almost
businesslike. Less than a day after a top adviser walked out, and with poll
after poll showing his popularity in free fall, the Texas billionaire
'picked up his marbles and went home', as Molly Ivins, the Dallas newspaper
columnist, said he would the night before.
He did it in Perot style too - unabashed, unapologetic, ad- mitting no more
than a minor mistake here or there. He felt for his 'volunteers' but offered
them no guidance, beyond a complimentary nod to the revitalised Democratic
party. In effect, he cut his losses, about Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m), and
ran.
But he left claiming to have made a difference, and, in that belief, his
confidence is not entirely misplaced. For this has been the political year
of the protest - from Pat Buchanan, Jerry Brown, even Paul Tsongas and
certainly Mr Perot himself - and though each has individually failed, their
cumulative effect has been to change the tenor of the presidential election
campaign.
The critical question now for the two who remain standing, President George
Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, is who is best positioned to pick up the
pieces, above all those left stranded by Mr Perot.
Mr James Carville, Mr Clinton's top strategist, is sure it will be his man.
He said yesterday that, whatever else might be said of Mr Perot, he had
tapped a well of discontent in a country dissatisfied and demanding change.
The Clinton premise throughout, he argued, has been change, while that of Mr
Bush has been retention of the status quo. The fact that Mr Perot has quit
while Mr Clinton is in the climactic stages of a successful convention,
leaping ahead in popularity, may also provide an extra boost, even
justification for the claim that it was Mr Clinton, not the president, who
proved the Perot-slayer.
The president has also been portraying himself recently as the architect of
change. But he has also consistently maintained that the electorate will not
make up its mind until the last two months of the campaign, when he promises
to pull out the stops.
In reality, Mr Perot's softer support had already begun to switch in droves
to Mr Clinton, as all the recent polls prove. Its harder core element is
probably overwhelmingly Republican and concentrated in the southwest and
west. If Mr Bush wins this back, he will have evened the odds.
The all-southern Clinton-Gore ticket is intended also to boost the Democrats
in the deep south, where a breakthrough is imperative for national success
and where Mr Bush is still more popular than elsewhere. The three-way
contest would have been helpful in this respect.
But the Perot factor was more than just a demand for change. It was a direct
and adverse reflection on the perceived abilities of Mr Clinton and Mr Bush,
seen as practitioners of politics as usual.
Mr Clinton may be on the up at the moment, while Mr Bush is not. But both
still have a way to go to convince Americans that they can lead the country
effectively. The Perot jury is not the only whose judgment is still being
reserved.
The disappearance of the Texan also illustrates the immense practical
difficulties of waging an independent campaign, albeit one whose appeal is
purely populist and not lacking in finance.
The departure from the Perot camp on Wednesday of Mr Ed Rollins, President
Ronald Reagan's campaign strategist in 1984, shows that professionals and
amateurs do not live together easily in politics, that a campaign chest
which is a personal fortune is not a common campaign property, and that the
executive decision-making of business and the collectivity and compromises
that are the essence of politics are inherently very different.
Mr Perot reached the peak of his popularity last month very much on his own.
He captured the TV talk shows, set up his own phone banks, conducted his own
personal schedule, and spent his own money - not a lot of it, compared with
what he has and what he would have to spend if he were to run for president,
but a sum beyond the reach of just about any other mortal.
He brought in Mr Rollins and Mr Hamilton Jordan, Mr Jimmy Carter's former
political guru, 45 days ago because, he said, 'world class' supporters (his
volunteers around the country) needed 'world class' professional direction.
A lot of the volunteers promptly took umbrage.
The specific grouses of Mr Rollins are symptomatic of the dichotomy. Mr
Perot did not think the experienced ad-man they wanted to hire was worth the
money; he reportedly did not show them in advance his patronising speech
last weekend to a black audience (if he did, their professionalism was
wanting); and he did not believe them when they said he was losing momentum
and had to kick into another and more expensive gear straight away.
Now he does not have to. The billion-dollar man has gone back to earning
more millions. It is probably easier than politics anyway.

BRUSSELS yesterday put forward its long-awaited plan for EC states to
tighten controls on militarily useful exports crossing the Community's
external frontier, to let them dispense with such checks along internal
borders.
The European Commission's draft regulation, covering the tricky category of
dual-use and nuclear goods which have a military as well as civil
application, is designed to remove another pretext for keeping customs
officers busy at internal EC borders after January 1, when the single EC
market is due to take effect.
If approved by EC governments, it would mean, for example, that a UK
security export licence granted to a British company would be valid in the
rest of the Community.
Delays in producing the plan, caused by the Commission's hesitancy in
intruding into a quasi-military field of unquestioned national competence,
means there is little chance of member states arriving at sufficient mutual
trust to do away with all checks between them in the next five months. So,
for a transitional period in 1993, EC officials envisage a certain
administrative 'paper chase' to check up on dual-use goods circulating in
the single market.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Hamlet of the Hudson brings house down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton knows about speeches. He writes many of his own and
there is enough of the southern Baptist tradition of oratory in him to make
them sound good - when he is on form.
But he would have to exceed his finest performance to come close to what Mr
Mario Cuomo pulled off on Wednesday night in nominating Mr Clinton as the
party's presidential candidate.
The address by the governor of New York can be assessed on two levels - the
purely political and as a piece of political theatre. On both it won rave
reviews.
There were nagging doubts before he spoke that the Hamlet of the Hudson, a
man of many moods and not all benign towards Mr Clinton, might give the
nominee short shrift. Some of the earlier highlighted speeches - Jesse
Jackson's, Barbara Jordan's and the petulant Jerry Brown's - had focused
more on the party than praise of Mr Clinton. Mr Brown never mentioned his
name.
Mr Cuomo invoked it 32 times, beginning with the first sentence and ending
with the last. More than that, each progressive value he has long attributed
to himself he said Mr Clinton possessed to an equal or even greater degree.
The embrace was total, and Mr Clinton could have asked for no finer
send-off.
'Magnificent Mario Cuomo' was how the nominee gratefully put it.
He put all the politician's oratorical skills on display. The timing, the
pacing, the wit, the savagery were all there in a wondrous bundle of
metaphor, imagery and, when turning the fire on President George Bush and
the Republicans, cold partisan scorn and contempt.
He brought the house down when he contrasted the Democratic and Republican
attitudes to the imperative of helping the needy.
'That is the fundamental Democratic predicate. Surrender that Democratic
principle and we might just as well tear the donkeys from our lapels, pin
elephants on instead and retreat to elegant estates behind ivy-covered
walls, where, when they detect a callous on their palms, they conclude it is
time to put down their polo mallet.'
Mr Bush, he said in another passage, did not understand that the ship of
state was foundering. 'He seems to think the ship will be saved by
imperceptible undercurrents, directed by the invisible hand of some cyclical
economic god, that will gradually move the ship at the last moment so that
it will miraculously glide past the rocks.
'Well, prayer, prayer, is always a good idea; but our prayers must always be
accompanied by good works. We need a captain who understands that, and who
will seize the wheel before it is too late. I am here tonight to offer
America that new captain with a new course before it is too late, and he is
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.'
Some close Cuomo watchers claimed this was stock stuff, lifted from many a
recent speech. But the governor hates to leave his home state and he has not
had a national audience like this since the party's convention in San
Francisco in 1984.
Back then, he talked about his democratic values. But he never extended them
as personally to Mr Walter Mondale as he did to Mr Clinton. That he did,
surely laid to rest forever the dreams of his supporters that he will
himself one day become president.
If Mr Clinton wins in November, perhaps he will redeem a half-promise and
elevate Mr Cuomo to the Supreme Court at the first opportunity.
If nothing else, that should improve the quality of the court's written
judgments.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Gatt offered airliner subsidy model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community and the United States yesterday offered their
hard-won accord limiting subsidies to civil aircraft as a model for a new
international agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
The bilateral accord, reached on April 1 after six years of wrangling over
government aid to the European Airbus project, will formally come into
effect next week after endorsement by EC finance ministers last Monday.
It limits direct government support for new aircraft programmes to 33 per
cent of total development costs. Indirect supports, for instance through
military contracts, are limited to 4 per cent of a company's turnover.
Both the EC and the US are long-standing critics of Gatt's civil aircraft
code, drawn up in the Tokyo round of trade talks that ended in 1979. The
code, which has 22 signatories, eliminates import duties on civil aircraft
and the bulk of aircraft parts, including engines. But its references to
subsidies and competitive practices are vague, leaving the door open for
conflicting interpretations.
The US, overriding EC objections, has instead chosen to use Gatt's subsidies
code as the vehicle for attacking state assistance to Airbus. It alleges
that Germany, France, Britain and Spain have spent Dollars 13.5bn to Dollars
26bn on subsidising the four-nation consortium, while the EC claims that US
manufacturers have received similar amounts indirectly through military
programmes.
Earlier this year, a disputes panel under the subsidies code ruled against
exchange rate guarantees to Deutsche Airbus by the German government. The
government announced last weekend it was selling its stake in Deutsche
Airbus and cancelling the guarantees.
Gatt's civil aircraft committee yesterday agreed in principle to renegotiate
the code. This will most probably be based on the US/EC agreement. However,
the agreement cannot simply be adopted wholesale by Gatt.
In particular, it applies only to new projects for civil airliners with more
than 100 seats. Manufacturers of smaller aircraft such as Fokker, the Dutch
concern, which are now covered by the Gatt code, maintain they have
different financing needs. An EC official said yesterday that small
manufacturers claim to require proportionately higher cash advances from
government to launch new aircraft than the US/EC pact permits.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday claimed it had instilled the true spirit
of competition into the Barcelona games by persuading the Barcelona Olympics
committee to change its ticket distribution policy just 10 days before the
opening ceremony, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Sir Leon Brittan - the EC's competition commissioner and now, apparently,
champion of the Olympics spectator - is also looking at ways of opening
television coverage of the games to greater competition.
The committee has modified its ticketing arrangements to allow the
sought-after tickets to move freely across Community frontiers. Usually, the
Olympic committees appoint an exclusive ticket distributor in each country.
Once the national quota of tickets is used up, individuals or travel agents
who want to buy tickets are forbidden from buying tickets from alternative
sources in other countries.
Now the rules have been amended, EC sports fans will be able to buy tickets
direct from the Olympic committee or from agents in other member states.
With less than 10 days to go until the Barcelona games start, it is not
clear how many tickets remain unsold anywhere in the Community. But as
cynical Brussels observers quickly pointed out, the move has awarded the
Commission - which has also co-ordinated EC sponsorship of the Olympics - a
welcome propaganda prize.
Sir Leon may have more of a struggle when it comes to opening up television
coverage of the games.
The rights to broadcast the Olympics have been bought by the European
Broadcasting Union (EBU), which groups Europe's public service broadcasters.
The Commission wants the EBU - and Eurosport, a channel backed by a group of
EBU members - to give Screensport, a rival European satellite sports
channel, fair access to Olympics coverage.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Efim, the debt-ridden Italian state industrial holding,
resigned yesterday, foreshadowing an imminent winding-up of the entity.
Efim, which controls more than 100 companies with activities ranging from
aluminium, defence and transport to glass and health spas, has accumulated
losses of more than L4,000bn (Pounds 1.8bn) and debts of L8,500bn against a
turnover of L4,660bn. Its fate has been in the balance for a long time and
earlier this year the public audit office called for the board to be
replaced because of repeated losses.
The holding was founded in 1947 to finance the development of private and
public sector industry but has ended up as a hospital for loss-making
businesses employing 37,000 people. The worst business is aluminium. Alumix,
which accounts for a quarter of total debt, is the heaviest loss-maker; but
other loss-makers include its glass division, Siv, with 30 per cent of
Europe's automotive glass sales.
Efim possesses good advanced technology and makes profits in its rolling
stock and mass transit division (Breda). It also has important defence
interests - via Oto Melara, and helicopters through Augusta. Although
Augusta has 7 per cent of the market for civilian light helicopters and 5
per cent of the military in this field, the company is strapped for cash,
has large stocks and owes L2,000bn to the banks.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Spanish ban means Nike can't just do it: A trade mark ruling
that prevents advertising and sales by the biggest sportswear group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPANISH Supreme court decision to uphold a ban on the advertising and sale
of sportswear in Spain by the US market leader Nike to protect a Spanish
claimant to the Nike name is embarrassing Madrid just eight days before the
Olympic Games start in Barcelona.
For a time last week it was feared the courts might even use police to
prevent the US athletic team, which is being sponsored by Nike, from
entering the Montjuic stadium in Barcelona for the inaugural ceremony on
July 25 if they were wearing the Nike flash.
With Madrid under pressure from the US and the European Commission, the
Barcelona judge who ordered the ban found a novel way around the problem -
the athletes could wear their Nike uniforms as they would not have been
bought in Spain.
The ban has, of course, infuriated Nike, the world's biggest sportswear
company with global sales last year of Dollars 3.4bn. Nike (slogan: 'Just do
it') has been engaged in a three-year battle with the Spanish authorities to
get its goods into the country and had been hoping to use the Games to
launch a multi-million-dollar line of new sportswear.
That respite aside, the ban, which is provisional and affects Nike apparel
but not its shoes, has opened a serious breach in Spain's trade relations
with the US. Madrid has been placed on Washington's watchdog list, making it
a potential victim of reprisals.
Government officials in the Spanish capital, asked in June by the European
Commission for an explanation, confess they are concerned about the
implications of the ban but that there is little they can do to overturn
decisions made by independent judges.
The government is trying to persuade the courts to allow Nike US to post a
bond which would allow it to advertise during the Games but provide some
security to the Spanish claimant to the Nike name should the courts continue
to find against the US company.
'Over the past three years, in the Spanish courts and in the market place,
our rights to operate as a brand in Spain have been trampled under,' said Mr
Richard Donahue, president of Nike, from the company's Oregon headquarters
recently.
'Our goods have been seized from bonded warehouses, our country manager
harassed, read his rights and summoned before a criminal court to defend
Nike's movement of products within the free trade zone (of European
Community countries).'
Nike's nightmare goes back to 1932 when a Catalan sock maker registered the
Nike name in Spain. Little is known of the Spanish Nike's fortunes until
1982 when Nike Inc signed a distribution agreement with the owner of the
rights to market the Nike brandname in Spain, a Catalan company called
Cidesport. The actual trademark is owned by a Catalan lawyer, Mr Juan Amigo.
When Nike International, Nike Inc's international operating arm, first began
doing business with Cidesport, the marketing rights were held by two
brothers, Carlos and Lorenzo Rosal Bertrand. Nike officials in Oregon say
they were assured by the brothers that the local trademark was not a
problem. However, by 1988 when Nike began to indicate it wanted to market
its product directly in Spain, Mr Amigo had transferred the right of use of
the name to Flora Bertrand, mother of the Bertrand brothers, and Cidesport
would not let the trademark go.
Mr Amigo and his partner are now offering to sell Nike the Spanish rights to
the Nike name for Dollars 30m, which the US company flatly refuses to pay.
But a Barcelona court has upheld the local company's rights to the mark and,
in June, the Constitutional Court turned down an appeal by Nike
International. At stake now is another appeal to overturn the ban while
lawyers fight over the basic rights issue.
Nike Inc reckons the ban could cost around Dollars 20m a year in Spain and
that sales of Nike clothes by the Spanish company amount, in effect, to
counterfeiting. That may allow the government, helpless to intervene until
now, a way into the dispute by using its prosecutors to mount a criminal
case but as yet no decision has been made.
While the string of court cases is most unlikely to be resolved before the
Games, Nike Inc can take heart, however, from the results of a 50-year
battle by Perrier, the French natural water group, to sell its Vichy water
in Spain. Then, too, Catalan courts repeatedly upheld the rights of the
makers of Vichy Catalan to use the Vichy name in Spain. They relented last
year.
Nike Inc's struggle should not take quite so long; even this month it has
been awarded new trade marks by the Spanish authorities. Mr Amigo's Dollars
30m play may be running out of time but until it does, Nike buffs may have
to gambol about wearing only their shoes.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Zimbabwe faces liquidity crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE is facing a serious money market liquidity crisis following the
Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe's decision to close its rediscount
window, refusing to accommodate the market except at penal overnight rates
of interest.
The sudden tightening of monetary policy, which took effect at the end of
June, follows a reported agreement between Zimbabwe and the International
Monetary Fund for an enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). One of
the terms of the agreement is understood to be that Zimbabwe maintains
positive real interest rates, which, with inflation in May of 36.5 per cent,
implies a marked increase in bank lending rates.
Money market sources said the Reserve Bank tighted its monetary stance when
it failed to meet IMF benchmarks on June 30, and was given until July 15 to
bring credit creation levels down to those stipulated by the Fund.
The central bank's move was prompted also by the publication of a surprising
set of monetary aggregates showing that money supply rose 34 per cent in the
year to May, which came as a shock after a marked slowdown earlier in the
year.
In April the broad (M2) measure of money was growing at an annual rate of
only 20 per cent.
The money supply figures were a surprise because the rate of bank lending
had slowed in recent months. Between May and December last year total bank
lending, including that by the finance houses, rose more than 53 per cent to
ZDollars 6.85bn (Pounds 730m), but in the first five months of 1992, lending
was up less than 8 per cent to ZDollars 7.4bn. Last week the Reserve Bank
pushed its rediscount rate to 30 per cent from 25 per cent - the second such
five-point increase in the past three months - while the rate for 90-day
money (Negotiable Certificates of Deposit) surged to 38 per cent.
Despite the authorities' clear intention of pushing up rates to meet the
IMF's demands and also to curb inflation, some banks are urging the
authorities to ease monetary policy, warning that if the tight money policy
is maintained, there will be some large corporate collapses.
The central bank has responded by asking the banks to use their USDollars
140m (Pounds 73.2m) lines of offshore credit, available for pre-shipment
financing of tobacco exports, and also to draw on their soft loan facilities
of USDollars 80m provided to help agriculture recover from drought. But the
banks say that this will not be adequate and warn of a serious crisis in
weeks unless policy is eased.
The liquidity crisis comes at a most unwelcome time for the government,
which cannot afford to back down on monetary policy, ahead of a crucial
budget to be presented by the finance minister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, on July
30.
Mr Chidzero is also committed, in terms of the ESAF deal with the Fund, to
cut public spending by no less than 6 percentage points of GDP, or
approximately USDollars 400m.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Bosnian Serbs' leader orders end to shelling: Diplomatic
moves in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, yesterday ordered his
forces to stop bombarding the eastern Bosnian city of Gorazde as European
Community-sponsored peace talks appeared powerless to bring about a
ceasefire in the republic.
EC diplomats in London said Serb irregulars had been besieging Gorazde, a
town of 37,000 inhabitants, of which 70 per cent are Moslem, as part of a
plan to 'ethnically cleanse' the region and eventually annex eastern Bosnia
to Serbia.
Despite the differences and the fact that all three sides did not meet one
another, Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC mediator, said: 'I am not that
pessimistic.'
Mr Karadzic denied Serb forces were involved in deportations, expulsions,
and killings, despite numerous eye-witness accounts.
'What we want is a Bosnia-Hercegovina which is based on three constituent
states. With this in mind, we support the current EC negotiations,' he said
in an interview.
He said these three ethnic states would consist of Moslem, Serb and Croat
regions. The Serbs account for a third of Bosnians, but with the support of
the former Yugoslav army, they have seized two thirds of
Bosnia-Herce-govina.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said he wanted a unitary
state, adding that the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina along ethnic lines
would fail to take into account mixed marriages, as well as those who
perceived themselves to be Bosnian.
'What Serb extremists are doing in Bosnia today is what the Nazis did in
world war two. Identity and ethnicity are being imposed on innocent
civilians,' he said.
Bosnia's Moslems, who make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m-strong population, had
earlier in the week put forward a peace plan offering equal shares of
cabinet posts to the other two ethnic communities. It was rejected by Mr
Karadzic and Mr Boban.
In an open letter to Lord Carrington, and Mr Cutileiro, Mr Silajdzic asked
the EC to stop the flow of weapons into Bosnia from neighbouring Serbia and
Montenegro.
'It is the Serb extremists who hold the weapons and continue the war. It is
the Serb extremists who are in a position to stop the killing. All heavy
weaponry and artillery should be placed under international control as a
precondition for constitutional negotiations,' he said.
Mr Karadzic said he had no preconditions for peace talks, but agreed with
the plan to place weapons under international supervision.
Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats and a close ally of Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman, said he would support the EC Lisbon plan of March
9 which stipulated that Bosnia would be composed of several national units,
but that the current borders of the republic would remain intact.
However, EC diplomats in London said Croatia and Serbia were working on
dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina between them, as witness the recent declaration
of a Croatian-run state within a state in western Hercegovina.
Mr Silajdzic yesterday said Mr Boban and Mr Karadzic had met in early July
in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, where the Serbs agreed to recognise the
Croatian region of Herceg-Bosnia, with a possible link to Zagreb. In return
Mr Boban had promised not to interfere in northern Bosnia, and called for
large population shifts aimed at creating ethnically clean areas.
Both Mr Karadzic and Mr Boban denied meeting each other.

FT  17 JUL 92 / Carrington sticks doggedly to EC remit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMFORTABLY ensconced on a settee in the chairman's office of Christie's,
the auctioneers, Lord Carrington does not look like a man under fire.
Indeed, it almost seems as if he is daring those, like the French
government, who want to transform the European Community's peace conference
on Yugoslavia, over which he presides, into a wider international forum, to
do their worst.
'I was employed by the European Community. The Foreign Ministers of the EC
are meeting in Brussels on Monday. If they want to do something different,
that's absolutely fine with me.' But he is quick to make clear he still
feels he has a useful job to do and does not despair of the current
negotiations on a Bosnian or overall Yugoslav settlement.
Nor does he believe an alternative to the EC conference would do any better.
'The problems are not going to go away by finding a new forum. One has to
recognise that a new forum other than the EC would be much more unwieldy.
And there are certain other difficulties involved in such a procedure, if it
involves the United Nations and permanent members of the Security Council.
'The Russians and the Chinese have recognised Serbia and Montenegro as the
new Yugoslavia, which the EC and the Americans have not. And when you are
talking about minorities, one would have to consider whether some permanent
members of the Security Council were necessarily the most suitable people to
talk about minorities.'
He clearly had Russia in mind, though he did not mention any names.
What then is Lord Carrington's plan to break the present deadlock in the
negotiations being held in London between the three warring Bosnian parties?
He does not believe there is any real chance of negotiating a ceasefire that
will stick at the moment, despite the protestations of all the parties that
they want one.
So a different approach must be attempted, in which a halt to the fighting
will be the end product rather than the precondition of a political
settlement.
'What the Moslems are saying is that either there will be military
intervention by the United Nations or we die. It is not my job to talk about
military intervention or what the UN ought to do. What I'm saying is that
there is a slim possibility that you could get an agreement between the
three communities on a constitution of an independent Bosnia so that the
reasons for fighting would no longer be there.
'I think it's a slim chance, but it's one which I think the Moslems ought to
take because the outlook for them is very serious in the absence of a
settlement. This is particularly so, since in the past neither the Serbs nor
Croats have made any pretence about favouring a partition of Bosnia.'
Lord Carrington stresses that his own aim is to stop Bosnia from being
partitioned. He is 'increasingly irritated' by the attempt to saddle him
with the so-called 'cantonisation' plan of March this year, which has been
interpreted by critics as breaking up Bosnia into a number of constituent
national units, and which was subsequently rejected by the Moslems.
'They all agreed on a set of principles, including the Moslems, providing
for a good deal of autonomy for the three communities under a federal state.
This was one of the reasons why the Community actually recognised
Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence.'
As late as April, the Moslems reiterated that the principles of this draft
constitution were acceptable to them. But subsequently they made clear they
were no longer prepared to negotiate on those principles and repeated their
demands for a unitary state.
'They are now talking to Mr Jose Cutileiro (the EC mediator, for whom Lord
Carrington has the highest regard) about their own plan which is simply
going back to the old constitution. I think that will almost certainly be
rejected by the other two sides.'
Lord Carrington insists he is not proposing a simple break-up of Bosnia into
three ethnically homogeneous geographical areas.
'What I have in mind is a certain degree of local autonomy for ethnic
people, not geographical boundaries in the sense that you have one slab
which is Serbian, another that is Croat and another that is Moslem, because
the whole thing is a patchwork quilt anyway.'

GREEK purchases of electricity from Bosnia-Hercegovina have come under US
scrutiny as a possible violation of the UN-led international embargo on
trade with Serbia.
According to the state-owned Public Power Corporation, Greece receives up to
200 MW of electricity daily, mainly in peak consumption hours, from a power
station at Trebisnyica in Hercegovina.
The power is transferred to Greece through the Serbian and Macedonian grids.
The PPC is liable for transport charges of over Dollars 20,000 monthly for
use of the Serbian grid, payable to Belgrade.
The US embassy in Athens has asked for clarification of the arrangement on
the grounds that it could amount to sanctions-breaking by Greece, according
to foreign ministry officials. The Greek view is that power supplies should
not be affected by the embargo since international transit traffic across
Serbia is still permitted.
President Ion Iliescu yesterday fended off press allegations that Romania
had broken the embargo on Yugoslavia, by saying his country did not have
total control over River Danube traffic in its domain, Reuter reports from
Bucharest.
'We can control only what is on Romanian territory and loading points in
Romanian ports,' he said.
Several Western news agencies have reported recently that Romania was
breaking the UN embargo by allowing oil and other commodities to slip into
Yugoslavia along the river.

powerful industrial lobby for his tight rein on credit, came as the Russian
parliament voted to cut VAT, the main source of government revenue.
The rate will come down from 28 per cent to 20 per cent from January 1, and
to 15 per cent immediately on some 'socially necessary' goods, mainly basic
foodstuffs.
Parliament also began amending the government's budget, agreeing a huge list
of costed and costly changes which early yesterday evening amounted to a
rise in the projected deficit to Rbs1.5 trillion, with more to come.
The effect of the developments is further to weaken the government's hold
over the budget deficit and rapidly-growing credits to industry.
The VAT decision was a compromise with the government which wanted no cut.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, warned that other taxes would
have to rise.
Mr Matiukhin's most likely replacement, according to officials in the
government and parliament yesterday, is Mr Victor Gerashchenko, former
chairman of the Soviet Central Bank, Gosbank. Mr Gerashchenko was on a
shortlist for the job in June when Mr Matiukhin's previous request to resign
was turned down narrowly by the Russian parliament, and now seems to have
emerged as the front runner.
If Mr Gerashchenko succeeds to what is the hottest central bank chair in the
world, it will for a man who was himself dismissed from his Gosbank post,
after the August coup, by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, for
alleged complicity. He has been criticised by Russian radicals for alleged
complicity in concealing Communist Party funds and in propping up the old
regime.
The end of Mr Matiukhin must be seen as a further victory for the
industrialists' lobby, who have a strong showing in the cabinet. In the end
the government withdrew support and let him fall, with only 15 deputies
voting against accepting his resignation to 154 for.
Mr Konstantin Borovoi, president of the new Party of Economic Freedom and a
leading Russian businessmen, said yesterday that the holding of people,
often on sentences of 15 years or more for behaviour considered normal in
market economies, was 'absurd' when Russia was attempting to attract foreign
partners, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Some 127,000 people convicted of 'economic crimes,' many of which are no
longer classified as illegal, are being held in prisons in the former Soviet
Union. In some cases, people are still being sentenced under extant
Soviet-period legislation for 'speculation' (selling) and other 'crimes.'
Mr Vladimir Bukovsky, a Russian dissident himself imprisoned then exiled in
the seventies, said 'there are some people in jail for real crimes, and we
would not defend them. But most are in jail for buying and selling, or for
changing money.'

FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Italy squeezes credit to defend
currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY was forced into an even tighter credit squeeze last night after the
Bank of Italy reacted immediately to the German discount rate rise.
The bank signalled its determination to defend the lira by raising the
official discount rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per cent in swift reaction
to the Bundesbank's move.
At the same time the bank's short-term interest rates on funds advanced to
commercial banks were also increased by 0.75 percentage points, to 15.25 per
cent. The rates will add to the already high cost of servicing Italy's debt
and put further pressure on the delicate financial state of many industrial
companies.
The bank's signal to the markets relieved pressure on the lira, which ended
the day at L758.35 against the D-Mark, marginally below Wednesday's close.
But at one stage, before the Bundesbank decision was known, the lira was
being traded at the record floor level of L761.25 against the German
currency. This compares with the L765 permitted against the D-Mark within
the European exchange rate mechanism.
This has been the third time in 45 days that the Bank of Italy has raised
the official discount rate, as the lira has come under pressure from
speculators concerned about the country's deteriorating public finances.
The bank has also been obliged to intervene by buying D-Marks. Interest
rates in Italy are now at their highest levels since 1986.
It is also the second time in almost seven months that the Italian central
bank has been obliged to react to German interest rate increases. However,
last December the bank waited three working days before countering the
German central bank's move.
Although reluctant to heighten the credit squeeze in an economy showing
timid signs of emerging from recession, the Bank of Italy has consistently
stuck by its policy of exchange rate stability. In the 12 months to May
Italy's foreign currency reserves have dropped from L58,692bn to L34,057bn,
a sizeable part drained by defence of the currency. In addition, in the run
up to the April general elections about L2,000bn worth of gold was sold.
Unofficial estimates suggest that every percentage point increase in the
discount rate raises the cost of servicing Italy's debt stock by L13,000bn
in a year. If current rates are sustained, this is likely to have an impact
on the budgetary needs which were redefined only last Friday in an emergency
budget generating an extra L30,000bn in fresh revenues and expenditure cuts.
A spokesman for Confcommercio, the traders' association, warned last night
of the dangers to business. 'This means money will cost us between 17 and 21
per cent, which in turn means the country is moving down a slope to
recession which will be difficult to resolve.'
He added that the credit squeeze threatened to kill many small enterprises.

Rail privatisation could create Britain's biggest bureaucratic complexity
since the introduction of rationing, Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, warns.
Sir Bob warns of possible difficulties arising from charging for the use of
railway tracks. Under government plans, train services will be handed over
to the private sector, but tracks will remain in the hands of a BR body,
Railtrack.
Other aspects of the white paper win a cautious welcome from Sir Bob.
Franchising out the passenger services, he says, may well produce gains for
passengers by unlocking entrepreneurial flair. A challenge to us all, Page

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gardini to buy drinks group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES, AP-DJ and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, FLORENCE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Raul Gardini, the Italian industrialist, is buying the Italian food and
drinks group Nuova GIA in a transaction worth about Dollars 300m, agencies
report from Milan.
A spokesman said Mr Gardini was making the purchase through Garma, in which
he holds 84 per cent, and Mr Giulio Malgara, the former European chief of
The Quaker Oats Co, the remainder.
The GIA group controls the Levissima mineral water brand as well as coffee,
biscuit and soft drink products. Its businesses generate an annual turnover
of about L330bn.
GIA, which was closely held by the Berger family with minority stakes owned
by the Sopaf investment bank of Jody Vender and the Luti group, owns 67.5
per cent of Crippa e Berger, which manufactures and distributes Caffe Hag, a
decaffeinated coffee, and the Levissima mineral water group.
The acquisition will lift the Gruppo Gardini's annual revenue in the foods
and drinks sector to L2,330bn (Dollars 2.06bn). Of this amount, the
international Barry cacao products line accounts for L700bn and France's
Vital-Sogeviandes meat products account for L1,300bn.
*****
ITALMOBILIARE, the key holding of businessman Mr Giampiero Pesenti, said
consolidated net profit in 1991 fell 7.8 per cent to L115.3bn from L125.1bn
in the previous 12 months, AP-DJ reports from Milan. It operates in real
estate and financial services, and controls leading cement group
Italcementi.
Consolidated shareholders equity rose 16 per cent to L1,724bn from L1,484bn,
Italmobiliare said in a statement following its board of directors meeting.
The diversified holding said parent company net profit for the year was
L44.77bn, little changed from L44.82bn a year earlier.
*****
FONDIARIA, which controls insurer La Fondiaria, said a broad review of its
operations would be completed by next September, Reuter reports from
Florence.
The group said that its insurance activities were going through a
consolidation phase and Fondiaria will continue to examine the sale of
non-strategic assets. A 10-member panel is conducting the review of its
business activities.
Italian press reports say that Fondiaria's controlling shareholders,
Ferruzzi Finanziaria and Camillo De Benedetti were at odds over Fondiaria's
expansion strategy.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK still wins most foreign projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN continues to attract the lion's share of inward investment into the
European Community, in spite of a fall in the number of new projects because
of the continuing international recession.
Figures released yesterday by the Invest in Britain Bureau show that
overseas companies are still investing more in the UK than in any other EC
country. It is thought that the UK could be accounting for about a third of
all incoming EC investment.
According to the bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry,
overseas companies endorsed 332 investment projects in the UK during the 12
months to the end of March. There were 350 in the previous year.
US and Japanese companies are channelling nearly 40 per cent of EC direct
investment into the UK. Germany and France are also investing heavily in the
UK.
Mr Malcolm Day, director of the bureau, said a fall from the peak number of
investments recorded in 1990-91 was understandable. Current inquiries from
overseas were showing another increase, he added.
Britain's promotional efforts to attract a continuing flow of corporate
investment would have to be maintained, he said. Particular emphasis will be
placed on medium-sized to small businesses, and Malaysia, Indonesia,
Singapore and Hong Kong will be targeted in the next 18 months.
About half the proposed new investment in the UK is by foreign companies
that are already established in the UK. Japanese companies are extending
their investment beyond manufacturing to include research and development
facilities. Many of the incoming companies are, according to the DTI,
spending more on training than their British competitors.
The investment projects approved in the year to March are expected to create
nearly 23,000 new jobs and to safeguard nearly 29,000 more.
Wales was particularly successful in securing new investment - attracting 71
projects - although Scotland and Northern Ireland were also chosen by a
significant number of companies as suitable investment locations.
The bureau provides no estimate of the value of recorded inward investment.
Among the largest projects in 1991-92, however, was a decision by Sony, the
electronics group, to invest Pounds 144m in expanding in Wales, and Kimberly
Clark, the US consumer products company, to spend Pounds 100m in south
Humberside.

FT  16 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie unable to hold above 2,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by the UK equity market to extend the recovery of the previous
session faded away yesterday as investors grew increasingly nervous ahead of
this morning's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. Firmness
in the D-Mark emphasised fears that the German central bank might tighten
policy today, and cast deeper clouds over prospects for UK interest rates.
Blue chip share prices opened strongly, as an initial gain in the September
futures contract on the FT-SE Index buttressed hopes for an extension of the
recovery seen at the close of the previous session. The Footsie quickly
advanced by 17.1, managing once again to move above the 2,500 mark, which
has proved an elusive target recently.
It was soon clear, however, that institutional buying support was sadly
lacking and, as the premium on the Footsie contract faded away, so did the
gain on the underlying index. Although the market held in positive territory
for the rest of the day, there was little genuine support. A sluggish start
on Wall Street, which was 5.68 Dow points off in UK hours, left London to
close in lifeless trading.
The FT-SE Index ended just a net 2.4 up at 2,486.4. Seaq volume remained
low, with the 404m-share total swollen by the completion of Tuesday
afterover of 374.1m on Tuesday represented customer, or retail, business of
only Pounds 854.3m, still a dismal figure from the point of view of the
London-based securities industry.
The lack of investment interest was reflected in the expectedly poor start
for Anglian Group, which opened at a discount to the share offer price after
a poor response to the public offer. Tomorrow brings the start of dealings
in MFI Furniture, which had a similarly unsuccessful journey through the
public sale process. Shares in Wellcome edged higher as the London market
awaited the close of the share offer period at the end of next week.
Traders said the market had been virtually put 'on hold' until the outcome
of today's meeting at the Bundesbank is known. Reiterated political support
for Britain's place in the European exchange rate mechanism left the City of
London to wait nervously for any decision on German monetary disciplines.
Two small trading programmes were identified yesterday, but such was the
lack of enthusiasm in the market that the overall trend of share prices was
not affected.
The banking sector continued to find some support, with the exception of
TSB, which gave ground as hopes for a bid receded. A few very small,
scattered gains among the store shares reflected little more than a
technical rally in a badly battered area of the stock market.
In its latest analysis of the UK economy, Goldman Sachs commented that
'there is now mounting evidence that the Conservatives' election victory has
not proved to be the catalyst required to shake consumers out of their
torpor. This is bad news for the manufacturing recovery which started in
February.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn hit by Amps and CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUSIC AND leisure group Thorn EMI suffered its third consecutive heavy fall
as the continuing worries over the possibility of a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiry into compact disc prices were joined by concern over its
exposure to auction market preferred stock (Amps).
The nervousness arose in several stocks yesterday with Amps exposure
following BET's decision to use a rights issue to repay some of its stock.
Thorn has Pounds 115m of Amps and Pounds 103m of redeemable convertible
preference shares on its balance sheet. There were suggestions as the market
opened that counting Amps in as debt would take Thorn's gearing from around
75 per cent to 115 per cent.
Analysts later pointed out that Thorn's gearing was ambiguous because the
company writes off so much goodwill in its accounts. However, this argument,
together with a strong rebuttal from the group, failed to stem the fall in
the shares, which closed 16 adrift at 783p.
Anglian dull
The market debut of Anglian Group, which manufactures and installs
replacement windows, went off with very few fireworks. The shares, offered
at 210p, opened around the 203p mark and ended the session at 204p.
Dealers said the stock had put up a creditable performance given that only 6
per cent of the shares offered to the public were taken up. Private
investors have shunned recent share issues.
The flotation of GPA, the aircraft leasing group, was pulled at the last
minute as international investors turned their backs on the stock, while the
flotation of 3i, the investment group, was postponed.
Shares in The Telegraph newspaper group opened at a substantial discount to
their offer price, while those in Kenwood, the electrical goods group,
managed a minor premium on their debut but have since fallen to a discount.
Barclays rallies
A long period of underperformance by Barclays, against the banking sector in
general and especially National Westminster, primarily caused by hefty
profits downgrades and a series of broker switch recommendations, was to
some extent reversed yesterday.
Nomura , the Japanese broking house, was believed to have recommended a
switch from NatWest to Barclays, predicting that Barclays would maintain the
current year's dividend. Its interim results are expected on August 6.
Barclays shares rallied 12 to 329p on heavy turnover of 5.8m, while NatWest
eased a fraction to 339p on 1.8m.
TSB continued to attract some above-average turnover, with 6.7m shares
traded by the close. There were hints of a seller of 5m TSB at a shade below
the market price.
Buoyed recently by suggestions that a stake-builder had been operating in
both the stock market and the traded options, the shares dipped 5 to 139p
amid a mixture of profit-taking and switching out of TSB and into Abbey
National. The latter edged up 2 to 289p.
Union Discount, which recently revealed heavy losses, remained under
pressure, closing 5 off at a 1992 low of 44p; in February 1991 the shares
were changing hands at 565p.
Templeton Galbraith, the investment management group, touched 313p before
finishing a net 20 higher at 309p after revealing that it is involved in
talks which could lead to a takeover bid for the group.
Composite insurances responded to a strong buy note issued by Robert Fleming
Securities, with Guardian Royal closing 2 ahead at 137p. The same broker was
also said to have been a keen supporter of Willis Corroon, as was Goldman
Sachs. Willis improved 5 to 213p.
Lasmo gave another dismal showing in a generally unhappy oils sector, the
shares sliding 5 more to 156p after a block of 1.4m was sold into the market
at 155p.
An initial setback in ICI, after Moody's Investors Service was said to be
considering downgrading some of the company's debt, was more than
counterbalanced by a move by James Capel, which turned more positive on the
stock. The shares gained 11 on the day at 1152p. Laporte, hit by downgrades
from a number of houses on consideration of difficult first-half trading,
retreated 10 to 563p.
Anglia Secure Homes shares almost halved, closing 5 1/2 down at 6 1/2 p
after the group revealed increased losses. Other casualties in a building
sector suffering from relentless waves of selling as hopes of interest rate
cuts recede every day included Taylor Woodrow, down 5 at 70p.
Alexander Proudfoot plunged 41 to 194p after an agency cross of 1.2m shares
at 200p.
Good results from Coca-Cola helped Cadbury-Schweppes to rise 11 to 492p.
Cadbury has a canning agreement with Coca-Cola in the UK, where it saw sales
growth of 17 per cent in soft drinks last year.
Results ahead of market expectations caused Bulmer to jump 16 to 300p.
Analysts, however, reported some nervousness among the Bulmer management
about the forthcoming flotation of rival cider maker Taunton, following
market talk that some institutions are considering switching out of Bulmer
and into the new stock.
Brewery group Whitbread receded 4 to 438p as County NatWest moved negative
on the stock, arguing that its high exposure in south-east England, low
earnings growth and expensive rating could hamper recovery.
The news that European and domestic short haul cabin crew at British Airways
have voted for strike action over pay and conditions weakened sentiment in
the shares, which declined 5 to 273p.
A profits downgrade from one of the company's brokers left Ocean Group 7
lighter at 242p. Charterhouse Tilney shaved its current-year figure by
Pounds 3m to Pounds 44m, and the following year's by Pounds 4m to Pounds
49m. The broker blamed the cut on 'weaker trading in the marine services
division'.
Speculation in the market that TI Group was about to sell its information
technology division to Cray Electronics boosted trade in TI and the shares
moved ahead 5 to 326p on high turnover of 4.4m. Sentiment was also helped by
a Smith New Court recommendation. The division was part of Dowty Group,
recently taken over by TI.
Wagon Industrial climbed 12 to 438p, with the company's broker Albert E.
Sharp reported to have been among the day's leading buyers.

FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases on setback in
industrial production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices finished on an easier note yesterday in the wake of some
mixed corporate earnings reports and news of the first decline in industrial
production for five months, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.97 at 3,345.42,
having spent the entire day in negative territory. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
eased 0.58 to 417.10, although the American SE composite managed to post a
slight gain of 0.79 at 386.87, while the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.26 to
575.47. Turnover on the New York SE came to 208m shares.
The morning's news of a 0.3 per cent dip in June industrial production, the
first fall in the indicator since January, and a 0.4 percentage-point
decline in capacity utilisation, provoked only a modestly negative reaction
from investors. Although the figures confirmed that the economic recovery
has been extremely sluggish, the very weak June employment report released
almost two weeks ago had prepared the market to expect lower output numbers.
Second quarter earnings continued to provide some direction for individual
stocks. AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65
1/2 in active trading in spite of reporting a net loss for the three months
of Dollars 166m. If write-offs related to a computer project and the
settlement of a class-action lawsuit are excluded, the carrier's underlying
operating earnings were stronger than expectations.
The news from AMR lifted other big airline stocks. Delta gained Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 56 7/8 , UAL Dollars 2 to Dollars 116 1/4 and USAir Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 .
Although American Home Products reported record second quarter earnings of
Dollars 296.1m (up 12 per cent from a year ago), the drugs group's shares
fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 3/4 , investors being disappointed by the
earnings per share.
TRW moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 on news of second quarter
net income of 96 cents a share, more than double last year's 39 cents,
although that included a big charge.
Motorola climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 82 3/4 after the company revealed,
late on Tuesday, second quarter earnings of Dollars 146m, up from Dollars
119m a year earlier.
Cigna lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 after the insurance giant warned
that its April-June profits will fall below the Dollars 1.25 a share
forecast by industry analysts.
On the Nasdaq market, Sunrise Technologies jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 9
5/8 after stating that the US Food and Drug Administration had cleared
Sunrise's holmium laser system for marketing in the treatment of glaucoma.
Herbalife fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 on a report that two senior
executives at the company have cut their holdings in Herbalife by more than
Dollars 2m since late May.
Canada
TORONTO closed modestly firmer after active trading. The TSE 300 index put
on 8.9 to 3,472.0, while rises outscored declines by 292 to 243. Volume
totalled 30.4m shares, valued at CDollars 354.5m.
Nine of the 14 sub-group indices were higher. Golds climbed a further 2.34
per cent as the New York spot gold price gained USDollars 2.80 to USDollars
353.85 an ounce. Two of the sub-group's most heavily weighted stocks,
American Barrick and Placer Dome, were up CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 34 5/8
and CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 13 3/4 respectively.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Germany calls the EMS tune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EYES were on the D-Mark yesterday, with dealers convinced that the
Bundesbank will tighten monetary policy when it meets today, writes Peter
John.
The worries left the German unit stronger against most European currencies,
although most dealers had already taken their positions. Apart from a spate
of D-Mark buying late in the day, activity was low.
The market's sense of unease began to build when yesterday morning's
Bundesbank repurchase tender resulted in a rise in the minimum-accepted
one-month rate to 9.65 per cent from 9.60. There were also comments from the
French, Belgian and Italian central banks suggesting they would remain in
line with German rates.
The market's conviction was given further impetus after the Bundesbank
announced that it would hold a press conference at the end of its council
meeting today.
The Bank of Italy had to intervene throughout the afternoon, selling D-Marks
to support the lira, which is languishing near the bottom of the EMS ladder.
By the close of European trading, the lira had weakened to L760.6 to the
D-Mark against a previous close of L758.2. The Italian central bank was
still operating into the European evening to defend the lira against heavy
speculative selling.
While most observers believe Germany will tighten its grip in some way,
there are three possibilities. The most worrying is that the Bundesbank will
alter the Lombard rate. This would almost certainly prompt a rate rise in a
number of European countries but was thought unlikely yesterday.
There is also a chance that the German bank will make a technical adjustment
to the amount which banks can borrow. However, the consensus was that the
Bundesbank would raise the discount rate, which affects domestic rates.
A dealer argued that if there is a technical adjustment or the discount rate
is tinkered with, there would be general relief and a jump in most
currencies against the D-Mark.
Nevertheless, Mr Akis Karayiannis, head of foreign exchange dealing at
Lehman Brothers, said the D-Mark's continued strength at a time when
everybody expects a discount rate move was a sign that the Bundesbank might
have to be more restrictive in the future. 'At this late stage we should
have seen short-covering of the dollar or selling of long D-Mark positions.
The worrying thing is that despite the consensus of a discount rate rise
rather than a Lombard rise, the mark was still strong.'
The dollar fell to DM1.477 from DM1.490. The pound was down to DM2.845 from
DM2.850, while the yen slipped to DM11.81 per Y1,000 from DM11.91. In New
York the dollar steadied to end at DM1.4815.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash futures active
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling continued to see very heavy trading as dealers speculated
ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting about the prospect of raised interest
rates.
The September contract opened two points lower and continued to fall until
it reached 89.77, at which stage it was discounting the possibility of a
quarter-point rise in interest rates to 10.25 per cent.
It steadied to close around 89.80, its lowest since becoming the front-month
contract. Turnover of around 47,000 lots by the official close was the
highest during the past three days of active business.
Dealers said that while sellers were offloading ahead of the prospect of a
rate rise there was also significant buying. The bull case was that if the
Bundesbank does not lift the Lombard rate but increases the less significant
discount rate, short sterling will bounce 20 points to around 90.00.
However, if a Lombard rise is announced there will only be a five-point
loss.
In the cash market, the three-month interbank rate, which tends to be seen
as the most significant indicator of future interest rates, also reflected
anticipation of an increase in the base rate. It climbed by two points to
close around 10 3/16 per cent. Meanwhile, the overnight rate was quoted at 9
7/16 per cent and one week money at 10 per cent.
The Bank of England was unable to provide much early assistance to correct
yesterday's forecast liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1bn. It gave cover
of only Pounds 42m, with dealers said to have been standing back in the hope
of longer term money.
However, it later provided short-term band 1 and band 2 loans. At noon, the
Bank provided a further Pounds 1.021bn of assistance, bringing total help
for the day to Pounds 1.063bn. The shortage was revised to around Pounds
1.2bn. The Bank later revised its liquidity forecast down by Pounds 100m to
Pounds 1.1bn and gave late assistance of Pounds 70m.
The German money market remained tense as speculation continued that the
Bundesbank would tighten policy at today's council meeting. A DM5.5bn
addition of funds to the market in a tender for securities repurchase funds
did little to relax the market. Call money remained at or just below 9.75
per cent.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: All eyes on Bundesbank as markets weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets seemed poised yesterday for a strong finish to the
week if the Bundesbank decides not to raise Germany's key Lombard rate at
its council meeting today. The UK government bond market could be the
biggest gainer, according to a broad range of economists and traders.
Yesterday, though, the hatches stayed firmly battened down as traders
awaited this morning's Bundesbank council meeting, with gilts suffering
another bad case of jitters. Other European bond markets remained in the
doldrums, waiting for fears of a hike in the Lombard rate - or some other
drastic tightening in monetary policy - to be dispelled.
Most observers by yesterday had largely ruled out the prospect of an
immediate increase in the Lombard rate, the emergency funding rate for banks
which is seen internationally as the key determinant of German monetary
conditions. However, views remained mixed on the authorities' likely stance
on two other options: a rise in the 8 per cent discount rate, which sets the
floor for money market rates, and a cut in the DM70bn quota for banks to
sell bills at the discount rate.
German money market rates crept up yesterday at the latest weekly repurchase
tender, though this was put down to technical factors and strong bidding for
funds rather than to any policy signal by the authorities. On Liffe, the
bund futures contract edged down to 87.72 from 87.74 in a moderately busy
day, as cash bunds also remained paralysed in a narrow range.
THE UK government bond market, which had recovered some of its composure on
Tuesday, slid again yesterday as traders positioned themselves for the worst
from Germany. The short gilt contract on Liffe lost around  1/4 of a point
to trade by the close at 89.77, a signal that the market expects the UK base
rate to creep back above its current 10 per cent level. Longer-dated gilts
also reflected the nerves, with the benchmark 9 per cent bonds due 2008
losing  1/4 of a point to finish at 101 9/32 , a yield of 8.85 per cent.
FRENCH government bond prices also slipped as traders returned from the long
Bastille Day holiday, shrugging off encouraging news that inflation had
slowed to 0.1 per cent in June. Prices fell to match losses in bunds this
week. The sale tomorrow of FFr11bn-FFr13bn of two and five-year notes
(BTANs) also left the market feeling bearish. The benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT
due 2002 slipped 0.15 of a point to a yield of 8.81 per cent, a spread over
bunds of around 80 basis points.
US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday in the wake of the first monthly
decline in industrial production since February.
In late trading,the benchmark 30-year government bond, which has recently
lagged behind the short end, was  23/32 higher at 104 9/32 , yielding 7.626
per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/8 at 101 7/16 , yielding
4.209 per cent.
Although the 0.3 per cent decline in industrial production and the 0.4
percentage point drop in capacity utilisation in June matched market
forecasts, the figures provided additional support for market sentiment
because they confirmed what June's employment report suggested - that the
economic recovery has been extremely weak.
Economists were quick to warn that production levels would remain sluggish
in the coming months due to poor growth in factory orders and relatively
high inventory levels.
In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the system
through Dollars 1.5bn in customer repurchase agreements in an attempt to
counter the slight firmness of Fed funds, which were trading at 3 3/8 per
cent, slightly higher than the Fed's target of 3 1/4 per cent.
PROFIT-taking wiped out some of the recent gains in Japanese government
bonds, despite an improvement in early trading in Tokyo. Data on industrial
output (down 1.9 per cent in May) and bankruptcies (up 30 per cent in June)
gave further evidence of economic weakening. But the official line on the
lack of need for a discount rate cut remained unchanged. The yield on the
benchmark bond No 129, which opened at 5.19 per cent, fell to 5.15 per cent
before climbing to 5.22 in late trade.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Banco de Chile plans Dollars
75m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO de Chile, the country's largest private sector bank, is set to become
the first Chilean borrower to tap the international bond market since the
debt crisis of the 1970s.
The bank is planning to raise a Dollars 75m five-year funding next week from
a Eurodollar bond issue lead-managed by Bankers Trust International.
While borrowers from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela are now regular
visitors to the international market, Chilean banks and companies have been
able to raise funds at cheaper rates in their domestic markets.
Reform of the pension industry in the early 1980s encouraged the development
of a liquid domestic debt market. Chile is one of only a few countries in
the world where 20-year corporate bonds are actively traded.
Bankers said yesterday that few Chilean banks would be able to raise
international funds and on-lend to domestic companies at attractive rates.
Banco de Chile will use the proceeds to finance dollar loans to companies in
capital goods sectors.
Pensions reform was part of a structural adjustment which included the
privatisation of state industrial holdings and a reduction of Chile's
external borrowings. Foreign debt stands at around 55 per cent of gross
domestic product, down from over 100 per cent in 1987.
The government runs a small budget surplus, and the current account is in
balance, despite several years of strong economic growth.
Commercial bank loans to Chile trade at around 90 per cent of face value in
the secondary market, against 50 per cent of face value for Argentina and
under 40 per cent for Brazilian debt.
Banco de Chile has assets of around Dollars 4.5bn. As a leading commercial
lender, its fortunes are linked to the fortunes of the Chilean economy. It
is still tied to the aftermath of economic collapse in the late 1970s.
Around 70 per cent of each year's profit is paid to the central bank, which
took over the management of Banco de Chile's bad debt portfolio to save it
from liquidation.
Bankers Trust expects to price the Banco de Chile bonds to yield around 2
per cent more than US Treasury paper of the same maturity, similar to the
yield spread of benchmark Mexican bond issues.

strategy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert yesterday urged investors to find a
quick solution to the strategic questions that threaten to undermine the
Belgian bank's shareholder structure.
But the board failed to indicate whether the bank would be better off
forging commercial links with an international or a domestic partner.
The group's shareholders are split over strategy. BBL is under pressure from
Internationale Nederlanden (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, to
enter into a form of collaboration. At the same time, influential Belgian
investors - notably Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the holding company - would
like BBL to link up with Credit Communal, the publicly-owned Belgian credit
institution.
ING announced on Tuesday it had increased its stake in the Belgian bank to
just over 10 per cent. At yesterday's board meeting, BBL directors 'took
note' of ING's wishes, and said they wanted to position the bank 'favourably
for its further development'. They urged shareholders 'to find a rapid
solution in order to ensure the stability of its shareholding'. Another
board meeting is fixed for September 17, but a BBL spokesman said: 'The
discussion is not really in the boardroom any more - it's rather a debate
between investors.'
A report to the bank's executive committee by Credit Suisse First Boston has
indicated an international strategy would offer more advantages to BBL than
a domestic move. BBL managers have also indicated they would prefer an
international link-up.
BBL's complex shareholder structure is dominated by GBL, which controls
24.16 per cent of the bank directly and through subsidiaries. The holding
company is headed by Mr Albert Frere, who is believed to favour keeping BBL
Belgian. Last week he and his subsidiaries sold a 5.7 per cent stake in BBL
to Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, which has Credit Communal as its
principal shareholder.
GBL also heads a long-standing syndicate of BBL's main shareholders, which
must offer their shares to GBL first if they decide to sell. The
first-refusal clause in the syndicate agreement expires at the end of this
year.

<TEXT>
SECOND-quarter results from four medium-sized US banks yesterday offered
more evidence of an earnings recovery in the sector.
Fleet Financial Group, the Providence, Rhode Island-based bank that last
year acquired the failed Bank of New England (BNE), produced a sharp rise in
net profits, from Dollars 28m to Dollars 71m.
Fleet's earnings rise - 45 cents against 23 cents in terms of earning per
share - was helped by gains on security sales, a lower level of
non-performing assets, and substantial contributions from the Massachusetts
branch operations of the former BNE.
Mr Terrence Murray, chairman, said the results were encouraging, but he
noted that bad debt provisions were increased by Dollars 40m during the
quarter. This was due to lingering uncertainty about the strength of the
economy in the north-east of the US.
He said Fleet's conversion and absorption of the former BNE branch franchise
would be completed by year-end.
The group's total workforce has meanwhile been reduced. At the time of the
acquisition last year, Fleet employed 18,000 people and BNE 11,000; the
combined workforce is now 2,000 less. Fleet's total assets at the end of
June were Dollars 45bn, compared with Dollars 32bn a year ago.
Bank of New York, meanwhile, announced a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter
net income, to Dollars 87m, or Dollars 1.05 per share. The profit rise was
helped by stronger fee income, wider spreads and lower bad debt provisions.
While second-quarter bad debt provisions were Dollars 106m against Dollars
127m a year ago, the level of total non-performing assets fell by 14 per
cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Non-performing commercial property assets declined by
12 per cent.
Two months ago, Bank of New York agreed to acquire the 65-branch New York
retail banking operations of Barclays Bank of the UK, a move that will boost
assets by Dollars 3.2bn. The Bank of New York's total assets at the end of
last month were Dollars 41.3bn.
Another profits rise was announced by Republic New York Corporation, the
holding company of Mr Edmond Safra's Republic National Bank and Manhattan
Savings Bank.
Republic said its net income rose 13.3 per cent to Dollars 63.9m. Earnings
per share were 9.1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.08.
The Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation, a prominent mid-western bank with
1,725 offices and Dollars 40.6bn of assets, said its net profits were 21 per
cent higher at Dollars 127.9m.

CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, warned yesterday
that its second-quarter results would be below analysts' expectations.
It gave no specific reason, and made the announcement at the instigation of
the New York Stock Exchange. Cigna shares fell by Dollars 1 1/8 on Tuesday
to Dollars 55 1/8 , before trading was halted. When trading resumed
yesterday morning, Cigna had recovered Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 .
Analysts had already been predicting a fall in earnings, year-on-year when
Cigna reports figures for the quarter on August 3. Earnings per share were
forecast, on average, to be around Dollars 1.25, compared with Dollars 1.88
in the same period a year earlier.
Most pundits had expected a good performance from the life and health
business, but warned that the property-casualty operations would be hit by
heavy catastrophe losses - including the impact of the Los Angeles riots,
the London bombings, and weather-related claims in the US.
Cigna's mortgage loan portfolio is also seen as a problem area, with the US
west coast property market continuing to weaken.

CSX, the US transportation group, plans to take a Dollars 450m after-tax
charge when it reports second-quarter results, writes Nikki Tait. The charge
is primarily to cover the buying-out of certain compensation arrangements
paid to train crews at the company's rail unit, CSX Transportation.
CSX had already taken a hefty Dollars 755m charge to earnings in 1991, to
cover severance payments for employees leaving CSXT as train crews are
reduced from three to two people. However, this assumed no buy-out of the
short crew allowance, and only a partial buy-out of productivity funds. CSX
shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 63 1/2.

<TEXT>
THE Securities and Exchange Commission, the US financial markets watchdog,
yesterday took on new powers that would make it easier for the agency to
discover whether US securities firms are in financial trouble, writes
Patrick Harverson.
The new rule gives the SEC the right to demand from holding companies
information about their securities subsidiaries, even if the parent is not
regulated by the agency.
The SEC hopes the rule will allow it to discover if a parent company is
having financial problems that could affect a securities firm.
The agency was granted authority to institute the new rule in a reform bill
prompted by the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Under the rule, parent companies of securities firms must file quarterly
financial statements giving information on its, and subsidiaries', exposure
to a variety of assets, including securities and commodities, real estate
holdings, and off-balance sheet derivatives such as interest-rate swaps.

GENERAL Electric, the US group with interests ranging from power systems to
financial services, yesterday turned in an 8 per cent improvement in
second-quarter earnings, in line with expectations, but said it would halt
its Dollars 10bn stock buy-back programme at the Dollars 5bn level.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company would complete the stock buy-back
programme before the end of the year. 'By taking this action during this
uncertain economic period, the company assures its triple A debt rating and
maintains the financial flexibility to take advantage of global recovery
opportunities.
'The company will, however, continue to repurchase on an ongoing basis
shares required for employee programmes. These purchases should amount to
approximately Dollars 400m annually.'
He added that GE had no plans for any significant acquisition.
For the second quarter, net earnings totalled Dollars 1.216bn, or Dollars
1.42 a share, against Dollars 1.131bn, or Dollars 1.30 in the same period of
1991. Consolidated revenues advanced 4 per cent to Dollars 15.4bn from
Dollars 14.8bn.
Net earnings for the first six months of 1992 rose 7 per cent to Dollars
2.274bn from Dollars 2.130bn. Earnings per share were 9 per cent higher at
Dollars 2.65 against Dollars 2.44. Consolidated revenues were up 3 per cent
at Dollars 28.9bn from Dollars 28.1bn.
During the quarter, GE's operating margin slid to 12.6 per cent from 12.9
per cent in the 1991 second quarter. The decline reflects significant
pricing pressures.
Earnings from GE's financial services grew 24 per cent, thanks to
double-digit increases at GE Capital, its main asset-holding arm and Kidder,
Peabody, its stock-broking arm.
The company said its NBC television network also had double digit growth.
GE will increase its quarterly dividend by 7.3 per cent, or 4 cents a share
to 59 cents effective with its September third-quarter dividend.

below expectations

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITABLE Life, the large but troubled US insurance company, yesterday
finally set the price at which it is selling shares to investors at Dollars
9 apiece. This is well below Equitable's initial expectations of Dollars 11
to Dollars 14.
The flotation of 43.5m shares is the final step in a lengthy conversion
process, transforming the Equitable from a mutual insurance company
(controlled essentially by its policyholders) to a conventional
shareholder-owned business. The conversion is the largest demutualisation
which has taken place in the US.
The first step in the demutualisation process took place last July when Axa,
the French insurer, agreed to invest Dollars 1bn in the Equitable in return
for a large minority stake in the US insurer when conversion took place. The
size of that stake depended on the price at which shares were floated;
yesterday's decision means that Axa will get 49 per cent of the common
stock.
Equitable's policyholders, who received a 'free' handout of shares in the
demutualisation process, will own about 19 per cent of the equity.
The flotation of shares to outside investors will raise only Dollars 361m.
Of this, Dollars 220m will go to pay dividends and expenses, and Dollars 72m
will fund cash payments and policy credits for policyholders. About Dollars
69m will be used to increase Equitable's statutory surplus.

<TEXT>
GANNETT, the US publisher of 81 daily newspapers, including USA Today,
yesterday said a recovery in advertising revenues helped it to a 4 per cent
rise in net profits for the second quarter of 1992.
The Virginia-based company said its second-quarter net profit was Dollars
98.745m, while earnings per share were 13 per cent higher at 69 cents.
Wall Street reacted favourably to the profit increase, marking the Gannett
share price Dollars 1 3/8 higher to Dollars 45 3/8 .
Gannett said its second-quarter operating revenues were 2 per cent higher at
Dollars 892.1m. Operating income for the quarter was, meanwhile, 9 per cent
improved at Dollars 176.7m.
The company said its newspaper publishing earnings rose due to higher
advertising and circulation revenues, along with significantly lower
newsprint costs.
At USA Today, the down-market national daily, paid advertising pages
increased by 3 per cent during the quarter.
Broadcasting revenues were unchanged at Dollars 97.5m as revenues from
Gannett's 10 television stations grew by 2 per cent and those from its 15
radio stations declined.
Revenues from Gannett's outdoor advertising division, the largest such
company in North America, fell 4 per cent to Dollars 66.8m in the quarter.
For the first six months of 1992, earnings per share were 16 per cent higher
at Dollars 1.07. Net income was Dollars 154.2m, compared with Dollars 145.1m
in the first half of 1991. Operating revenues for the first six months were
1 per cent better at Dollars 1.7bn.

WEAK gold price have claimed further casualties. Gengold, the gold arm of
the Gencor group, has been forced to mothball the developing Weltevreden
mine and shelve plans to deepen the No 6 shaft at Winkelhaak.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said work had been stopped at Weltevreden
because the gold price was 41 per cent lower than envisaged when the project
was undertaken. He said a price of R45,000 (Dollars 16,304) per kilogram
would be needed to restart the project. The current price is under R31,000
per kilogram.
Mr Maude said the Winkelhaak shaft would be viable if there could be
confidence of a gold price of R32,000 a kilogram. The price, however, was
weakening.
The average price received by group mines in the June quarter was R32,071
per kilogram. Previously announced plans to merge Winkelhaak and Kinross
Gold Mines would be delayed.
A feature of the group's results for the quarter was the substantial
contribution to profits from hedging, a practice Gengold has now adapted
with some enthusiasm. Mr Maude said the group had made hedging profits of
R16.8m during the quarter from the forward selling of nearly 147,000 ounces
of production.
He said hedging profits had accounted for about one-third of the 5 per cent
improvement in group after-tax profits, to R70.6m compared with the previous
quarter. Gengold mines hedge up to 20 per cent of production.
The R1.3bn first-phase capital programme for Oryx mine in the Orange Free
State is continuing.

RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the large RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group,
is to begin manufacturing cigarettes in Russia.
The US group announced it had reached a partnership agreement with AS-Petro,
a Russian cigarette manufacturer. It claims that this is the first major
investment by a foreign company in a private cigarette enterprise in Russia.
RJR said that it would make a 'substantial investment' in new equipment for
the factory, but disclosed no figures. It said that after the new machinery
was installed, RJR-Petro's annual production capacity would rise to 22bn
cigarettes, to make it Russia's largest cigarette producer.
American-blend brands 'will be phased in as component sourcing is resolved',
RJR said.

<TEXT>
GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US forest products group, has reported break-even
results for the second quarter, with a sharp drop in pulp and paper profits
partly offset by a big rise in lumber income.
The company announced earlier this month that its results would be 'slightly
better than break-even'.
The break-even figure, compared with net income of Dollars 29m, or 34 cents
a share, in the second quarter of last year when the company was helped by a
Dollars 29m after-tax gain on the sale of forests. Sales for the latest
quarter, at Dollars 3bn, were unchanged from last year.
For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 5m, or 6
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 5.88bn, against a net loss of Dollars
44m, or 51 cents, last year, on sales of Dollars 5.76bn.
*****
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, US business information group, yesterday posted
second-quarter net income of Dollars 128.8m, or 72 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 119.1m, or 67 cents, a year ago, writes Karen Zagor.
The company has restated its 1991 results to reflect new accounting
standards and the recognition of revenue for software services.
Revenues eased to Dollars 1.16bn from Dollars 1.17bn, reflecting the
divestiture of the communications unit of the company's IMS International
division. Revenue growth for Dun &amp; Bradstreet's portfolio of businesses rose
about 3 per cent in the quarter.
For the first six months, the company had net income of Dollars 227m, or
Dollars 1.27, against Dollars 217.5m, or Dollars 1.22 a year earlier.
Operating revenue slipped to Dollars 2.27bn from Dollars 2.29bn.
*****
American Home Products, the US pharmaceutical group, yesterday turned in
second-quarter net income of Dollars 296.1m, or 94 cents a share, up 12 per
cent from the previous year's earnings of Dollars 265.2m, or 84 cents,
writes Karen Zagor. Sales in the three months to June 30 rose 8 per cent to
Dollars 1.76bn from 1.62bn.
Shares in American Home Products closed Dollars 2 1/8 lower at Dollars 72
3/4 in active trading.
For the first half of 1992, the company's net income rose 14 per cent to
Dollars 702.4m, or Dollars 2.23, from Dollars 617.7m, or Dollars 1.96. Sales
grew 11 per cent to Dollars 3.75bn from 3.38bn.
*****
Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group was depressed by weak
aluminium prices in spite of record shipments, writes Barbara Durr in
Chicago.
The company reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 33.1m, or 56 cents
per share, a 46 per cent drop from last year's Dollars 61.4m, or Dollars
1.04. Revenues in the quarter ended June 30 were Dollars 1.49bn, compared
with Dollars 1.52bn a year ago.
In the first half, net income was Dollars 46.4m, or 78 cents per share, on
revenues of Dollars 2.82bn, compared with Dollars 88.9m, or Dollars 1.50, on
revenues of Dollars 2.89.
Shipments for the quarter were a record 393,400 metric tons, up 3.6 per
cent.

<TEXT>
TRW, the US automotive, space and information services group, yesterday
posted a 48 per cent improvement in second-quarter operating income to
Dollars 158m from Dollars 106m.
The company was boosted by strong gains from its automotive operations
offsetting declines from its space and defence business.
Sales advanced 9 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.15bn from Dollars
1.98bn.
The company's net profits were muddied by special items in both years.
Including one-time items, TRW had second-quarter net income of Dollars 60m,
or 93 cents a fully-diluted share, against Dollars 24m, or 39 cents, a year
earlier.
In the 1992 quarter, after-tax earnings were lifted by Dollars 4m, or 7
cents, from the sale of an investment. A year earlier, the company took an
after-tax charge of Dollars 18m, or 29 cents, on the divestment of a
European automotive business.
Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the results, marking TRW's shares
Dollars 1 3/8 higher to Dollars 56 3/8 at midday.
Mr Joseph Gorman, chairman and chief executive, attributed the company's
earnings improvement to cost-reductions and higher sales volume on the back
of investments in air bag and steering systems.
For the first half of 1992, TRW lifted net income to Dollars 101m, or
Dollars 1.58, compared with Dollars 59m, or 96 cents. Sales rose 7 per cent
to Dollars 4.19bn from Dollars 3.90bn while operating profits advanced 35
per cent to Dollars 295m from Dollars 219m.
TRW's automotive business brought in operating profits of Dollars 88m on
sales of Dollars 1.21bn in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 31m on
sales of Dollars 1.02bn a year earlier.
The space and defence segment saw operating profits slide to Dollars 55m
from Dollars 62m last year on sales which edged 3 per cent lower to Dollars
742m from Dollars 764m.

<TEXT>
PARKER PEN, the British-based company, has been fined Ecu700,000 (Dollars
615,601) by the European Commission for trying to prevent its German
distributor from exporting its pens to other EC countries.
The German company, Herlitz, has been fined Ecu40,000 for its involvement in
the illegal agreement.
The Commission said the deal - which was concluded in August 1986 - would
clearly have obstructed the achievement of the single European market and
was therefore 'a very serious infringement of EC law'. The illegal agreement
came to light after a Dutch importer of office furniture discovered it could
not buy Parker products from Herlitz except where Parker had given its
consent in writing.
Parker has managed to avoid a heavier fine by co-operating with Brussels. It
has drawn up a programme for its EC subsidiaries, showing them how to comply
with EC competition law. As a result, the Commission decided to fine Parker
only on the basis of its German sales rather than taking into account
EC-wide turnover.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO launches damage limitation
exercise - The Kuwaitis' efforts to rebuild their tarnished image in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) may be poised to take advantage of
falling share prices to increase its positions in some of its Spanish
industrial investments. This would offset some of the damage being done to
its image as a long-term investor in Spain by the collapse of its large
chemicals affiliate, Ercros.
An emergency meeting in Kuwait yesterday between the KIO management and the
Kuwaiti government, triggered by a growing row in Spain over the Ercros
crisis, decided to appoint Peat Marwick to investigate allegations of
mismanagement in KIO's Spanish empire and instructed KIO to seek advice
about how to 'safeguard and develop Kuwaiti investments in Spain'. It also
sought to protect Kuwait's reputation as an international investor.
The meeting coincides with suggestions in Madrid that the KIO could increase
its stake in the foods group, Ebro, in which it already has a 40.2 per cent
stake, and that it may be reconsidering its decision not to help rescue
Ercros, whose holding company and fertiliser operations filed for protection
from creditors last week. Peat Marwick is to report on its findings by
November.
While KIO battles to regain the confidence of Spanish bankers and ministers
who are angry with its refusal to pump fresh capital into Ercros, the
Kuwaiti agency is also being advised by Salomon Brothers on what to do with
the rest of its portfolio in Spain, which includes Ebro, the Prima property
group and the papermaker, Torras Papel.
KIO's management is understood to be keen to make good promises made to the
government that it intended to stay in Spain, but worries over the way
Ercros appears to have been abandoned to its fate have led to sharp falls in
the prices of shares in Ebro and Prima in Madrid.
Stock in Ebro, which KIO and its Spanish managers have built up into one of
the world's leading producers of long-grained rice, was trading yesterday at
Pta1,500, up strongly but still half their 1992 high, on remarks by Mr Pedro
Solbes, the agriculture minister, that KIO officials had told him they might
increase their position in the company.
Any further purchases by KIO might put the Kuwaitis into direct conflict
with Mr Javier de la Rosa, KIO's former adviser in Spain who has built up a
personal stake of about 20 per cent in Ebro this year.
But the most interesting prospect for KIO is Prima, whose shares have come
under heavy selling pressure and are now quoted in Madrid at around Pta1,800
each, down from Pta3,950 in March. At one point in 1991, they were trading
at Pta7,890.
In 1988, Grupo Torras, KIO's holding company in Spain, issued a Pounds 100m
Eurobond, redeemable at 125 per cent in August next year, that was
originally convertible into Torras shares. In 1990, however, KIO bought
Torras off the stock market and the convertibility of the bond was
transferred to Prima and a cash payment.
By pushing Ercros into receivership, KIO may have triggered one of the
default clauses in the bond. Ironically, if bond holders want it redeemed
now instead of in 1988, KIO could save itself some Pounds 36m as it is
redeemable this year at 102 per cent and it would also escape two coupon
payments before a put option becomes available next year.
That saving could be used to buy more of Prima's stock. Analysts agree in
Madrid that while Prima, like most property companies, is suffering from
falling property prices, its office portfolio in Madrid and Barcelona
remains one of the most attractive in Spain.
Last weekend, the KIO said it 'would be happy' to redeem the bond if holders
wanted it to. Salomon Brothers, the National Bank of Kuwait, Creditanstalt,
the Swiss Banking Corporation, James Capel and a Monaco-based broker are
understood to hold most of the bonds, either on their own accounts or for
clients.
Even without a default on the bond - which might unnecessarily damage KIO's
international investment reputation - the Ercros crisis has significantly
cheapened some of KIO's more attractive assets in Spain, opening up an
opportunity for it to demonstrate its commitment to the country.
Nevertheless, Mr Ali Rashid al-Bader, KIO president, badly wants to be rid
of Ercros, which owes Dollars 15bn. In order to do so without putting 10,500
Spaniards out of work, he is pressing hard to find buyers for all of the
Ercros divisions.
Freeport MacMaRon, the US commodities group which earlier this year agreed
to lead a joint venture into which Ercros would place its mining and
fertiliser businesses, has a team working with Manufacturers Hanover bank in
Madrid to find ways of taking full control of the divisions and of securing
assistance from governments in regions affected by Ercros plant closures.
A number of European chemicals companies, most notably Hoechst, are said to
be interested in taking over Erkimia, the Ercros chemicals division, in
Catalonia.
While the Spanish regional administrations try to secure the Ercros jobs in
their regions, both KIO and the Spanish government remain adamant they will
not pump more money into the group. Following yesterday's meetings, Mr Al
Bader may be forced to feed the group small amounts of money over the summer
to prevent plants closing. If he is unable to find buyers, KIO faces the
distasteful prospect of an outright Ercros bankruptcy.

Mondadori purchase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FININVEST, the media, retailing and investment group controlled by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian magnate, saw 1991 net profits fall 68 per cent to
L61.3bn (Dollars 54m).
The sharp reduction reflected the effects of absorbing Mondadori, the
publishing group purchased last year. As a result, the group's net debt rose
21 per cent last year to L2,938bn, higher than forecast by analysts, and
compares with net assets of L1,178bn.
The Mondadori purchase also underlined that last year's growth in sales was
generated by acquisitions. The group's consolidated turnover rose 33 per
cent from L7,561bn to L10,096bn. With Mondadori stripped out sales growth
was down to 14 per cent.
Fininvest, which is Italy's third-largest private group after Fiat and
Ferruzzi-Montedison, invested heavily, with L1,158bn spent on cinema and
television rights to support its core media business. The group said 1992
consolidated turnover could be L12,300bn.
Despite the stagnant state of the Italian economy, the group said increased
efficiency led to a 10 per cent rise in operating profits to L544bn.
However, this was not reflected in after-tax profits because of growing
financial costs.
The Berlusconi family controls all but 10 per cent of minority stakes in the
group's two publicly-quoted companies, Mondadori and Standa, the store
chain. The group, Europe's largest media empire after Germany's Bertelsmann,
gave no hint of any flotations.
The group's media activities have come under the scrutiny of the media
ombudsman in Italy after newspaper editors and other television competitors
claimed Mr Berlusconi was stifling competition and manipulating the
advertising market. Mr Berlusconi is currently contesting a ruling that
would cap television advertising receipts which could entail a potential
loss of L300bn in advertising receipts.

with Alusuisse
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE plans of Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) for substantial expansion
in Europe were severely dented yesterday as it called off negotiations about
a joint venture with Alusuisse-Lonza.
The companies had hoped to set up a joint venture which would have invested
SFr300m (Dollars 210m) to modernise and expand most of Alusuisse's aluminium
operations in Switzerland.
The aim was to expand their position in aluminium flat-rolled products for
the European automotive, industrial and aerospace markets, which are
forecast to have high growth rates during the next decade.
If the deal had gone through Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium group,
would have immediately taken 60 per cent of Alusuisse's smelter, ingot
casting operations and rolling facilities in the Canton of Valais. These
produce high-technology products with high added-value such as
'superplastic' aluminium sheet for cars and a thick hard-alloy plate used in
machinery manufacture.
However, Alcoa said yesterday that 'in spite of intensive effort' the
companies 'were not able to establish a satisfactory basis for
co-operation.'
Neither company would give any details about what caused the talks to break
down. An Alusuisse official said there were differences of opinion during
negotiations, which started in November last year.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: AMR Dollars 166m loss an
'enormous disappointment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, parent company of American Airlines and one of the 'big three' carriers
in the US, yesterday led what is likely to be a dismal quarterly reporting
season for the nation's airline industry with a Dollars 166m loss after tax
in the three months to end-June.
Mr Robert Crandall, American's chairman, described the figures as 'an
enormous disappointment' - and pinned the blame on domestic fare wars, plus
rising fuel costs. 'Operating results were very adversely affected by the
need to match discounted fares of our competition,' he said, 'and secondly,
by continuing increases in fuel prices.'
Part of the deficit came from one-off items - a Dollars 109m provision on a
now-suspended hotel and car reservation system project, and Dollars 9m to
cover American's share of a recent class action settlement, centring on
price-fixing allegations.
But even without these items, AMR would have posted an after-tax loss of
Dollars 48m, or 64 cents a share, compared with a Dollars 10m profit in the
same three months a year earlier. At the operating level, there was a small
profit, but a 14.1 per cent rise in operating expenses year-on-year, to
Dollars 3.53bn, easily outweighed the 12.3 per increase in revenues at
Dollars 3.59bn.
In April, American tried to overhaul domestic ticket pricing by eliminating
its numerous discount offers in favour of a four-tier fare system.
Yesterday, Mr Crandall admitted the initiative had been undermined: 'Our
competitors have chosen to continue filing many different fares, thus
proliferating complexity and preventing 'value pricing' from working as it
should. Thus, despite strong traffic growth in the second quarter, yield
declined by 3.6 per cent - a very unfortunate result,' he said.
The Dallas-based company was one of only two US carriers to make a profit in
the first three months of 1992. However, the second-quarter deficit means
AMR is now posting a net loss of Dollars 146m for the first half, on
revenues of Dollars 7.09bn. In the first six months of 1991, there was a
Dollars 185m deficit, on revenues of Dollars 5.96bn.
AMR had already warned of a second-quarter loss and, in the event, the
airline's operating results were better than some pundits had feared. Shares
in AMR itself rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 yesterday, and other
carriers' stocks also enjoyed a modest rally. Delta was up Dollars 1 1/2 at
Dollars 56 7/8 and UAL gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 116 1/4.

stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels group, has topped bids by rival hotel
groups Intercontinental and Ramada to win control of the Duna
Intercontinental, one of Hungary's leading hotels.
Marriott will pay more than Dollars 20m for the state shareholding in the
hotel, a price which was influenced by the shortage of hotel space and prime
sites for development in Budapest.
The Duna Intercontinental went to Marriott after three rounds of bidding
described by the State Property Agency, the Hungarian privatisation
authority, as a close battle.
The SPA admitted it would have been easier to sell the hotel to the
Intercontinental group, whose bid was a close second. It already held a
franchise agreement with Hungarhotels, the Hungarian state hotel chain which
operated the Duna Intercontinental.
But the agency said it had not managed to come to terms with
Intercontinental on a valuation of the franchise contract. Moreover, the SPA
feels that its decision dispels scepticism about its commitment to
competitive bidding in substance as well as form.
The transaction is the first belated result of Hungary's two-year drive to
privatise Hungarhotels, Danubius and Pannonia, the three state-owned hotel
chains.
With the revenues from the disposals of individual hotels, the authorities
are trying to reduce the hotel groups' debts and make the pared-down chains
more attractive candidates for privatisation.
The government plans this autumn to float Danubius and Pick Szeged, the meat
and salami producer. These will be sold off through the stock market,
reviving this form of privatisation.
Preference will be given to small domestic investors in both privatisation
issues, whose planned structure bears strong parallels to the British model.
Under consideration, at least for the Pick public offering, are price
discounts of about 10 per cent, deferred payment or bonus shares.
Nevertheless, the agency said there would be plenty of shares left for
international investors.
James Capel, the UK investment bank advising on both transactions, said that
Danubius would seek a listing on SEAQ International in London. The advisers
said they would try to place privately about 40 per cent of Pick, mainly in
the US.

<TEXT>
Mainly as a result of stringent control of costs and working capital,
Denmans Electrical lifted interim pre-tax profit by 43 per cent, from Pounds
574,000 to Pounds 823,000.
However, directors of this USM-traded group stressed that results were
becoming more seasonally biased, and the percentage increase should not
necessarily be expected to be held over the full year.
They reported that all sections of the business were trading profitably even
though the results were affected by bad debt provisions 'well above historic
levels.'
The group was developing its manufacturing and importing businesses and,
consequently, lighting was becoming an increasingly important part of
turnover.
For the half year ended March 31 1992 sales rose to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds
17.8m).
Interest charges were cut to Pounds 97,000 (Pounds 152,000). Earnings per
share worked through at 12.7p (8.8p) and the interim dividend is raised from
1.65p to 1.8p.

profit came to Pounds 731,000, against Pounds 860,000.

(4.7p) and the dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 1.375p.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Beckenham in loss and seeks Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BECKENHAM GROUP, the USM-traded engineer, yesterday called on shareholders
for Pounds 1.9m net via a rights issue and also announced that it ran up a
loss for the six months to end-April.
The proceeds of the cash call would be used to continue the restructuring,
strengthen the balance sheet and provide additional working capital.
Turnover for the half year fell to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 26.5m) and at the
pre-tax level the loss worked through at Pounds 771,000 compared with
previous profits of Pounds 746,000.
Directors described the result as unsatisfactory but said it was a
'considerable improvement' over the preceding six months' loss of Pounds
6.2m.
The half-year deficit included a full provision of Pounds 164,000 against
the effects of Olympia &amp; York, one of its larger customers, being placed in
administration together with reorganisation and closure costs amounting to
Pounds 386,000.
Further reorganisation costs would be incurred in the second six months but
the directors anticipated that reorganisation would be virtually completed
by October 31.
Interest charges rose by Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 364,000, well down,
however, on the preceding half year's figure of Pounds 741,000.
As a result of disposals, bank borrowings at June 30 totalled Pounds 6.7m
(Pounds 9.7m at October 31 1991). Further disposals, together with the
proceeds from the rights issue, should reduce indebtedness by a
'substantial' amount.
Losses per share were 1.4p (earnings 1p) and the interim dividend is omitted
 -0.5p was paid previously but the final was passed.
The fully underwritten rights issue is of 35.51m shares on a 3-for-4 basis
at 6p per share - in line with yesterday's close, down 1/2p.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kalon bid referral is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, president of the board of trade, was yesterday urged
to refer Kalon's hostile all-paper bid for Manders (Holdings), its
Wolverhampton-based paint-making rival, to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in a parliamentary early day motion signed by 49 MPs.
Signatories included Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's front bench spokeswoman on
City affairs, Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the all-party select
committee on trade and industry, and Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for
Wolverhampton South West.
Noting that a takeover would give Kalon more than 70 per cent of the
own-label paint market, the motion argues that a merger would 'threaten a
reduction in competition against the public interest.'
Kalon's objective is 'to achieve an increased market share of the paint
market, and in the process cut 500 jobs from the workforce of a combined
group,' the motion states.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hitch hits Walbrook rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL to rescue Walbrook Insurance, a subsidiary of London United
Investments which is in administration, has been referred to the US
Securities and Exchange Commission following questions over the procedures
it has followed.
Walbrook stopped paying claims on May 29, two years after it ceased to write
new business. It told leading policyholders in Chicago and London over the
last few days that it had a balance sheet deficit of Pounds 170m.
The directors of the company are urging the policyholders to endorse a
proposed informal scheme of arrangement which would leave the existing
executives in charge and require large creditors to subscribe to redeemable
preference shares equivalent to 60 per cent of the amount they are owed.
However, Mr John Dingell, chairman of the US House of Representatives
sub-committee on oversight and investigations, wrote to Mr Richard Breeden,
chairman of the SEC, on July 9 calling on him to examine the nature of the
Walbrook offer.
He has asked whether the stock offering should be covered by the
registration and disclosure requirements of Federal securities laws; whether
the Walbrook directors can disclaim legal liability for the offering; and
whether the SEC is examining the 'propriety' of the offering.
The letter follows correspondence to the sub-committee from the receiver of
Transit Casualty, a Missouri-based insurance company which went into
receivership in 1985 and which is one of Walbrook's largest creditors.
Transit has been leading a group of policyholders which oppose the offer
from Walbrook and would prefer to place the company in provisional
liquidation.
It applied last month in the high court for a liquidation order, and its
hearing has been postponed until early August.
Those opposing the plan are trying to avoid the slow-moving schemes of
arrangement established for the so-called KELM group of companies to which
many are also creditors and which are other subsidiaries of London United
Investments.
The SEC refused to comment yesterday on whether it had launched an
investigation. An official said that public offerings had to be registered
with the SEC before they could be announced, but private placements did not.
Walbrook said yesterday that it had not been contacted by the SEC, but its
lawyers were asking the commission to see whether it wants any information
on the offer.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Waste Management advances by 51%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management International, the UK-quoted group, yesterday reported a 51
per cent increase in profits in its first reporting period after its Pounds
405m global share offering in April.
Pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 62.7m on sales ahead
some 30 per cent at Pounds 382m.
Some 18 per cent of the sales increase came through organic growth and the
remainder through a number of acquisitions.
When Waste Management, the Chicago-based group, sold 20 per cent of its
international operations in the share offering it said it would use the
warchest to take advantage of opportunities arising from tightening
environmental regulations in Europe and growth in Asia.
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive of WMI, said yesterday that nothing had
dampened enthusiasm about the opportunities and that the continuing
recession in the UK had increased the potential possibilities as companies
tried to dispose of non-core waste businesses.
During the six month period, WMI bought Marvin, a storage, handling and
chemical waste treatment facility in Great Yarmouth; SPAT, in France, which
provides eight operating landfill sites for the group; and agreed to build,
own and operate a waste-to-energy facility at Gutersloh, Germany.
Mr Falkman also said the group had also agreed a joint venture with
Bimantara of Indonesia to build the country's first hazardous waste
treatment plant.
Earnings per share emerged at 10.6p, up 36 per cent over the period.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Taunton offer only 30.1% subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC has subscribed for only 30.1 per cent of the shares on offer in
Taunton Cider, making the west country drinks group the latest newly-floated
company to fail to attract widespread support.
Another 15.3 per cent of the 29.13m shares on offer to the public at 140p
were taken up by sub-underwriters as part of offset arrangements to the 29m
share institutional placing which was successfully concluded last week.
While Taunton shares have failed to fire the public's attention and may
initially trade at a discount next week, the company has been relatively
more successful than other recent companies to float.
The public took up only 23 per cent of The Telegraph Group's shares, 15 per
cent of the shares in MFI, the furniture group, and only 6.4 per cent in
Anglian, the double-glazing group.
When Anglian began to trade yesterday the shares closed at 204p, a 6p
discount to the issue price.
Kenwood Appliances, the first new company to float in the post-election
rush, was only 1.2 times subscribed. It opened at a premium to the 285p
offer price and is now trading at a small discount.
Mr Michael Cottrell, Taunton's chairman, said he was delighted with the
strong institutional interest in the issue. An adviser said the support was
satisfactory given the recent run of undersubscribed issues and the state of
the markets and that the institutional interest was a positive sign for the
aftermarket.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Sun Alliance fails in attempt to acquire Norwegian insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest composite (life and general) insurer, has
failed in its attempt to acquire Norway's fourth-largest life insurance
company, Forenede.
The bid, which was launched in January through Sun's Danish subsidiary
Codan, was seen as an important step in the UK insurer's strategy of
expanding in the Scandinavian insurance market.
However, the Copenhagen-based Codan, which is 71.5 per cent owned by Sun
Alliance, notified the Oslo stock exchange yesterday that it was withdrawing
its bid to acquire Forenede.
The announcement removed any lingering hopes that the bid, which had valued
Forenede at Pounds 72m, could proceed, following last month's decision by
the Norwegian finance ministry to award a permit to acquire the company to
Gjensidige Skadeforsikring, a rival Norwegian insurer.
Gjensidige must complete the purchase of two thirds of Forenede by August 1
and wholly own the company by August 1993.
It is understood that Codan will retain both its 10 per cent stake in
Forenede and an option to purchase a further 11 per cent in the Norwegian
company.
Sun Alliance made no formal announcement yesterday, arguing that the matter
had been dealt with by Codan.
It is understood, however, that although disappointed with the failure of
the bid - which would have given Sun Alliance 10 per cent of the Norwegian
market - the group is continuing to investigate opportunities for expansion
in the Scandinavian market.
Sun Alliance's interest was signalled by an unsuccessful attempt to bid for
the Danish state-owned life insurer, Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring,
which was privatised in 1990.
The group is optimistic about prospects for future growth in the
Scandinavian savings market, where state pensions schemes have come under
increasing strain in recent years.
Sun Alliance's overseas activities this year have mainly focused on the
agreement of partnership deals.
In May, the group signed an agreement with the Swiss company, Helvetia, to
develop jointly international commercial lines business. In Scandinavia, Sun
Alliance has less formal accords with Vesta Group in Norway and Atlantica in
Sweden.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Belling pension fund probe widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTIGATION into the loss of Pounds 2.1m from the pension fund of
Belling, the cooker manufacturer which went into receivership last May, has
widened to include two companies linked to Mr Clive J Smith, the Midlands
entrepreneur who faces legal actions over his natural resource investments.
The first company is Finchley Investments, the Isle of Man company
administered from Jersey, which Mr Smith has often used to handle some of
his investments. The second is Western &amp; Pacific, a Canadian mining group.
It was 57.4 per cent owned by Mr Smith and his family through Finchley and
another company, Newsham Investments, in May 1991.
Last summer, Belling tried to arrange a Dollars 50m (Pounds 26m) capital
injection through Global Prospect Funding. In advance of the deal, Belling
paid Global Pounds 2.1m as the first year's interest. The company borrowed
the money from its pension fund.
In April this year, when the Dollars 50m was not forthcoming, Belling
demanded security. Global introduced Finchley Investments which put up
shares in Western &amp; Pacific. Belling believed the shares were worth CDollars
1.75m (Pounds 760,000). However, today they are estimated to be worth Pounds
200,000.
The Law Debenture Society, the new independent trustee of the pension fund,
is investigating the fund shortfall and trying to recoup the money. Global
is administered by Mr C J Deacon, a solicitor based in Newcastle-under-Lyme.
He is believed to be helping the society in trying to recover the money.
One of the shareholders in Finchley was Mr Kelvin Myles, who ran the offices
of Bryant &amp; Co, the Jersey accountant which was raided this spring by Jersey
fraud office. Documents found at Bryant &amp; Co have triggered a Serious Fraud
Office investigation into share dealings in Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Butte
Mining, two companies which Mr Smith had helped float. Bryant &amp; Co also
managed some of Mr Smith's off-shore interests.
Mr Smith, who also has offices in Newcastle-under-Lyme, was unavailable for
comment. He faces litigation from Butte Mining and Sun Glow of the US. Butte
alleges fraud and misrepresentation by more than 70 defendants. Sun Glow is
seeking Dollars 450,000 from Mr Smith allegedly arising from a personal
guarantee. Mr Smith said recently he would contest both actions.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Hongkong starts Midland shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) yesterday disclosed the
first stage in its reorganisation of Midland Bank, following last month's
Pounds 3.7bn takeover of the UK bank, with the appointment of a new deputy
chief executive at Midland to work with Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief
executive.
At the same time, it confirmed that two top executives at Midland are
stepping down from the Midland board prior to leaving the group.
Mr Keith Whitson, 49, a general manager of HSBC has been made Midland deputy
chief executive . Until last month, Mr Whitson had been executive director
of HSBC's US subsidiary, Marine Midland.
At Marine Midland, he helped push through tough cost-cutting and
restructuring measures. Next Monday, Marine Midland will publish half-year
figures which are expected to show that it has returned to profit compared
with a loss of Dollars 109.3m (Pounds 56.8m) at the same point last year.
Mr Whitson became known at Marine Midland as an energetic hands-on manager
who was not afraid to take sharp remedial action.
Mr Whitson previously served as HSBC chief executive in the UK from late
1987 after it purchased its 14.9 per cent stake in Midland. He will succeed
Mr Brian Goldthorpe, who takes up responsibility for group risk at HSBC from
January 1.
Midland also confirmed that Mr Gene Lockhart, chief executive of UK Banking,
and Mr George Loudon, chief executive of Midland Montagu, are to leave the
Midland board.
They will resign from Midland when the terms of their departure have been
negotiated.
Mr Lockhart has run the UK banking arm of Midland for two years. HSBC's
decision that he should go came as a shock to Midland executives.
Mr Loudon's departure reflects HSBC's plan to forge closer links between
each bank's commercial and investment banking arms. Mr Bernard Asher, an
HSBC director, is expected to become head of a combined merchant banking and
international division.

FT  16 JUL 92 / KIO's role in Spain under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT yesterday sought to quiet growing concern in Spain and the state
itself over the Spanish investments of the Kuwait Investment Office by
revealing that Peat Marwick, the accountantcy firm, is conducting a full
assessment of KIO's Spanish and worldwide holdings.
The announcement was made after a high-level meeting in Kuwait. It included
the ministers of finance, oil, trade, planning and communications, as well
as top officials of the Kuwait Investment Authority and Mr Ali Rashid
al-Bader, president of the London-based KIO.
A statement after it assured that the KIO should seek whatever further legal
or financial expertise was necessary to 'safeguard and develop Kuwaiti
investments in Spain, and in order to maintain Kuwait's international
reputation in this regard.'
Mr al-Bader had been summoned to Kuwait to explain to the government KIO's
role in the threatened collapse of Ercros, Spain's biggest chemicals
company, which KIO controls.
Convening such a meeting reflects Kuwait's concern about perceptions that
the KIO may have lost some of its agility as an investor since the Gulf war.
The secretive KIO has liquidated up to half of its pre-war investments of
Dollars 65bn (Pounds 34bn) to help pay for reconstruction costs.
KIO's sale of a large part of its 10 per cent stake in Midland Bank just
before the group became subject to a bid battle also raised some eyebrows.
Ercros owes some Dollars 2.15bn to creditors. KIO's refusal to make new
funds available to the group in the absence of help from the Spanish
government or creditor banks has prompted fierce criticism of the group in
Spain.
It has also prompted a concerted attack on the KIO's secrecy and investment
strategy from Kuwaiti opposition groups preparing for October elections.
Peat Marwick, KIO's regular auditor, last year assessed KIO's Spanish
investments at between Dollars 2.9bn and Dollars 4.4bn, with the lower
figure valuing Ercros even then at zero and, at most, Dollars 500m.
Peat Marwick has now been asked to 'furnish a comprehensive assessment' of
KIO's Spanish investments by November.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Patents trade becomes a booming business / Charting the
growing search for profits from technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Current wisdom in the electronics industry is that 'if you can't sell your
products, sell your technology'. As competition and economic slowdown eat
away at profits, the adage is winning a growing number of adherents.
The trend to seek rewards for technological developments is encouraging an
increasing number of companies to search their portfolios for patents on
which they might be able to capitalise.
Furthermore, companies which believe their technology is being used by
competitors who have not made royalty payments for the privilege are
increasingly willing to turn to the courts to fight for their cause.
In the past few months Intel, the semiconductor manufacturer, has filed
suits against Chips and Technologies (which has counter-sued Intel) and
Cyrix, while Wang, the computer company, has brought actions against
Mitsubishi Electronics America and NMB Technologies.
The trend towards protecting intellectual property is spreading as the
financial gains from licensing technology increase.
'It's a booming business and there is lots of money to be made in it if you
have a patent,' says Mr Lane Mason, principal analyst at Dataquest, the high
technology consultants, of San Jose, California. He estimates that last
year, publicly-known licensing fees that were paid in the semiconductor
industry alone came to roughly Dollars 800m (Pounds 418.8m), compared with
about Dollars 300m in 1986.
Texas Instruments has made more money in the past two years collecting
royalties on its semiconductor patents than it has from selling
semiconductors.
The Dallas-based group made a loss from operations in both 1990 and 1991,
but collected Dollars 428m during that time in royalty revenues from its
competitors. In the five years since 1987 it has received in excess of
Dollars 1.2bn in royalty revenues alone.
Honeywell, the US controls manufacturer, this year enjoyed a rise in
first-quarter income from Dollars 71.8m in 1991 to Dollars 116.8m, helped by
a Dollars 127m settlement it won from Minolta, the Japanese camera group,
over a patent infringement dispute.
The US has set an example that European and Far Eastern groups are beginning
to follow.
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has agreed to assist in the licensing
of patents owned by Mr Gilbert Hyatt, an American scientist entrepreneur.
SGS-Thomson recently asked the US International Trade Commission to
investigate the sale by several Taiwanese semiconductor companies and
importers of certain integrated circuits, which it says infringe its
patents.
Japanese electronics companies, which for many years had silently watched
competitors in Korea build up their semiconductor manufacturing capability,
have begun to initiate licensing agreements with Korean manufacturers.
The trend has sprouted law firms and organisations specialising in
intellectual property rights. 'More companies are starting to understand
that intellectual property should be a major strategic asset,' says Mr
Melvin Sharp, president of Innovation Strategies, a consultancy set up
specifically to advise companies on how to make use of their intellectual
property.
These moves reflect a marked change of attitude among electronics companies
towards patented technology.
While the electronics industry was still in its infancy, technologies were
licensed widely at low prices in the hope that greater use would establish
them as de facto industry standards, says Mr Osamu Ohtake, president of
Semicon Research, a consultancy.
But as R&amp;D costs have risen and competition intensified, the pioneers of
technologies, many of them in the US, have not been able to make the
necessary returns on investments in the marketplace, where they have been
battered by competition from the Far East. They have been forced to turn
instead to royalty payments as a source of revenue.
'Intellectual property is becoming a new commodity that's being priced at
whatever the market can bear,' says Mr Mason.
The companies blame rising R&amp;D costs for the trend. 'A company cannot go on
indefinitely investing billions of dollars in R&amp;D without obtaining a
reasonable return on its investment,' Texas Instruments says.
The group invested Dollars 2bn in R&amp;D between 1986 and 1990, during which
time it was able to recoup Dollars 700m through royalty payments, which were
aided in part by court actions against six Japanese semiconductor
manufacturers.
The amount of time and money spent by companies on legal action over patent
disputes and the spiralling costs of licensing technology are, however,
raising cries of alarm in the industry.
The number of legal disputes involving semiconductor manufacturers, for
example, trebled from 12 in 1986 to 37 last year, according to a recent
joint study by Pathfinder Research of the US and Semicon Research in Japan.
With amounts being sought for royalties skyrocketing, companies being asked
to pay up have started to resist.
Sanyo, the Japanese electronics group which was in negotiation with Texas
Instruments over renewing a licensing agreement, recently started court
action against the US group, charging it with misuse of patent rights and
anti-trust violations.
Earlier this year, Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and electronics group,
filed a petition in Tokyo seeking a court determination that a Texas
Instruments patent does not apply to Fujitsu products.
The aggressive stance of the patent holders is such that some in the
industry believe there could even be a shift in the balance of power away
from companies which succeed on the strength of their low-cost manufacturing
and marketing ability, in favour of those which have patented technologies.
Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, for example, has been able to
dominate a highly lucrative sector of the semiconductor market for years, by
refusing to license its microprocessor technology.
But there is growing concern in the industry that if more companies took a
similar stance or if licensing prices were allowed to continue to rise as
they have done recently, the effects on competition could be detrimental.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parcelforce sell-off imminent: Heseltine pledges continuing
universal parcel service at affordable tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, DIANE SUMMERS and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARCELFORCE, the loss-making parcel delivery arm of the Post Office, is to
be privatised as soon as possible, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, said yesterday
He emphasised there would continue to be a universal parcel service at a
uniform and affordable tariff. 'That is not negotiable,' he told MPs,
indicating that the tariff would remain a matter that ministers decided.
The government has yet to decide how privatisation is to be achieved,
although Mr Heseltine indicated that financial support would be made
available so that management and employees could make a bid. Other bidders
might include rivals United Parcels Service, TNT, and Securicor.
Parcelforce has the leading 34 per cent share of ordinary parcel deliveries
but only two per cent of the premium 'next day' market. Its turnover for
1991-92 was Pounds 508m and it sustained a loss of Pounds 24m.
Mr Heseltine said Parcelforce was the only part of the Post Office that
would be affected, but the decision prompted speculation that it would be
followed by moves to privatise Royal Mail, the letters division.
The Conservative election manifesto said only that the party was committed
to maintaining a nationwide letter service with delivery to every address in
the UK with a uniform price structure.
Reaction from trade unions representing Parcelforce's 12,500 employees was
hostile, although Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the Communication
Managers' Association, said a management buyout 'might well be the least
undesirable privatisation option'.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents most Parcelforce
workers, called for assurances on protection of the pension fund, job
security and continued union recognition. It also raised fears about the
future of rural parcel deliveries.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, Post Office chairman, said his board supported the
government's view that privatisation would 'provide the commercial framework
and access to capital that Parcelforce needs'. The operation would need
'continued significant investment' to secure a strong future, he said.
Labour accused the government of indulging in 'privatisation for
privatisation's sake', and warned that the move threatened to undermine more
than 100 years of a universal parcel service.
The parliamentary recess means that a government statement on the sell-off
of British Coal is now not likely until the autumn, David Lascelles writes.
The government had been hoping to clarify plans for a sell-off by this week
but negotiations on long-term coal supply contracts between British Coal and
the power generators remain unresolved.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Environment agency given go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to press ahead with a 'one-stop shop for environmental
protection', bringing together control of air, land and water pollution, Mr
Michael Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday.
An independent environment agency was proposed by the government last year.
The Queen's Speech two months ago, outlining the legislative programme after
the election, failed to mention it. This prompted speculation that the
agency had fallen victim to inter-departmental wrangles about river
regulation.
Since then, the Rio Summit and the UK's accession to the presidency of the
EC have given environmental matters a fresh prominence.
The bill needed to create the agency was 'a high priority', Mr Howard said,
although he added that there was unlikely to be parliamentary time for the
legislation in the next 12 months.
The agency will combine the functions of the National Rivers Authority, the
Inspectorate of Pollution and waste regulation by local authorities. In
drawing together the NRA and HMIP, one of the agency's most important
effects is likely to be an improvement in control of river pollution.
The agency would cover England and Wales, and the arrangements for Scotland
would be announced separately, he said.
Local authorities will continue to be responsible for controlling low-level
industrial air pollution.
There would be no changes in ministerial policy responsibilities, Mr Howard
said. Mr John Gummer, minister of agriculture, fisheries and food, will
continue to be responsible for coastal defences and land drainage.
The chosen structure of the environment agency was supported by the NRA, by
the water supply companies and by environmental groups for its decision to
leave the NRA in one piece.
It ends speculation about whether the agency would take over only the NRA's
pollution regulation role and split off its river management operations.
Mr Gummer said it was important the agency's main purpose should be clearly
perceived to be protection of the environment.
He said he had initially been concerned that the twin roles of the NRA would
blur this image. However, he was satisfied that the NRA would pursue
vigorously its policy of contracting out its river management.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Perot adviser resigns from campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR campaign adviser to Mr Ross Perot abruptly resigned last night,
dealing an apparently severe blow to the Texas billionaire's plans to put
himself forward as an independent US presidential candidate.
Mr Ed Rollins, who guided the victorious Republican campaign of Mr Ronald
Reagan in 1984, said there were 'differences over the future conduct of the
campaign'. He said his departure was 'a mutual decision' and that 'the kind
of campaign I wanted to run and Mr Perot wanted to run were not really
compatible'.
He added that if he had continued, 'the anger and frustration would only
have gotten worse'.
Day-to-day operations of the Perot camp will be left in the hands of Mr Tom
Luce, a long-time associate, and Mr Hamilton Jordan, who only 24 hours ago
denied that he, too, was on the verge of resignation because Mr Perot was
ignoring his advice.
The next two weeks are expected to be critical for Mr Perot. If he is unable
to reverse his slide in the polls or dispel the growing perception that his
autocratic tendencies are not compatible with politics, his populist bid for
the White House may soon be over.
He has always said he would only run if his name was registered on the
ballot in all 50 states, a process at present barely half complete. If this
faltered, he would be provided with a ready-made excuse for withdrawal.
Mr Perot's recruitment on June 4 of Mr Rollins and Mr Jordan, the Democratic
campaign manager for Mr Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980, was considered a
coup, providing a degree of political sophistication previously lacking.
But Mr Perot's popularity has started dropping. Two weeks ago, he led both
President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic
candidate, in the polls.
Last night, though, a poll from ABC News and the Washington Post showed Mr
Clinton in a 17-point lead over Mr Bush, transformed from a five-point
deficit only a week ago. The governor's support was 45 points among 'likely
voters' in the survey, completed on Tuesday. Mr Bush was on 28 per cent, Mr
Perot down to 20 per cent.
The Texan independent has been beset by controversy over some of his public
statements and criticism for the lack of specifity behind his ideas.
Both Mr Rollins and Mr Jordan were known to be upset when Mr Perot decided
not to use the services of Mr Hal Riney, an experienced advertising
consultant. As Mr Rollins conceded last night, this was a symbol for a
deeper strategic unease with Mr Perot seemingly unwilling or unable to move
into a different gear.
Many leading Democrats do not want Mr Perot to withdraw at this stage, as Mr
Clinton has benefited politically from the animosity between Mr Perot and
President Bush.

Whatever British Rail may think of the government's privatisation plan, it

copper as change for the Pounds 1 coins they're invariably offered.
'A bizarre price,' commented Observer's watchdog on the 10 am express to

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank and its new Hong Kong owner are still enjoying their honeymoon,
so nobody will be too upset about the abrupt departure from the Midland
board of highly paid American, Gene Lockhart, and well connected Dutchman
George Loudon. Evidently their faces just didn't fit any more.
They had, however, proved themselves in the market place - more than can be
said for Keith Whitson, Midland's new 49-year-old deputy chief executive.
Having joined the Hongkong Bank from school, he has worked his passage and
so has more in common with most Midland Bankers than Loudon or Lockhart.
Nevertheless if Midland staff regard Whitson as just another safe pair of
hands, they may be badly mistaken. In his days at Midland's new sister
organisation, New York's Marine Midland, he helped reduce its assets by over
a third and its staff by close to a quarter.

The auction-room peace talks contrast sharply with the London red carpets
being rolled out for one Egon Klepsch. Yesterday: meetings with the prime
minister and lord chancellor, the leaders of both opposition parties and the
lord mayor of London, not to mention lunch with the foreign secretary.
Today: an audience of the Queen, drinks with Commons speaker Betty
Boothroyd, and chinwags with a further clutch of ministers.
Of course they, unlike most Britons, know that Klepsch is president of the
European parliament. But his reception is to say the least a notch above any
given to his predecessors in said office.
Could the reason be that he is a German Christian Democrat, who had a lot to
do with arranging the admission of British Conservative MEPs into the
European People's Party group three months ago? Not an earth-shattering
event, perhaps, but one that John Major sets some store by.

Although the European Community sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia was
started nearly a year ago, it has failed to set up a permanent secretariat.
Hence its chairman Lord Carrington has been using the London premises of
Christie's, the fine art dealers he also chairs, for talks with
representatives from war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'It's as if he is meeting us between auctions,' said one senior Bosnian
official, who regretted that the UK, which holds the presidency of the
Community, appeared to have made little effort in providing transport and a
decent venue for talks affecting the lives of thousands of people in Bosnia.
First at the door of Christie's was Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serb
irregulars still bombarding the eastern city of Goradze, despite yet another
ceasefire promise by Karadzic.
A psychiatrist by training, he was chauffeured to and from the premises in a
blue Volvo, guarded by his usual coterie of heavies. Haris Silajdzic,
Bosnia-Hercegovina's foreign minister, just took a taxi.

Meanwhile executives who complain of killing work schedules will perhaps
count their blessings on comparing themselves with Mitsui official Jun
Ishii.
His schedule literally killed him, the Labour Standards Inspection Office
has just decided in Tokyo. The ruling entitles his family to government
compensation on top of Pounds 125,650 already handed out by his company.
The fact that he was a white-collar worker makes the ruling a rare one.
Although about 30 Japanese a year die of what is officially recognised as
overwork, or karoshi, they are usually all blue-collar operatives. Ishii's
case is the first of its kind to be accepted in Tokyo.
He was found dead, aged 47, in a Nagoya hotel room two years ago after a
week in which he'd been kept too busy to take a day off. A Russian speaker,
he had been escorting four Russian clients visiting his company.

The ghost of Yoshi Fujiwara must be smiling contentedly through Japan's
economic gloom. While the Japanese may have ceased knocking back champagne,
they are still coughing up handsomely for western opera, which the tenor
Fujiwara first popularised there 59 years ago.
Around 2,500 of them have paid Pounds 2,350 apiece for tickets for tours by
visiting opera companies over the next four years. Britain's Royal Opera,
first on stage this month with Mozart, will be followed next year by
counterpart companies from Berlin, Vienna and Milan.
The Y560,000 tickets, which cover 14 operas, have sold so well that the
organisers have rationed sales to leave seats for people not rich enough to
attend all the performances.
The British company has already touched not just the heart- but the
purse-strings of Hirotaro Higuchi, president of the tours' sponsor Asahi
Breweries. Even though Asahi has not escaped unhurt from the troubles, at
the Royal Opera's Tokyo party he upped and pledged a contribution to the
Pounds 250m renovation scheme for Covent Garden.
His hosts were so shocked that silence reigned until his words were
digested, when it gave way to spontaneous applause. Asahi officials also
appear to have been surprised - it took them two days to confirm the details
of their president's promise.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Doctor Subtle's twin pillars: Prof Giuliano Amato, Italy's
new prime minister, explains his plans for economic and political reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prof Giuliano Amato, Italy's new Socialist prime minister, has dumbfounded
even his closest colleagues.
No postwar Italian prime minister has headed such a fragile government
coalition with a mere 16-seat parliamentary majority. Yet after less than
two weeks in office he has emerged as a man determined to make up for the
long years in which successive governments ducked reform of an increasingly
ossified political and economic system.
'We are going to change the rules,' insists the 54-year-old law professor
and former deputy head of the Socialist party.
Nicknamed 'Dr Sottile' (Doctor Subtle) for his slight frame and formidable
intellect, he signalled his intentions in last Friday's emergency budget,
which went well beyond a simple financial operation. He set in motion a
series of reforms to pensions, healthcare, local government spending and
civil service employment, as well as a privatisation programme heralding the
biggest shake-up in state ownership since Mussolini pioneered
state-sponsored development in the 1930s.
Surrounded by documents in the prime minister's 17th-century Rome palace, he
is aware that one of his hardest tasks is to win credibility. Italians and
foreigners alike have come to regard any promise of reform from an Italian
politician with the cynicism reserved for an oft-heard cry of wolf.
The prime minister was already a treasury minister in the 1980s and heads a
government composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals - the very same parties who ignored the budget deficit, pension
reform and electoral reform over the past three years precisely when Italy
was being obliged to bring itself into line with European Community norms.
So what is different now? Prof Amato recounts a conversation he had with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany at last week's Munich summit. He asked Mr
Kohl if he was surprised that the same four-party coalition was in power
after being battered in the April elections. Mr Kohl said that he was not,
because they were the only viable majority, providing the faces were
different.
'The people are different, so are the circumstances,' Prof Amato says. His
24-person cabinet contains, unusually, six technicians, three of whom are
directly concerned with economic and industrial reform. As for the
circumstances, Italians have been warned that with an uncontrolled
public-sector deficit of more than 10.5 per cent of GDP, Italy is on 'the
edge of an abyss'.
Rather than seeing himself as tainted by involvement with previous
governments - he was the key organiser for Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist
leader, when premier from 1983-87 - Prof Amato sees this as an advantage.
'People who know the system are familiar with its rules and have in mind how
the system can be changed,' he maintains, adding, however, that 'change is
never easy. Those who want change are not experts in the areas they want to
change - so generally when they come on the scene it's a disaster. The
experts usually don't want to change anything because the reason they are
experts is because they defend the system.'
He regards his government as guiding a 'transition' from a corporatist state
and patronage politics to Italy becoming a modern member of the EC. His
strategy is two-pronged.
The first prong might be called the Me-or-Else scenario. He is introducing
his budget and reforms by decree, which must be approved by parliament
within 90 days. The decrees contain the broad principles of legislation, but
once approved by parliament the government then has the authority to fill in
the details. This avoids the interminable process of sabotage and change
suffered by previous initiatives (pension reform has been under discussion
for more than 10 years).
If the decrees are not approved, then Prof Amato will seek a parliamentary
vote of confidence. He believes he can obtain approval by presenting the
unattractive alternatives. Who could form another government? Would a
disgruntled electorate support a return to the status quo ante? Would the
heavily fragmented and internally divided parties accept new elections
without prior reform of Italy's unworkable system of proportional
representation? Finally, who could solve the problem of Italy's disastrous
public finances?
'It is very difficult to expect another cabinet to do tomorrow what has to
be done today,' he says. This calculation gives him confidence, and he adds
bleakly: 'I don't see a great future if they (the political parties) don't
understand.' Perhaps because this message is sinking in, the reaction to his
programme has so far been muted.
The second prong has yet to be fully appreciated by the politicians. He has
told parliamentary leaders he regards institutional reform, which is also
being pressed by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, as their prerogative. In
other words, parliament must draw up plans for changes in proportional
representation, direct election of mayors, new powers for the regions and
even a redefinition of the prime minister's and president's roles.
However, Prof Amato has assumed responsibility for economic management and
by his own definition economic reform. The thrust of these reforms would be
to slim down the role of the state, increase competition and remove
political interference. Thus economic reform, which is likely to come
faster, could in itself precipitate political reform.
Prof Amato says his philosophy is that of 'the market whenever possible, the
state whenever necessary'. But he is very much a pragmatic Socialist. The
budget, in which he exercised considerable influence, reflects his
frustrating two-year experience as treasury minister. 'As treasury minister
I was perfectly aware that the typical Italian budget was like a devaluation
 -it produces effects for a few weeks but does nothing to change
fundamentals such as public expenditure.'
He recalls preparing a budget for Italy's army of teachers only to discover
that some 50,000 'new' staff had crept on to the payroll after the
calculations had been made. 'If you don't change these sorts of things, it
is pointless to bother people with one budget after another.' He left
without being able to tackle these fundamentals. 'And now we are exactly at
the same point three years later.'
Friday's budget seeks to find L30,000bn (Pounds 13.7bn) to hold the public
sector deficit down to its original 1992 projection of about L128,000bn. The
cabinet has gone for anti-inflation measures weighted towards special taxes
on property and a one-off tax on bank deposits - as opposed to swingeing
spending cuts. He answers criticism of avoiding such cuts by saying: 'First
I have to tackle the rules and principles which condition spending.'
The latter cover five areas: pensions, public employment, health,
decentralisation and privatisation. The current generous state pension
scheme risks gobbling up the entire budget if unchecked. The pension scheme
outlined in the budget envisages a gradual move to retirement at 65 for both
sexes, with a combination of incentives and sanctions for those who wish to
avail themselves of the current 55 years for women and 60 for men. Final
benefit will also be slightly reduced.
While pension reform was widely anticipated, Prof Amato has surprised
everyone by tackling other issues head on. On public employment he is
determined to revitalise the civil service with greater job flexibility, new
job definitions and gearing pay to productivity.
'There is no control of what our senior civil servants do . . . It is
essential to introduce productivity,' he says. 'Experts have been saying for
years that it is impossible to raise productivity in the public sector. They
are right, because the way the system is organised, it is impossible.
Productivity is foreign to the system.'
On the national health service, he is proposing to remove political control
from local health authorities, which will be given greater autonomy and the
possibility of hospitals opting out, as in the UK. Until now local health
authorities have had no budgetary control and have been one of the biggest
sources of corruption. As a result large sums are spent to little effect.
The same considerations apply to local government at the municipal and
regional level. Each year the state merely transfers funds, with no sanction
for overspending. The government now proposes that municipalities will be
able to raise additional property taxes (1 lira per 1,000 on a house),
additional income tax (starting at 1 per cent above national rates, rising
to 4 per cent by 1994), as well as increased road taxes.
The biggest immediate shake-up, however, concerns privatisation. 'We have an
overload of state ownership and we have to reduce it not just to pay debts,
. . . and at the same time we need a better financial market. We are trying
to create a system with which we can face the European financial market
saying we can make deals in which you can buy,' says Prof Amato.
Already the four big state entities - IRI, the main holding company; ENI,
the oil concern; ENEL, the electricity authority; and INA, the insurance
institute - have become joint stock companies under the treasury's tutelage
as a preliminary to selling off stakes in their subsidiaries.
'I am creating a machine that will be forced towards privatisation,' Prof
Amato insists. 'There is no capital, no financial backing in the system as
it is.' The two new holdings, to be created under the treasury to hold state
assets worth some L60,000bn, will be attractive to investors, he believes.
But their real value, in which the private sector will take a maximum 45 per
cent, will be in the performance of the companies they control and intend to
sell off, he claims.
Deflecting criticism that the state still harbours ambitions to be a
majority shareholder, he says: 'Those who understand these operations can
easily see that under the two super-holdings there is a big push towards
privatisation because that's the only way for the system to work.'
To listen to an Italian prime minister talking in these terms is perhaps the
beginning of revolution, turning the seemingly impossible into the possible:
changing the Italian way. But the lack of challenge to his vision so far may
be deceptive, because his changes threaten so many of the country's
entrenched vested interests.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Bundesbank looks east
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOBBYING is done. With beaded brows and sweaty palms, the finance
ministers of the industrialised world must now await the outcome of today's
Bundesbank council meeting. But their increasingly desperate attempts to
place the west's economic burdens on the shoulders of 18 German council
members are misplaced. The Bundesbank's task remains to secure German price
stability. That they stuck to this objective to the last is, rightly, the
epitaph that the council members wish to secure.
Unification has delivered an economic shock to the German economy far
greater than almost anyone predicted. In the eastern Lander, the recession
has been spectacularly deep; in the west the inflationary impact has been
doggedly persistent. The demand for financial resources  - from the German
taxpayer, the budget deficit and the banking sector - has overshot all
initial projections.
The Bundesbank has, as a result, found itself in a quandary. Concerned at
rising wage claims and the build-up of hoarded liquidity, it fixed a
restrictive target for monetary growth in 1992. Yet, in spite of record high
interest rates, the subsequent acceleration of broad money growth has made a
mockery of these austere expectations.
The Bundesbank council could choose to ignore the message of its favoured
monetary aggregate. As with any economic target, it is easy to find reasons
why it might be distorted, particularly given the straits in which Germany
finds itself. Reunification may have made the demand for money less
predictable, while the demand for the D-Mark as a reserve currency in
eastern Europe may have grown: the OECD's latest German survey provides a
convenient list.
Dented credibility
Yet the Bundesbank will surely hesitate before abandoning its monetary
target so lightly. To ignore the target when the going gets tough, however
apparently justified by special circumstances, would dent the credibility of
any future commitments the council might make. The Bundesbank's credibility
has already been damaged enough: the section of the OECD report entitled 'An
intensifying cost-price spiral' will have sent a chill up every council
member's spine.
It is not just credibility that is at stake. The counterparts to the rapid
broad money growth reveal that the main cause of growing money supply is
rapid credit creation by the German private sector. This credit growth has
been hastened by the plethora of capital subsidies available for investment
in the east, which reduce the cost of capital below market levels.
Higher inflation
Even an avowed anti-monetarist would concede that such a rapid rate of
credit growth, outstripping the growth of either output or assets, risks
feeding into higher inflation eventually. The British experience of the mid
to late 1980s, when the rapid rate of credit expansion was conveniently but
mistakenly ignored, sets a chilling precedent.
The logical consequence of the Bundesbank's previous commitments, and
current predicament, suggest that today's Council meeting should decide to
tighten monetary policy. The UK's experience also suggests that raising
interest rates is a blunt way of controlling runaway credit growth. Raising
reserve requirements on bank lending or direct ceilings on the availability
of credit may be a better option, particularly if the Bundesbank wishes to
minimise the effect on international interest rates.
If the Bundesbank council does decide it has no option but to raise interest
rates, Germany's partners can hardly complain. It was their voluntary
choice, after all, to link their currencies to the D-Mark in the pursuit of
credibility.
So recent lobbying by the French and British finance ministers should be
ignored. It suggests these countries still do not understand the art of
non-inflationary central banking. They complain about what is needed to give
them the stability they say they want. For the success of the ERM has been
built on the willingness of the Bundesbank to keep its anti-inflationary
head, while all around were losing theirs. To ask the Bundesbank to tolerate
high German inflation in the interests of European co-operation makes little
sense.

FT  16 JUL 92 / People: Kenneth Baker joins Hanson board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Baker, the former Conservative home secretary, has been slower than
some of his ex-cabinet colleagues to pick up new interests now that he is
free from ministerial office.
However, he has made up for the delay with his first appointment, a
non-executive directorship of Hanson, Britain's ninth biggest company.
Lord Hanson, who has better political contacts with the Conservative party
than have many big businessmen, yesterday said he was delighted that Baker,
57, had agreed to join his board.
Over the past year Hanson has been under pressure to strengthen its team of
non-executive directors and Baker's appointment fills an obvious gap on a
board which is dominated by executive directors and businessmen.
Baker, who entered parliament in 1968 and remains MP for Mole Valley, has
held a wide variety of ministerial posts. Between 1981 and 1984 he was
minister of state at the Department of Industry. He then moved to the
Department of Environment as minister for local government, and in May 1986
was appointed secretary of state for education and science. In July 1989 he
was made chairman of the Conservative party but retained his cabinet seat.
He decided to leave the government after the 1992 election.
He said yesterday that Hanson was 'one of the most successful and
well-managed companies in the world' and he was 'very pleased' to have been
asked to join its board.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Internal auditors in search of an
authoritative role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a good deal of head-scratching at a hotel in west London earlier
this week, where the Institute of Internal Auditors was holding its latest
conference. The underlying message was one of unjust neglect of their
profession by the outside world.
While accounting standards, auditing practices and the work of the
accountancy firms dominates the news, internal auditors are barely noticed
as they carry out essential functions for organisations and companies across
the UK.
Internal auditing is the process by which a special group of a company's
employees work to help assure management that the business is achieving its
objectives economically, effectively and efficiently; that financial and
operating information is reliable; that laws, regulations and procedures are
being complied with; and that the assets are safeguarded.
While the external auditor typically spends a few weeks a year testing
control systems and essentially building up a snapshot of the company's
balance sheet, the internal auditor is submerged in its daily operations.
If the neglect of the internal auditor was a matter of perception or
professional pride alone, it might not much matter. But while in some cases
the staff are not appreciated, the depressing fact is that the function
itself - while so evidently vital - is often altogether absent.
A survey of 1,185 quoted companies by the institute in conjunction with Aid
to Industry last summer found that only 24 per cent had an internal audit
function, and 23 per cent an internal audit committee. At the lower end,
only 5 per cent of electronics companies had an internal audit function.
Mr Roger Cheesley, a partner with Touche Ross, which is marketing a 'health
check' service for companies to scrutinise their internal audit procedures,
argues that many of the failures and frauds of recent months could have been
prevented by an effective internal audit function. But he says:
'Surprisingly little attention is paid to internal audit.'
Mr Andy Robertson, chairman of the institute's public affairs committee and
an internal audit controller with a private company, contrasts the London
meeting - which about 200 people attended - with an equivalent function in
Arizona in the US which he attended recently. There were more than 1,500
delegates.
He says the difference is explained by the slow development of the
profession in the UK, the dominance and influence of the other accountancy
bodies, and the fact that there remains no legislation to drive its
expansion by requiring internal auditing to take place.
Part of the problem has also been that, traditionally, internal auditing has
had a reputation as a second-rate job. 'You used to place the accountants
who couldn't do anything decent into the internal audit department,' says Mr
Harold Izzard, a past president of the institute and now its spokesman on
corporate governance.
As a result, the staff were not always of the highest quality, turnover was
high, and the results achieved were not necessarily the most impressive.
The institute is keen to argue that things are beginning to change, however.
It points proudly to nearly 4,000 members. It displays its code of
professional ethics, and a series of guidelines and position statements.
Perhaps most significantly, it stresses the fact that since 1990 full
membership has only been available to those who pass its written
examinations and gain relevant work experience over at least three years.
They can then become either a Member of the Institute of Internal Auditors
(MIIA), or obtain the specialist Qualification in Computer Auditing (QiCA).
Mr Robertson says that while the recession may also be a factor, the growing
status and more demanding nature of the role helps explain why his own
company's internal audit department is now receiving a large number of job
applications from chartered accountants - something that would never have
happened even a few years ago.
The status and importance of the profession has certainly grown as its
influence has spread. The public sector has made far greater play of
internal audit than the private sector, driven by legislation and public
pressure for accountability.
Other worries remain. There will always be tension for the internal auditor
in identifying high-level fraud: it may require going to the managers
involved; or to the external auditors who - according to Mr Izzard - often
find such discoveries embarrassing.
On a more practical level, Mr Cheesley says that the internal auditors are
often used as 'fire-fighters' for the accounts department during periods of
illness or high pressure. They provide back-up support to other functions
within the business, at the expense of their own work.
But he stresses that where internal audit is performed effectively, it is a
vital complement to the work of the external auditor. It can provide
reassurance, highlight areas of weakness, and prevent costly duplication of
effort. 'The question is whether management is giving internal auditors an
opportunity,' he says.
As Mr Andrew Chambers, professor of internal auditing at the City University
Business School in London, pointed out at the Institute's conference this
week, there still appears to be little attempt to involve internal auditors
in the wider debates about accountancy and corporate governance, and little
discussion by other bodies of the issues it raises.
One example of this neglect which Mr Chambers cites is the Cadbury report on
the financial aspects of corporate governance, which has caused some
irritation at the Institute. It was not invited to sit on the committee or
to help sponsor its work.
Mr Andy Robertson takes some comfort from the fact that it did participate
in discussions. 'But we are still only mentioned in the notes at the back,'
he says. This low-key role is reflected in the final conclusions made in the
report.
The institute made a submission when the committee first began operating a
year ago. It is now on the point of submitting a detailed response to the
draft. In contrast to most professional bodies, it launched a strong and
immediate attack when the report was issued in late May.
Mr Neil Cowan, the president elect, said at the time: 'Cadbury pays lip
service to internal auditing. It doesn't give it any teeth.' He said that
fraud was most likely to be detected by the internal auditor; that the chief
internal auditor should have unimpeded access to the audit committee; and
that all listed companies should be required to have an effective internal
audit function.
The Cadbury report does stress that 'an effective internal control system is
an essential part of the efficient management of a company'. But there are
no recommendations to reinforce this point. It talks about the importance of
the audit committee, but it makes little play of the role of the internal
auditor in providing information to that committee.
As a result, it should come as no surprise that the institute criticised the
report for taking a 'top-down' approach to corporate governance, and
considering the issues from the perspective of the external auditor.
Mr Izzard warns that, if the amended Cadbury report due out later this year
does not include stronger recommendations on internal auditing, it will deal
a powerful blow to the profession. 'Without internal audit, the audit
committee is a bit of a farce,' he says. 'External auditors can only scratch
the surface. Internal auditors constantly monitor controls and systems. They
are in a prime position to identify problems.'
'External auditors can only scratch the surface. Internal auditors

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont in call to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, has appealed to Conservative MPs to keep
faith with the government's steady-as-she-goes economic strategy, warning
against the 'illusory benefits of a quick fix'.
In a three-page letter, aimed at reassuring backbench unease, he cautions
MPs not to expect instant economic growth but insists that the basic
foundations for recovery were established before the general election.
'The government has accepted that the pace of recovery will be slow,' he
writes.
'Policy cannot be set to determine the level of output on a short-term basis
. . rather, policy must be designed to deliver sustainable growth over the
medium term.'
The letter, now being distributed by Conservative Central Office, gives firm
assurances that MPs' alternative strategies have all been carefully examined
by the Treasury.
But it concludes that there would be no advantage in a premature cut in
interest rates or a realignment in the exchange rate mechanism. The
experience of Italy and France had shown that devaluations within the ERM
raised interest rates, not lowered them, he says.
In conciliatory language intended to raise spirits before the summer recess,
Mr Lamont offers a vigorous defence of the ERM as a key instrument for
defeating inflation, and emphasises that the government's commitment to the
mechanism is 'unshakeable'.
While recognising concerns about interest rates and indebtedness, he points
out that trade figures and surveys of business confidence give grounds for
optimism that the economy is strengthening.
Two dozen of Britain's largest housebuilders yesterday warned Mr Lamont that
his economic policies could push the recession in the housing market into a
slump.
In a letter to the chancellor, the builders said that the government's aim
of achieving zero inflation through high interest rates would totally
undermine confidence among individuals and industry.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Representation remains an expensive
business - The row over benefits to Members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 38 per cent increase in office cost allowances that MPs awarded
themselves in the small hours of yesterday morning means Mrs Edwina Currie's
battered black electric typewriter can finally be consigned to the
scrapheap.
The former health minister celebrated yesterday's vote by ordering Pounds
4,000 worth of new computer equipment. As a further consequence of the
Pounds 10,974 per annum increment, Mrs Currie will be able to give her staff
a substantial pay rise, which means she can 'stop avoiding their reproachful
eyes'.
The 'very relieved' Derbyshire South MP, who took part in the Tory backbench
rebellion which overturned government efforts to limit the rise to some
Pounds 4,000 or 9.8 per cent, is in no doubt that the eye-catching increase
is justified.
Factors such as the televising of parliament and the impact of the recession
on constituents have meant that the average MP's workload has risen
substantially, she says, pointing out that she dealt last year with 1,100
cases of constituents asking for help of one kind or another.
These demands on available resources meant that she overshot the then Pounds
28,986 office costs allowance by just under Pounds 4,000, meeting the excess
from her own pocket.
The overshoot was only kept this low by dint of draconian measures in the
second half of the year. 'From September onwards, my staff had to get
permission to buy pens,' she says. 'My secretary in Derbyshire had to wait
until April 1 to get a chair.'
Emphasising that she paid some Pounds 2,000 in tax on the Pounds 7,000 she
claimed last year in car mileage allowance, Mrs Currie also argues that
critics sometimes over-estimate the generosity of MPs' other expense
entitlements (see table).
'I am saving hard to replace a three-year-old car,' she says, pointing out
that MPs do not benefit from car-loan schemes or pool cars and that the
travel allowance for spouses and children is 'also taxable'.
Such tales of relative hardship and deprivation cannot disguise that expense
allowances are a subject about which MPs are inordinately sensitive,
however.
Their sternest critics see their entitlements as little short of a racket
whereby backbenchers can boost their basic salary of Pounds 30,854 to a
combined pay and benefits package of Pounds 100,000 or more.
Many MPs - particularly on the government side - enjoy paid private-sector
directorships or consultancies which supplement their earnings further at
the cost of time which they could be devoting to their constituency
responsibilities.
Labour, meanwhile, bears the brunt of allegations that by basing secretaries
in constituencies, they can use individuals who are paid from public funds
to anchor local party organisations by conducting mass mailings and the
like.
At the very least, critics say, MPs should set an example to others by
exercising restraint during a difficult period for the domestic economy. The
government's current austerity drive, after all, succeeded last week in
limiting the pay increases awarded to senior civil servants.
There is certainly little doubt that MPs of the old school would see their
latter day counterparts as spoiled. Before implementation of the independent
Lawrence committee report into the pay of members of both houses of
parliament in 1964, there were only 'a limited number of allowances
available to MPs', as the relevant Public Information Office fact-sheet
recounts.
The report of the independent review body whose recommendation MPs endorsed
last night does much to back up their case, however - particularly regarding
the extent to which their workloads have increased.
According to the report, the amount of correspondence received by MPs now
averages 300 letters per week, against the 200 which a survey commissioned
in 1986 indicated they were being sent. 'The overwhelming weight of the
evidence we have received . . is that the present resources, however
apportioned, are no longer adequate,' the report states.
In spite of this, the report shows, as many as 38 per cent of MPs in 1990-91
still employed less than the full-time equivalent of 1.5 staff for which the
office costs allowance notionally provided.
The report also indicates that UK legislators are comparatively unpampered
by international standards. The staff allowance for each member of the US
House of Representatives, for example, is put at Dollars 515,760 or more
than Pounds 289,000 at the rate of exchange prevailing on April 15, 1991.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU chief in benefits call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S traditional support for universal entitlement to welfare benefits
has come under pressure after unexpected support for targeted benefits from
Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, Britain's largest.
Mr Morris, whose union controls more than 10 per cent of the total vote at
Labour's policy-making annual conference, says in an article in the New
Statesman: 'I favour an examination of the ineffective system of universal
entitlements, perhaps looking at moving towards a more flexible programme
that offers individual pathways out of poverty.
'This does not mean a move away from equality. Instead, I see it as a move
towards genuine equality, an equality that does not pretend that the state
needs to offer the same to the two-income, two-car family as it offers to
the poor any more than men need the same protection as women, or white
people the same as black.'
Using the example of child benefit, he proposes a compromise of much lower
universal payments with additional payments for those in need, should the
party feel the need to continue to satisfy the principle of universality.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell committee probe to broaden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE members of the House of Lords are expected to be asked to give
evidence to the Commons' cross-party social security committee as it reopens
and broadens its inquiry into the disappearance of Maxwell company pension
funds, Alison Smith and Ralph Atkins write.
Lord Walker, who was briefly a director of Maxwell Communication
Corporation, and Lord Donoughue and Lord Williams of Elvel, who were
directors of Maxwell investment companies, are likely to be invited to
attend the committee as the renewed investigation is stepped up in the
autumn.
The committee is also planning to hold a special session in September -
during the parliamentary recess - to take evidence from the liquidators and
administrators of the Maxwell companies.
Meeting yesterday for the first time since the general election, the
committee also re-elected Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, as
chairman.
The renewal of its investigation into the plight of the Maxwell pensioners
is likely to focus on three areas: the liquidators and administrators; the
key companies, including London and Bishopsgate International Investment
Management, and Bishopsgate Investment Management; and the role of the
banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.
Separately, the Treasury and Civil service select committee decided to
consider resuming investigations into the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
A final decision will depend on Treasury and Bank of England responses to
the committee's earlier report on BCCI and on the official inquiry under
Lord Justice Bingham.
Mr John Watts, the Tory MP for Slough who two years ago declined to endorse
UK membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, has been elected
chairman of the Treasury committee.
MPs on the Treasury committee are to invite Mr Anthony Nelson, economic
secretary, to give evidence in the autumn on his new responsibilities for
City regulation. A wider investigation into City regulation may follow.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, is also expected to be
called to discuss the Citizen's Charter.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Political Notebook: Labour's leader-in-waiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE cabinet minister offering political editors an end-of-term drink,
there was not a scintilla of doubt that the Labour party was making a huge
mistake.
Mr John Smith, he declared, was the only leader of Her Majesty's opposition
who would allow the Conservatives to summon up in 1996 memories of the
winter of discontent.
Even now central office would be digging out grainy footage of Mr Smith
consorting with the union leaders who brought the country to its knees in
1978.
The images might be juxtaposed neatly with the more recent ones of another
generation of union bosses explaining piously that it was a waste of time
and money to consult their members before casting their votes for him in the
leadership contest.
So who should Labour have chosen? The answer came without hesitation: Mr
Tony Blair. The opposition should have skipped a generation. More
importantly, it should have opted for the politician who had grasped the
scale of the changes required to make the opposition electable.
The assessment is universal among senior ministers: their opponents are
still looking for a leader to gloss over the past rather than one who has
policies to confront the future.
Like most sweeping judg-ments, it is too simplistic.
Persuading the voters that Mr Smith is a militant trades unionist will be as
easy as convincing them that Mr Major and Lady Thatcher are still good
friends.
For a Tory party used to scoring easy points off Mr Neil Kinnock's past, the
solid centrism that comes with membership of the Scottish bar will prove an
elusive target.
Mr Smith's fluent and sharp debating style promises a rough ride for Mr
Major across the floor of the Commons.
The circumstances also are propitious.
He faces a prime minister with a majority of 21 rather than 100 and a party
whose celebration of its fourth election victory has vanished into a sea of
acrimony over Europe and the economy.
But then, scratch beneath the superficial confidence of the Labour MPs who
have flocked to annoint the leader-in-waiting and there is unease to match
the Conservatives' confidence. Mr Blair's name is whispered as frequently on
the opposition as on the government frontbench.
The 39-year-old MP for Sedgefield has played no part in the leadership
campaign save as one of Mr Smith's many backers in the shadow cabinet. He
considered standing for the post of deputy. Few doubt that he could have won
it. But he was discouraged, if not warned off, by some in the Smith camp
when Mrs Margaret Beckett declared her candidacy.
Now he is promised the home or foreign portfolios. The prize of the shadow
chancellor's job will go to Mr Gordon Brown, a friend and rival for the
future leadership.
But Mr Blair's absence from the contest has emphasised the timidity of his
party's post-election debate. Others have danced minuettes around the
fundamental issues facing the party. Mr Blair has signalled from the
sidelines they must be confronted head on.
His starting point is not whether a mechanism can be found to end the block
vote while ensuring the trades unions still wield an influence commensurate
with their financial contribution.
Alone on the Labour front-bench, Mr Blair has begun to spell out how 1980s
revisionism should be followed by 1990s radicalism. He is impatient;
dismissive of those who believe the leadership can devote the next year to
cosmetic organisational changes.
Labour, he believes, must start with a fresh concept of how an electable
centre-left party should look in the approach to the 21st century.
The answer clearly is not found in a party structure that attracts fewer
members than the National Trust; and which is entirely dependent for its
resources on a handful of union leaders.
Mr Blair argues passionately that Labour must recognise that its post-war
success was built not on an illusory working-class altruism, but on the
perception that it offered the majority the best route to individual
advancement.
Now it needs a project to rescue its concept of the community from that of
the centralised state, placing it instead in the context of individual
aspirations which the Tories have so skilfully tapped.
On such subjects Mr Smith has been virtually silent. But his fortunes and
those of his party may well depend on the extent to which the new leader
will bend his instinctive conservatism to the radicalism of his most likely
successor.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM angered by revolt over MPs'
allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING STREET yesterday made known the prime minister's anger at the
outcome of the Commons vote on MPs' allowances in the early hours that led
to a government defeat - the first of his premiership.
Mr Major watched as Conservative backbenchers defied ministerial pleas for
restraint in a vote giving MPs a 38 per cent increase office expenses -
Pounds 7,000 higher than the recommended figure.
The government feels the rebellion, costing some Pounds 8m, would send the
wrong signals to business and the public sector at a time when modest pay
increases were being sought to keep the downward pressure on inflation.
Some ministers, including Mr Major, are expected to forego the increases as
an example to their colleagues.
Coming in the wake of the prime minister's intervention last week to allow
top public servants only 4 per cent against the up to 24 per cent
recommended by a pay review body, the vote provoked grumbling among
Whitehall civil servants whose pay claims have been held down.
Officials said that Mr Major had made a point of being present for the vote
and regarded the government's proposal of a 14 per cent increase to Pounds
33,190 in MPs allowances as 'generous' in the prevailing economic climate.
Several Conservative MPs were unrepentant, however, claiming that the
increase now approved - taking total allowances from Pounds 28,986 to just
under Pounds 40,000 - was necessary to meet growing workloads.
They reiterated the point that the new money would meet the costs of hiring
equipment and staff and should not be confused with a salary rise.
However, several MPs admitted that some of the increase would be enjoyed by
their wives, who worked in the Commons as secretaries. Another countered
that the real impact of the increase would be felt as helping provide new
infrastructure and equipment for campaigning in constituencies.
'In effect, it is a state subsidy of the political parties by the backdoor,'
he said. 'I opposed the rise but I will have to take it or my opponents will
have the better of me.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / Fears on N-plant safety: Nuclear watchdog questions Sizewell
B computer systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC has been asked to consider strengthening the back-up safety
system at Sizewell B, Britain's most advanced nuclear reactor, after fears
over the principal computer-controlled safety system.
The state-owned power generator, intended Sizewell B in Suffolk to be the
first UK nuclear power station to rely on a computer-controlled primary
system to detect faults and shut the reactor down if necessary. The station
is due for completion in 1994.
But the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, part of the government's health
and safety executive, has asked Nuclear Electric to examine extending its
back-up system, which is not computer-controlled, so that it could also
carry out the functions of the main system.
Nuclear Electric said last night that the back-up system at Sizewell, which
will be the UK's first pressurised water reactor, operated on the same
principle as those used at existing nuclear stations. The
computer-controlled primary system was an additional safeguard aimed at
protecting against more remote risks.
The company said that human operators would be able to override the
computer-controlled system and shut down the plant at any stage if they
suspected a fault. The computer would prevent them only from taking action
that would compromise the plant's safety.
Today's Computer Weekly magazine reports that the inspectorate asked Nuclear
Electric to consider increasing the scope of its back-up safety system at a
meeting of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations at
Sizewell last month.
Nuclear Electric said yesterday that the costs of extending the secondary
safety system at Sizewell would be considerable. The costs have already
risen from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 2bn.
Nuclear Electric said the NII had said it would license the Sizewell B plant
without extending the secondary system if the company could substantiate the
validation tests it was performing on the computer-controlled system.
Radioactive waste should not pose a serious health risk to more than one
person in 100,000 per year, according to new objectives laid down by the
National Radiological Protection Board, David Lascelles writes.
The board also said that future generations should not be exposed to any
risks which would be considered unacceptable today.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNUSUALLY dramatic painting by the 19th century horse painter John
Frederick Herring Snr sold for Pounds 251,000 at Sotheby's yesterday. The
painting, entitled 'Mazeppa', depicts the Ukranian general of that name
strapped to the back of a wild stallion.
It was the top price in an auction of British paintings that totalled Pounds
1.2m, with just more than 36 per cent unsold.
It was not a bad result given the market's present state. The unsold
percentage was boosted by the failure of Constable's 'Willy Lott's House' to
find a buyer even though bidding reached Pounds 180,000, its low estimate.
Stubbs' 'Horse frightened by a Lion' was sold for Pounds 104,500, at the
bottom of its estimate.
Among the successes were a contemporary painting of the young Prince Edward,
later King Edward VI, attributed to the studio of William Scrotts. It sold
above estimate for Pounds 52,800. 'Rownham Ferry with Portraits', by the
short-lived early 19th-century painter Rolinda Sharples, doubled its
estimate at Pounds 46,200, a record for this female artist.
The National Army Museum bought a portrait of an officer of the 15th Light
Dragoons by Tilly Kettle for Pounds 12,650, and the National Postal Museum
paid Pounds 7,480 for two paintings by James Pollard depicting 19th-century
Royal Mail coaches.
Another museum buying yesterday was the Royal Armouries, which paid Pounds
6,600 at Christie's for a sporting gun given by Queen Victoria in 1868 to
her favourite gamekeeper, John Brown.
Christie's South Kensington on Tuesday celebrated its 25th year of auctions
devoted to costumes and textiles. Top price at the sale was Pounds 16,500
paid by the US collector Cora Ginzburg for a chintz open robe made around
1770.
Another robe of the same period, discovered in a costume trunk at London's
Player's Theatre, sold for Pounds 6,820, three times its estimate.

FT  16 JUL 92 / BR introduces quality rules for its suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL yesterday introduced rules to govern its relations with
suppliers that provide it with Pounds 1.5bn of goods and services every
year.
At a meeting with 270 of its largest suppliers in Birmingham Mr Peter
Watson, the board member responsible for engineering, outlined a system of
qualification and accreditation that each company will have to undertake if
it is to remain a BR supplier.
The aim is to raise the standard of service and to improve the quality of
products BR buys, as part of a programme to boost the confidence of BR's own
customers.
BR is going down the same route as the automotive industry, where car
manufacturers have produced lists of preferred suppliers with which they are
prepared to work on a long-term basis.
Mr Watson said the government's plans for privatisation would have no impact
on the process. He added that the step was 'better late than never'.
BR's new policy towards its suppliers will be introduced in two stages. From
January next year no company will be able to tender for a supply contract
unless it can meet minimum standards. Also starting next year, BR will
introduce accreditation awards for its main suppliers.
BR's main suppliers include GEC Alsthom, Brel and Brush for rolling stock;
ABB and Westinghouse for signalling equipment; and British Steel, Pandrol
and Costain for track.
Operating losses at London Transport increased from Pounds 108m to Pounds
123m in the year to March 31 because of a fall in the number of passengers.

FT  16 JUL 92 / SFO tells of regrets over Blue Arrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office would not handle the year-long Blue Arrow fraud
trial the same way again, the Court of Appeal heard yesterday.
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, who brought the prosecution for the SFO, said his
original estimate that the trial would last four to six months was genuine
and sincere.
The first lesson to be learnt was that pre-trial hearings had to be more
rigorous than was the case in Blue Arrow, he said. However, there was no
risk that the convictions of four City advisers of conspiracy to defraud
were unsafe or unsatisfactory, he continued.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed, Mr Nicholas Wells, all former County
NatWest executives, and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
director, are appealing against their convictions for conspiracy to defraud.
In a separate hearing in the High Court Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, was given leave to bring a prosecution for contempt of
court against Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Mail on Sunday; Mr
Stewart Steven, the newspaper's former editor; and Mr Clive Wolman, City
editor.
Counsel for the attorney-general argued that the newspaper's publication of
interviews with members of the Blue Arrow jury constituted a breach of the
Contempt of Court Act 1981.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Scots training payments faulted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, has qualified
the first annual accounts of Scottish Enterprise, the body that replaced the
Scottish Development Agency last year, saying there is 'a risk of error
which could be material'.
The qualification in the statement on the accounts from Sir John Bourn,
comptroller and auditor-general, relates to payments made by Scottish
Enterprise to the 13 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) under its control
which they passed on to training providers. Lecs are the Scottish equivalent
of the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales.
Sir John says that at five of the Lecs, financial appraisal and monitoring
systems for the disbursal of training funds were not in place for the whole
of the 1991-92 financial year. One did not implement them until last
November.
He says that the appraisal and monitoring systems at one Lec were 'giving
Scottish Enterprise concern at the end of the financial year' and that 11
Lecs had not arranged an internal audit to be carried out in the form
required by the rules.
Business people in several sectors in Scotland are becoming slightly more
confident about their prospects and there are signs of a modest rise in
demand, according to the latest quarterly Scottish business survey conducted
by chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of
Strathclyde University, Glasgow.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Finance body warns on upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER warning that the UK faces a slow economic recovery came yesterday
from the Finance and Leasing Association, whose members last year financed
more than 30 per cent of fixed investment.
The FLA said its latest economic survey showed that confidence about future
business conditions had declined since the general election.
The survey, carried out in June, found that 55 per cent of FLA members
polled expect confidence to increase over the next three months compared
with 83 per cent that expected an improvement immediately after the April
election.
'Post-election realism has set in and most companies now realise a recovery
will be slow,' said Mr Tony Mallin, deputy chairman of the FLA. However, he
added: 'Members have noticed some signs of revival in investment and
long-planned projects are now getting under way.'
The association said the most promising areas for investment activity
financed by leasing were in the small and middle ticket ranges. Some 70 per
cent of FLA members forecast an increase in leasing and hire purchase
agreements of up to Pounds 50,000 value over the next three months, while 51
per cent expected the demand for leases in the Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 1m
range to rise.
The FLA was founded this year to represent companies offering business
finance and leasing, consumer credit and motor finance. It expects its
members to have more than Pounds 30bn of new business this year.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Radical accounts changes proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROFIT and loss account and balance sheet of many companies could be
fundamentally reshaped under radical proposals unveiled by the Accounting
Standards Board yesterday.
In two draft chapters in its 'statement of principles', the board makes
recommendations that could force all leases and off-balance-sheet finance
instruments to be included on the balance sheet.
It would also cast a shadow over the widespread practice of making large
provisions for reorganisation expenses on buying a company, which can then
be fed back to the profit and loss account.
'These go a long way beyond existing definitions,' said Mr David Tweedie,
chairman of the board. 'They are pretty fundamental and we expect an
onslaught of criticism.'
The impact of the draft chapters would be to improve the transparency of
accounts, and probably overall to increase companies' liabilities and allow
less room for them to massage profits.
The new chapters are the foundations on which new standards will be built.
The first chapter - the elements of financial statements - defines the basic
elements or items in accounts. It says that assets are 'rights or other
access to future economic benefits controlled by an entity as a result of
past transactions or events'. It stresses that they do not require
certainty, but only some possibility of access to future benefit.
Liabilities are 'an entity's obligations to transfer economic benefits as a
result of past transactions or events.'
The second chapter - covering the 'recognition' of these elements - says
that they should be incorporated into the accounts if they meet three
criteria: they meet the definitions; they can be measured reliably; and that
there is evidence of changes in assets or liabilities having occurred.
Organisations have until October 31 to comment on the discussion drafts.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Maxwell probe challenge fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARK HAAS, an executive director of Lehman Brothers International, the UK
arm of US investment bankers Lehman Brothers, has failed to block his
interrogation today about stock-lending agreements between Lehman and
Bishopsgate Investment Management.
The High Court yesterday rejected his challenge to an order under the
Insolvency Act that he submit to oral examination by the liquidators of BIM,
which managed Maxwell company pension schemes.
Mr Justice Hoffmann also rejected Mr Haas's plea that he be shown an
annexure to a confidential report by Mr Neil Cooper of Robson Rhodes, one of
the liquidators.
The annexure identified the informant who gave the liquidators information
about the agreements, which had suggested to them the line of inquiry they
wanted to pursue with Mr Haas, the judge said.
He said one of the agreements had involved Lehman lending BIM US Treasury
bills against collateral provided by BIM in the form of pension-fund
investments. The bills had immediately been converted into cash for BIM by
Lehman. On the face of it that arrangement, although designated as stock
lending, had been nothing more than a secured loan of money by Lehman to
BIM, the judge said.
Ruling that Mr Haas's interrogation must go ahead, the judge said the
liquidators were concerned to discover the extent of Lehman's knowledge of
the nature and purpose of the stock-lending agreements.
The primary purpose of the interrogation was to discover whether they had
grounds for suing Lehman.

FT  16 JUL 92 / War with trade unions is over says Shephard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is no longer at war with the trade union movement and
believes unions can have a valid role, according to Mrs Gillian Shephard,
the employment secretary.
She told journalists yesterday that she was not interested in 'talking to
the unions in a hostile way'. She added that the Trade Unions Bill, which
introduces a number of further restrictions on the unions and is likely to
go before parliament in October, was only a 'tidying up exercise'.
'I don't see this as part of a war against the trade unions. There was a war
in the 1980s but that is now over,' she said.
These comments are the first attempt by Mrs Shephard to distance herself
from the more aggressive stance of her predecessor, Mr Michael Howard.
She has made few changes to Mr Howard's bill, which includes restrictions on
strike action and on the automatic 'check-off' of union dues by employers.
However, she has added an element of her own which underlines her different
priorities.
The new element is a move to shake up the schools Careers Service by
insisting that the service, currently run by local authorities, is put out
to tender. 'We must free up the provision of careers advice,' Mrs Shephard
said.
A recent survey of employers showed that the service was not widely used. A
Department of Employment official said the service had been seen by
employers as trapped in the educational establishment.
Mrs Shephard also emphasised that she was concerned about the number of
young people who were not getting a place on the Youth Training scheme, in
spite of a government guarantee of a place for all.
She added that she would be getting monthly reports on the problem. 'The
trouble is that the machinery bringing together the young person and the
training place is not always there,' Mrs Shephard said.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour employment spokesman, said up to 200,000 young
people could be missing out on a training place.
Mrs Shephard's more emollient attitude to the unions will be viewed with
some suspicion by union leaders. Although she is viewed as an improvement
upon Mr Howard, they would like to see the new style translated into policy.
Some union leaders hope she may block the abolition of the remaining Wages
Councils which set minimum wages for 2.5m people.
The government is in principle committed to abolition of the Wages Councils
and Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, is known to be a keen
supporter of this although Mrs Shephard's position is less clear.

FT  16 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors fail to get regulator's evidence heard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International failed
yesterday in an attempt to submit evidence from the Luxembourg Monetary
Institute which they argued would strengthen their attempt to reject the
compensation plan negotiated between liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority
shareholders.
The evidence, which has been shown to the Financial Times, outlines a
strongly worded objection to the liquidation plan from the LMI, which had
regulatory responsibility over the Luxembourg-registered BCCI SA, one of the
two main banking arms.
Mr David Hunt QC, counsel for the creditors, told the Court of Appeal
yesterday that the evidence emerged after last month's High Court ruling
that sanctioned the Dollars 1.7bn compensation package, and could have
influenced the court's decision.
A summary of the LMI criticisms, contained in documents prepared for the
case but ruled by the Appeal Court judges as inadmissible, outlines a
17-point objection to the plan which some creditors believe presents a
powerful argument against the package drawn up by Touche Ross, the
liquidators.
The main points were:
The majority shareholders were given wide powers of decision in the
liquidation.
The presence of an Abu Dhabi government representative on the board of BCCI
meant that the Sheikdom could not be considered 'passive shareholders
exposed to the actions of the board over which they had no control'.
The power to pursue some third-party claims has been passed to Abu Dhabi in
the agreement without any commitment by Abu Dhabi to do so.
If Abu Dhabi was successful in claims against third parties to the extent
that it succeeded in having the entire losses repatriated, it would qualify
for half the proceeds - potentially more than it would have paid.
Under the terms of the proposed agreement the Abu Dhabi government reserves
the right to withhold BCCI files in its possession if it judges it to be in
its interests.
The significance of this agreement is also apparent in the documents, which
reveal that Abu Dhabi is holding more than 81,000 BCCI files crucial to the
Touche Ross investigations. Some papers are still being withheld from the
liquidators more than a year after BCCI's closure by the Bank of England.
Lord Justice Dillon rejected the application, saying the Luxembourg
regulator's views were opinion. The appeal is expected to end tomorrow.

<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of the London Docklands Development Corporation yesterday
called on the Department of the Environment to relocate its offices to
Canary Wharf rather than to two other possible sites in Docklands.
Mr Michael Pickard said relocation to Canary Wharf would help to secure the
release of funding by the development's administrators. The funding would
meet an initial Pounds 100m payment required by the government for work to
begin on the Jubilee Underground extension.
The corporation's annual report shows writedowns against falls in property
values of Pounds 52.1m. There was a deficit of Pounds 52.9m against a
pre-tax surplus the year before of Pounds 6.1m. Canary Wharf has cost the
corporation up to Pounds 1m from the loss of mooring fees and certain
development costs for which Olympia &amp; York, the developer, had pledged to
reimburse it.
Mr Pickard says the corporation is convinced that the administrators of O&amp;Y
'will resolve its financial situation in a way that allows the project to
continue moving forward'.
The corporation is negotiating with Customs and Excise over about Pounds 2m
in VAT payments, and with the Inland Revenue over surplus tax of up to
Pounds 27m.
Mr Pickard adds that action has been taken to improve the reliability of the
Docklands Light Railway.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Executives strive to cope with job loss: Back-to-work
strategies in a recession with record managerial redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR executive living in an exclusive cul-de-sac in stockbroker-belt
Surrey was so traumatised when he lost his job two years ago that he
disguised the fact from his golf-partner neighbours for several months.
Eighteen months later he was still without work but was a happier man - all
but one of the seven breadwinners in his cul-de-sac were by then unemployed
too.
Mr Mark Scott, a partner in recruiting agency Jamieson Scott, tells this
story to illustrate the unprecedented increase in executive, management and
professional unemployment that has been a feature of the present recession.
Nobody knows precisely how many managers are unemployed. In the early 1980s
the Department of Employment stopped keeping information about former
occupations of the unemployed - classifying managers is in any case
difficult.
But according to an Employment Department study of London and the
South-East, 19 per cent of the unemployed have worked in professional or
managerial occupations. That is about 150,000 people, and 400,000 for the
whole country.
This figure is not just a result of recession. Organisational change has
permanently cut out layers of generalist middle managers and computers have
wiped out certain specialisms.
A survey by Reed Personnel Services predicts that managers will be the staff
in least demand as the recession ends. It adds that companies have reduced
management staff by 27 per cent during the recession, beaten only by
unskilled staff who have declined 31 per cent.
Do unemployed managers respond differently to unemployed non-managers?
There are plenty of true stories of dynamic executives setting up sandwich
delivery services or working, at least temporarily, as mini-cab drivers.
But it appears managers are actually less flexible than most non-managers as
regards future employment. An Employment Department study of the South-East
reveals only 20 per cent of managers are prepared to consider non-managerial
positions.
Ms Dulce Merritt, managing director of Reed Accountancy, the employment
agency, says that in the early stages of recession managers did seem
prepared to take jobs below their previous pay and status but that has now
stopped.
She points out that sacked managers are often the least effective and
flexible and therefore are less able to return to the job market. Generalist
managers tend to be unemployed longest, but some groups, such as credit and
tax managers, have not been hit at all.
The Employment Department study shows that managers are under-represented -
only 10 per cent - among those unemployed for 18 months or longer -
self-employment may explain this.
According to figures compiled Clubs, designed to help executives back to
work, 4,041 out of the 12,158 executives who used the service last year got
a job. A further 1,430 had a 'positive outcome', meaning in most cases
self-employment.
Senior executives in their 40s and 50s, with a marketable skill, often have
to learn to survive by building up a portfolio of part-time consultancy
jobs. 'That means a huge change in working life, some thrive but many find
it tough,' says Mr Scott.
                        *      *      *
MR ROD HARVEY used to design buildings. Recently he has been sweeping floors
on building sites for a few pounds an hour while he searches for a full-time
job, Lisa Wood writes.
An architect by profession, Mr Harvey's goal is to work in a 'people area',
preferably in equal opportunities. A former Pounds 30,000-plus earner, he
would definitely take a salary cut.
Mr Harvey, a 42-year-old New Zealander, used to work for Chapman Taylor
Partners, once the UK's second-largest architectural firm. In 1989 it had
650 staff - last year when Mr Harvey was made redundant it employed 150
people.
He said: 'My last job was the mechanical and electrical co-ordinator on a
Pounds 76m shopping and leisure centre in Woking. It was a massive job but
contracts like those are just not coming up anymore.'
He signed on with the Unemployment Office last August. His wife works and so
he did not qualify for any form of income support or housing benefit.
Over the year, while doing an MSC in construction management, Mr Harvey has
applied for almost 800 jobs. He started by applying to other architectural
firms but has now changed tack and wants a job in personnel.
Several of his colleagues at the Birkbeck Executive Job Club, run by Kennedy
Scott, a training development company, also want jobs in the 'people'
business.
Mr Harvey says: 'I'm lucky. I have been able to find a new job goal. A lot
of us are just numb for a long time after being pushed out of our jobs.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / Cost of theft claims rises to Pounds 3m a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISING TIDE of theft claims is costing insurers more than Pounds 3m a day,
according to figures released yesterday. Both the cost and number of claims
rose sharply in the first three months of this year, the statistics from the
Association of British Insurers' indicate.
The association blames some of the increase on the recession but says that
consumers are increasingly likely to cheat on their insurance policies.
In the first quarter of this year the cost of theft claims increased to
Pounds 300.7m, a rise of 44.2 per cent on the same period last year.
Over the year to the end of March the rise was even steeper, with claims
rising 53.7 per cent to Pounds 999.4m.
Although inner-city areas have been badly hit, the crime wave is affecting
all areas of the country.
The association estimates that fraud cost its members Pounds 400m last year.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Skill shortage expected to cloud upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession has perman-ently changed companies' staffing patterns but as
the economy picks up businesses are still likely to be affected by skill
shortages, a survey of 350 companies by Reed Personnel Services found.
The changes identified include: more central control over staffing, the
restructuring and cross-training of a permanent core of staff, and greater
use of flexible contracts. More than 80 per cent of companies said they
wanted to hold on to these changes and would be able to do so.
The survey says that companies have learnt to do more with less staff, but
during the next six months 38 per cent of companies expect to take on
permanent staff and 26 per cent temporary staff.
A shortage of skilled staff will develop alongside continuing high
unemployment for both unskilled staff and managers. Only 11 per cent of
companies expect to take on more managers as the recession ends, but 33 per
cent expect to take on more skilled staff.
The number of skilled staff fell in only 20 per cent of companies as the
recession deepened. Personnel departments also survived the recession
relatively well, with staff cuts declining in only 17 per cent of companies.
Several reports have been published to coincide with today's announcement of
last month's unemployment figures which are expected to show another
substantial rise.
The Trades Union Congress said that on current trends employment will not
start growing until 1994 and the AEEU engineering and electrical union has
identified 22,500 manufacturing job losses since mid March, bringing the
total for the year to 55,000.
Recruitment consultant Alfred Marks says the number of permanent job
vacancies continues to grow slowly. In the past three months vacancies are
14 per cent up on the first three months of the year.
The number of employers offering paternity leave has nearly doubled over the
past three years, according to the largest survey of personnel management in
Europe by the Price Waterhouse Cranfield Project.
The survey found companies maintained equal opportunities policies in spite
of the recession.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Concern at likely level of police pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pay of Britain's 120,000-strong police force in 1992-93 is set to rise
by 7 per cent, or just under, according to the Public Finance Foundation,
David Goodhart writes.
This is well above most public-sector increases and the foundation, an
independent pay research group, says it gives a further push to the creation
of a 'two-tier' public sector,
The monthly index of average earnings for May, published today, determines
police pay from September 1992 to August 1993.
A pay rise of about 7 per cent would take a constable at the top of the
scale to more than Pounds 21,000. Last September pay rose by 8.5 per cent.
The police have had a pay determination system based on average earnings
since the late 1970s, but that system is under review. The government is
keen to inject an element of performance pay. It also wants to be able to
award good police officers who do not want to climb the career ladder.
The review's findings are not likely to be agreed in time to alter the
current system in 1993-94.
Police pay has had a higher percentage rise than the public-sector average
in almost every year since 1976.
Staff at Granada Television fear a new round of redundancies is being
planned including the hiving-off or closing of some of the ITV contractor's
activities, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Meetings between Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of Granada Television, and
Granada's unions are expected later this month.
Granada Television, one of the main programme producers for the ITV network,
has been under increasing pressure to cut costs since the arrival last year
of Mr Gerry Robinson as chief executive of the Granada Group.
Earlier this month Granada announced a 49 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 57.2m for the 28 weeks to April 11.
In February pressure on costs led to the forced resignation of Mr David
Plowright, chairman of Granada Television.
Some staff fear that there are plans to turn Granada into a
publisher/broadcaster, commissioning an increasing proportion of programmes
from outside. This is denied by the management.
Granada's television production centre in Manchester is seen by senior
management as a cost burden rather than an asset.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Clinton and Gore take centre stage: Brown withholds backing
at Democratic convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DESCRIBING the experience as 'amazing and humbling', Governor Bill Clinton
of Arkansas prepared last night to accept the presidential nomination of the
Democratic party.
But he had to make do without the formal endorsement of Mr Jerry Brown,
former governor of California and his last surviving primary opponent.
In a rambling speech to the Democratic party's convention in New York, which
received a lukewarm reception, Mr Brown last night launched a tirade against
the evils of power and money. He blamed the plight of the nation on
everything and everybody, from utilities, investment bankers and lawyers to
corporate executives and corrupt politicians.
He criticised President George Bush often - at no stage did he mention Mr
Clinton.
Asked beforehand what would happen if Mr Brown exceeded his 20-minute
speaking time, his namesake - Mr Ron Brown, the Democratic national chairman
 -grinned and replied: 'We have this podium that goes up and down.'
The first two days of the convention, which began on Monday, were, according
to Ron Brown, 'all about defining the party'. The next two were designed 'to
shift the definition' to Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running-mate.
Mr Clinton kept out of sight yesterday, working on acceptance speech he will
deliver tonight, and so did just about everybody else before the formal
events of the evening yesterday culminated in the ballot for the nomination.
Ron Brown complimented the Rev Jesse Jackson for his endorsement of the
Clinton-Gore ticket on Tuesday night. The civil rights leader, he said, was
'a constructive force' who had always supported Democratic presidential
candidates and would be essential for success in the November election.
Mr Jackson had indeed referred to 'President Bill Clinton', declaring: 'The
hopes of many depend on your quest, be comforted that you do not stand
alone.' But much of his relatively subdued speech was an invocation of the
liberal causes which he is known to feel have been given less than their due
by Mr Clinton's determination to bring the party back towards the centre.
The party platform approved on Tuesday night was very much shaped in Mr
Clinton's moderate image, with all minority recommendations voted down,
though without rancour. Ron Brown described it yesterday as 'common sense
and pragmatic', related to the problems of working people.
He drew attention to the party's commitment to fight Aids. The convention
had heard two moving speeches from Aids sufferers on Tuesday, though both
were delivered before prime-time live television coverage began.
This coverage is much more sparse than in the past, reflecting commercial
pressure on the networks and the decline in public interest in conventions.
Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the focus of so many previous
conventions, spoke last night long before the cameras rolled.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Wall Street contemplates change of guard: Business is paying
more attention to Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUIET carpeted corridors of Wall Street's top brokerage houses seem a
world away from the bustle and bunting of Madison Square Garden.
This election year, however, Wall Street executives are playing unusually
close attention to events at the Democratic party convention. Many have a
sinking feeling that Governor Bill Clinton could just win the presidency in
November.
The reaction on Wall Street today to the Clinton/Gore ticket is absolutely
clear, says Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, the
broker. 'It is fear, hostility and apprehension.'
He has just completed an analysis of the economics of presidential elections
and the omens do not look good for President George Bush.
'The message is that the public votes its pocketbook,' he says. Economic
growth in the first three years of the Bush presidency has averaged a meagre
1.1 per cent a year, the worst record of any administration since the 1930s.
Mr Bush's performance is far worse than that of either the second Eisenhower
administration in the late 1950s or the Carter administration in the late
1970s, when growth averaged 2.5 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. Both
incumbent parties lost the presidency.
The figures on personal incomes are even more depressing. Incumbent parties
have invariably lost if the growth of real personal disposable income in the
year preceding the election has dipped significantly below about 4 per cent,
Mr Straszheim says. Under Mr Bush, the figure is likely to be just over 2
per cent, nowhere near good enough to guarantee re-election.
Earlier this year, most analysts in financial markets assumed Mr Bush would
win a second victory in November. Mr Straszheim is far from alone in taking
the possibility of a Clinton presidency seriously.
Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at The Boston Group, an economic
consultancy, says: 'My working assumption is that the Clinton/Gore ticket
will win.' He regards the weak economy as only one of several factors that
could pull Bush down.
'The disenchantment with Washington' will count against Mr Bush as will the
growing perception that the 'president is asleep at the wheel,' he adds. In
failing to respond to acute domestic problems, Mr Bush appears 'almost as
inept as President Carter in 1980'.
Mr Clinton's shrewd selection of Senator Al Gore from Tennessee - another
moderate southerner - as his running mate is also seen as significantly
strengthening the Democratic ticket. On Wall Street, now largely a
meritocracy, even committed Republicans feel uncomfortable defending Mr Dan
Quayle, vice-president, who is widely regarded as lacking the qualifications
for high office.
Mr Gore's intellect and energy, on the other hand, command grudging respect.
One leading Wall Street bond market commentator, who wishes to remain
anonymous, is convinced Mr Clinton will win. But he says none of the above
arguments is as important as the Supreme Court's recent decision narrowly to
uphold abortion rights. With polls indicating that a majority of Americans
are 'pro choice,' he claims this was the perfect result for Mr Clinton.
It allows the Democrat to present himself as the only plausible bulwark
against the one judicial appointment needed by Mr Bush to overturn Roe vs
Wade, the 1973 decision that legalised abortion. At the convention, a
succession of prominent female politicians, led by Governor Ann Richards of
Texas, has pushed abortion to the fore, aggressively declaring themselves
pro-choice.
On Wall Street, predictions of a Ross Perot presidency were conspicuous by
their absence. Some analysts doubt the Texan entrepreneur will actually run.
The consensus is that he will press ahead but, like all previous independent
candidates this century, be squeezed out by the two main political parties.
In a part of Manhattan where Republican voters overwhelmingly outnumber
Democrats, many executives remain quietly confident that Mr Bush will
successfully relaunch his campaign in Houston next month.
Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities and a self-styled
libertarian, says Mr Bush is likely to get the most votes despite his poor
economic performance. But he worries that nobody will win a clear victory on
November 3, in which case the House of Representatives makes the final
decision. 'This would be the worst possible result for financial markets
because it would create the maximum uncertainty.'
Perhaps belatedly, Wall Street recognises that political judgments are now
indispensable when making financial forecasts for 1993 and beyond. But
analysts differ on the importance of politics.
Mr Paul Mastroddi, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan, the New York bank,
says a Clinton presidency would not alter the economic outlook all that
much. People underestimate the constraints the budget deficit imposes on
politicians of any party, he argues.
Mr Leonard Santow, a founder of the Wall Street firm Griggs and Santow,
disagrees. A Clinton presidency would make a big immediate difference
because a Democratic White House, co-operating with a Democratic Congress,
could actually do something. 'If Clinton wins, you would get a lot of early
stimulative legislation, making up for 12 years of lost time.' Growth next
year would be 3 per cent compared with 1-2 per cent if Mr Bush were
returned, he argues.
Financial markets are traditionally wary of Democrats. But faster growth
under Mr Clinton would put upward pressure on US interest rates. In the
short run at least, the dollar could thus strengthen if a Clinton victory
appeared likely.
Wall Street is only beginning to think through the longer-term implications
of a possible changing of guard in Washington. Many analysts fear for their
own pocketbooks because Mr Clinton has promised to raise taxes on the
wealthy. But aspects of Mr Clinton's economic programme, which emphasises
the need for investment in education, training and infrastructure, are
viewed positively.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Bush hoping to hook Baker as campaign guru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and the Republican party have mostly let Governor Bill
Clinton and the Democrats hold centre-stage this week, half in the hope that
the opposition would revert to type and disembowel itself.
That has not happened, which means that, when the Democrats leave New York,
attention will turn again to the incumbent and his team.
Campaign watchers wait to see what emerges from Mr Bush's two-day fishing
trip, which began yesterday in Wyoming. At issue is not what Mr Bush and Mr
James Baker, secretary of state, catch in the rivers, but whether the
president can lure his old friend back into a leading role in his stuttering
campaign.
Four years ago, when the Democrats were nominating Mr Michael Dukakis in
Atlanta, the two men also went fishing in Wyoming. Two weeks later, Mr Baker
resigned as Treasury secretary to run the Bush campaign. He was considered
instrumental in turning a double-digit deficit into a comfortable victory in
November.
Mr Bush, according to the polls, is faring better than he was then, but the
likelihood is that Mr Clinton will prove a tougher nut to crack than Mr
Dukakis, while Mr Ross Perot is still muddying the conservative waters.
Moreover, it did not help Mr Bush that he was booed, albeit mildly, when he
attended an all-star baseball game in San Diego on Tuesday night. More
Americans were watching that game on television than were viewing the
Democratic convention.
One option is for Mr Baker to be brought back as a combined campaign and
domestic policy supremo. This has been assiduously denied for weeks and it
may be that he can exercise at least the campaign part of the role from his
present perch at the State Department.
There is expectation of a dirty campaign to come.
The Republicans have disowned the activities of Mr Floyd Brown, now a
renegade conservative activist but notorious for having been the producer of
the scurrilous Willie Horton commercial four years ago which so damaged Mr
Dukakis by playing on the fears of white Americans.
Mr Brown has been digging into Mr Clinton's private life and is trying,
among other dirty tricks, to activate a telephone hotline featuring alleged
taped conversations between Mr Clinton and Ms Gennifer Flowers, a one-time
night club singer. On Tuesday, the Bush campaign filed a formal complaint
against Mr Brown with the Federal Election Commission.
In one respect, the president has been consistent. He has always insisted
the campaign proper will not begin until the Republican convention a month
from now in Houston. Only then, he has argued, will the public mind
concentrate on the alternatives.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Fujimori and military in awkward embrace: The problems and
politics of the Peruvian president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unprecedented 'ceremony of institutional unity', held last week by Peru's
army top brass, has raised the first serious doubts about the solidity of
armed forces backing for President Alberto Fujimori's de facto regime.
The flamboyant event involved some 2,000 army officers from all over the
country and seemed to have been intended to provoke similar demonstrations
of unquestioning loyalty by navy, air force and police. So far these have
failed to materialise.
On the surface, the parade and speechifying were a robust response to an
interview given in Europe by Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, the internationally
renowned Peruvian novelist who was defeated by Mr Fujimori in the last
presidential election.
His suggestion that Latin America would be better off without its armed
forces unleashed a hail of abuse from the Peruvian army's supreme commander,
who accused him of 'sickly anti-militarism' and of 'being a Peruvian only by
geographical accident'.
Along the way, army support for Mr Fujimori's suspension of the constitution
on April 5 was roundly reiterated.
Mr Vargas Llosa carries no political weight in Peru today so one must look
for the hidden agenda behind the attack. The show of unity, admit even
sources close to Mr Fujimori, conceals a potentially damaging discontent in
the ranks of Peru's ever-influential armed forces.
Their first gripe is about money. Many enthusiastic but ingenuous officers
expected immediate financial benefits from the money 'saved' through the
disbanding of Congress. But pay levels remain low - generals take home less
than the equivalent of Dollars 400 a month, even though Lima is now as
expensive as New York - and unprecedented numbers of officers are leaving
the services. Most US military assistance remains frozen because of
congressional concern in Washington over human rights abuses.
Prospects for salary improvements are poor. Mr Carlos Bolona, economy
minister, reiterated last week that any public-sector pay rises possible
under his stringent fiscal management would follow established priorities -
security forces first, then education and health workers.
The second concern, at least for the thinking and honest element among the
military, is the lack of real progress against subversion and
drug-trafficking, Mr Fujimori's double-edged justification for his
dissolution of congress in April. 'The recent avalanche of detentions makes
it appear there is a counter-subversive strategy,' said one high-ranking
naval officer, 'but that's not so. There isn't the political will for it.'
Reports from Peru's coca-growing zones, meanwhile, indicate that sectors of
the army and police are still involved in 'protecting' drugs aircraft,
collecting fees of between Dollars 3,000 and Dollars 5,000 per flight.
A further cause for military unease is the continuing - for many, malevolent
 -influence of a once-cashiered captain over the president. While Mr
Fujimori insists that Mr Vladimiro Montesinos is simply his personal lawyer
and one of a number of close advisers, top military and intelligence men
attribute extensive powers to this shadowy figure they call 'the phantom of
the palace'.
Recent wrangling over promotions, where the hand of Mr Montesinos is said to
rule, has left an after-taste of bitterness and suspicion with many
high-ranking officers. 'We never get to talk directly with the president any
more,' complains one. 'Montesinos just comes and gives us the latest news
through a half-open door.'
There are signs that, as Mr Fujimori draws closer to the military - he has
virtually abandoned the government palace to live in the military
Pentagonito (little Pentagon) in Lima - support from the de facto regime's
other two pillars is starting to be eroded.
One prominent entrepreneur, a regular member of the presidential entourage
on a series of investment-seeking trips abroad last year, says: 'President
Fujimori is becoming more and more isolated from the real world. His
increasing authoritarianism is very perturbing.'
The reality, however, is that, with international funding and overseas
investor interest in abeyance until a return to democracy has been
engineered, support from the business community is of little immediate
interest to a pragmatic president. 'Peruvian businessmen have always
prostituted themselves before who-ever's in power', said one close
presidential adviser. 'For a while, they were the darlings - but not any
more.'
Support on the streets is, too, falling from its initial euphoric levels. A
survey by the Lima-based Apoyo polling organisation in late-June showed
popular approval for Mr Fujimori at 68 per cent, down eight points in little
over two weeks.
But the president continues his periodic tongue-lashing of the traditional
parties and the media - tactics which usually push his ratings up a few
points. News of the collapse of a series of financial institutions linked to
the previous government has also been skilfully handled by the presidential
psych-ops team to achieve maximum discredit for the opposition Apra party in
particular and politicians in general.
Diplomatic observers continue to wring their hands at the degree of
improvisation which pervades every level of government activity. Hardly a
decree is passed, a tax level fixed or an election date finalised than it is
retracted within hours. 'The problem is,' explains a rueful presidential
adviser, 'that Mr Fujimori knows what he wants but he doesn't know how to
get there.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / Black leaders come in to their own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to stirring the emotions, Mr Jesse Jackson is still unmatched
within the Democratic party, writes George Graham in New York.
Although relegated to a less prominent speaking slot at this year's party
convention, he did it again on Tuesday night, rousing his audience in
Madison Square Garden with a powerful sermon on inequality and compassion.
But the convention has brought to the fore a different style of black
leadership, with men and women who have chosen to take elected office. They
include, in Congress, Representatives Bill Jerrson of Louisiana and Mike
Espy of Mississippi; in the states, governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia; or,
in the party, Mr Ron Brown, the Democrats' first black chairman.
Many of Mr Jackson's supporters were disappointed that he ducked the
opportunity to follow the same path by running for mayor of Washington DC,
choosing instead to take the more symbolic role of 'shadow senator' lobbying
for Washington to be allowed statehood.
Mr Brown served as convention manager for Mr Jackson's presidential campaign
in 1988, but he moved on to become a senior political adviser to the Dukakis
campaign. Since taking over as party chairman in 1989 he has worked to
create a Democratic campaign apparatus ready to work for whoever emerged
from this year's primaries as the party's presidential candidate.
A 50-year-old partner in the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow,
Mr Brown is a smooth-tongued and sharp-suited operator behind the scenes.
In the last three years, however, he has taken a prominent role as the
Democrats' spokesman, filling the void left by the low-key leadership of
Congressional Democrats like Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of
Representatives.
Governor Bill Clinton, in his campaign for the presidential nomination, has
been perceived by some as shunning black votes by pointedly distancing
himself from Mr Jackson. In fact, however, he has developed strong support
from the new generation of black leaders such as Congressman Espy.
'I think the Clinton campaign has been very smart. They have gone directly
to indigenous leaders and elected officials,' said Congressman John Lewis of
Georgia, a legendary figure from the civil rights era who bridges both wings
of the black community, and who has backed Mr Clinton in his home state of
Georgia and in the south.
On Tuesday Mr Clinton won the endorsement of Mr Wilder, the country's first
black governor since Reconstruction after the Civil War, who was briefly a
candidate for the Democratic nomination.
The strategy is risky. 'Don't Mess With Jesse' is a cry that reverberates
strongly, particularly with big-city black leaders like Congresswoman Maxine
Waters of Los Angeles and Congressman Charles Rangel of New York.
But Mrs Hillary Clinton's enthusiastic welcome by the Democratic national
committee's black caucus suggests that her husband's bridges to the
community have by no means been burned. 'We will speak for you in November
at the ballot box,' said Dr C. DeLores Tucker, the caucus' chair.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Cuomo hails the Comeback Kid'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mario Cuomo did Mr Bill Clinton proud last night. The governor of New
York nominated the governor of Arkansas as Democratic candidate for
president in a speech that wittily savaged President George Bush and evoked
heroic qualities in Mr Clinton.
Bill Clinton, Mr Cuomo said 'is the new captain who will change the course
of the nation before it is too late'. President Bush, he said, was steering
'the ship of state for the rocks'.
Referring to the Gulf war victory parade, he added: 'Step aside, Mr Bush,
you've had your parade. It's time for a change - someone smart enough to
know; strong enough to do; sure enough to lead. The Comeback Kid. A new
voice for America.'
Mr Clinton called himself the 'Comeback Kid' when he survived a series of
scandals to place second in the New Hampshire primary last February.
Bill Clinton, he went on to rapturous applause, understood the national need
for jobs. President Bush's supply-side economics had perpetrated the
'greatest bank robbery' in the savings and loans scandal and 'we heard no
moralising then from our Republican leaders then, did we?'.
President Bush, he intoned, was always saying the country had 'the will but
not the wallet'. Mr Clinton understood that 'we can always find the wealth
for their quiet catastrophes', such as hunger, deprivation and lack of
health care.
Deriding Republicans as polo players without their mallets, Mr Cuomo said Mr
Clinton 'was born and raised with all the attributes needed for leadership'.
It was a vintage Cuomo performance, reminiscent of his speech for social
justice at the San Francisco convention eight years ago. Recalling that
address, he told the convention the party had failed to get its message
across then. It could not afford to fail now.
'It is not a matter of our wanting Bill Clinton. It is more than that. We
need Bill Clinton because he is our only hope for change from this nation's
disastrous course,' he said. Mr Clinton could have asked no more from the
man who once professed to dislike him.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Mandela asks UN to look into violence
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) leader, yesterday
urged the United Nations to appoint a special representative to investigate
violence in the black townships of South Africa, which he said had made
impossible further negotiations on the country's constitutional future.
In a speech to the UN Security Council, Mr Mandela blamed the white South
African government for the violence and said the council had an obligation
to 'intervene to end the carnage'. He accused Pretoria of a 'cold-blooded
strategy of state terrorism'.
Mr Mandela was speaking in support of a council resolution put forward by
Organisation of African Unity states calling for the appointment of a
special representative of the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, to investigate the township violence. The aim would be to create
conditions for a resumption of constitutional negotiations.
Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, is expected to support
some form of UN mission when he addresses the council this morning, although
the Pretoria government opposed earlier efforts by the OAU nations to seek
the dispatch of a force of UN monitors to the country.
Mr Mandela said the envoy should investigate the violence and help the UN
decide on measures to help end it. The council's subsequent action, he
added, should include 'continuous monitoring' of the situation.
'The blame lies clearly at the door of the regime,' he added. 'It and nobody
else has the law enforcement presence and legal authority to stop this
violence and act against the perpetrators.'
President F W de Klerk earlier said two battalions with a reputation for
brutality in operations in black townships would be disbanded.
Mr de Klerk's warning about the country's tense political climate was
underlined yesterday. Several shops in the centre of Pietermaritzburg, the
Natal provincial capital, were looted after several hundred ANC supporters
tried to occupy the city hall. Police said 25 people were arrested, but were
freed by a crowd that surrounded the vehicles in which they had been
detained.
South African business and labour leaders are near agreement on a 'charter
for peace and economic reconstruction' which includes a call for elections
for a transitional parliament within six months, Michael Holman and Philip
Gawith write from Johannesburg.
The South African Defence Force said yesterday it was 'investigating the
background' of an SADF member who allegedly took part in a plot to kill Mr
Dirk Coetzee, a former South African policeman living in London.

FT  16 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Big three weigh in for HK container port /
A look at the contenders for Kwai Chung's four-berth dock contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE right to build Hong Kong's ninth container terminal is developing into
one of the biggest commercial issues the Hong Kong government has to face
this year.
This week, the three consortiums presented their proposals to the
government. They expect to attempt to qualify as bidders for a four-berth
dock costing an estimated HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 67.5m) at the colony's Kwai
Chung container port.
The debate centres on the perceived need for more competition in the port to
hold down costs to shippers and the need to ensure that existing operators
remain profitable enough to fund current and future expansion plans.
Underlying these arguments is the bidders' desire to increase control of a
facility that has been growing by 20 per cent a year and does not look like
slowing down.
The potential of the colony's port was underlined by plans announced by the
Wharf group to build a major distribution hub in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
central China.
In 1998 a dual-track railway will be completed, linking Beijing to Shenzhen.
As the east-west transportation links in China are poor, a distribution
centre linked to the railway has the potential to feed manufactures and farm
produce from the heartland of China to the south China coast.
The contest between the prospective bidders includes not only the big
operators of the port - the Hutchison Whampoa subsidiary Hong Kong
International Terminals (HIT) and Modern Terminals Limited (MTL) - but also
the Jardine Matheson group, and Evergreen, the Taiwanese shipping group.
The three consortiums are all strong. HIT and MTL have joined forces and, if
successful, will rationalise their existing ownership of berths which they
claim will lead to efficiencies and higher container throughput.
The Jardine consortium - known as the Tsing Yi Container Terminal Consortium
 -includes Jardine , Sea-Land Orient Terminals - which already operates one
berth at the port - Sun Hung Kai Properties, New World Development,
Sinotrans of China, and Hanjin of South Korea. Jardine group members are
expected to take a 30 per cent share of the consortium.
The third group bidding for the right to operate the new terminal is led by
Evergreen, and goes by the name United Terminal Consortium. It includes
Genstart Container Corp., Guangdong Enterprise Holdings, Henderson Land
Development, and three Japanese trading houses - Marubeni, C. Itoh and
Nissho Iwai.
The current operators of the port, HIT, have been promoting themselves as
the most efficient operator of Hong Kong's port facilities. They have also
let it be known that failure to win Terminal 9 will diminish their interest
in further planned container development - Terminals 10 and beyond on Lantau
Island.
MTL and HIT have also threatened to invest in southern Chinese port
development if they fail to win their bid for Terminal 9. Sea-Land, which
already has container facilities at the southern Taiwanese port of
Kaohsiung, has said its position in Hong Kong would be under question if its
bid fails.
Calls for more competition have come from the Hongkong Liner Shipping
Association and the Hong Kong Shippers Council, which represents exporters.
They believe a greater diversity of ownership of the port will lead to lower
costs of moving cargo across the docks. In the aggressive public relations
campaign, the Jardine consortium is trumpeting the efficiencies of Sea-Land,
its operator.
Sea-Land with just one berth, or 6 per cent of the Kwai Chung port, directly
handles 11.5 per cent of the TEU's (20 ft-equivalent) containers which pass
through it.
Sea-Land also boasts a faster load/unload time than its competitors,
shifting, on average, 22.5 TEUs an hour, compared with an average at the
port of 18. It says that this is an important consideration when ship owners
have to pay between Dollars 25,000 and Dollars 30,000 a day in port.
Moreover, the Jardine group has produced figures showing terminal handling
charges, paid to shippers by importers and exporters, are higher at Kwai
Chung than at any other port in the region.
But more than 60 per cent of Sea-Land's terminal business is conducted with
ships owned by Sea-Land or in a Sea-Land consortium; they too pay a terminal
handling charge in spite of the claimed efficiencies.
HIT/MTL so far have rested on their record of investment in the port. HIT
has spent HKDollars 21bn over the past 20 years and feels this 'commitment'
entitles it to a say in its future.
It denies claims of high charges, pointing out that HIT's charges have risen
3.5 times over the past 15 years, while the capital cost of berth
construction has risen almost 15 times.
HIT also points out that any new operator will face higher costs than an
existing one in constructing Terminal 9 and that these higher costs will
feed through to higher handling charges. Existing operators have the
advantage of being able to spread the cost over existing facilities.
It has also taken up the issue of competition. Efficiency is best served,
HIT contends, not by increasing internal competition but by maintaining
co-operation between operators.

<TEXT>
ONTARIO, which contributes 40 per cent of Canada's economic output, has
joined calls on Mr Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister, to pull out of
talks on a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Mr Bob Rae, Ontario's social democrat premier, urged Ottawa to suspend its
participation, in protest against 'virtually unending trade harassment' by
the US. British Columbia, which also has a left-of-centre government,
recently made a similar call.
But the Mulroney government has given no indication of bowing to growing
pressure to withdraw from the Nafta talks with the US and Mexico. Mr Michael
Wilson, international trade minister, is expected to join his US and Mexican
counterparts on July 25 for the 'final push' towards a Nafta pact. However,
a US trade official said last night the talks could last until September
before all disputed areas were resolved.
A Canadian official said yesterday that Ottawa's commitment to Nafta
remained 'rock-solid'. He acknowledged that selling the accord to a
sceptical public would be tough in the run-up to a general election next
year, but said: 'The bottom line is that we have no choice but to be there.'
Opinion polls show most Canadians oppose Nafta and the existing free trade
agreement with the US. They blame the latter for job losses and fear that
Nafta will bring an exodus of jobs to Mexico.

FT  16 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Gatt rules against US in cement dumping
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GATT dispute panel has recommended the US return millions of dollars in
anti-dumping duties that it wrongly imposed upon Mexican cement producers.
The still-unannounced ruling - under the anti-dumping code of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) - comes as the US and Mexico, along
with Canada, are in the final stages of negotiating a free trade agreement.
The cement case will be closely watched in Mexico and Canada for evidence
that the US is prepared to abide by international rulings.
The decision by the Gatt panel - if accepted by the US - would mean a big
victory for the Mexican cement companies, principally Cementos Mexicanos
(Cemex), the largest Mexican cement exporter. The anti-dumping decision
helped reduce Cemex's exports to 1.4m tonnes last year from 2.26m tonnes in
1990. Cemex redirected many of its exports to Asia at low margins.
The panel finding did not address the question of whether or not Mexican
companies had 'dumped' or sold at 'less than fair value' cement and cement
clinker, but it ruled that not enough US companies had come forward to
support the complaint.
It was brought in the US as a regional injury case, supported by 61.7 per
cent of the producers in parts of an 11-state region. The panel found that
'US authorities did not satisfy themselves prior to initiation that the
petition was on behalf of producers of all or almost all of the production
in the regional market.'
Cemex had been, in 1989, the largest exporter of cement to the US,
accounting for 28 per cent of the total. Under the terms of the anti-dumping
suit, Mexican companies had to pay 58 per cent duties on their exports to
the US.
Cemex was operating at 81 per cent of capacity at the end of 1991, mainly in
meeting demand at home, so it may have only small scope to expand exports.
In the longer run, though, the decision should benefit Cemex, which plans to
spend Dollars 1bn to increase output by 35 per cent in three years.

THE US yesterday issued its sternest warning in months to Iraq, accusing it
of jeopardising the Gulf war ceasefire by refusing to allow United Nations
weapons inspectors to enter a Baghdad ministry building in search of
documents, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent.
Washington's tough statement, which implies that continued Iraqi resistance
to the UN might prompt a military response, came as Iraq itself sharpened
its recent defiance of the UN by demanding the annulment of all resolutions
adopted since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
In Washington, Mr Richard Boucher, a state department spokesman, said Iraq's
refusal to allow a team of UN inspectors access to an agriculture ministry
building 'is putting at risk the ceasefire that concluded Operation Desert
Storm'.
Iraqi officials have denied the UN inspectors access to the building since
July 5 and have couched the refusal in increasingly hostile terms.

FT  16 JUL 92 / French row over 'rule by judges' re-opens: The latest clash
between politicians and the judicial investigation system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEWSPAPER report that the Socialist president of the national assembly -
constitutionally the third most important man in France - might be charged
with political corruption has provoked the latest clash between France's
politicians and its judicial investigation system.
The case has aroused alarm among all political parties, including the
opposition, who fear that parts of the French magistracy may be running a
political campaign.
The magistrate in charge of an inquiry into Socialist party finances, Mr
Renaud Van Ruymbeke, refused to confirm or deny the report about assembly
president Mr Henri Emmanuelli before taking a month's holiday to leave all
involved to stew in impotent fury.
President Francois Mitterrand has leapt to the defence of Mr Emmanuelli, a
former Socialist party treasurer, and urged fast adoption of plans to reform
criminal justice, to improve the rights of defendants and reduce the
considerable powers of juges d'instruction, or examining magistrates.
France cannot be allowed to 'fall under a government of judges', warns Mr
Michel Vauzelle, justice minister. Magistrates' unions have replied that
justice must be done, whoever stands to be charged.
The row is being seen as the latest blow to the Socialists' reputation,
after the truckers' strike and a court case over Aids-contaminated blood in
the public transfusion service. It centres on a politically charged inquiry
into alleged payments by construction companies into Socialist party coffers
some time during Mr Emmanuelli's period as treasurer from July 1988 to
January 1992.
The case attracted national attention in January when Mr Van Ruymbeke led a
raid on Mr Emmanuelli's former office at party headquarters in search of
documents relating to a link between the party and Urba, a construction
company in Le Mans. He arrived, embarrassingly, on the same day as Mr
Laurent Fabius moved in as the party's new first secretary, a coincidence
which guaranteed television coverage for Mr Van Ruymbeke and fuelled
suspicions that he might be politically motivated.
Mr Van Ruymbeke knows very well that the Urba case is a thorn in the
Socialists' side. He took over the inquiry into possible payments by Urba to
Socialist officials in western France after another examining magistrate, Mr
Thierry Jean-Pierre, was asked by a tribunal in Le Mans to drop the case
last year.
The political opposition was enraged at the time by what it saw as
government interference in a case that could harm the Socialists and
demanded the resignation of the then justice minister.
The judiciary, for its part, has felt that it has been the victim of
political interference for years. Magistrates were deeply angered three
years ago - to the extent of going on strike - when the government gave
amnesty to many of the people responsible for the once widespread practice
of resorting to corruption to raise cash for political parties.
The amnesty was designed to allow all involved to turn over a new leaf
before the introduction of tough new rules on party financing. It did not
cover those who enriched themselves rather than their parties, as a result
of which more than two dozen businessmen are on trial over allegations
relating to the 1988 presidential campaign.
Since the amnesty, the government has on the whole pursued its
anti-corruption drive with determination, though it is not clear how deeply
it was involved with the removal of Mr Jean-Pierre from the Urba inquiry. Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, is planning to table new laws against
political corruption in the autumn. At the same time, he is pushing on with
the penal code reforms, to clip the investigating magistrates' wings.
The wide powers of Mr Van Ruymbeke and his colleagues are an outstanding
feature of the French criminal justice system. They make inquiries or can
order the police to do so, question witnesses, decide alone whether to bring
charges and whether the defendant should be held in custody. Often young and
on moderate salaries, they take pride in staging elaborate investigations
and claim to be ready to root out the truth at any cost.
Mr Van Ruymbeke has even more power himself, because he is an adviser to the
prosecuting court and as such does not have to account to the public
prosecutor. This quietly spoken, 39-year-old, Rennes-based lawyer, who
denies any political motivation, has taken on big targets throughout his
professional life. One of his earliest cases was against a former Gaullist
labour minister in the early 1970s, who committed suicide after Mr Van
Ruymbeke examined his bank account in connection with an alleged bribe. (A
subsequent inquiry cleared Mr Van Ruymbeke of any impropriety.)
The advantage of giving magistrates such wide powers is that they are in
theory just as interested in proving innocence as guilt, unlike the police,
who are understandably more prosecution-minded. The main control on French
examining magistrates' powers is that their cases must be scrutinised by a
higher court before going to trial. As a result, French higher courts have a
greater conviction rate than in the UK, for instance.
However, the government believes that the controls on examining magistrates
are inadequate in two senses. There is the often unfair damage a juge
d'instruction can inflict on a person's reputation. It also believes that
there are too many people held in French prisons awaiting trial or judgment
 -nearly 41 per cent of the total.
So the penal code reform, to be voted in parliament next autumn, would be to
abandon the crude principle of charging defendants. Instead, there would be
a two-step procedure: an examination followed by a summons. Defendants would
have access to the magistrates' documents from the start. Examining
magistrates would no longer be allowed to place their own defendants in
custody. That decision would instead be made by a panel of three magistrates
not involved in the case.
In the meantime, Mr Van Ruymbeke and his colleagues can be expected to make
the fullest possible use of their existing powers, however much this might
irritate the government.

Liberal Russian media chiefs accused the parliamentary leadership yesterday
of trying to impose extensive controls that could pave the way for another
hardline coup, Reuter reports from Moscow.
In an appeal to President Boris Yeltsin, they criticised two resolutions
drafted by parliament's presidium, arguing that these would re-introduce
television censorship and impose direct control over a leading liberal
newspaper.

The European Community's executive agency yesterday cleared a fresh infusion
of capital into the French airline Air France, AP reports from Brussels.
The European Commission said it approved a FFr1.25bn (Pounds 128bn)
injection by Banque Nationale de Paris for an 8.8 per cent stake in the
state-owned carrier. A second one of FFr2.59bn by an international banking
consortium was also authorised.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Paris sees inflation fall to annual 3%

FRANCE'S monthly inflation rate eased to 0.1 per cent in June, down from 0.3
per cent in the previous month, according to provisional figures from the
Insee state statistics body yesterday, William Dawkins writes from Paris.
The result, better than most forecasters were expecting, brings the annual
rate to 3 per cent, a fraction below the rate at which inflation had
stabilised since March.
The improvement is believed to be due to lower energy prices and a
consistently low price rise for goods. Inflation in the services sector, by
contrast, is rising slightly above the headline figure. This leaves French
inflation at 1.3 percentage points below the rate in western Germany.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Norway warned on whaling

NORWAY might find it hard to join the EC unless it drops its plan to resume
commercial whaling, a Community Commissioner warned yesterday.
With the express intention of putting pressure on Norway, expected to apply
for EC membership in November, the European Commission yesterday formally
proposed the Community should become a member, in its own right, of the
International Whaling Commission.
Last month, Norway announced it would resume commercial whaling next spring,
pre-empting an IWC verdict on whether this would be allowed. Announcing the
proposal to seek a Community seat in the IWC, Mr Manuel Marin, EC fisheries
commissioner, said such a move would make IWC rules and recommendations part
of EC law. 'Any country wishing to join the Community would have to go along
with that,' he said.
