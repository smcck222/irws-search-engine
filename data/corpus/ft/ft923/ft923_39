FT  08 JUL 92 / France dashes Gatt hopes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major's hopes of a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks at this week's Munich summit foundered yesterday on
opposition from France.
Although G7 officials said differences had narrowed in the contentious area
of farm support, France's President Francois Mitterrand refused to sanction
progress, apparently for fear of losing support in September's referendum on
the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Major admitted that there was 'no chance of an
agreement being reached' in Munich. Report, Page 2

FT  08 JUL 92 / Saudi bank floods market with 600 tonnes of silver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Commercial Bank of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia's sole private bank and
one with close ties to the royal family, sold at least 20m troy ounces - or
622 tonnes - of silver, worth about Dollars 80m (Pounds 42m), in only two
hours yesterday.
Traders linked the huge sale with yesterday's announcement of the
resignation of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the Saudi bank's deputy general
manager and chief operating officer, who was indicted in the US last week on
charges related to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The metal sold was equivalent to about 5 per cent of annual worldwide demand
for silver.
At one stage, the silver price in London was driven down from Dollars 4.06
an ounce to Dollars 3.82, its lowest level so far this year. The turmoil in
Europe was reflected in futures trading on the New York Commodity Exchange,
where the most active September silver contract was down 21.8 cents an ounce
at one point at Dollars 3.835. Prices recovered slightly later and silver
closed in London at Dollars 3.87 an ounce.
Sheikh Khalid and a London-based associate were charged by a US grand jury
less than a week ago with scheming to defraud depositors, regulators and
auditors of BCCI. Sheikh Khalid has described the charges as 'completely
unwarranted and without justification'.
Announcing yesterday that Sheikh Khalid's resignation had 'reluctantly' been
accepted, Sheikh Mohammed bin Mahfouz, chairman of the NCB, said: 'We are
fully confident of Sheikh Khalid's innocence. God willing, he will be
vindicated.'
Analysts suggested the market would take some time to digest the metal. Mr
Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, recalled that the same
bank had hit the gold market in a similar way with large sales in March
1990, when it sold about 100 tonnes of gold, equivalent to about 5 per cent
of world supply, and drove the price down by Dollars 20 an ounce to Dollars
368 in a few hours.
'It took the gold market several months to settle down after that,' Mr Smith
said.
Silver is used mainly by the photographic and electronics industries and
demand fell slightly last year to 541m ounces.
Production has fallen far behind demand as mines have closed because of
depressed prices. But there are probably 1bn ounces of metal held by
investors who were encouraged to buy in 1987 when the price rose above
Dollars 7 an ounce.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Thames group bids Pounds 1,000 for TV channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ARMY of 2,000 TV service engineers may be created to visit all the homes
in London to retune video recorders and so clear the way for the launch of
Britain's fifth national television channel, which last night attracted only
one bid - of Pounds 1,000.
The strategy of the consortium making the bid involves launching CityTV
stations in various parts of the UK, starting in London next July and
followed by Manchester in 1994. The retuning operation, necessary because of
interference, would cost Pounds 75m if extended across the country.
Birmingham CityTV could follow in the year 2000 with Glasgow or Edinburgh in
2001. Up to 49 per cent of the companies would be offered to local
investors.
The plan was unveiled yesterday as the consortium, led by Thames Television,
submitted the only bid for the Channel 5 licence to the Independent
Television Commission.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television and chairman of the
consortium Channel Five Holdings, said that up to 50 per cent of video
recorders could suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal and would have
to be retuned. Rather than wait for complaints, teams contracted by Thorn
EMI and Granada Rentals would visit homes and carry out 85 per cent of the
retuning before the launch.
Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of the innovative Citytv station in Toronto and
consultant executive producer to the consortium, said yesterday: 'We
believe, crack the retuning problem and it's the key to the door.'
The 'door' is access to about 74 per cent of the UK population although many
will need a new aerial to receive the channel. The company plans to
distribute vouchers for free aerials but each installation will cost about
Pounds 25.
The programme schedule, like Citytv in Toronto, will concentrate on news,
films and music. Thames plans to take no more than 15 per cent of the
holding company and the consortium has no other significant financial
backing at the moment.
The task is first to convince the ITC that the video recorder problem can be
solved and then that the project can be financed.
The peak cash requirement, including a contingency fund, would be Pounds
150m by 1995, Mr Dunn said, implying that the channel would start to make
profit at the operational level in its fourth year.
The ITC is unlikely to announce for some months whether the bid has
succeeded.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Anglian Group's share offer shunned by nervous investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN GROUP, the double glazing company, yesterday became the latest
victim of apprehension among investors when the public took up only 6 per
cent of shares on offer to them.
When the offer closed yesterday morning, private investors had subscribed
for only 1.3m of the 21m shares on public offer in the flotation, which
values Anglian at Pounds 183.5m.
The balance of these shares was left with underwriters and institutions who
last week had subscribed to the other 21m shares in a placement at 210p.
The failure of Anglian's retail share sale puts additional pressure on other
companies that joined the race for a stock market quotation soon after the
Tories won the election in April.
Last week investors shunned shares in The Telegraph Group, leaving more than
three-quarters of the public offer with underwriters. When the shares begin
trading this morning, they are expected to trade at a discount to the 325p
offer price.
Next in the firing line will be MFI Furniture Group, the retailer, whose
offer closes on Friday after the offer price was sharply discounted to 115p
last week. Shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical company, went on sale this
week in the largest non-privatisation offer seen in the London market. The
offer closes on July 24.
Mr Bill Hancock, Anglian's chief executive, said he was disappointed but not
surprised by yesterday's low public interest.
'I suppose it is the expected result in a very poor market,' he said. 'The
company has not changed; the market has. We have achieved what we set out to
do - we have repaid our borrowings and we have a listing.'
Taunton Cider, the drinks group, yesterday set the price for its flotation.
The public is being offered 29.1m shares at 140p, in an offer valuing
Taunton at Pounds 153m. The same number of shares was successfully placed
with institutions that also took part in the underwriting.
At that price, Taunton is valued at a pro forma price earnings multiple of
15.1, a slight discount to Bulmer Holdings, the other quoted UK cider
company. It will carry a notional dividend yield of 4.5 per cent and pro
forma earnings per share of 9.3p for the year to March 1992.

FT  08 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices rally on bargain-hunting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOUDS lifted a little in the UK equity market yesterday when several
institutions began cautiously foraging for bargains among the lengthening
list of share price casualties. Strategists discounted comments from Mr
Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, that the Bundesbank was expected to
cut interest rates 'soon'. The recovery of nearly 25 points on the FT-SE
Index yesterday appeared to reflect factors closer to the heart of the
London stock market.
Buying support was very modest, and the day's Seaq-recorded trading total
reached only 381.8m shares, an improvement on Monday's 274.8m but still a
poor level by more normal standards. Turnover was boosted by substantial
activity in the electricity stocks after the expected pricing review turned
out significantly more favourably for the distribution companies than the
market had expected.
After opening firmly, the Footsie drifted down to the 2,467 area in early
trading. Some fund managers, who had taken the view that 2,450 was a buying
level, decided not to wait any longer in case they were overtaken by traders
seeking to cut bear positions ahead of the end of the trading account on
Friday.
Share prices steadied and the equity market was then given further
encouragement when pressures slackened in the stock index futures sector.
Equities turned briskly higher and, helped by a steady opening to the new
session in New York, where the Dow Average added 6.76 in London hours, the
FT-SE Index closed very nearly at the day's best. At its final calculation,
the Footsie was 24.7 up at 2,493.7, raising the hope that the 2,500 mark
might be challenged again soon.
The market was helped by a good rally in British Aerospace from an initial
loss, and by small gains in many of the blue chip issues which have suffered
in recent sessions. Improvements in ICI, BP and Shell were of modest
proportions indeed, but continued weakness in the US dollar failed to
restrain these large overseas-earning shares.
However, hopes that the UK stock market might at last be seeking to
establish a base level were overshadowed by concern over the outlook for
Wall Street.
With last week's cut in discount rate by the Federal Reserve apparently
finding little response on Wall Street, London still considers US equities
overvalued and fears further weakness in New York.
Also overhanging the UK market is the increasingly serious problem of low
turnover in equities. Retail, or customer, business in equities was worth
only Pounds 581.4m on Monday, barely half the level regarded as profitable
for the UK securities industry. Stock Exchange statistics show that daily
retail volume has remained well short of Pounds 1bn for the past six trading
sessions, an unhappy start to the traditionally sluggish summer season.
London securities firms have continued to trim back their office and dealing
staffs, and confidence was not helped by reports that a UK clearing bank had
announced redundancies among its London staff.

FT  08 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures bounced from Monday's falls after a large seller of the
Footsie contract, who had been active over the last three sessions,
completed his operations, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,509
making a fairly firm opening. But the positive mood soon turned sour as a
few independent traders and a large institution went on the selling tack,
sending the contract into retreat. By 10.30am September had fallen to 2,487.
With the large sell order completed, the September contract recovered and
moved into more positive territory, helping lift the underlying cash market
higher.
Sentiment was also boosted by comments by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury
Secretary, about a possible cut in German interest rates.
September continued to move forward in a quiet afternoon session, closing at
2,520, up 30 on the previous session and about 2 points ahead of its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover reached 8.696
contracts.
The day in the traded options market was dull, with turnover a meagre 21,895
contracts by the close. Some 8,624 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.
British Aerospace was the most actively traded stock option at 1,454 lots.

FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lower dollar weighs on most
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER plunge in the dollar, taking it down through DM1.50 in London, was
blamed for falls on most bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was disappointed that prices had failed to react to Monday night's
compromise in Bonn on a 30 per cent withholding tax on interest income. But
it took some comfort from the US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady, who
inferred at the Munich G7 summit that the Bundesbank might cut interest
rates soon.
The DAX lost 4.85 to 1,767.51 after an early loss of 10 points, and a fall
of 3.10 to 697.36 in the FAZ at midsession. Dealers said that the rebound
might have been technical, as futures market traders were seen buying the 30
DAX shares to narrow the gap between the cash index and the DAX futures
contract.
Siemens shed DM6 to DM667 after saying on Monday that it saw little room for
a higher dividend on 1991-92 results. Chemicals also came under pressure
from expectations of poor second-quarter results, Bayer leading the way down
with a fall of DM2.60 to DM279.90.
Schering overcame the trend to close with a gain of DM9.40 at DM732.40 on
talk that it was about to announce it had found buyers for its chemicals
businesses.
ZURICH liked the Brady comments but not the higher dollar, and the SMI index
closed 6.0 down at 1,856.6 after an earlier low of 1,850.3.
Nestle bearers fell SFr100 to SFr9,460, dealers saying that there had been
several major sell orders. Brown Boveri, also export-sensitive, lost SFr40
to SFr4,250 francs.
PARIS was given a late lift by the bond market but turnover remained thin,
with only FFr1.8bn worth of business. The CAC-40 index finished 10.57 higher
at 1,879.09 in quiet trading.
Alcatel Alsthom remained active, adding FFr13 to FFr654, while the lower
dollar and fading hopes of an early economic recovery in the US prompted
profit-taking in Rhone-Poulenc which dropped FFr24 or 4 per cent to FFr559.
Havas ended 60 centimes lower at FFr495.90 with 215,000 shares traded, as
two blocks were traded ahead of the July 15 expiry of a warrant issue.
AMSTERDAM was knocked lower by some disappointing company reports and the
weaker dollar. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.5 to 121.7.
The office supplies group, Oce van der Grinten, shed Fl 4.80 or 7 per cent
to Fl 64.70 after releasing poor second-quarter results. The food producer
Nutricia fell Fl 7.90 to Fl 145.50 after its chairman said that recent
profit growth would be hard to maintain.
MILAN got dangerously close to the support level of 420 on the Comit index
as it fell 7.15 to 434.20 in turnover estimated at slightly more than
Monday's low L72.1bn.
Dealers said thatthere were rumours of financial problems at various Sims,
due to losses incurred in the bond market which has fallen heavily on
currency devaluation fears.
The recent rise in interest rates and the government's plans to freeze
public tariffs weighed in particular on the telecommunications sector. Stet
fell L26 to L1,629 and was down to L1,580 in the after-market. Sip lost
L43.5 to L1,187.
OSLO ended mixed in thin trading, with Aker A shares gaining NKr2.5 to NKr54
on news the company had sold its stake in Spanish cement company,
Valenciana. The all-share index ended 0.61 firmer at 397.71 in low turnover
of NKr182m.
MADRID suspended Valenciana ahead of a takeover bid by Cemex of Mexico,
reportedly at Pta15,000 a share. Valenciana closed off Pta350 at Pta14,500
on Monday. The general index fell 0.45 to 236.29.
STOCKHOLM cited the weak dollar as the Affarsvarlden General index fell
another 9.7 to a new 1992 low of 894.4.
Trelleborg, the metals group, saw its B shares fell SKr4 lower at SKr106
while A shares in Asea, one of this year's top performers in Europe, fell
SKr9 to SKr383 for an accumulated SKr14 loss this week.
TEL AVIV closed sharply higher in active trading on strong buying by mutual
funds, the blue chip index rising 3.13, or 2.1 per cent to 153.09 in
turnover of Shk137.5m.

FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Corruption allegations harm Brazilian
equities - The political uncertainty has led to volatility and a drop in
trading volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp fluctuations, with diminishing volumes, have characterised the
precipitate downward career of Brazil's equity market during last two
months.
During a lull in the country's wounding political crisis, the index of the
Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) recovered by 5.3 per cent on Monday,
following a 6.2 per cent drop on Friday. By noon yesterday it gained a
further 4.7 per cent to 22,387. However, it had fallen by 46.7 per cent in
dollar terms between April 22 and June 30, sustaining its worst one-day fall
of the year on Monday, June 29 with a drop in dollar terms of 15.6 per cent.
Volume, meanwhile, was Dollars 33.9m on Monday, down from an already record
low for the year of Dollars 43.4m on Friday. Trading for the first days of
July was 43 per cent lower than the same period in June, when volume had
dropped by 19.3 per cent from May. Daily trading of Dollars 100m,
commonplace just a few months ago, is becoming a distant memory.
Since the last week of May, the malaise in the market has reflected
allegations of corruption involving President Fernando Collor de Mello,
either in the press or in the parliamentary inquiry into charges of
influence peddling and other wrongdoing by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a
businessman who was treasurer of Mr Collor's campaign.
Analysts are beginning to say that the ability of new revelations to shock
the market may be wearing thin. The rise in the index on Monday came in
spite of a new series of allegations in the press on Sunday. 'The effect of
the headlines may be diminishing,' says Mr Julius Buchenrode, director for
investments of the local subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank.
However, investors who saw the market rise by 152 per cent in dollar terms
in 1991, after a punishing crash in 1990 when the Bovespa fell 71 per cent
in dollar terms, seem to be voting with their feet.
They may be waiting for a definition in the political scenario. The
parliamentary commission is continuing its investigation, and some members
of Congress are calling for Mr Collor's resignation. The president says that
he will stand firm, which could lead to a debate on impeachment.
There is also uncertainty about the depth of the president's parliamentary
support and the future of the economy minister, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira,
if Mr Collor were to step down. Mr Moreira has become a symbol of stability
to the business community.
'I'd say that everything is being contaminated (by the political situation),
and you should not draw conclusions on any investment,' says Mr Ken Baxter,
general manager for foreign funds of the Bozano Simonsen bank.
With growing uncertainty, trading is becoming even more concentrated than
before, even by the normal standards of the traditionally narrow bourse. On
Monday, Telebras, the public telecommunications company which makes up
one-third of the Bovespa index, accounted for 64 per cent of volume; 90 per
cent of trading was restricted to blue chip shares. Telebras rose by 10 per
cent, and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining group, by
4.7 per cent.
This concentration is reversing a trend evident before the political crisis:
a move toward second-line equities, shares traditionally short on liquidity
but in companies that are often industry leaders in Brazil. Traders disagree
whether the current retrenchment is a response to current low prices for
blue chips or if it reflects a search for greater security during the
political upheaval.
The ability of foreign investors to adjust to uncertainty in the Brazilian
equities market was improved by the National Monetary Council's announcement
last week that foreign investors will be eligible to operate in the options
and futures markets. Previously, the only hedge available to foreign
institutions, allowed to invest directly in Brazil since last year, was the
foreign exchange market.

FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weak construction sector
pulls Nikkei down

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS of bankruptcy at a construction company listed on the
over-the-counter market depressed sentiment, construction and real
estate-related issues fell, and the Nikkei average declined for the third
consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 197.52 to 16,459.55. Small-lot arbitrage buying pushed it up
to a day's high of 16,709.86 in the morning, but jitters over the
construction company then spread throughout the market, and the index fell
to the day's low of 16,420.81 on mid-afternoon selling.
Volume remained low at 170m shares, rising marginally from 161m. Investment
trusts, which had supported the market last week, were absent. Declines led
advances by 706 to 211 with 173 unchanged, the Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 16.39 to 1,271.15 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 2.87 to 995.57.
Concerns about financial problems at Royal Construction shook investors, as
the Japan Securities Dealers Association suspended afternoon trading in the
shares on the OTC market. After the market closed, Royal announced that it
would seek court protection.
Investors were also worried over reports that Shuwa, the land and stock
speculator and leading shareholder of Isetan, the department store, had used
Isetan shares as collateral for loans.
Property-related issues and construction stocks plunged. Daikyo, the
condominium builder, which had previously retreated on rumours of financial
problems, fell Y47 to Y733, and Misawa Homes, which was recently sold on
similar concerns, declined Y48 to Y951.
Leading construction companies fell, with Obayashi down Y10 to Y542, Taisei
losing Y24 to Y660 and Shimizu Y30 to Y911.
Isetan plunged Y190 to Y1,540. Other retailers were also weak, with
Seven-Eleven Japan plunging Y340 to Y6,900 and Ito-Yokado losing Y190 to
Y3,920.
Penta-Ocean Construction, which surged on Monday on reports that the company
had won an order to expand a section of the Suez Canal, lost Y55 to Y828 on
profit-taking.
Matsushita Electric Works fell Y30 to Y1,040. The company forecast a 30 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the current year to November this year, the
first fall in six years.
Mitsubishi Materials advanced Y6 to Y416 on reports that the company was
likely to win an order to supply pipes and tanks for a nuclear facility in
northern Tokyo.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 258.40 to 19,309.01 in volume of 7m shares.
Roundup
DECLINES led advances in the region yesterday, although Bombay stayed in
suspension and Manila was closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG finished sharply lower, reflecting political worries after three
days of high level talks in Beijing on Hong Kong's massive airport project
ended on Monday with no agreement on funding.
The Hang Seng index fell 112.85 or 1.9 per cent to 5,911.92 after an
intraday low of 5,857.47. Among blue chips, HSBC was the most active stock
as it lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 49, followed by Sun Hung Kai Properties,
down HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 32.75. Turnover dropped from HKDollars 6.1bn
to HKDollars 3.6bn.
SEOUL closed at a 53-month low for the second consecutive day, and while the
composite index only fell 0.38 to 535.34, a land scandal involving former
military officers continued to dampen depressed sentiment.
Police were tracking promissory notes issued by First Life Insurance,
believed to be trading in the black market at a discount.
TAIWAN fell as hopes for an early interest rate cut faded, the weighted
index ending 79.75, or 1.8 per cent lower at 4,432.22, turnover staying
active at TDollars 25.7bn against Monday's TDollars 28.7bn.
AUSTRALIA closed slightly lower in dull trading as investors waited for a
cut in interest rates. The All-Ordinaries index lost 3.2 to 1,660.5 in
modest turnover of ADollars 200.6m.
Banks were lifted by the rate cut hopes, with Bank of Melbourne and Bank of
Queensland gaining 4 cents to ADollars 4.33 and ADollars 5.00 respectively.
NEW ZEALAND closed at its best level in almost four weeks, as investors took
heart from the prospect of lower interest rates.
The NZSE-40 index rose 17.18 to 1,559.07 but turnover was a modest NZDollars
21.76m. Among active second-liners, PDL rose 25 cents to NZDollars 6.85
while Michael Hill rose 17 cents to NZDollars 2.00 and Transmark rose 20
cents to NZDollars 3.00 after publishing its annual report.
KUALA LUMPUR was pushed higher by afternoon buying of second- and
third-liners by retail investors. The composite index rose 0.95 to 596.70 in
volume of 56.5m shares. Sungei Besi led the actives with 4.6m shares traded,
rising 10 cents to MDollars 4.52. South Malaysia Industries closed up 24
cents at MDollars 3.18 on talk that the privatised Sabah Shipyard would be
injected into SMI.
KARACHI fell further as textile mills threatened to cut production. The
100-share index fell 19.71 to 1,460.60. DHAKA receded further in dull
trading, the all-share index ending 8.18 lower at 374.22.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips to 17-month low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dipped to a 17-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign
exchanges yesterday due to technical trading and continuing bearish
sentiment over the US economy, writes James Blitz.
With few economic indicators due out of the US this week, the currency
continues to be overshadowed by last week's cut in interest rates and a
feeling that the economy is into a triple-dip recession. That poor sentiment
was compounded yesterday by the lack of any supportive comment from the
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich. Indeed,
Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary, said that the final
communique, due out today, will contain no 'detailed language' on foreign
exchange rates. 'There's nothing coming out of G7. That's why the dollar's
been coming down for these last 48 hours,' said one trader at a leading US
bank in London.
The dollar closed yesterday at DM1.4980 from a previous close of DM1.5130.
In late American trading, it was at a new low of DM1.4956.
The question now is whether the dollar will sink to its all-time low against
the German currency of DM1.4430 set on February 11, 1991. Mr Mark Austin,
chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London sees the
dollar at the centre of a battle between two groups. 'On one side they are
saying that the dollar is cheap and now is the time to buy. On the other
side, the feeling is that the US economy is not recovering, that political
uncertainty is increasing and that the thing to do is sell.'
The lack of comment at the G7 meeting also had a negative effect on the
Japanese yen. Investors had assumed that the G7 would openly support the yen
to reduce the huge trade deficit that Japan has with the US. In the absence
of this, the yen lost ground to the D-Mark yesterday, closing at Y83.02 from
Y82.25. However analysts remain bullish about the yen, expecting the
Japanese authorities to introduce a mixture of a fiscal boost and an
interest rate cut.
Sterling was again the principal loser in the European Monetary System. With
no indicators issued in the UK, it was again dragged down by the dollar's
weakness and finished at DM2.8850 from a previous close of DM2.8900.
The currency is firmly at the bottom of the EMS grid and some dealers fear
that it may soon reach its permitted lower limit against the Portuguese
escudo, the strongest currency in the system. Although the Portuguese
authorities hinted strongly at an interest rate cut on Monday, there is a
5.97 percentage point divergence between the two currencies, compared to the
permitted divergence of 6.18.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rates firm again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling cash markets continued to firm yesterday as the Bank
of England forecast another large shortage which dealers found difficult to
remove.
The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn in the morning, which was
later revised upwards to Pounds 1.6bn. But dealers were slow to offer bills
to the Bank throughout the day and the authorities had to provide late
assistance of around Pounds 510m.
Dealers explained the stickiness of the market by lingering hopes that the
authorities might signal a cut in base rates. On Friday, the Bank shaved the
rates at which it deals in longer dated bills. But the expectation that this
would be the precursor to a rate cut was dashed again yesterday. The Bank
failed to deal in longer dated bands, purchasing bills in Bands 1 and 2 at
the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent and repurchase agreements (repos) at
9 15/16 per cent.
Dealers said that the Bank's reduction in the supply of Treasury Bills had
also caused difficulties. 'The Bank has been issuing more gilts recently,'
said one trader, 'and as a result they do not need to cover their funding by
issuing more Treasury bills.' This gives dealers a smaller range of monetary
instruments with which to operate.
Cash rates ended firmer on the day, with the overnight rate rising to a peak
of 11 per cent. 1-month money again closed at 10 1/16 per cent, but 3-month
money, a key indicator of the market's view on rates, finished at 10 1/32
per cent from a previous close of 9 15/16 per cent. One-year money ended up,
at 9 7/8 per cent, from a previous close of 9 13/16 per cent.
The firming of longer-dated rates was also due to sterling's poor
performance on the foreign exchanges, as the pound dropped  1/2 a pfennig to
DM2.8850. Sterling futures responded in bearish fashion to the currency's
decline. The September contract finished at 90.19 from a previous close of
90.25, and the December contract finished at 90.46 from a previous close of
90.50.
In its morning operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 150m, and later Pounds
591m, in a 'repo' for resale on 27, 28 and 29 July. In the afternoon, the
Bank purchased Pounds 166m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 79m of Band 2
bank bills.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: El Nino drought 'appears to be
over'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DROUGHT that has ravaged crops and cost hundreds of millions of dollars
in countries across Asia and the South Pacific appears to be over,
meteorologists say, reports Reuter from Sydney.
Its cause, the climatic phenomenon known as El Nino, is dissipating with
some areas returning to normal weather conditions more quickly than others,
they said.
Australia is among the first of the major agricultural producers to emerge
from drought in most areas, while in India a return to normal rainfall is
expected in the late monsoon.
China's northern provinces are still in the grip of drought, however, though
it is unlikely to have much impact on the country's international trading
position.
'We're now in the declining phase of El Nino, it's global and it has had an
effect since early last year all round the planet, particularly in the
tropical regions,' an official at Australia's National Climate Centre said.
Ocean waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which had warmed
under El Nino were continuing to cool quite rapidly, the climate centre
reported.
Australia, whose farm sector was ravaged by drought and economic recession,
has already felt the effect of the changing conditions. 'Australia tends to
climb out of it earlier than others,' the official said.
Drought conditions still persist in some areas of New South Wales and
southern Queensland but local output of grain and sugar is forecast to
recover significantly after last year's drought across eastern Australia.
The total value of wheat, coarse grains and sugar is forecast to rise by
nearly 30 per cent to ADollars 3.14bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the year to the end
of June, 1993, compared with the previous drought-hit year.
In India however, the change is taking longer to come through. 'It is
expected to come back to average in the late monsoon season,' Australia's
climate centre official said. Erratic rains in India last year caused food
grain output to fall to about 171m tonnes in the year to June 30, 1992 from
the previous year's record 176m tonnes.

'non-subsidisers'
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA AND Australia, two countries that consider themselves
'non-subsidisers' in the world wheat market, both provide indirect subsidies
through their wheat boards and government farm programmes, according to a
new report issued by the US General Accounting Office.
The GAO said the governments of both countries have on occasion reimbursed
their wheat boards for annual losses. In 1985, when the US introduced an
export subsidy scheme to counter similar European Community subsidies, the
Canadian government reimbursed its board for a Dollars 19m loss. In 1986-87,
the government paid Dollars 140m to compensate for the board's shortfall in
the 1986-87 season when wheat export prices plummeted. The marketing boards,
said the GAO, offered different prices to different customers and seek to
capture new markets by selling grain at lower-than-posted prices.
Canada supports farmers with freight subsidies, crop insurance and
guaranteed minimum prices. Australia has a rural family farm adjustment
scheme and farm input subsidies. Both have export credit guarantee
programmes, enabling them to take on riskier markets.
According to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, in 1990 Australian government assistance provided wheat farmers
with 11 per cent of their income. US and EC wheat farmers received 44 and 46
per cent of their income from government programmes. Canadian wheat
producers received from 43 per cent.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa agreement talks focus on
withholding plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME to withhold cocoa from the oversupplied world market is expected to
dominate this week's meeting of producers and consumers.
Delegates gathered here for a second round of talks on a new accord to
replace the present International Cocoa Agreement, which expires in
September 1993, say the three-week meeting, held under the auspices of the
UN Conference on Trade and Development, will focus on the scope, finance and
operation of the export withholding scheme proposed by consuming countries
to stabilise prices.
Although the producers have not formally withdrawn their preferred export
quota plan, it is regarded as having effectively been abandoned at the first
round of talks in April.
Producing countries, hit hard by the slump in cocoa prices, overproduction
and excess stocks, are anxious to conclude a new agreement before the
current cocoa year ends in September. But delegates believe another session
of talks is likely to be needed. These have already been pencilled in for
next November.
Mr Kouame N'Guessan of the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer,
speaking for all producers at Monday's opening session, said they had come
to the meeting 'ready for compromise'. However, Mr Zago Jacob Goffa, the
Ivory Coast delegate, said any new agreement must stabilise prices at
remunerative levels.
Under a withholding scheme, this would mean withdrawing whatever quantity of
cocoa from the market was necessary to defend an agreed price range, Mr
Goffa said. Producers want to keep the price range at the SDR1,485-2,155 a
tonne (Pounds 1,120-Pounds 1,620) ruling when the International Cocoa
Organisation suspended price support early in 1988.
The European Community, which accounts for 40 per cent of world cocoa
consumption, has proposed limiting withholding to 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes.
Consumers see export withholding as a temporary measure while producers put
in place, by quotas or other means, tough curbs on production to balance
world supply and demand. Producers want more onus on withholding to 'manage'
the market.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar suppliers seek CAP reform
compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN countries that supply sugar to the European Community are asking
the community to consider compensation for the lower prices they expect to
result from agricultural policy reform.
At their annual summit here, leaders of the Caribbean Economic Community
(Caricom) said that, although proposals for the reform of the European
Community's sugar regime had not yet been finalised, 'the principle of
compensatory payments to EC farmers has already been agreed'.
The Caricom leaders said the compensation should be paid to all members of
the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group that supply sugar to the
community. The ACP states supply 1.3m tonnes a year under quota. The price
they receive has been determined traditionally by the price paid to the EC's
domestic producers.
'The European Community has always maintained that ACP cane sugar should be
treated on par with community sugar,' the heads of government said. They
said the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and the reform of the European
Community's common agricultural policy 'could result in a dramatic reduction
in the price of sugar, which would reduce the income earned by the
industry'.
Caribbean government officials have said that, if current proposals on sugar
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were implemented, the ACP
states could lose about 8 per cent of their earnings from the sales to the
community. ACP producers receive an average price of Pounds 349 a tonne from
the EC.
The ACP producers are also hoping to increase the volume supplied to the
community through increased access to Portugal. Representatives of the Sugar
Association of the Caribbean, a federation of regional producers, said there
has been 'little progress' in efforts to widen the Portuguese market. Since
it joined the EC in 1986 Portugal has been allowed to import some of its
sugar from the world market, and to buy some from some ACP producers, but at
world market prices.
ACP officials say the termination of this transitional arrangement at the
end of this year will coincide with efforts by the group to have Portugal's
purchases from the ACP at world market prices and the country's additional
world market requirements both added to the ACP's quota.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bartering for the riches of
cash-starved Turkmenistan - Steve Levine on the economically-backward
republic's efforts to capitalise on its wealth of resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUPLE of dozen western businessmen gathered last month in what must have
been the unlikeliest site in the former Soviet Union for a sales exhibition,
and at the end they had one, unanimous opinion.
'They don't have any money,' says Mr Ian Forrester, managing director of the
Kent-based food company Healthyfood Marketing, one of the disappointed
participants in the week-long exhibition.
The westerners were attracted mostly by talk of Turkmenistan's coming
riches. The most discussed subject was its 10 trillion (million million)
cubic metres of proven natural gas reserves. About 85bn cu m - worth about
Dollars 6bn at present prices - is extracted annually. Initial engineering
has also begun on a Dollars 1bn Italian proposal for a refinery to exploit
Turkmenistan's oil reserves. The republic has 213m tonnes of proven oil
reserves, according to the government, and is producing 5m tonnes of oil and
condensate a year. 'This country is richer than Qatar,' claims a senior
diplomat.
The trouble is that so far little of this wealth has translated into cash
for the 4m people of this Central Asian backwater that borders Afghanistan
and Iran to the south and the Caspian Sea to the west.
'The only way these people will do business is with barter,' says Mr
Forrester, who plans to barter his product for another of Turkmenistan's
natural resources, dried fruit and nuts. 'And while others won't, we will
barter. These fruits and nuts are the basic components of the products we
are producing anyway.' Mr Forrester is discussing a deal in which his muesli
breakfast food product of raisins, nuts and other dried fruit could be
manufactured in Turkmenistan, slowly and cheaply at first. The goal would be
eventually to develop a new market for the cereal, which at present has a
turnover of just Dollars 4m a year.
In contrast to the Slavic and Baltic states, business in former Soviet
Central Asia has evolved slowly since the superpower broke up. Other than in
Kazakhstan, there is no private enterprise to speak of. Decisions are made
almost solely in the president's office. President Saparmurad Niyazov, for
example, recently declared that there could be no private sale of apartments
or homes for another 10 years. And, for now, the Turkmen government is
talking only in terms of joint ventures with foreign companies rather than
allowing them to buy whole plants or concessions, says Mr Abdi Kuliev, the
foreign minister. 'There are people now who have enough money to buy all
state property. But we don't want to let them buy it. That's why we want
joint ventures - to control both sides.'
Until the republic became independent with the Soviet Union's collapse in
December, Moscow exploited Central Asia largely as a resource store, carting
away cotton, natural gas, oil, silk and gold to factories in Russia and
other republics. So the Asian republics are now starting largely from
scratch economically, and indeed are virtually broke. The situation is not
helped by the resistance of their authoritarian leaders, steeped in
centuries of feudal history in addition to the 70 years of communism, to
anything less than complete control of every undertaking.
In Turkmenistan, there is money to be made - if one can get to President
Niyazov to talk about it. Much of the money will probably be earned from the
natural gas deposits.
The trouble for Turkmenistan is that most of the natural gas until recently
went to Russia and the Ukraine; only about 20bn cu m could be exported
elsewhere. Because of a dispute over Turkmenistan's decision to start
charging former Soviet republics hard currency for its gas the government
has shut off the pipeline to the Ukraine and is looking elsewhere for
customers. Unfortunately that pipeline is just about the only way to
transport the gas anywhere.
Turkey, Iran and Turkmenistan have signed what one diplomat describes as a
'gentlemen's agreement' to build a Dollars 3bn natural gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan, across Iran and into Turkey. But that deal is on hold for now.
As Turkey and Iran are in fierce competition for influence in Central Asia,
the Iranian government is reported to be less than fully co-operative in
getting the deal finalised. Moreover, international bankers are thought to
be worried about Tehran's reliability as a business partner. 'If there is
trouble, Iran could just turn off the pipeline,' says one Asian businessman
who operates in Turkmenistan.
Another proposal is to add value to the gas by building a petrochemical
plant to produce liquefied natural gas, some of which could be shipped to
Kazakhstan, Iran or Turkey to make polymers.
One businessman who is optimistic about opportunities in Turkmenistan is Mr
Paul Aouizerate, the 28-year-old president of Alpax, the Paris-based company
that sponsored the exhibition. He is comparing Turkmenistan to Kuwait a few
decades ago. Turkmenistan has a few other enthusiastic supporters as well,
but most of them see in it something to watch and deal with carefully.
'To compare Kuwait and Turkmenistan, well, I could compare a donkey and a
duck, but I would not try to eat a donkey, nor ride a duck,' says Mr Daniel
Perrin, director general of the French company Amca Chimie et Plastiques.
For the present creative barter seems almost the only way to go.
Rome-based Tecnologie Progetti Lavori has signed a Dollars 250m deal to
build a 100,000 sq m textile plant at Ashkabad, Turkmenistan's capital. The
contract, by far the largest Turkmenistan has concluded with a foreign
company, was endorsed personally by President Niyazov.
The state-owned plant, under construction 5 km (3 miles) south of the city
centre, is to be finished by October 1994. Initially it is to produce terry
cloth and, eventually, clothes, according Mr Pierre Stainier of TPL.
Payment is complex, he says. TPL is to receive the hard-currency equivalent
of its fee in cotton. But, under to the deal, Turkmenistan is to 'convert'
the cotton to hard currency itself by selling it abroad, then hand over the
proceeds to TPL. Turkmenistan produces 1.4m tonnes of cotton a year, until
now using all but 300,000 tonnes at home. The cotton itself is a guarantee
of eventual payment. 'Sometimes we've had to stop construction because
they've been slow paying us. But then they do pay us, and we begin building
again,' Mr Stainier says.
TPL has now begun moving earth in a desert site 300 km north-east of
Ashkabad, near the Amu Darya River, for a proposed Dollars 1bn oil refinery.
The plant, 2 km long and 1 km wide, will provide Turkmenistan's first
opportunity to produce petrol for export.
Only the engineering stage has been agreed to so far. If the government
agrees to a construction contract, the two sides will probably employ a
barter arrangement - based on refined crude - for payment, Mr Stainer says.

Three-month COPPER came to within a whisker of Dollars 2,500 a tonne on the
LME against a background of US investment fund buying, with selling well
absorbed. The rise represented the resumption of the recent uptrend after a
spell of consolidation, with early gains prompted by Far Eastern buying,
dealers said. In afternoon trading Comex copper futures were setting
lifetime highs on the back of continued fund buying. LME ZINC leapt higher
during kerb trading, with speculative buying pushing the three-month price
above Dollars 1,300 a tonne. New York arabica COFFEE futures were firm at
midday on renewed short covering after Monday's fall. Analysts said
sentiment that Brazil's coffee sector might be getting closer to a unified
proposal on an international price support plan lent background support. In
London, where robusta coffee closed ahead, news that Brazil would be happy
with a 20m bag share of a global quota of 70m bags was seen as mildly
constructive. In Chicago SOYABEANS were firmer at midday on concerns that
hot temperatures next week could endanger the developing crops, traders
said.

PETROLEOS MEXICANOS has discovered an offshore oil well described as having
'outstanding hydrocarbon reserves'.
The well was found in the Sonda de Campeche sea area and is expected to
produce about 14,000 barrels of crude a day and 2.6m cubic feet of gas. This
is roughly double the average production of existing wells in the Sonda de
Campeche.
The well is located 95 km (60 miles) north-east of Ciudad Carmen and is 55

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Boots joins queue of UK groups seeking
long finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the pharmaceutical and retailing group, yesterday launched a Pounds
250m 25-year bond issue - the latest UK company to raise long-term funding
in the international bond market. The deal was wholly underwritten by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, which lead-managed a Pounds 400m 14-year issue by
Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, on Monday.
However, unlike the Hanson deal, the paper issued yesterday was entirely
placed by BZW. The bonds are unusual in paying 10 1/8 per cent coupons
quarterly. The lead manager said the structure matched the cash-flow
requirements of a handful of institutional investors.
Bankers speculated that the issue had been 'stripped' by BZW: the coupons
had been sold separately from the underlying bonds. Stripped bonds are often
bought by insurance companies, which use the coupons as backing for
long-dated obligations such as annuities.
Boots will use the proceeds of the issue to repay short-term bank
borrowings. At the end of the last financial year, the group showed
short-term debt amounting to just over Pounds 300m. Some of the proceeds of
the deal were swapped in floating rate sterling, although the longer-dated
portions will be held as fixed-rate obligations.
At an issue price of 100.325, the bonds yield around 140 basis points more
than UK government paper. There are few comparable corporate bond issues
outstanding, since most other deals of this maturity are secured on the
assets of the issuer. Yesterday, the Hanson bonds were trading at a yield
spread of around 126 basis points, from 128 basis points at launch.
Elsewhere, Confederation Life, the Canadian life insurance company, raised
Pounds 100m five-year funds from a deal lead-managed by Warburg Securities.
The 9.5 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.20, where the yield is 40 basis points more than gilts.
Participants in the deal said the pricing was fair for a company rated AA+,
just one notch below the top triple-A credit rating, by Standard &amp; Poor's,
the US agency.
Against this, the deal was Confederation Life's first sterling bond issue
and the company remains less well known in the UK than in North America.
However, demand was easily sufficient to support the issue. By the close in
London, the issue was trading at around the launch spread.
Britannia Building Society also raised Pounds 100m, from a four-year issue
of floating rate notes. The paper pays 15 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate and were re-offered to investors
at a fixed price of 99.73. At this level, the bonds pay a margin of 24 basis
points over Libor, roughly in line with outstanding Britannia paper in the
secondary market.
In the Eurodollar sector, Thyssen, the German industrial group, made a rare
appearence in the public debt markets. The group raised Dollars 200m
seven-year funding in a deal lead-managed by Dresdner Bank.
Thyssen does not carry a credit rating but is one of Germany's best-known
industrial groups. The 7 1/2 per cent bonds, priced to yield 84 basis points
more than US Treasury bonds, sold briskly to continental European retail
investors, banks and some investment institutions.
City of Yokohama launched a long-awaited Dollars 130m 10-year issue
lead-managed by Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets. The paper was priced to yield
36 basis points more than Treasuries - considered tight by some participants
in the deal, and unnecessarily generous by others.
Republic of Ireland yesterday raised Dollars 300m in the US bond market. The
10-year yankee bond issue, lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, was priced to
yield 40 basis points more than US Treasury bonds.
Bankers said that the borrower achieved a lower cost of funds than issuing
in the international bond market. A Eurodollar issue may have been priced to
yield up to 10 basis points more, although higher fees are charged by
underwriters in the US market. Ireland is rated AA3 and AA- by Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agencies.
The long-term debt rating of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) has been
downgraded by Moody's from Aa1 to Aa3. About Dollars 2.7bn of debt is
affected. The rating agency cited concerns about asset quality and the
effectiveness of the bank's risk management controls, as well as the
longer-term profitability of the bank.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Only 94 companies refer to
accounts standards

<TEXT>
FEWER than 100 companies worldwide make reference to international
accounting standards in their accounts, according to a survey from the
International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).
The Scandinavian countries, France and Canada dominate the list, while only
one UK company - Ocean Wilsons in its 1990 accounts - has made mention of
the standards.
A total of 94 companies refer to the IASC, including several from Italy, the
US and Japan. There is also at least one Polish company and three
international organisations.
Mr David Cairns, secretary-general, said he was disappointed that only a
very small number of listed companies referred to the standards 19 years
after the IASC was established. But he said that a growing number were now
beginning to do so, mainly as a result of either national requirements to
state that they conformed with accounting standards, or by a desire to make
their financial statements more attractive so they could gain access to
international capital markets.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Equity Issues: Flow of new issues set to tail
off as US demand weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOW of new equity offerings, which reached a record volume in the first
half of this year, was boosted by a constant stream of deals from the US,
where companies took advantage of a bullish stock market to rebuild their
balance sheets.
Of a total Dollars 13bn of international equities launched in the first
half, offerings by US companies accounted for Dollars 5bn, according to IFR
Securities Data. In the US market, US companies raised Dollars 41.3bn.
But in recent weeks the depressed state of the world's stock markets has
taken its toll on the international equities market, and the strong US
component of the market is now under threat.
Investors have become increasingly disgruntled with the performance of deals
launched earlier this year, with US initial public offerings (IPOs) down by
an average of about 8 per cent, according to bankers.
The cancellation of a large Dollars 600m initial public offering by Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up, the soft drink manufacturer, is the most significant of a
series of pulled or postponed deals.
However, the market is not closed, but rather has become highly selective.
'There are two trends: a flight to quality and an acute sensitivity to
valuation,' said one banker.
Some bankers point out that the new issues market normally experiences a
seasonal lull in the summer, even without depressed stock market conditions.
Still, a number of US IPOs with international tranches are under way.
The planned offering for Revlon, the US cosmetics and consumer group, has
been halved but is going ahead at just under Dollars 200m (or 11m shares).
The deal will be priced shortly. The US tranche is arranged by Merrill Lynch
and the international portion by Credit Suisse First Boston.
Meanwhile, Equitable Life, the US life insurance company, hosted roadshows
in Europe last week for its Dollars 544m IPO, arranged by Goldman Sachs. The
deal is expected to be priced next week.
Among other US IPOs, Computervision is planning a Dollars 300m deal, via
Lehman Brothers and GTec Holdings, a lottery operator, is preparing a
Dollars 150m offering, via Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Court protection sought by Royal
Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL CONSTRUCTION, a Japanese contractor with interests in resort
development, is to seek court protection.
Royal Construction said that its outstanding debts totalled Y19bn (Dollars
152m), and blamed the difficulties on an unidentified condominium operator
which failed to pay debts, leaving Royal unable to honour payment deadlines
and in need of protection from creditors.
Yesterday's announcement shook investor confidence in other Japanese
property companies, whose share prices fell sharply on the Tokyo stock
exchange.
Trading in Royal shares on the over-the-counter market was suspended
yesterday afternoon and the company later said it sought protection because
the damage to its credit reputation had left it unlikely to win new
government contracts. The company had been a specialist in public works
projects before entering the crowded resort market.
The Tokyo stock market has been haunted by fears of property company
collapses, and reports of Royal's predicament led to a sharp fall in the
share price of Daikyo (down Y47 to Y733), a condominium and resort builder
which last month publicly denied press reports that it was close to
collapse.
Share prices of leading contractors fell, including Sumitomo Construction
(down Y26 to Y419) and Tobishima (down Y22 to Y423), which is already being
restructured by its main bank, Fuji. Misawa Homes, another house builder,
was down Y48 to Y951.
Japanese contractors have been confronted by a sharp increase in debt
defaults by developers, who have been unable to find tenants for new office
or apartment complexes, or who have invested wrongly in leisure projects.
Builders argue that the condominium market, in decline for the past two
years, has begun to recover. The Real Estate Economic Institute said
yesterday the number of unsold units in Tokyo last month was 9,953, the
first month it has been below 10,000 since September 1991.
But the institute said the number of new condominiums offered for sale in
June was down 34.3 per cent from the same month last year, while the average
sale price of those apartments was 26.9 per cent lower than in June of last
year.

JAPAN Airlines (JAL) is studying the possibility of eliminating some of its
less-profitable international routes, a company spokesman said yesterday,
AP-DJ reports.
The spokesman said two weekly flights between Tokyo and Copenhagen and one
weekly flight between Tokyo and New Delhi may be cut.
Sluggish economic growth and heavy investment badly hit the airline, the
country's largest. The pre-tax loss was Y6.04bn (Dollars 48.5m)for the
fiscal year ending on March 31 - the first loss since the former national
flag carrier went private in 1987.
Last month, the company said it was reviewing its routes, investment and
personnel to counter a sharp drop in its ability to compete. Some 400 jobs
will be eliminated and the management team will be restructured in an effort
to return to profitability.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: China Merchants sails smoothly
into uncharted waters - Simon Holberton examines the flotation of a mainland
Chinese company on the Hong Kong market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first time that Jiang Bo encountered China Merchants was in 1949 in
Shanghai. The People's Liberation Army liberated the city from Nationalist
control and he was one of the officials the new communist government sent
into the company's then head office to seize its assets.
Today, 67-year-old Mr Jiang, a Communist party member since 1944, is China
Merchant's managing director and the man who has presided over its expansion
from a shipping company to one which owns hotels, three insurance companies,
two banks and hundreds of small industrial companies.
He is also the man who this week scored a first in the Hong Kong capital
market by floating 25 per cent of the equity of a pure Chinese mainland
company, Hai Hong Holdings, a producer of marine and industrial paints.
The offering was a success. Hai Hong sought less than HKDollars 100m
(USDollars 12.9m), but on Monday Hong Kong investors - hungry for any stock
that can be described as a 'China play' - stumped up HKDollars 31.2bn to
make the issue 373 times oversubscribed.
Mr Jiang says it is possible that in the future Hai Hong may become China
Merchant's main listed company on the Hong Kong exchange. It will always
wish to retain at least 51 per cent of the company, he said, but did not
rule out selling its interests in other assets the company now holds
privately.
The strength of investor interest reinforced the growing importance of Hong
Kong as a source of capital for the mainland. Equally importantly, it
underlined a significant change of approach to the colony by the mainland
establishment.
China Merchants, along with the three other 'Heavenly Sisters' - China
Resources, Bank of China, and China Travel Service - has been one of the
more conservatively-managed mainland companies in Hong Kong, preferring to
go about its business with the minimum of fuss.
But in keeping with Beijing's 'open door' policy of economic reform and the
impending transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997, the
mainland's economic presence in the colony is daily becoming more visible.
China Merchants is the mainland's oldest company in Hong Kong. It was
founded in 1872 by Li Hung-Chang, a late Qing dynasty reformer, and has
always had close ties with the Chinese state.
Since 1949, when the communists assumed power in China, it has been under
the 'direction' of the Ministry of Communications. The minister of
communications is the chairman of the company's board, but China Merchants'
operational headquarters is in Hong Kong and, since 1978 when Deng
Xiaoping's reforms were inaugurated, its managing director has been given
considerable latitude to develop the business.
Today, China Merchants employs 40,000 people in 22 wholly-owned subsidiaries
and 40 Hong Kong joint ventures, and operates 368 mainly industrial
companies, the bulk of which are located in a region of the Shenzhen special
economic zone called Shekou. This is a port situated on the Pearl River
Delta, which the company owns and operates on behalf of the Ministry of
Communications.
According to Mr Jiang, the company has assets with a book value of HKDollars
12bn, HKDollars 6bn of debt, and made profits last year of HKDollars 200m.
Profits in 1991 were hit by the poor performance of its UK marine insurer,
Scottish Lion Insurance.
The company also owns a shipping line, called Ming Wah, which made profits
of HKDollars 300m in 1991. Ming Wah owns and operates a fleet of ships of
3.5m dead-weight tonnes - the second largest in Hong Kong.
The core of its business remains shipping. Last year its ships carried 11
per cent of Hong Kong's trade that went by sea; they also handled 50 per
cent of all marine trade by Chinese-invested companies in Hong Kong.
China Merchants also operates ship repair and maintenance facilities, and
owns docks and container operations in Hong Kong, Shekou and Shenzhen.
Earlier this year it paid HKDollars 175m for a 15 per cent share of Modern
Terminals Limited - one of the main owner-operators of Hong Kong's container
port.
'Because we are under the Ministry of Communications our main business is
shipping,' says Mr Jiang. 'But if we have the opportunity we are also
prepared to diversify and develop other activities.'
Since he became managing director in 1985, the company has bought into
banking and insurance and increased the vertical integration of its shipping
business by acquiring a ship repair business and warehouses.
The company has also done its bit for the economic development of other
parts of the mainland by setting up businesses in the Pudong area of
Shanghai and in Weihai, Shandong province, and recently acquiring an 18 sq
km area of land in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, to develop as a free trade
zone.
These ventures are part of the 'developmental' role the big mainland
companies in Hong Kong are meant to fulfil for China. In Shekou, where the
company has funded the ports development and taken slices of 340-odd
industrial companies which have set up business there, it is also building a
35km railway to connect the port with the industrialised part of Shenzhen to
the west.
The company's move into banking and insurance fulfils both the developmental
and profit-seeking brief it has been given. Scottish Lion may be a
loss-maker today, but China Merchants has plans to set up a branch in
Shanghai and, as a mainland-owned company, it should be well placed to take
advantage of the liberalisation being planned for China's the insurance
market.
Similarly in banking. It owns a controlling interest in Hong Kong's Union
Bank, and has a joint venture bank on the mainland, China Merchants Bank.
Both are small, but the seeds of future growth have been sown.
As Mr Jiang said: 'I joined the revolution in 1944 to make China rich and
strong.'

McDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, is selling
Telecheck Services - which provides cheque acceptance and guarantee services

McDonnell Douglas said the deal was part of its strategy of focusing on its
aerospace business. Telecheck, which it acquired in 1984, is based in
Denver, Colorado, and employs about 700 people.
The aerospace group did not put a price on the deal, but First Financial
Management said it would be paying Dollars 159m both to buy Telecheck and
Payment Services, its principal franchisee, which is not owned by McDonnell
Douglas.
McDonnell Douglas has been slimming down its sizeable financial services
operations, to focus on aircraft financing and commercial equipment leasing.
Last year it even considered selling off the entire financial services arm
as a means of raising cash.

<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group, yesterday reported a 6.5
per cent decline in second-quarter net earnings, reflecting the tough
competition in US food retailing and the pressures of a sluggish economy.
Net income in the three months to June 13 was Dollars 33.3m, or 28 cents a
share, against Dollars 35.6m, or 31 cents, in the same period of 1991.
Sales slid 2 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 3.5bn, while same-store
sales were 3.1 per cent below 1991 levels.
The company, which was subject to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986,
reduced its interest expense in the latest quarter to Dollars 67.5m from
Dollars 84.8m a year earlier.
The improvement was attributed to a decline in short-term interest rates and
the refinancing of high-interest-rate debt taken on during the 1986 buy-out.
Safeway's second quarter operating profits fell 13.7 per cent to Dollars
120.5m from Dollars 139.7m. The company blamed the weak comparison on a
strong 1991 second quarter before recessionary sales trends had fully
emerged in many of its markets.
For the first six months net income dropped to Dollars 28.4m, or 24 cents,
compared with Dollars 62.3m, or 57 cents, the previous year. The 1992
figures, however, include a one-time charge of Dollars 27.8m, or 23 cents,
related to the early retirement of debt.
Safeway said its operating results were also hurt by the low level of food
price inflation.
Sales in the first half of 1992 were Dollars 6.85bn, against Dollars 6.92bn
a year earlier.
Chase Manhattan Bank, a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Corp, said it has
formed a new group within its North America corporate finance sector by
combining the project finance and public utilities divisions, Reuter reports
from New York.
The company said it had named Mr William Rockford to head the new group. Mr
Rockford joined Chase in 1972 and has held positions covering utility
companies in the US.

<TEXT>
LEHNDORFF Canada, a private group of real estate partnerships funded largely
by European investors, met with about 30 creditors in Toronto yesterday to
ask for concessions on its CDollars 565m (USDollars 470m) debt.
Lehndorff said it was seeking an 'informal restructuring of its debt, assets
and operations' in view of the slump in the Canadian commercial property
market. 'Given the persistence of current trends, it can no longer be
business as usual,' Mr Murray Brown, president, said.
The company said the debt was secured by properties with residual equity of
close to CDollars 1bn.
The restructuring plan is due to be finalised by September 30. It includes
proposals for an injection of equity by the 5,000 investors in its limited
partnerships, most of whom are German.
Lehndorff manages a portfolio of about 230 properties, mostly in southern
Ontario and Alberta. Its main lenders include Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank
of Canada and several foreign-owned banks.
It is the latest in a string of Canadian property developers to acknowledge
financial difficulties caused by a combination of heavy debt loads, rising
vacancy rates and downward pressure on rents and purchase prices.
Bramalea, a developer controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman
family, failed to make an interest payment due last week on a CDollars 100m
bond issue.
The company is renegotiating its CDollars 4.8bn debt. Its share price stood
at 90 cents yesterday morning, down from more than CDollars 5 at the
beginning of this year.

private placing

<TEXT>
MILLICOM International Cellular (MIC), a cellular phone operator based in
Luxembourg, is launching a private placement in the UK and US prior to
listing on the Luxembourg stock exchange.
The company aims to raise Dollars 70m through the placement which is
expected to increase shareholders' equity to Dollars 165m from about Dollars
50m.
The funds will go mainly towards strengthening its capital base. It is
eyeing a number of important licences which are expected to be granted over
the next few years.
MIC is a joint venture formed in 1990 between Kinnevik, a Swedish industrial
holding company with interests in telecommunications, broadcasting and
timber, and Millicom of the US, a New York-based telecommunications group
which was a minority shareholder in Vodafone before being bought out by
Racal. Kinnevik owns 48 per cent and Millicom has a 50 per cent holding
while the management control the rest.
The placing, at between Dollars 9 and Dollars 11 per share, will be for 14
per cent of the company's shares, or about 7m shares, reducing the holdings
of Kinnevik to just under 43 per cent and of Millicom to approximately 41
per cent, with the remainder to be retained by the management.

OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch maker of photocopiers, design engineering
plotters and office systems, said second-quarter net profit rose by 6 per
cent to Fl 30.1m (Dollars 17.7m) on sales up 9 per cent at Fl 696.1m.
The rate of growth is slower than the first quarter, when both net profit
and sales posted gains of 11 per cent. Overall, net profit in the first half
rose by 8 per cent to Fl 51.2m, while turnover increased by 10 per cent to
Fl 1.35bn. More than half of the rate of increase in sales was due to the
acquisition in 1991 of Bruning, a US maker of design engineering equipment.
Operating profit in the first six months to May 31 fell by 11 per cent to Fl
74.6m. However, income from leasing office equipment nearly doubled, surging
to Fl 33.8m from Fl 19.7m. If leases are included, overall operating profit
rose by 4 per cent to Fl 108m, or at about half the rate of net profit.
Financing charges were 12 per cent higher at Fl 38.8m, but taxes were
substantially lower, falling by 15 per cent to Fl 18.6m. The company's
fiscal year ends on November 30.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Swiss to grant banking licences
to Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swiss government is prepared to grant banking licences to up to 10
Japanese financial institutions by the end of this year.
Mr Alexis Lautenberg, head of the financial and economic division in the
Swiss Foreign Ministry, said yesterday that the government was also ready to
grant a one-year extension to the 11 other Japanese-owned non-bank financial
institutions in Switzerland which want to become banks but cannot yet
qualify.
These decisions reflect the successful conclusion of a lengthy bilateral
negotiation on financial issues between Japan and Switzerland.
The talks took place against the background of a Swiss law that requires all
non-bank financial institutions to convert themselves into banks by the end
of this year. The Swiss threatened to hold back banking licences unless the
Japanese Ministry of Finance (MoF) eased restrictions on the operations of
Swiss banks in Japan.
In late June, the Japanese Diet (parliament) passed a law enabling foreign
banks in Japan to increase their ownership of securities subsidiaries from
50 per cent to 100 per cent.
No progress was made on two other issues, The ministry refused to lift its
severe limits on Japanese individuals putting their capital in foreign
banks. 'We understand and trust they will take steps in the future,' Mr
Lautenberg said.
For legal reasons, the ministry has also been unable to lift restrictions on
securities companies' participation in the Japanese foreign exchange market.
The ministry will now decide to which financial institutions the Swiss
banking licences should be allocated. There is speculation in Japanese
financial circles in Zurich that all but one of the nine subsidiaries of
Japanese banks without banking licences will be selected, but only two of
the subsidiaries of the 12 securities companies will convert themselves into
banks.
Mr Lautenberg said the offer of an extension to the rest should only be
taken up by those who really intended to seek a banking licence. It should
not be used to delay making a decision.

purchase

<TEXT>
AFTER NEARLY two years of reflection, Mr Ali Salih, chairman of Aberdeen
Steak Houses, the loss-making restaurant chain, has decided he will not
offer to buy out the company's minority shareholders.
Mr Salih, who owns 78 per cent of the company, said in August 1990 he was
talking to his bankers about buying out minorities at a price 'unlikely to
be materially different' from the 67p flotation price when the shares were
listed on the USM in 1985.
Yesterday he said he would no longer proceed with the plan, prompting
another fall in the share price, which dropped 2p to 18p.
The market was always sceptical about Mr Salih's plans and has marked the
shares down as losses mounted since 1989.
Last year losses were contained to Pounds 422,000 compared to Pounds 3.27m
in 1990.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Howden rises to Pounds 18m as Danish
provisions fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineer whose recent results have been
plagued by a contract to supply tunnelling machines to Denmark, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.99m to Pounds 18.1m in the year to April 30
after a sharp reduction in exceptional provisions relating to the Danish
contract.
The company said that MT Group, the international consortium constructing
the twin rail tunnels under the Great Belt waterway, had recently escalated
the contractual disputes with James Howden, which supplied four boring
machines, by threatening to demand payment of two bank guarantees - a
performance bond of Pounds 7.8m and another for liquidated damages of Pounds
5.8m.
This, Howden said, was despite indications given to the contrary and despite
MT defaulting on payments to James Howden and denying it the right to
perform under the contract.
Howden described the consortium's move as 'a tactical manoeuvre' in the
long-running dispute which is before the courts in Scotland and arbitration
in Denmark.
Howden has applied for an injunction to prevent MT 'pulling' the bonds, but
said that, even if that happened, the damage to Howden would be slight - the
Pounds 13.6m loss would not much hurt the now 'sound balance sheet'.
Acknowledging that the Great Belt contract had not benefited the company one
penny and had been a main claim on the board's time, Howden said that Pounds
8.4m cash from operations and Pounds 30.4m from August's rights issue had
reduced group borrowings from Pounds 63.7m to Pounds 24.9m over the year.
Subsequently interest charges fell from Pounds 9.58m to Pounds 5.13m,
helping the pre-tax increase.
The company said that MT dispute was not a shackle on its operating
businesses, though the lack of Great Belt work accounted for Pounds 20m of
the fall in turnover to Pounds 292.3m (Pounds 330.6m). Group operating
profits rose by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 24.3m.
Last time's exceptional charge of Pounds 10.4m shrank to Pounds 1.07m. This
was further provision for possible future legal costs on the dispute.
Mr John Jackson, chairman, said that Howden's 'strength in international
markets had protected it from the worst of the recession'. The order book at
the beginning of the current year stood at Pounds 300m (Pounds 250m), which
includes Howden Canada's Pounds 64m share of a yet to be finalised power
station plant order from Iran.
Mr Jackson said that the air and gas handling division - 48 per cent of
group turnover - 'had a busy and successful year', while construction and
mining equipment's was 'disappointing'. Aerospace 'experienced a significant
contraction in its markets' and processing and packaging 'operated in
quieter market conditions'.
The proposed final dividend is 1.3p (nil) making 2p (1.59p) for the year, as
forecast last July, payable from earnings of 5.7p (1.4p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEP Industrial Holdings, a manufacturer and distributor of engineering
products, raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 319,000 to Pounds 378,000 in the
half year to March 31.
Reflecting that improvement, directors of this USM-quoted company intend to
lift the dividend from 0.2p to not less than 0.65p and have declared an
interim of 0.3p.
Turnover came to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 26.2m). Comparisons included Pounds
13.5m sales and Pounds 123,000 profit attributable to Combori Group and
American Socket Screw Manufacturing. Earnings per share were 0.7p (0.26p).
Mr Paul Formby, chairman and chief executive, said the reorganisation
reduced gearing and SEP was producing significantly improved results even
before the recession ended.
The better half year reflected an improved contribution from distribution,
which was expected to continue. Acquisition of Huntingdon Fastener further
increased market share.
Activity in manufacturing remained subdued throughout the period but 'we are
starting to see the first tentative signs of a recovery'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HELPED BY a substantial cut in interest charges, Securiguard Group raised
interim pre-tax profits by 20 per cent.
Turnover in the 28 weeks to May 17 moved up to Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 84.9m)
but trading profit fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.77m). Interest took Pounds
792,000 (Pounds 1.32m) to leave the pre-tax balance at Pounds 2.6m (Pounds
2.16m after an exceptional charge of Pounds 287,000).
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said the continuing focus on credit control and
cash collection contributed to the interest savings and that progress was
expected to be maintained in the second half.
In the UK, the security division's results were down on last year's outcome
which was temporarily boosted by the Gulf crisis. Indications were that it
would achieve second half profits similar to last time.
Cleaning and maintenance lifted profits 16 per cent from turnover up 6 per
cent; the communications side had mixed trading and personnel services
reduced losses significantly.
Earnings per share rose to 8.6p (7.2p) and the interim dividend goes up to
3.5p (3.2p).

Creighton's Naturally, the USM-quoted maker of toiletries and beauty
products, lifted pre-tax profit by 30 per cent in the year to March 31,
although sales were lower.
Mr Richard Collard, chairman, said improvements in production efficiency and
operational cost control contributed greatly to the expanded profit.
From sales down nearly Pounds 1m at Pounds 10.2m, profit worked through at
Pounds 934,000 (Pounds 720,000). Earnings per share were 13.1p (10.4p) and
the final dividend is 5p for a total of 7p (6.2p).
Mr Collard said stocks were reduced by Pounds 500,000 and debtors by Pounds
600,000, allowing the company to benefit from cash surpluses and the
elimination of a net interest charge.

On turnover of Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 30.9m) operating profits amounted to

Higher operating profits of Pounds 780,000 (Pounds 720,000) were offset by

Turnover for the USM-quoted company, which services electronic point of sale

Difficult trading conditions prompted a further decline at Colefax and
Fowler Group, the wallpaper, fabric and furnishing company.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-April were Pounds 704,000, against
Pounds 1.18m last time and Pounds 4.01m the year before.
Mr David Green, chief executive, said that overall trade sales in the UK
fell by 11.5 per cent reflecting a fall off in contract orders. Retail sales
were also badly affected, he said, and the group was examining ways of
reducing costs.
In contrast, continental sales showed a near-8 per cent expansion, with a
particularly good performance by Jane Churchill products which jumped by 44
per cent.
Mr Green reiterated that future growth, scheduled to be achieved through
expansion of product and services, was dependent 'on the rate of return of
consumer confidence.'
Turnover dipped to Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 30.2m). Earnings per share, helped
by a Pounds 221,000 tax credit, emerged at 3.7p (4.7p). A same-again final
dividend of 1.3p maintains the total at 2.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Miskin Group, the USM-quoted contractor, property development and plant hire
group, is to prepare for the future in an 'organised and practical manner',
according to Mr Jeffrey Goodman, chairman.
It will continue to improve sales, reduce debt by selling off properties,
and divest itself of less profitable businesses.
That will maximise profits and reduce overheads by reverting to the
profitable core business - building and plumbing contracting and plant hire
 -of the principal subsidiary, leaving options open in respect of the future
direction to be taken.
Mr Goodman warned that substantial provision may be needed in the accounts
for the year to July in respect of any discontinued trading activities or
disposals.
In the half year ended January 31 the group produced turnover of Pounds 6.2m
(Pounds 4.94m) and pre-tax losses of Pounds 414,000 (Pounds 630,000).
However, an extraordinary credit of Pounds 2.92m, following the financial
restructuring last October, left a retained profit of Pounds 2.51m (loss
Pounds 630,000).
Comparatives were for the middle term of an 18 months period to July 31
1991, when losses reached Pounds 7.36m after exceptional charges of Pounds
4.62m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gresham Telecomputing reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 294,000 for the six
months to April 30 on turnover of Pounds 3.95m.
Pro-forma figures for the six months to March 31 1991 from the combined
results of Gresham Telecomputing for the six months and Gresham Computer
Holdings for five months showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 293,000 on
turnover of Pounds 4.89m.
Earnings were 0.57p and there is no interim dividend.
The company said that there had been a reduction in revenues as a result of
tough trading conditions and concentrating on higher margin products.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bimec tops Pounds 6m but sees downturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING AN extensive restructuring programme, Bimec Industries, the
aerospace, waste treatment and engineering company, increased pre-tax profit
from Pounds 5.36m to Pounds 6.04m for the year ended March 31, on turnover
up from Pounds 74.5m to Pounds 103m.
Each of the group's main divisions was profitable, although the company
warned that orders were now down to Pounds 50m compared to Pounds 55m at
this stage last year. The half year results would therefore be disappointing
unless there was an early upturn in the economy, the company said.
Earnings per share remained stable at 5.1p - after allowing for the rights
issue last July - and an increased final dividend of 0.83p (1p) is
recommended, to maintain the total at 1.5p.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tokyo gives cautious response to Wellcome
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME has received a cautious response from investors in Tokyo, the first
stop on a global road show to promote the international tender offer for the
drug company's shares.
As Mr John Robb, chief executive, moved on to presentations in the US this
week, most Japanese investors said they would wait to see the reaction in
other parts of the world before deciding on how big a commitment to make to
the shares.
'We'll need to see the reaction of investors overseas,' said a fund manager
at Tokyo Marine and Fire, a leading non-life insurance company. He added
that buying Wellcome would mean selling stocks such as Glaxo or SmithKline
Beecham, in order to maintain his portfolio's exposure to British
pharmaceutical companies.
Although Wellcome is known in Japan for AZT, its anti-Aids drug which
achieves local annual sales of Y25bn (Pounds 105m), its presence lags behind
other leading UK drugs companies.
One fund manager said he was thinking of spending Y30m but considered the
share price still too high despite its sharp fall since the issue was
announced. 'The offer doesn't seem to be generating excitement, and I would
rather buy shares of Astra, the Swedish drugs company,' he added.
Many Japanese institutional investors, hurt by the slump in the domestic
stock market, are looking to decrease investments. Last year, net purchases
of foreign stocks by Japanese investors fell from Dollars 6.3bn to Dollars
3.6bn (Pounds 1.9bn).
Some 250 investors turned up to Wellcome's Tokyo presentation but they will
have to wait until next Monday before they can begin to participate in the
tender process.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: P&amp;P turns round to Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;P, one of the UK's largest distributors of personal computers, saw pre-tax
profits shrink from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 1m in the six months to May 31.
However Mr David Southworth, chairman, stressed that profits this time
represented a sharp turnround - in the second half of last year P&amp;P incurred
losses of Pounds 2.6m. Many people had been writing the company off, he
said, 'but P&amp;P is far from dead.' However, the interim dividend is almost
halved to 0.7p (1.33p).
He said the company was now over the worst, though he added that in a
recession where manufacturers reduced prices, the competition was squeezed.
'Vigorous cost reductions' and 'a revision of the whole cost structure' had
been implemented to achieve the turnround. This resulted in the loss of
almost 200 jobs, though this figure is clouded by the acquisition of ICI
Computer Systems. The ICI deal - a four-year agreement whereby P&amp;P supplies
the chemicals company with its PC needs - is a model for future P&amp;P
partnerships.
The European operations are seeing the same drop in prices and margins as
the UK side, said Mr Southworth, but were reacting more quickly, because
lessons had been learned.
Last time's pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 2m greater but for an
exceptional charge relating to a stock write-off for discontinued lines.
Turnover this time slipped to Pounds 119m (Pounds 121m). Earnings shed 2p to
0.9p per share.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Seeboard up 45% and gives customers rebate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEEBOARD, the electricity distributor serving south-east England, yesterday
reported a sharp increase in profits - and immediately promised a minimum
Pounds 10 rebate for all its customers.
Mr George Squair, chairman, said that the rebate and recommended 17 per cent
dividend increase 'provide evidence that privatisation can bring benefits to
shareholders and customers alike'.
Seeboard's pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31 were Pounds 98.4m,
up 45 per cent from the Pounds 67.8m given in the pro forma accounts for
last year's privatisation. This amounted to earnings per share of 53.5p, up
from 36.5p.
The company's mainstream business continued to grow despite the recession.
Electricity distributed rose by 1.4 per cent, and the average tariff
increase amounted to 1.9 per cent. The distribution business made a profit
of Pounds 91.5m, up from Pounds 64.2m. Controllable costs were reduced by
3.6 per cent.
The supply business made a profit of Pounds 4.3m, down from Pounds 7.2m
because of the squeeze on margins.
Seeboard has regained 31 large industrial customers in its area, but Mr Jim
Ellis, chief executive, stressed that Seeboard only accepted business in
this market if it was profitable.
The non-regulated businesses saw their contribution fall from Pounds 2.9m to
Pounds 2m because of the recession.
Retailing turnover was up 11 per cent to more than Pounds 50m, and
electrical contracting work rose to Pounds 26m, up 15 per cent. Seeboard is
also expanding into the power generation and gas distribution business.
Seeboard's dividend increase is the largest so far proposed in this round of
electricity results. The final pay-out will be 12.25p making a total
dividend of 17.25p. Dividend cover increased from 2.5 to 3.1.
Mr Ellis said the result pointed to an underlying growth in the business of
about 1 per cent.
Mr Squair, who will be succeeded by Sir Keith Stuart in September, said:
'Seeboard has come through the testing initial period which followed
flotation with flying colours.'
COMMENT
The Pounds 10 rebate - which will cost Seeboard about Pounds 20m - will be
seen as a stunt to deflect attention from high profits and the most handsome
dividend increase seen in the sector so far. But the real reason is the
regulatory system which requires regional electricity companies to set their
tariffs on the basis of forecasts of costs rather than past history, and
Seeboard overestimated them. Even so, this is one of the best electricity
company results to date, showing underlying growth and a well covered
dividend. The stock market seemed to think Seeboard's concern for its
customers is good for business: the share price rose a few pence to 330p
where the yield is 5 per cent, one of the lowest in the sector.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cellnet helps Securicor to 97% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP recovery at its Cellnet mobile telephone system during the half year
to March 31 helped lift pre-tax profits at Securicor, the security, parcels
and communication company, by 97 per cent to Pounds 26.6m compared with
Pounds 13.5m.
Sales for the half year were Pounds 288m (Pounds 275m).
Cellnet, which is 40 per cent owned by Securicor and its sister company,
Security Services, produced in its second half pre-tax profits of Pounds 57m
(Pounds 30m). Cellnet's contribution to Securicor's operating profits was
therefore increased from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 22.8m.
Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive of Securicor, said Cellnet's result was
based on the popularity of its new call-back message system introduced in
November. Although it was introduced after its main rival, Vodafone,
introduced its call-back system, Mr Wiggs described it as the 'most
sophisticated' in the market.
Benefits from Cellnet's call-back system helped offset the Pounds 3.33m
(Pounds 5.19m) loss from Securicor's other cellular operations.
Operating profits from parcels delivery increased from Pounds 1.97m to
Pounds 3.98m following the group's decision to offer a higher premium
service. Its sales were Pounds 110m (Pounds 102m) and 2.2 parcels were
delivered to each customer compared with an average of 1.8 parcels. Since
the acquisition of most of Federal Express' UK operations Securicor has 15
per cent of the overnight parcel delivery market.
Security profits fell from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 3.45m as the group took a
Pounds 860,000 redundancy cost over the closure of its West Drayton office
near Heathrow.
The interim dividend is increased to 0.665p (0.616p). Earnings per share
increased to 10.8p (7.1p).
Security Services, Securicor's 50.75 per cent subsidiary, made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 8.8m). Earnings rose to 9.8p (5.6p). The
interim dividend is 1.394p (1.291p).
COMMENT
An 8 per cent dividend increase against a 97 per cent pre-tax profit
increase looks rather mean. It should, however, be remembered that Securicor
only derives its contribution from Cellnet in the form of an after-tax
dividend at the year end. That dividend is unlikely to top Pounds 15m.
Nonetheless, investors will understandably be disappointed if the group does
not raise its final dividend by more than a 8 per cent. Cellnet's figures,
while better than anticipated, need to be put into context. For the full
year to March it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 106m compared with
Vodafone's Pounds 272m. Cellnet argues, with some justification, that the
figures are not comparable since Vodafone is sitting on a cash pile. Yet
Cellnet still has some catching up to do. With Securicor's forecast pre-tax
profits of Pounds 59.4m, giving earnings per share of 24.6p, its A shares -
up 15p to close at 571p - are on a demanding prospective multiple of 23.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 3i's new accounts lift veil on activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT'S ABOUT lifting the veil,' says Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of
3i, the venture capital group, in a reference to the accounting changes and
greater disclosure in the company's latest set of accounts.
This year's financial statements provide far more information than either
their predecessors, or many of their investment trust and venture capital
competitors. They also represent a move to less conservative policies.
In his review, Mr Macpherson highlights three areas of change in the
accounts for the year to March 31 1992, which he says should provide a
better understanding of the company's 'strengths and long term philosophy':
disclosure of valuations policy on investments, and a change in some of
these policies
division of operating costs between revenue and investment realisation
profits
details of the portfolio, listing investments in excess of Pounds 5m, and
giving a geographical and industrial split for all
He says the changes reflect 3i's intention to seek a listing. They may yet
be in the last set of accounts before the delayed flotation takes place.
Mr Brian Larcombe, executive director for finance and planning, argues that
the new approach places the accounts 'on the high ground', notably with a
fair value for the assets on the balance sheet, while he says the accuracy
of some other companies' valuations has been criticised.
A three-page valuation policy statement shows that 3i calculates the gross
valuation of profit-making companies by multiplying the latest reported
earnings by the FT-Actuaries p/e ratio for the relevant industrial sector.
Loss-making companies are generally valued at half the net tangible asset
value, or if failure is expected, the equity is valued at nil. New
investments are generally valued at cost until the first post-acquisition
accounts are received.
3i then applies a liquidity discount to the gross value to reflect their
lack of marketability. These have ranged from 40 per cent for companies with
a capitalisation below Pounds 5m, through 20 per cent for investments on the
unlisted securities market to nothing for listed investments and those
valued at cost.
The company recently reviewed the valuation policies reducing its top rate
40 per cent discount to 30 per cent, and valuing USM stocks at mid-market
prices. That has increased net asset values by Pounds 32m.
By transferring Pounds 13.6m of the operating and administrative costs from
revenue to an investment realisation profits reserve, 3i is adopting a
policy used by many investment trusts. But it also has the advantage of
increasing the company's dividend cover, since it is only allowed to pay
dividends from revenues.
The geographical and industry-sector break-down of investments gives an
insight into the breadth of the 3i portfolio. But the disclosure of
investments above Pounds 5m is not complete. Up to ten of the 80 enterprises
did not want to be named.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown acquisition gets MMC clearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission has cleared Hillsdown Holdings'
purchase of the fruit and vegetable canning and ambient stored meals
businesses of Associated British Foods.
The MMC said the acquisition gave Hillsdown substantial market shares in
those sectors and for individual products. Hillsdown and Anglian Canners,
one of the businesses acquired, had combined sales of Pounds 130m in 1990,
equal to a little more than half the total UK market for canned seasonal
vegetables.
But the MMC found Hillsdown was unlikely to be able to exploit its position
because of the buying power of multiple retailers and competition from other
producers.
The MMC also decided the market for ambient stored meals would not be
damaged. Competition was provided by branded products and by chilled and
frozen meals.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Telecom talks to computer groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE TELECOM, the state-owned telecommunications company, is in talks with
two of Europe's major computing services companies which could lead to it
taking a stake in either or both.
Telecom has relationships with a number of small computing services
companies but has yet to take a stake in a large group. It already holds a
17 per cent stake in Groupe Bull, the state-owned computer manufacturer.
Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company quoted in London,
confirmed that it has been discussing a possible industrial partnership with
Telecom in telecommunications. Sema is anxious to develop its
telecommunications interests, which at present represent only 7 per cent of
its Pounds 412.5m turnover.
Sema disclosed that France Telecom is also having discussions with Paribas,
the French bank which holds a 39.1 per cent stake in Sema. The discussions
could lead to Paribas's shareholding being transferred to a new holding
company, jointly held by the bank and France Telecom, in which Paribas would
be the majority shareholder. A decision is expected within a month.
Mr Michel Jalabert, a president of Cap-Gemini-Sogeti (CGS), the leading
European-owned computing services group, confirmed that it was also talking
to Telecom. CGS, he said, had enjoyed a close relationship with Telecom for
25 years but there was, as yet, no equity involvement. Mr Jalabert said the
two sets of talks were linked, but this was fiercely denied by Sema.
CGS holds a 29 per cent stake in Sema and cannot increase it beyond 30 per
cent without making a full bid under London Stock Exchange rules. A Sema
spokesperson said: 'We have an arms-length relationship with CGS and there
is no question of roundtable discussions.'
Another Sema shareholder, Schneider SA, with a 10.5 per cent stake, said it
wanted to reduce its investment but would not do so without the consent of
the Sema board.
At one level, the talks are being seen as a minor adjustment of
shareholdings, rather than a major reshuffle within the European computing
services industry. Telecommunications companies worldwide, however, are
seeking relationships with computing companies to broaden their service
offerings.

FT  08 JUL 92 / 3i sees rise in net asset values despite impact of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in Industry (3i), the UK's largest venture capital group that has
delayed its planned flotation, yesterday reported a small increase in net
asset values in spite of the impact of two years of recession.
Mr Ewan Macpherson, chief executive, said the performance of 3i, which
invests in about 4,000 small British companies, was linked with the economy
which was 'experiencing only patchy signs of economic recovery'.
However, net asset value per share - the most useful measure of the
performance of investment trusts - increased 3.2 per cent to Pounds 5.38 in
the year to March. Over the same period, the FT All Share Index fell 1.8 per
cent.
There was an improvement in economic confidence between the first and the
second half as measured by the size of investments. In the first six months
the group invested Pounds 141m while in the second it invested Pounds 283m.
Mr Macpherson said the trend had not been maintained this year. Last year's
average monthly investment had been about Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m, while
during the first three months of this financial year investment had fallen
to Pounds 35m-Pounds 40m.
As a result of the recession, the pre-tax revenue surplus fell from Pounds
55.99m to Pounds 40.08m on total revenue that fell from Pounds 263.12m to
Pounds 231.88m. The group is paying a increased dividend of 10.9p, up from
10.43p.
3i also took further steps to improve the understanding of the group among
investing institutions before flotation. Last month 3i and its chief
shareholders, the main UK clearing banks, postponed the flotation because of
the slowness of the economic recovery and the condition of the London stock
market.
'People know what 3i does,' said Mr Macpherson. 'What is not known is the
quality of 3i as an investment.'
As part of this campaign 3i has disclosed a changed valuation policy for the
investments in its portfolios after a review showed it was consistently
realising more on the disposals than the book values of its investments. The
group has reduced the discount it applies in valuing its non-quoted
investments. These two changes in accounting policy led to an increase in
net asset values of Pounds 32m. Total net assets rose from Pounds 1.22bn to
Pounds 1.27bn.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's annual report and accounts from 3i reads like the pathfinder
prospectus that never was. The flotation may wisely have been postponed
until next year, but by breaking down the main investments and disclosing
its valuation policy for the first time 3i is clearly signalling that the
roadshow has begun.
There is room to ponder the transformation from the mission-driven business
of the last 40 years to the more fully commercial organisation which 3i will
inevitably become. In particular, will the company's proven long-termism be
compatible with the demands of ordinary shareholders? Moreover, 3i should
not be allowed to get away with claiming the accounting moral high ground
just because competitors are less open. The allocation of half the
investment division's operating costs to an investment realisation reserve,
for instance, is primarily designed to secure a better yield. As for the
valuation issue, an admittedly very conservative policy is simply coming
into line with less conservative market thinking.
That said, the results underline the enormous strength of 3i's portfolio and
its dominant market position. When they do arrive, the shares will be well
worth buying on a discount to net assets at anything over 20 per cent.

Sterling has yet to breach its narrow band limit against the D-Mark, but it
was already below it against the Belgian Franc yesterday afternoon. It is
difficult to see how the authorities can respond if the market persists.
Intervention would do little in the face of disbelief that the chancellor
would follow Italy's example and raise interest rates. He may thus have no
choice but let sterling find its own level much closer to its wide band
floor. That was what happened before the election, but the government was
less reliant then on overseas funding of the PSBR. For now, the gilts market
may be underpinned by the fact the hedging cost in D-Marks is virtually
zero. How long that will last is another matter.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: National Grid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the UK regional electricity companies bounced back yesterday in
relief at the regulator's new price formula for National Grid. But while RPI
minus 3 is indeed more benign than the regime darkly rumoured in the market
last week, Offer's Professor Stephen Littlechild is hardly a soft touch.
Even with minus 3, the grid will only be able to achieve real earnings
growth provided it finds additional savings of 2 per cent on top of those
already identified. No doubt there is a bit more up its sleeve, but it is
worth remembering that half operating costs are outside its control.
The other issue is what the professor has in mind for the Recs come 1995.
National Grid's new formula implies a target rate of return of around 5.8
per cent on fixed assets, which compares starkly with the Recs' current
range of 8.5-9.0 per cent. The clear message is to enjoy the real dividend
increases while they last.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At yesterday's intra-day low of 208p, British Aerospace was down 45 per cent
in just six weeks. That seems overdone. Even after second thoughts pushed
the shares back up to 231p yesterday afternoon, the price scarcely reflects
the fundamentals.
BAe has long been vulnerable to negative speculation: witness last year's
exaggerated alarm about its cash position. Now it is under attack on three
fronts: worries about the European Fighter Aircraft; concern about its
loss-making regional jet business; and dividend uncertainty. EFA has the
highest profile but is arguably the least of these concerns. Even if the
project were scrapped BAe's profits would be unaffected until 1996 or 1997.
By contrast, the regional jet business is a running sore receiving urgent
attention from Mr John Cahill, BAe's new chairman. Closure would be an
expensive option with costs runovision for uncovered lease commitments
valued in the accounts at Pounds 348m. That would push the company into a
hefty loss this year. The chances of a full disposal are remote, but Mr
Cahill may yet clinch a joint venture. That would be less painful than
closure, but the immediate cash impact of a shut-down would be less serious
than it looks, since the leases could be unwound over a long period. A
separate sale of the corporate jet business could yield over Pounds 200m.
The prospect of a further loss in 1992 raises questions about the dividend,
but it is premature to regard the payout as doomed. Unlike BP's, BAe's
dividend costs a mere Pounds 105m. Halving it would shave only 2 percentage
points off gearing. And unlike British Steel, it can claim scope for
vigorous earnings recovery once the regional jet problem is out of the way.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Never mind the public
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's events in the UK new issue market suggest two things: that
retail interest in flotations is officially dead and that nobody minds very
much. On the one hand, the retail half of Anglian Group's offering was only
6 per cent taken up by the public. On the other, Taunton Cider was placed
and underwritten close to the price originally planned, suggesting that the
institutions accept there is no longer any point in cutting the price to
lure the public in.
It may be that the public is being perfectly rational here. The old-style
flotation, which fixed the price and then knocked 10 per cent off to get it
away, was grossly biased against the vendor. The new book-building method
aims at a true market price. But if the stags have grasped that, there seems
no point in offering half the issue to the public at all. The result is to
leave the public's half with the underwriters, so that the issue is labelled
a flop and suffers accordingly in the after-market. In fact, the
institutions may simply be underwriting stock as a means of getting a
discount on stock they want to hold anyway.
For public offerings to go out of fashion would have its ironic aspect. The
book-building process was introduced to the UK by the government as a means
of controlling the bribe offered to the public in privatisations. In
teaching the market how to price issues correctly, the government may have
dealt a blow to its own cause of wider share ownership.

<TEXT>
Sir, Re Samuel Brittan (July 2), it is not that worldwide public sector
deficits provide 'some cushion' to the recessionary impact of high savings.
Rather, it is those deficits which absorb high savings to keep interest
rates too high for an investment-led recovery to be possible.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Real interest rates and the exchange rate connection
(1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CALVERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's suggestion (Economic Viewpoint, July 2) that world
real interest rates remain stuck at about 4 per cent judging by the yield on
UK indexed bonds is incorrect because it ignores the effect of exchange
rates. The experience of floating exchange rates in the last 20 years
supports the theory that world real interest rates are not in fact equalised
by the markets, but can be higher (or lower) in one country if the exchange
rate is perceived to be overvalued (or undervalued). In effect,
international investors demand compensation for the exchange rate's expected
movement. Thus we can only deduce the level of 'world' real interest rates
from the yield on UK indexed gilts by guessing at how much the markets
believe the pound is overvalued.
The test of this theory will be if the US Treasury begins to offer
index-linked stock as is reportedly under consideration. If the US dollar is
currently around 10 per cent undervalued against the pound, then US
index-linked stock should yield around 3 per cent, allowing the
international investor to expect the same return on US Treasuries as on
gilts over a 10-year period given the likely exchange rate correction. (The
indexation element will cover any exchange rate moves due to any future
differential between US and UK inflation.)
This would imply that 'world' real interest rates are somewhere between 1
per cent and 4 per cent. My guess is that the markets may believe the pound
to be more than 10 per cent overvalued, which points to world real interest
rates being around 3 per cent. This would support Samuel Brittan's view, and
mine, that the world is not suffering any shortage of capital at present.

Sir, Your editorial, 'Directors' pay' (July 6), is right in seeking greater
disclosure of board remuneration information, including share option
benefits.
I hope that the National Association of Pension Funds proposals for share
option schemes ('Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans',
July 6) support your recommendations for volunteering further details on
share option schemes, but do not impose a view as to the 'correct' criteria.
It should be for companies, and their remuneration committees, to decide the
appropriate structure of the scheme, and to disclose it. It should be for
the 'markets' to make their judgments on that structure, and to act
accordingly.
More disclosure - yes; more regulation - no.

defending the wearing of wigs as being somehow beneficial to the proper

FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Surveys of business opinion seen as lacking
credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So the Institute of Directors has joined those whistling to keep their
courage up about the continuing recession ('Confidence firm, says IoD', July
6), but how much can we credit these surveys of business opinion? We all
remember the March Confederation of British Industry survey which declared
on the eve of the general election that recovery was round the corner.
Indeed, a story on the same page as the IoD story undermines its
credibility. Here, you report the Ernst &amp; Young Item forecasting group
envisaging 'a 0.6 per cent decline in output this year after a 2.4 per cent
fall last year'. A week ago Dun &amp; Bradstreet reported that company failures
in the first six months of this year rose to 30,722, 33 per cent up on the
same period in 1991. Are any of the managers of these companies questioned
about their 'confidence'?
Many members of this union who have lost their jobs this year treat these
management surveys with derision, and rightly so. They appear to be more
concerned with giving aid and comfort to a failed government rather than
reveal the truth about the economy.
If one can give any credence to the IoD survey, then the fact that
'confidence' has continued to fall among manufacturing and distribution
companies should ring the alarm bells. More jobs are going to be lost in
this vital sector in the months to come - and that is going to make it even
more difficult for Britain to emerge from recession through a manufacturing
industry sector recovery.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Dentists' fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEES earned by UK dentists for treating national health service (NHS)
patients today fall by seven per cent. In retaliation, the dentists have
voted for a partial withdrawal from NHS work. Unhappiness over the terms of
the current contract under which most dentists work has already started an
exodus from NHS dentistry in some areas. This now looks likely to spread.
The government says that the fee cuts are needed because dentists are
earning more than the target net income set by their pay review body.
Dentists have succeeded in signing up many more patients than anticipated
when setting the fees. However, the cuts send out an unfortunate signal
about the government's commitment to relating rewards to performance. And
given the value of preventive dentistry in improving dental health, it is
doubly unfortunate that the cuts are implemented on the same day as the
white paper on improving the nation's health is to be published.
Ministers' response to the gathering crisis has been to promise a
fundamental review of dentists' remuneration, a move which is long overdue.
It would examine criticisms that the current contract undervalues preventive
work. It should also look at regional differences in costs such as salaries,
rents and other overheads, so that dentists' income for NHS work bears some
relation to their expenses.
More radical options should also be explored. Some work currently available
free or subsidised on the NHS is mainly cosmetic, with little value in
health terms. And with most adults already paying 75 per cent of the cost of
NHS treatment, charging them the full cost should be explored to release
resources for improving incentives for dentists to sign up the 25m
unregistered people and offer them regular checks.
The sooner Mrs Bottomley gets her review under way the better for those who
rely on the NHS for dental treatment. Meanwhile, dentists should put their
threat of partial withdrawal from NHS work on hold until that review is
completed.

FT  08 JUL 92 / A thirst for expansion: Nestle is awaiting Brussels'
decision on its takeover of Perrier, which is crucial to its growth strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From their headquarters in the Swiss lakeside town of Vevey, managers of
Nestle, the world's largest food company, look out on a placid
picture-postcard view disturbed only by the passing of an occasional paddle
steamer. But inside the building, the atmosphere is tense with anticipation.
In the next month, the European Commission will decide whether Nestle may
complete its FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) takeover of Perrier, the French
mineral water group acquired after a hard-fought battle with the Italian
Agnelli family.
The decision is central to Nestle's plans to become at a stroke the world's
leading mineral water supplier - it is already the biggest producer of dairy
products, chocolate and soluble coffee - and to its ambitions to raise
profitability to new levels in the 1990s.
'We feel we must break out of this limitation which has seemed like a sound
barrier in the food industry - the idea that a 5 per cent net margin on
sales is really very good,' says Mr Reto Dominiconi, finance director and
chief architect of the Perrier deal. He thinks 6 per cent is achievable.
Perrier, whose profits have been depressed since a benzene scare two years
ago, could fit the bill nicely. Industry analysts estimate that, by
rationalising Perrier and beefing up its marketing, Nestle could earn
operating margins of 20 per cent on mineral water, twice the return on its
existing businesses.
However, Brussels says the deal could give Nestle and BSN, France's largest
food company, a duopoly of the French mineral water market. This is the
first time EC merger watchdogs have objected to a deal on duopoly grounds,
and Nestle - which is counting on takeovers to fuel much of its growth -
fears the case will set a restrictive precedent. Says Mr Domeniconi: 'If
they upheld the duopoly position, it would be a very major hurdle to many
future acquisitions,' particularly hostile ones.
Whatever the outcome of the case, Nestle will remain determined to pursue
worldwide expansion by any route it can. Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, says
he sees more growth opportunities in food than at any time in his career. By
2000 he aims to double last year's sales of SFr50.5bn (Pounds 19.3bn), the
sixth largest of any publicly quoted European company.
Since the German-born Mr Maucher became chief executive in 1981, he has
transformed Nestle from a sluggish and sprawling multinational into an
aggressive global player by injecting a more decisive management style,
impatience for results and a streak of shrewd opportunism.
Long a highly acquisitive company, Nestle spent about SFr20bn in the 1980s
on takeovers, notably of Carnation in the US and Rowntree in Britain. In the
past five years, it has invested on average SFr2bn annually to restructure
operations in the US and Europe and expand in Asia, Africa and the Middle
East.
These moves are now paying off. In the US, Nestle increased sales last year
by 5 per cent in a stagnant grocery market, while its European operations,
some of which lost money in the 1980s, all traded profitably. Rowntree has
flourished, increasing profits and market share.
Though traditionally averse to alliances, the Swiss company recently formed
two important joint ventures. One, with General Mills of the US, is
challenging Kellogg's worldwide leadership in breakfast cereals, and the
other, with Coca-Cola, is in canned coffee and tea.
In the past year, Nestle has radically reshaped its management structure by
grouping activities into strategic business units, which marry geographic
and product responsibilities. The aims are faster decisions, more coherent
strategy and improved co-ordination of the company's far-flung operations in
more than 100 countries.
Next year, Mr Ramon Masip, Spanish head of Nestle's European operations,
will become chief operating officer, freeing the 64-year-old Mr Maucher to
focus more on broad strategy. Mr Maucher, who enjoys personal authority rare
in a company of Nestle's size, is already scouting for fresh acquisitions,
particularly in the US, where he believes the takeover market may be
livelier than in Europe.
Nestle's horizons are not limited to food and drink. In the 1970s, pessimism
about food manufacturing led it to buy Alcon, a US pharmaceuticals company,
and to acquire indirectly 27 per cent of l'Oreal of France, the world's
biggest cosmetics manufacturer. An agreement gives Nestle first refusal on
the rest of L'Oreal after the death of Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, the French
company's largest shareholder.
The agreement expires in 1994, and Nestle's exercise of its pre-emptive
rights would require French government approval. But Mr Maucher already
talks openly of eventually taking full control.
Although Nestle claims it can find 'synergies' with Alcon and L'Oreal, Mr
Maucher admits these investments stem as much from financial as industrial
logic: 'Nestle could live without L'Oreal. It was a fantastic investment . .
. why not have a second big egg in a company basket?'
He also insists that Nestle's dominant business will remain food
manufacturing, and is focusing much attention on developing countries, where
he expects future growth to outstrip the mature industrialised markets which
provide four-fifths of Nestle's sales.
Nestle's role in the third world remains a touchy issue. It has operated
there since late last century, and its manufacturing and distribution
network is rivalled only by Unilever. But the Swiss company is still haunted
by a controversy from the 1970s, when it was accused of promoting baby food
sales by urging mothers to abandon breast-feeding.
Nonetheless, it believes economic reform and free-market policies have
lessened developing countries' hostility to multinationals - and its drive
to capture new markets there is moving into high gear.
In Latin America, it plans to spend SFr2bn this decade after freezing new
investment in the 1980s. It recently entered the ice-cream market in China,
where it is also negotiating several other ventures, and is building a
network of plants in south-east Asian countries which have agreed to cut
tariffs on its products by 90 per cent.
At Mr Maucher's insistence, the company is developing a range of 'popularly
positioned products' (PPP) which it can produce cheaply in developing
countries using local raw materials such as soya. The project will test the
success of a recent shake-up of Nestle's research operations. Although these
are among the biggest in the food industry, the company has long been
accused of being slow to innovate. Some critics argue that its last real
world-beater was soluble coffee in 1938.
Executives respond that continuous updating and adaptation of existing
products pays bigger dividends than searching for blockbuster breakthroughs.
However, they also admit that house-cleaning was long overdue at its
research laboratories, which had lost touch with the needs of the business.
But for all its confident expansionism, Nestle's future growth will depend
heavily on maintaining the success of established businesses such as
Nescafe. Here, it faces three main challenges:
Coffee supplies: although Nestle has benefited from the steep fall in world
prices, it is increasingly concerned that production cuts will trigger a
sharp price rebound. It is lobbying, so far with little success, for a new
international coffee agreement which would stabilise prices.
The rise of retailer power: Nestle fears its formidable marketing clout is
being eroded as the European grocery trade concentrates into fewer big
supermarket groups, which increasingly promote their 'private-label'
products in competition with those of branded manufacturers.
Mr Peter Brabeck, Nestle's chief marketing strategist, says the product
range it sells through large supermarkets is narrowing as they tighten the
screw on manufacturer brands. The squeeze, he says, has been made worse by a
decline in the effectiveness of mass-media advertising, traditionally the
branded manufacturers' main means of communicating with consumers.
Mr Brabeck plans to experiment with new distribution channels and marketing
methods, such as buyers' clubs and loyalty bonuses. But some colleagues
think action by EC competition authorities may be the only long-term check
on retailers' growing power.
Uneven margins: Nestle earns huge profits and cash from chocolate and
soluble coffee. But margins are far less impressive on products such as pet
food, yoghurt and ice cream, where Nestle is either not dominant or competes
in highly fragmented markets. Mr Maucher says it is hard to find new
products which can match Nescafe's profitability.
Mr Domeniconi concedes that weaker operations may eventually have to be
eliminated or strengthened through acquisition. But Mr Masip says the
company can afford to carry them for some time, although he declines to say
which are considered 'strategic' long-term businesses: 'I don't think we
have a very clear idea ourselves, because this is a moving target.'
With annual cash flow of more than SFr4bn and a triple-A credit rating,
Nestle has ample resources for further takeovers. Indeed, it has sometimes
been accused of buying its way out of mistakes by making high-priced
acquisitions, such as the Pounds 2.6bn takeover of Rowntree in 1988,
launched after the Swiss company had allowed its own share of the UK
chocolate market to slide.
Nestle has long relied on issuing equity to fund takeovers and investment,
which has kept its balance sheet strong but limited earnings growth. Now it
aims to limit cash calls in an effort to boost its price/earnings ratio, so
it can use its shares to pay for takeovers without diluting earnings.
More than half of Nestle's shares are owned by foreign investors, whom it
has diligently courted since the late 1980s by liberalising its share
register and disclosing more information. However, voting-right restrictions
still protect it against takeover.
But in opening up to foreign investors, is Nestle not worried about falling
prey to the short-term preoccupations of Anglo-Saxon institutions? Mr
Maucher sounds unperturbed.
'I think a lot of those investors will have a portfolio of solid growth
security in Nestle shares, and a portfolio of more speculative shares,' he
says. 'They cannot keep everything in one basket.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To London music-lovers Cheryl Studer is known as the face that launches a
thousand record covers. The few live appearances she has made here have told
us relatively little about her. In Wagner's Lohengrin or as the gleaming top
soprano in Mahler's Eighth Symphony, it has been Studer first and foremost
as a remarkable voice who has left audiences wanting more.
The recordings have given us more - operatic roles many and various. Those
are still eagerly awaited at Covent Garden and there seems to be no sign of
them as yet. But, as a substantial makeweight, Studer appeared in recital at
the Royal Opera House on Friday with Wagner and Strauss dominant in her
programme, on the face of it a sensible choice.
Unfortunately there was disappointment in store. The opening Schubert group
may have been largely an opportunity to warm up, but it introduced irritants
which were to settle in for the evening. The pitch tended to sag in the
middle of the voice. The singing bumped along the consonants. Nor was there
a lot of spontaneity at this stage in her partnership with Irwin Gage, who
was laying bare the inner workings of Schubert's piano parts with cool
precision.
To my ears, this was the work of a singer who was trying so hard to do the
right things that any natural sense of musicality was being pretty
thoroughly smothered. One sensed Studer needing to break free from such
small scale works and to some extent she succeeded in doing so in Wagner's
Wesendonk Lieder, although even there the voice was asking for an orchestral
accompaniment if it was to sound at its best.
The second half, in which she sang Richard Strauss, remained mixed. Slow
songs continued to stagnate; but when speed or muscular strength was called
for, as in 'Standchen' or 'Zueignung', the singing took off with the help of
Gage's exemplary playing, and Studer's potential as an interpreter of songs
could at last be glimpsed. The audience response was enthusiastic. Warm
enough, I hope, to encourage her to return in the operatic roles we all long
to hear.
* By chance, Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder turned up again three days later,
when Anne-Marie Owens gave a recital at St. John's, Smith Square. This was
an altogether less problematical performance, in which the music flowed
easily. This mezzo does not pose difficulties of style for herself and the
general amplitude and romantic warmth of the songs were well sustained, even
if there is rather more depth in them than she finds.
In the past year or two at this hall, Malcolm Martineau has come to judge
the acoustics to a nicety and he gave his singer accompaniments with plenty
of atmosphere. A Schumann group might have shown a more detailed grasp of
the words; the Debussy songs and her Spanish selection settled into a
warm-hearted, easy-going mood a little too often. All through, however, one
felt musicianship naturally at work, singer and song in harmony together.

FT  08 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: No Mareva for premature claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZUCKER AND OTHERS v TYNDALL HOLDINGS PLC Court of Appeal (Lord Justice
Dillon, Lord Justice Neill and Lord Justice Staughton): May 7 1992
THE COURT has no jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction in respect of a
premature claim for specific performance of a contract which has not been
breached and is not threatened by prospective breach.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff
appellants, Mr Willard Zucker, three members of his family and Mr Phillipe
Grossglauser, from Mr Justice Morland's order discharging a Mareva
injunction obtained by them against the defendant, Tyndall Holdings plc, in
proceedings for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of shares.
LORD JUSTICE NEILL said that by an agreement dated June 2 1989 the
appellants were allotted 25 per cent of the shares in a Swiss company called
Tyndall Trust. The other 75 per cent were allotted to Tyndall International
Holdings, a Bermuda company which was a wholly owned subsidiary of an
English company, Tyndall Holdings.
The parties to the agreement were the appellants, Tyndall Holdings and
Tyndall International.
At the time of the agreement Tyndall Trust's share capital was increased.
The purpose of the agreement was to enable Mr Zucker and his companies to
join forces with the Tyndall Group, and to enable Tyndall Group headed by
Tyndall Holdings to obtain access to the Swiss market and to have the
benefit of the services of Mr Zucker and Mr Grossglauser.
It was a term of the agreement that if control of Tyndall Trust should ever
pass out of the hands of Tyndall International the appellants would be
entitled to exercise a put option to sell their shares.
Article 4 of the agreement defined a 'put option' as the right of minority
shareholders to sell the shares at a defined price. It provided that if on
or before June 30 1992 Tyndall International, without the appellants'
consent, disposed of a controlling interest in Tyndall Trust shares, then
the appellants would have a right to exercise their put option against
Tyndall International 'at any time after such event, but no later than
September 30 1992'.
The put option could be exercised by any or all of the appellants by sending
a letter to Tyndall International.
The agreement was governed by Swiss law and disputes were to be submitted to
the non-exclusive competence of Geneva courts.
In September 1991 Tyndall Holdings was taken over by another company. That
had not been anticipated by the appellants. One of the effects was that
Tyndall Holdings shares were no longer going to be listed on the stock
exchange.
On March 23 1992 the appellants exercised the put option and sent their
share certificates to Tyndall International. It was accepted that if there
was a valid exercise of the option the three months period for issue of the
shares would expire on June 24 1992.
On March 25 the appellants began proceedings in Geneva, claiming a
declaration that they had validly exercised their right to 'put' the shares,
and an order that Holdings and International should pay them SFr6m with
interest from June 24.
On March 30 the writ was issued in the present proceedings claiming specific
performance of the agreement for sale of the shares constituted by notice of
exercise of the option. On that day the appellants obtained an ex parte
Mareva order.
The question was whether the court had any jurisdiction to grant a Mareva
injunction in the circumstances.
On April 6 Mr Justice Morland concluded that the nature of the specific
performance action was such that any order obtainable until or before June
24 1992 would be merely declaratory. He concluded that the court had no
jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction.
The appeal arose from that decision. It was directed solely to the question
of jurisdiction.
Section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 provided that the High Court might
grant an injunction 'in all cases in which it appears to the court to be
just and convenient to do so'.
Those words were very wide indeed, but the power conferred by them had been
'circumscribed by judicial authority dating back for many years' (South
Carolina (1987) AC 24,40).
In the Siskina (1979) AC 210,256 Lord Diplock said the power to grant an
interlocutory injunction could only be exercised 'in protection or assertion
of some legal or equitable right which it has jurisdiction to enforce by
final judgment'.
He said a right to obtain an interlocutory injunction was dependent on there
being a pre-existing cause of action against the defendant 'arising out of
an invasion, actual or threatened by him, of a legal or equitable right of
the plaintiff for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the
jurisdiction of the court'.
The principle laid down in Siskina had been applied in a large number of
more recent cases. In Siporex (1986) 2 Lloyd's Rep 428 Mr Justice Bingham
said it was clear law that 'a Mareva injunction will not be granted to an
applicant who has no cause of action at the time of application'.
That sentence was cited with approval by Lord Justice Beldam in Veracruz
Transportation (FT, November 19 1991).
One had to consider what was meant by 'cause of action' in the present
context. A Mareva injunction could not be granted unless there was an
existing cause of action which could be immediately enforced.
In the present case there had been no failure to pay the SFr6m.
The attitude taken by Tyndall Holdings was that the circumstances which
would give rise to the valid exercise of the put option had not arisen. But
it was not suggested that there had been any failure to pay the money at
this stage when June 24 was still weeks away and there had been no
repudiatory breach.
The appellants had the right to be paid but there had been no invasion or
interference of that right.
As the law stood at present, for the purpose of a Mareva injunction it was
necessary to demonstrate that a legal or equitable right had been interfered
with or invaded, or such an invasion or interference was threatened - though
interlocutory relief could be obtained in certain circumstances to protect
an equitable interest even before the time for performance under a contract
had arisen.
On the facts of the case it was not open to the court to grant an
injunction. It had no jurisdiction to do so.
The appeal was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON agreeing, said the question
was not whether the appellants had a cause of action, but whether they had a
cause of action arising out of the invasion, actual or threatened of a legal
or equitable right.
It appeared from Veracruz (FT, November 19 1991), the Steamship Mutual case
(FT, June 19 1992), Niedersachsen (1983) 2 Lloyd's Rep 600 and Siporex
(1986) 2 Lloyd's Rep 428 that it did not cover a threat to break a contract
which was not presently performable.
In the present case there had been no actual breach, and no threat to break
a term which was presently performable.
LORD JUSTICE DILLON also agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction, said a Mareva could only be granted by the English
court in support of a cause of action which the English court had
jurisdiction to entertain.
The appellants sought to establish in the Swiss courts that they were
entitled not to shares but to a money payment being the value of the shares.
The Mareva relief was sought in aid of that claim. But the court's
jurisdiction to award the money payment depended on Swiss law and Swiss
courts, and the English court had no jurisdiction to award it, nor was it
asked to.
Mareva relief in aid of the claim for the money payment must be premature
until the Swiss court had made its determination. The application was
premature.
For the appellants: Martin Mann QC and Michael Gadd (Jay Benning &amp; Levine).
For Tyndall Holdings: John Thomas QC and David Foxton (Turner Kenneth
Brown).

FT  08 JUL 92 / People: Top teams at PW and Ernst &amp; Young
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Hughes (left) plans to help stitch Price Waterhouse, the accountancy
firm, into a 'seamless' international practice in his new role as world
managing partner.
Hughes, 54, is the first incumbent of the position, created at the same time
as Sir Jeffery Bowman and Shaun O'Malley, both 57, were appointed joint
chairmen of PW World Firm.
Hughes was managing partner of PW in the UK during the second half of the
1980s, joint managing partner of PW in Europe from 1989-91 and then deputy
chairman there from 1991-92.
Sir Jeffery and O'Malley were joint chief executive officers of PW world
organisation for the past two years. They will now concentrate on supporting
Hughes in his new management role.
Hughes told his partners this week that his role is to develop PW's
worldwide objectives and further develop its international network. 'We must
maintain and strengthen the co-operative efforts across firm and industry
lines to provide clients with a truly seamless service,' he says.
Meanwhile, at Ernst &amp; Young a new team has moved into the top jobs as their
mentor departs the UK for responsibilities in Europe.
Harold Cottam, 54, who was responsible for bringing in a youthful management
team in the early 1980s, is stepping aside as managing partner to take
charge of building the firm's pan-European consulting business.
Elwyn Eilledge has been re-elected as senior partner for a second three-year
term, and has announced a new team, mostly in their mid to late 40s, moving
up one place from their previous jobs.
The new UK managing partner - who takes charge of day-to-day administration
within the firm - is Nick Land (right), formerly managing partner of the
London office.
Michael Boyd, former head of the audit practice and energy and natural
resources group, becomes London office managing partner in his place.
Land says: 'The marketplace is pretty murderous and the profession is not
entirely flavour of the month. But we are internally in a strong position to
meet these challenges. Operationally we are in good shape. We can say the
merger (of Ernst &amp; Whinney with Arthur Young) is truly behind us.'
The firm has no great ambition to be the largest in the UK, he says, but
wants to focus at the top end of the market. He will be placing particular
emphasis on developing the tax and management consulting practice areas.
*****
Peter Kingston, ENTERPRISE OIL's managing director (technical), has resigned
from the board in order to set up his own management consultancy.
Kingston, 49, a petroleum engineer who first made his mark in Shell UK's
North Sea development, was a consultant before joining Enterprise in 1984.
He will continue to work for Enterprise as a consultant, with particular
emphasis on the further development of Enterprise's business in Italy and
Norway. His board responsibilities have been reassigned to Iain Watt as
technical director (UK operations) and Edward Harris, technical director
(international).
*****
N BROWN, the Manchester-based home shopping group which specialises in
serving niche markets that few other companies think about, has appointed
Martyn Pass as managing director of its Langley House subsidiary.
Langley House sells a wierd and wonderful range of products through
advertisements in national newspapers. Its diverse products include ladies'
fashion wigs, cast-iron garden rocking chairs and mini-size camera clamps.
Pass, 42, has worked at N Brown for the past decade but gained his marketing
knowledge at GUS, the mother of mail order companies. He then worked at
Plumbs Mail Order, a stretch-cover company, before joining N Brown.
*****
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) has
appointed two new deputy chairman, in place of Nick Durlacher who was
elected chairman of the exchange earlier this year.
David Heron and Jack Wigglesworth represent the two different sides of
Liffe's business, which is split between equity derivatives and interest
rate products. Durlacher says there is 'merit in having a balance between
the exchange's equity and interest rate businesses' - represented
respectively by Heron and Wigglesworth.
Heron, a director of James Capel, was previously on the board of the London
Traded Options Market, which merged with Liffe earlier this year, while Jack
Wigglesworth, business development director at JP Morgan Futures, has served
on the Liffe board since 1982.
*****
Ken Scobie, deputy chairman and chief executive of BRENT WALKER, is to take
over as chairman of its William Hill subsidiary on the retirement of Lord
Kindersley.
*****
Joe Goasdoue has been appointed director, quality and corporate affairs at
ICL; already director, quality, he takes on the increased responsibility
from Aodh O'Dochartaigh who has been appointed director of group
communications at BASS.
*****
Lawrence Post has been appointed company secretary of WACE GROUP on the
retirement of Scott Ritchie.
*****
Jeremy Campbell, formerly director of human resources at Rothmans
International, has been appointed company secretary and solicitor of EAST
MIDLANDS ELECTRICITY on the retirement of Derek Wells.
*****
David Carrick, group finance director, has been appointed md of ABI LEISURE
GROUP; he succeeds David Eastwood who is to become a non-executive director.
Rob Carmichael is promoted to finance director of ABI Caravans.
*****
John Neerhout (above), who is on secondment from Bechtel as project chief
executive, has been appointed to the board of EUROTUNNEL.
*****
Kees Bokmans, previously global business director of ICI Films, has been
appointed md of the polymer products division of EVODE.
*****
David Jackson, general manager airline services, is now the senior
representative of AER LINGUS in Britain.
*****
Tony Reid, formerly president and md of Continental Netherlands Oil Company,
has been appointed director and general manager, business development, of
CONOCO (UK); he replaces Ian Gray who has been appointed president of the
Dubai Petroleum Company.
*****
John Maples, the former Conservative minister and new chairman of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Government Communications Worldwide, has added another directorship
to his portfolio. He has gone back on to the board of SEP Industrial
Holdings, the small USM-quoted engineering company, where he had been a
director until he was made economic secretary to the Treasury in July 1990.
The 49-year-old Maples, who owns 2.89 per cent of SEP's equity, rejoins the
company at a low point in its fortunes. When he resigned two years ago it
had just reported half-yearly profits of Pounds 1.2m and increased its
dividend by 10 per cent. By contrast, in the year to September 1991 the
company's profits fell sharply and the dividend was cut, although yesterday
it reported a modest recovery in half year profits and raised its dividend
again. SEP has also put John Davis, managing director of its UK distribution
division, on the board.

 -Part Three, Charles Leadbeater looks at the group's joint ventures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Six days into the new year of 1989, the relaxed calm of a Friday afternoon
at General Electric Company's headquarters was shattered by bad tidings from
the City.
A plot was afoot to assemble an international consortium called Metsun; its
purpose to dismember GEC, the company which Lord Weinstock had spent almost
30 years building up.
This was his most perilous time at the helm of GEC. The company's future
hung in the balance and he knew that if the Metsun bid succeeded, GEC's
dismembered parts would be carried off by a hungry pack of international
competitors.
He also knew that to see off the threat GEC needed to take some fateful
decisions itself. In three months of hectic negotiations that winter GEC
formed three vital joint ventures. The alliances were not solely a response
to the threat of takeover but the combined effect was that GEC conceded
shared sovereignty over large parts of its business.
These alliances now generate about a third of GEC's Pounds 9.4bn turnover
and 43 per cent of its operating profits. If they were to unravel GEC could
be cut off from its paths to international growth.
The roots of the drama lay in 1986 when GEC made its initial bid for its
close rival, Plessey. GEC wanted to combine their businesses, making
telecommunications equipment and defence electronics. The aim was to
rationalise the British electronics industry in the way it had the
electrical industry more than 20 years before.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission rejected GEC's bid because it feared
competition in defence markets would be eroded. But GEC remained under
pressure to expand by acquisition. The City was breathing down Lord
Weinstock's neck, keen he should spend the Pounds 1bn cash mountain the
group had accumulated.
Lord Weinstock's way around monopolies obstacle was to bring in Siemens. The
German company would help to provide GEC and Plessey's telecommunications
businesses with the scale they desperately needed. Siemens would buy some of
Plessey's defence activities to alleviate the Ministry of Defence's concern
over GEC's growing monopoly in defence electronics.
This revived interest in Plessey, however, rebounded upon GEC. Its record
was subjected to unrelenting public scrutiny and Plessey came out fighting.
It became a prime mover in Metsun. The consortium was orchestrated by
Lazards, the merchant bank, fronted by Sir John Cuckney, then chairman of
Westland, and backed by Barclays Bank. And even more menacingly this
grouping tried to entice General Electric and AT&amp;T of the US to join a bid.
The threat was great. But before Metsun could take shape Lord Weinstock
announced his second major European joint-venture, a wide-ranging deal with
Alsthom of France to create an engineering business with turnover of about
Pounds 5bn.
The deal was finalised at Lord Weinstock's country house in Wiltshire. A few
days later, when the venture was announced, Metsun broke cover. Lord
Weinstock knew he must then move swiftly to head off the threat of a bid. It
took him just a week to break up the consortium.
He started secret talks with Mr Jack Welch, General Electric's chairman, and
lured the US group away from Metsun.
He and Mr Welch agreed a joint-venture in consumer appliances, while GEC
promised to pull out of the European medical electronics market to give GE a
clearer run. The US group was also brought into the alliance with Alsthom,
supplying gas turbine technology.
That agreement sounded the death knell for Metsun, and four months later the
monopolies commission cleared the joint bid for Plessey.
Now the ring of joint ventures makes it extremely unlikely that GEC will
ever be broken up: most of the companies which once might have launched a
bid are signed up as the group's allies.
GEC executives discount the risk that the partners - Siemens, Alsthom and GE
 -might club together to carve up their partner. 'They dislike one another
more than they dislike us,' says one.
But how much might GEC eventually have to pay for the construction of this
Maginot line of joint ventures? Has the group warded off a break up bid only
to risk allowing the company to dissolve gently as it loses control to
partners who have stronger management, international market positions or
technology?
These ventures have opened up avenues for GEC to expand internationally,
particularly into continental Europe where it was weak and where
opportunities for large acquisitions were virtually non-existent.
However, they could also be a disguise for its lack of international scale
and competitiveness in industries such as telecommunications. Indeed, has
GEC been forced to look for partners because it lacks the resources to
succeed internationally on its own?
The three ventures are quite different in their aims, the way they work and
what they could mean for GEC's future:
Mr Bruce Enders' bright red Lotus Elan sports car sticks out like a sore
thumb in the drab corporate car park at the Hotpoint refrigerator factory in
Peterborough. The American managing director of GEC's consumer appliances
partnership with GE explains: 'I decided to get a British sports car because
I did not want to stir up any union trouble.'
He is shaking up Hotpoint and Creda, GEC's consumer goods companies which
make refrigerators, cookers and washing machines. Surprisingly little was
done to rationalise Hotpoint and Creda's overlapping activities when they
were solely-owned by GEC. Obvious opportunities to cut costs were not taken.
Now change has been forced upon Hotpoint by the UK recession and the
alliance with GE is also driving reform.
Mr Enders, who used to work for GE in the US, has brought in total quality
programmes. The legions of suppliers are being pruned and products are being
redesigned to make them cheaper to manufacture. At least two of the group's
five factories will be closed this year.
For GEC the partnership has brought access to the US group's research on new
products. For GE the UK has become a further outlet for US-made components.
Hotpoint's future is clear: it fits neatly into GE's worldwide strategy for
consumer appliances. This is the latest in a string of consumer appliance
joint-ventures which GE has formed around the hub of its large US
businesses. As yet there are very few GE components in a Hotpoint washing
machine or refrigerator. But the number will grow and Hotpoint will
gradually become more entwined with its US partner.
GE sees no need to buy the company to secure that relationship. The alliance
serves its purpose for both companies. Their ambitions are strictly limited
to consumer products. Initial plans that it should be the starting point for
a much larger European business have been quietly shelved.
GEC-Alsthom is a different kettle of fish altogether. It is by far the most
impressive venture, based upon the best Britain and France can offer in
making heavy equipment such as generators and turbines for power stations,
locomotives and rolling stock for railways.
The venture was not a response to the threat of takeover. World demand for
power stations fell precipitously in the 1980s. That created huge
overcapacity, which forced all producers to cut costs. In 1988 Asea of
Sweden and Brown Boveri of Switzerland led the way by merging to create an
integrated pan-European business. GEC and Alsthom realised they had to
respond or the ABB giant might stride ahead.
This was compounded by problems GEC and Alsthom had in their own countries.
In the UK electricity privatisation created demand for power stations driven
by gas turbines. GEC does not make gas turbines for power stations.
As Mr Mike Barrett, now in charge of GEC-Alsthom's steam turbine division
puts it: 'We had to find a partner who could make gas turbines to get a
share of the market. We could have been in desperate straits otherwise.'
GE of the US which has the best gas turbine technology, has made it
available to Alsthom through an intimate relationship forged over two
decades. Alsthom's access to GE's technology made it a natural partner for
GEC.
Alsthom, the engineering arm of Alcatel-Alsthom, was already conducting its
own search for a partner because the French nuclear programme, which had
sustained it for years, was in decline.
It got close to a deal with Siemens, but pulled out because the Germans
wanted control. The French then found there was a very good fit with GEC,
the only serious overlap being in manufacturing capacity for steam turbines,
and the deal was done.
The venture got off to a rocky start. A clutch of UK orders for coal-fired
power stations, which had filled GEC's order book, were suddenly cancelled.
The first gas turbine orders in the UK went to competitors such as Siemens.
But GEC-Alsthom has overcome these teething problems.
Its order book has grown to Ecu14.5bn (Pounds 10bn), compared with Ecu10bn
(Pounds 7bn) three years ago. It is the leading UK supplier of power station
gas turbines and has just won an important order in Holland to build one of
the largest combined-cycle gas turbine station in the world.
The venture's pre-tax profits have risen from Ecu346m in 1989-90 to about
Ecu440m this year as its profit margins have widened from 4.4 per cent to
5.3 per cent.
Managers on both sides of the channel are fired by a sense of dynamism. Red
brick factories in France and Britain which have made power equipment since
the 19th century are being modernised.
According to Mr Kelvin Bray, chief executive of European Gas Turbines, the
venture's gas turbine arm, who has worked for GEC for almost 30 years: 'It
has given us momentum, size and reputation.'
From GEC-Alsthom's large plant in the fortress town of Belfort in northern
France, Mr Claude Descroix, the genial plant manager, a veteran of the
Concorde project, offers another explanation: 'We need a counterweight
against German influence in Europe, politically and industrially. That is
why this must work.'
British and French managers mix in a relaxed fashion. French engineers are
more theoretical than the British, who tend to be more pragmatic in finding
solutions to problems. The British tolerate the French managers' love of
long-term strategic thinking, while the French tolerate British
commercialism. GEC's financial controls were introduced six months after the
merger. Alsthom's managers used to make general financial reports once every
six months. Now they make much more detailed reports once a month.
This financial rigour has already started to bear fruit. Mr Pierre Bilger,
GEC-Alsthom's chief executive, says: 'Lord Weinstock has shown us how to use
a financial system to understand a business. In France we have frequently
felt it was negative and destructive to reduce the business to figures. Lord
Weinstock has shown us how to put flesh on the figures.'
The British managers have a spring in their step. Mr Jim Cronin,
GEC-Alsthom's finance director says they have been quick to pledge their
loyalty to the venture: 'GEC had no corporate identity abroad. They have
that for the first time with GEC-Alsthom.'
There are, however, two potential sources of tension in this close
relationship.
The first is the strength of French management. Some at GEC believe the
French are quietly taking over by stealth. Most of the top jobs are filled
by French executives. The most plausible explanation for this is the sheer
quality of French management and their greater facility with language - Mr
Bilger learnt English in six months, most English managers are still
struggling with the basics of French.
The second factor is the two companies' different characters which stem from
serving very different customers. Alsthom was fed by France's commitment to
nuclear power. GEC invested heavily in nuclear power for little return
before electricity privatisation threw the UK nuclear programme into
disarray. Alsthom's strength in railway locomotives reflects the French
government's 20-year-old commitment to the TGV high-speed train. The French
are bemused by the British government's equivocation over investment in
rail.
Last month GEC-Alsthom won orders worth Pounds 509m from European railway
companies for 27 high-speed trains, beating off competition from Siemens. In
contrast British Rail this spring placed a Pounds 140m order for commuter
trains with Brel, an affiliate of ABB, casting a dark shadow over the future
of GEC's train making operations.
The strength of Alsthom's base may tip the balance of power to the French.
But it seems unlikely that the merger will break up or unravel. Lord
Weinstock describes it as rock solid. And Mr Bilger says: 'This merger is
dictated by common interests. The factors which brought us together are not
going to disappear.'
GEC-Alsthom is the extension to continental Europe of GEC's main achievement
in the UK, the rationalisation of traditional heavy engineering. GEC is
confident on this familiar terrain.
The same cannot be said of the other major joint-venture, the alliance with
Siemens.
The troubled history of Britain's telecommunications industry cartel still
haunts this venture: GPT, which is 40 per cent owned by Siemens and 60 per
cent by GEC.
When Mr Karl Heinz Kaske, Siemens' chairman, and Lord Weinstock planned the
Plessey takeover they envisaged it would be the foundation for an alliance
encompassing telecommunications, defence electronics and research
activities.
Those plans came to nought because of the US Department of Defense's
objections to Siemens' ownership of US defence companies. This forced the
two partners to redraw their plans for defence electronics.
And once the Plessey bid succeeded it did not take long for the two
companies to find they had very different approaches to business. Most of
Siemens' research is centralised. At GEC it is decentralised. Siemens has a
hierarchical management structure. GEC is highly informal.
Mr Tony Cobbe, managing director of GPT's telecommunication systems
division, has no doubts about the importance of the partnership with
Siemens. He says: 'Without it we could not afford to be involved in the next
generation of big digital telecommunications switches. With this partnership
we should be in the top five in the At the GPT factory on the outskirts of
Liverpool, Mr Peter Gershon, the squat, energetic managing director brought
in from the computer industry about two years ago, is unsparing in his
account of the problems faced.
GPT's traditional business, supplying System X, the main digital switch used
by British Telecommunications, is in decline and that threatens to open a
gaping hole in the company's finances, unless it can generate additional
income from new products such as video conferencing and mobile telephones.
Success in these markets will require a revolution in manufacturing and
marketing approach.
Mr Gershon is leading a ruthless clear out of the company's old management
and ideas. Only one member of the GPT board is left from 18 months ago. The
workforce has been cut by about 20 per cent to 16,000 and the introduction
of some tighter financial disciplines this year has turned GPT into one of
the main sources of the Pounds 350m growth in GEC's cash reserves to Pounds
876m. But the aim is not just to cut costs; it is also to push GPT in a new
direction.
This change is being forced upon it as the UK telecommunications market is
opened up to competition.
Thus a financial fence has been erected around GPT's traditional business of
supplying BT, to prevent it consuming the resources, technology and
management which GPT's new businesses need to generate growth. Before, all
the businesses used to carry some of the burden of the large overheads for
the System X work. As a result many of the smaller businesses could not make
the kind of returns needed to survive. Now they only have to cover their own
overheads and this has reduced the financial burden upon them.
The new businesses come in two varieties. First, a range of new products,
such as sophisticated public pay phone systems, video conferencing and
mobile telephones is being developed. Second, the company is trying to turn
itself into a telecommunications software house.
Computer software is becoming increasingly important in telephone systems,
to integrate switches, exchanges and handsets. GPT wants to provide the
software for Siemens' hardware. Mr Steve Harbour, GPT's marketing director
says: 'We are ahead of Siemens in this area because the liberalisation of
the British telecommunications market has forced us to examine what
customers want.'
Back at head office, senior GEC executives believe the relationship with
Siemens is stable. Lengthy negotiations over Vision One, the Dollars 2bn
joint research programme to develop the next generation of large switches
and mobile telephones have settled the most difficult question: how much
each company would put into research.
However, many within GEC harbour doubts about the alliance's prospects. A
senior GEC non-executive director highlights several areas of potential
weakness: 'GPT's capacity to stay with the game is not that convincing even
with the link to Siemens. The German company has not put all its
telecommunications resources into GPT, which means GPT's interests do not
always coincide with Siemens'. The short-term nature of GEC's financial
controls makes it difficult for GEC to think about the future in the way
that Siemens does.'
There are three main sources of tension.
The relationship is technologically unequal. GPT's technological dependence
upon Siemens' strength in semi-conductors is reflected in Vision One. Not
only is Siemens leading more projects than GPT, it is leading the big
projects on public switches and mobile telephones. GPT is fitting into
Siemens' plans as a specialist sub-contractor.
The shareholding structure is unequal. This is not really a joint venture.
Siemens has bought a minority stake in GEC's telecommunications business,
but it has kept its own telecommunications business, which is Siemens'
largest single division with a turnover of DM 11.26bn, completely separate.
The two parent companies' management approaches are very different. Mr Walsh
remarked: 'We have to be more organised to work with Siemens, play to agreed
rules. They do not like doing things by the seat of their pants, they are
much more formal and a bit insular.'
It seems unlikely that GPT will break up, if only because financial
pressures will encourage GEC and Siemens to stay together.
It is almost certain that eventually Siemens will want to translate its
technical predominance into management control by buying GEC's stake. But
that is not on the cards at the moment.
Lord Weinstock explains: 'There is no reason to think about selling to
Siemens at the moment because we do not need the money. We have got cash
building up again and we have just gone through tortuous negotiations to
settle the business down.'
Siemens has some much bigger problems of its own to sort out - the losses at
Siemens-Nixdorf, the computer maker, the financial drain of its
semi-conductor business and its ailing nuclear power activities. For the
foreseeable future the two partners will rub along together, trapped in a
rather loveless marriage.
As a senior Stanhope Gate executive describes it: 'With the French there is
a friendliness, there may be arguments but there is a lot of bonhomie.
Siemens has to have big meetings and they have to do things very
laboriously.'
But for GEC the success or failure of these ventures needs to be judged
against the purposes they serve.
Financially they make sound sense. GEC-Alsthom should generate good profits,
as Alsthom's technology pulls in the orders and GEC's financial controls
drive down costs. Similarly, savings at GPT contributed to GEC's cash gains
last year.
Also, by demerging the group through joint-ventures, GEC's sprawling
activities have become more manageable. This is reflected in the impetus the
ventures have delivered to GEC managers. Long-standing weaknesses which were
not adequately addressed when these businesses were run by GEC are now being
addressed: GE is helping to rationalise consumer appliances; a revolution is
under way at GPT; and at GEC-Alsthom the British managers are revelling in a
new found sense of identity and purpose.
The vital telecommunications and engineering ventures are the route GEC
needs to take if businesses oriented to Britain and the Commonwealth are to
gain a European base. In the past three years GEC's profits from continental
Europe have risen by 42 per cent to Pounds 199m, offsetting a sharp decline
in the UK.
The GEC-Alsthom merger has created a business which should become one of the
best companies in Europe. It is in excellent shape to take on the likes of
Siemens or ABB, and GEC has found a European home for much of the UK's heavy
engineering inheritance which is the envy of many of its competitors.
The alliance with Siemens does not have the same momentum. GEC's
achievements in forming the venture with Siemens look feeble compared to the
giant strides Alcatel of France made by buying ITT's European business - a
move that made it one of the largest telecommunications groups in the world.
However the venture has given GPT much needed breathing space.
Each of the ventures has a good rationale. But what of their consequences?
GEC's consumer appliances business is being remodelled by a manager from GE
who will take it ever closer to its US partner. French managers dominate the
senior ranks of GEC-Alsthom. And Siemens' technology means it will dominate
and probably eventually control the telecommunications venture.
GEC is increasingly at one remove from the management of the assets which
generate a rising share of its profits. The joint ventures are unlikely to
lead to GEC being broken up by stealth. But it may become a semi-detached
industrial group.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Investors flexing greener
muscles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While investment has long been used to wield clout in the human rights
arena, City of London investors are at last beginning to flex their muscles
on environmental issues.
London fund managers last month received their second formal briefing from
environmental groups and say they want to hear more.
The first came in April, when a pressure group based in Cornwall, called
Surfers Against Sewage, presented its case against some of the sewage
disposal methods used by South West Water, a listed company. Then last month
Greenpeace argued against the business of incinerating toxic waste.
The meetings were organised by Roger Hardman, the environment analyst at
stockbrokers James Capel. 'It is a very forward thinking move on the part of
James Capel,' says Steve Warshal, editor of Greenpeace Business.
Hardman, impressed with the turnout, wants to organise more meetings. 'These
late afternoon briefings are usually used by many fund managers as an excuse
to catch an early train home. They're usually out the door by five. But at
the Greenpeace meeting, the last person did not leave until 6.45pm.'
Environmentalists have acknowledged, but seldom exploited, the power of the
investment community to create change in industry's environmental
performance. But the success of green investment funds - where fund managers
screen their investment decisions according to environmental criteria - has
shown that pressure can be exerted on industry via the investor.
Given that some of the mystery surrounding the investment community is being
lifted and the public is beginning to know more about the way investment
works, it is possible that environmental pressure groups could target
specific well-known companies, such as insurers.
These household names could be put under pressure - by the threat of
consumer resistance - to include environmental criteria when building their
investment portfolios.
Furthermore, the City is slowly becoming aware of the possible impact of
tough new environmental laws, many led by the EC, which could affect profits
of dirty companies. There is also a fear that companies, and possibly their
lenders and insurers, will be made liable for the cost of cleaning up
pollution.
Meanwhile, both the pressure groups and the fund managers are learning to
talk to each other. 'I don't think Greenpeace could have presented their
case any better without diluting their message,' says Hardman.
Warshal of Greenpeace says he was surprised at the audience's lack of
knowledge and understanding of incinerators. 'But they seemed quite
receptive to our argument that toxic waste incineration is an industry that
will not grow.'
Marion Carter, an environmental consultant to most of the UK's waste
managers, says there is a role for pressure groups in pushing for change in
industry. 'But I think it is very dangerous to say to fund mangers that they
should not invest in the waste management industry, because you would then
have a problem of what to do with the waste.'
Kate Medd, a fund manager at Henderson Administration, was impressed by the
quality of the Greenpeace presentation. 'They have a legitimate point of
view and they can back it up.'
Edward Bonham-Carter, fund manager of the Electra Investment Trust, is less
impressed. 'The whole tone of the Greenpeace presentation was too much like
a biology class for 16-year-olds. They would do much better if they gave a
far more detailed analysis of practices and companies.'
He says issues about the quality of life are set to increase in importance
over the next 10 years, which will have an effect on investments. He would
like a debate between industry and pressure groups on issues such as
incineration.
'But I will certainly go to another one of these meetings,' he says.
Mark Campanale, a researcher for the Merlin Ecology Fund, says most City
analysts have no experience of the environment. 'The City is virtually
illiterate when considering environmental concerns. It's just not part of
the traditional investment equation.
'James Capel should be applauded for getting people thinking about wider
issues. But if Greenpeace is going to succeed in getting its message across,
it should switch on to the fact that it is companies that both create and
solve problems. They've got to present their case on specific companies and
in great detail.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind calls for 'rethink' on EFA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY was urged to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the consortium
that commissioned the European fighter aircraft (EFA) and back attempts to
'drive down the costs of the existing design' by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, in the Commons yesterday.
He strongly underlined the economic case against embarking on a new project
which he put to Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, in London on
Monday.
Mr Rifkind warned that the acceptance of Germany's view would result in the
taxpayers of all the countries concerned - Spain and Italy are the other
members of the consortium - losing any benefit from the substantial sums
already invested.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrats' defence spokesman, called for an
assurance that savings would not be made at the expense of the aircraft's
'inherent capability'.
Mr Rifkind said 'substantial cost savings' had already been identified, and
emphasised that Britain wished to continue, as part of an effective
partnership, towards the production phase of the project.
Embarking on a smaller version of the EFA as proposed by Mr Ruhe would
involve total redesign of the airframe, engine and the installed equipment,
and delay the aircraft's entry into service by up to eight years.' The
operational performance of the aircraft would inevitably be substantially
inferior to the EFA, and the cost of changing our minds halfway through the
existing project would add at least 20 per cent to the price,' Mr Rifkind
said.
While not disputing the legal right of Germany to withdraw from the
production phase, he pointed out that it was committed to investing a
further Pounds 1bn in the development phase.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's shadow defence secretary, underlined the extent
to which the future of Britain's aerospace industry was dependent on the
revenue raised from the EFA project.
He said: 'The replacement of ageing aircraft with anything other than this
cost-effective European collaborative project will leave us at the mercy of
American suppliers'.
Mr O'Neill went on: 'We don't want our pilots to go to war or to go into the
air in anything other than the most effective aircraft available to us, and
at the moment EFA is that only option.'
He spoke of the narrowness of the UK's technological base compared with
other European countries and said the country could not afford to lose the
'competitive technological edge which EFA represents'.
Mr Rifkind told him that Italian, German and Spanish industry attached equal
importance to the project.
Tory MP Mr Winston Churchill said: 'This House must never let down the very
few who man our front-line defences by letting them go into future battles,
should there be any, with second-rate equipment.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unionist tensions surround NI talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN IRELAND unionist leaders presented their position papers in talks
with the Irish government yesterday amid the first visible signs of the
tensions the London negotiations have caused in unionist ranks.
Three local councillors in Cookstown, County Tyrone, announced their
resignations from the hardline Democratic Unionist party of the Rev Ian
Paisley in protest at the Lancaster House talks.
Their action was dismissed as a 'stunt' by the DUP - which said that two had
been lapsed members - but it highlighted the pressure Mr Paisley would face
if he appeared to be making concessions to the Dublin government.
A DUP official emphasised that Unionists were not negotiating about the
Irish government's role in Northern Ireland. They were talking to Dublin
about relations between a proposed devolved Northern Ireland government and
the south. Devolution was the subject of earlier negotiations in the talks
process to which the Irish government was excluded.
'We are on a higher moral ground. Resigning on something like this is
playing into the hands of Dublin,' the official said.
Mr Paisley's presentation called for the Irish government to end its
constitutional claim on Northern Ireland. It also set out how Unionist
feelings had failed to be incorporated into the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,
which gives the Irish republic a say in the affairs of the province.
The Ulster Unionist party's presentation was made by Mr Ken Maginnis, MP for
Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and is believed to have covered similar areas to
the DUP's. The meeting then turned to discussion on the participants'
opening positions.
Also taking part in the talks are the nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party and the UK government. Talks, under the independent
chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor general of Australia,
resume today and are expected to transfer to Belfast next week.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over health care is settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have settled a row that was threatening to delay the switch to
local authorities of responsibility for the government's care in the
community policies for the elderly and mentally handicapped, Philip Stephens
writes.
In what is seen as a defeat for the Treasury, health secretary Mrs Virginia
Bottomley is also close to winning her battle to ensure that money
transferred to local authorities from the social security budget to fund the
new system will be 'ring-fenced'.
The plans - which will begin next April to transfer to councils
responsibility for those requiring care at home or in residential
accommodation - have been the subject of intense Whitehall infighting.
The aim is to 'cap' a surge in open-ended income support payments to pay for
residential accommodation but the size of the initial transfer from the
social security to local authority budgets has been the subject of dispute.
The Treasury and the Department of the Environment have also opposed Mrs
Bottomley's view that the transfer can only succeed if local authorities are
prevented by ring-fencing from switching resources for community care to
other budgets.
The health secretary is now said to be confident that she has secured enough
money - several hundred million pounds - to ensure that the phasing in of
the new system can begin next year.
The government appears set to reject the recommendations of an independent
review body that more than 2,000 top public servants should receive a large
one-off pay rise to bring their salaries level with those in the private
sector.
Senior ministers said that they expect tomorrow's meeting of the cabinet to
scale back significantly the increases for senior civil servants, armed
forces officers and judges suggested by the Top People's Pay Review Board.
Mr John Major is also likely to insist that those pay awards of over 10 per
cent which are accepted by the government should be phased in.

THE GOALS of the Patient's Charter will require additional manpower and
funding, the British Medical Association told the government yesterday.
Delegates at the association's conference in Nottingham endorsed the
sentiments behind the charter but insisted that investigation of patients'
complaints must be comprehensive and establish the real causes of troubles
'including faults in the system'.
The conference accused the government of artificially distorting hospital
waiting lists by measuring them from the time a consultant placed a patient
on a list.
Waiting time should, the BMA said, be measured from the time a general
practitioner referred a patient to hospital.

FT  08 JUL 92 / AEEU to assist Romania unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging the AEEU engineering and electrical union to
provide know-how to the nascent free trade unions of Romania, Michael Smith
writes.
The Foreign Office's 'know-how fund' has paid the expenses of Mr Nigel
Harris, an AEEU executive councillor, for an exploratory visit to the former
communist country. It has also agreed in principle to a two-week visit by
eight of the unions' officials.
The Foreign Office's know-how fund was set up in 1989 to provide technical
assistance for east European countries to adapt to market economies.
Although the AEEU money will have only a limited impact on the fund's annual
budget of Pounds 46m, its use may raise the eyebrows of some Tory MPs. The
AEEU is a moderate union but led the successful campaign for a 37-hour week
for engineering workers.
Mr Harris said that in Romania he and his colleagues would aim to show how
unions could operate in a market economy with a multi-party political
system.
The union's engineering section last year incurred a deficit of Pounds
949,714, according to its accounts published yesterday.
It was the third deficit in three years but the union expects staff
reductions and property sales to result in surpluses by 1993.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Syria destroys Lebanese drug crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OPIUM AND cannabis production in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a prime source of funds for Hizbollah Islamic fundamentalists - has been
wiped out by the Syrian army.
The valley has long been one of the world's principal centres for growing
illegal drugs but policing was non-existent during Lebanon's civil war.
However, the subsequent large presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon and
Syria's powerful influence in the country, with which Damascus signed broad
'co-operation' agreements last year, made the task of clearing the Bekaa
feasible.
The world's other main illegal opium production areas are in Afghanistan,
Pakistan and south-east Asia. New fields have also been sown this year in
the former Soviet Union, with traffickers taking advantage of current
turmoil.
The UN says the Bekaa crackdown is not going to stop trafficking, but it has
disrupted European supplies. As a probable result, there have been shortages
of cannabis on the illegal British market for several months.
The Syrian crackdown started soon after talks between President Hafez
al-Assad and Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, about the time of
last year's Gulf War.
Mr Baker is believed to have suggested that tackling Lebanon's role in
supplying a significant part of the world illegal drugs market might be one
way Syria could improve relations with the US and western Europe.
The United Nations Drug Control Programme in Vienna carried out a snap
inspection five weeks ago, when poppies should have been in bloom and
cannabis plants growing strongly. Mr Bernard Frahi, a former police
superintendent in France who led the inspection, said yesterday the
crackdown has dealt a strong blow to illegal drug trafficking.
'The Syrian army just got on with it, beginning last year when they seem to
have eradicated about 80 per cent of the crops. This year they finished the
job,' Mr Frahi added.
Some groups in Beirut claimed growing is still going on, but were unable to
produce evidence to the UN's three-man team, which had free access to the
valley. Photographs taken by the team show the Bekaa - about 75 miles long
by eight miles wide - looking like a large ploughed field. Two years ago,
photographs from similar positions show purple-white opium poppies as far as
the eye can see.
The team's unpublished report on the inspection says there has been an
immediate effect on the drugs market. Raw opium for processing into morphine
and heroin is now so short its price in Beirut has rocketed from Dollars 70
a tonne to more than Dollars 500.
According to Syrian estimates, up to 12,500 acres in the Bekaa were planted
with opium and up to 40,000 acres with cannabis, yielding 50 tonnes of opium
and 1,000 tonnes of hashish. The opium would then be refined into about five
tonnes of heroin.
The Lebanese civil war allowed easy bulk shipment by sea, with profits
helping to fund the fighting. With peace and tighter Syrian control, six
'controlled delivery' operations have been carried out from Lebanon this
year, leading to drug seizures in Germany, the US, Britain and France. Mr
Frahi said tighter policing was also preventing drug smuggling across Syria.
Cultivation in the Bekaa was split between a large local family with 5,000
members, Hizbollah activists, smaller families and individual farmers. Many
are now struggling to subsist by growing lettuce, tomatoes and potatoes, but
are losing money because of the cost of seeds, fertiliser and irrigation.
Illegal drugs are low-cost, low-maintenance crops, and farmers told the UN
team they will revert to growing them if they get the chance. However,
Syrian generals say there will be no let-up.

<TEXT>
INDIA is for the first time to allow private broadcasters to use the
state-owned television network.
The government announced yesterday that it would allow private companies
broadcasting time on a second channel beamed to main cities.
The partial privatisation, to start next month, is a belated response to the
competition being faced by Doordarshan, the state-owned television service,
from CNN, the BBC, Star TV and other networks using satellite links.
The second channel, focusing on audiences in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and
Madras, will show independently made programmes and will be governed by a
Broadcasting Council intended to be free of government control.
Independent television producers have welcomed the government's decision.
The council will be made up of nine people drawn from the media and
performing arts, all of whom will have experience of electronic media.
Producers hope that the quality of programmes on Indian television will
improve substantially once private producers 'with proven track records' are
issued licences by the Council for an initial five-hour time slot rising to
nine hours.
The Information Ministry, which has faced widespread criticism of its
mediocre programmes and arbitrary censoring, hopes to increase its
commercial revenue substantially from advertising on the new private channel
and from the licence fees of cable operators.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Rao confident of surviving scandal: Indian inflation turns
downwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao faces a new
session of parliament today with growing confidence that the opposition will
be unable to substantiate charges of ministers' involvement in the Bombay
financial scandal.
The Finance Ministry also believes that inflation is at last turning
downwards. It has been running at 12 to 13 per cent over the past year and
has provided the principal weapon for critics of the government's economic
reforms.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said that he was confident that
inflation would come down from month to month to a single digit rate by the
end of the financial year.
But, anticipating a big assault from the opposition over its handling of the
financial scandal, the government seems ready to yield ground by agreeing to
the setting up of a joint parliamentary commission to investigate the
scandal.
The opposition has demanded an independent inquiry on the grounds that both
the Reserve Bank and the police investigations have been carried out by arms
of the government - and have thus dodged uncomfortable questions over the
involvement of ministers and senior government officials and over the role
of the central bank.
Such an inquiry is likely to put further pressure on Mr R. Venkitaramanan,
the Reserve Bank governor, who is at risk of becoming the main scapegoat of
the scandal.
Mr Singh this week expressed his continuing confidence in the governor and
spoke of the difficulties he had faced. But the government also seems
prepared to sacrifice him if need be.
All the opposition parties are intending to vote against the government in a
no-confidence motion over its handling of the scandal, which is expected to
be tabled in the early days of the session. Though the government has only a
bare majority, its co-ordination is better than that of the opposition. In
addition, none of the opposition parties is yet ready for an election.
At least two ministers are constantly named in private conversations in
Delhi as having an involvement in the scandal. But ministers and senior
officials seem increasingly confident that the opposition does not have
material to substantiate charges of wrongdoing.
The government's confidence has been strengthened by some signs of
improvement in the main economic indicators. The inflation rate has dropped
to just over 11 per cent and government economists believe that the
year-on-year rate will descend to single digits in the next few months.
A rise in imports in the February to May period is seen as a sign of
industrial production picking up and officials are encouraged by the large
number of companies planning to focus more on exports.
But with industrialised economies in prolonged recession, there is much
uncertainty over how strong the growth in export performance will be.
There is also uncertainty over whether the government - already on the
defensive over the financial scandal - will have the courage to push ahead
with unpopular economic decisions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT labour supply will limit Singapore's economic growth this year to
between 4 and 6 per cent, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS). The economy grew by 6.7 per cent in 1991, AP reports from Singapore.
Rising labour costs will curb exports, the MAS, Singapore's central bank,
said in an annual report. Weak US demand is likely to dampen exports by a
leading Singapore industry, computer disk drive manufacturing, and consumer
electronics will be depressed because of high inventories in Japan and
Europe, it said.
Overall, however, 'increased spending on public infrastructural projects, a
revival in exports to the US and increased trade with China will provide the
main impetus to growth.' Pharmaceuticals and special chemicals should
continue to prosper, while petrochemical exports will be hit by a regional
glut, the report said.
'The appreciation of the Singapore dollar since 1988 served to neutralise
foreign inflationary pressures and exerted a cooling effect on the
overheated labour market,' said Mr Richard Hu, MAS chairman and finance
minister.
'A weaker exchange rate may indeed help achieve higher export and gross
domestic growth in the short term. It comes, however, at the cost of higher
inflation, which must eventually undermine competitiveness,' said Mr Hu.
'There is no lasting gain in output arising from a weaker currency. More
often than not, persistent inflation erodes investor confidence, engenders
social divisiveness, and impairs long-term economic growth.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Canadian health care faces financial realities: The
provinces are considering reforms including user fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIANS enjoy one of the world's most widely admired health care systems.
Anchored by the principles of universality and accessibility, the publicly
funded system has ensured that rich and poor alike are able to visit a
first-class doctor, call an ambulance or get a bed in a prestigious
hospital.
But keeping these principles intact is becoming difficult. A vigorous debate
is under way on how a system that so many other countries have been tempted
to follow should itself be reformed.
The nub of the problem is money, as underlined last month when, for the
first time, the health ministers of all 10 provinces (health care is a
provincial responsibility) met jointly with provincial finance ministers.
Canadians can visit a doctor as often as they like at no charge. Doctors
charge provincial health plans according to a schedule of fees for various
services, but with few aggregate limits. The system is funded by a variety
of taxes, ranging from a portion of general government revenue to a special
payroll tax in some provinces.
For years, financial considerations were secondary. But public spending on
health ballooned by an average of 12 per cent a year during the 1980s to the
point where Canada's spending on health care relative to its gross domestic
product is now 9.2 per cent, higher than any other country with a national
health system. The budget of Ontario's health ministry, by far the biggest
in the country, has almost quadrupled since 1980.
Some of the spiralling costs are attributed to the bureaucratic inefficiency
of a government-run system split between 10 provinces. Canadian hospitals,
for instance, have traditionally been run as separate entities, each with
its own board of directors trying to carve out a high profile in the
community.
The recession and growing grassroots resistance to tax increases have forced
governments to tighten their belts. Ontario has budgeted for a mere 1 per
cent rise in funding for hospitals this year. It has warned pharmaceutical
companies not to increase their prices by more than 2 per cent.
Mr Earl Berger, managing director of Canadian Health Monitor, a national
health care survey, says the cuts are 'forcing hospitals to do things which
many of them have never done before'. These include drawing up business
plans and encouraging doctors to remove their patients from hospital more
quickly.
At the same time, the fundamental principle of universal health care is
being questioned. Critics are asking whether unlimited 'free' access to
services encourages demands on doctors and hospitals. Similarly, could
doctors, whose income is partly determined by how often they see their
patients, be more sparing in their choice of tests and treatments? Does
every hospital in every city need the most modern equipment to treat a wide
variety of ailments?
Changes are already under way. New Brunswick, for example, hopes to improve
efficiency and bring down administrative costs by replacing 53 hospital
boards in the province with eight regional boards. Ontario has warned
commercial laboratories that from next April payments will be cut by half
when the number of tests grows by more than 2 per cent a year. Health care
administrators are trying over the longer term to ease the pressure on
hospitals by putting more emphasis on walk-in clinics, day surgery and
homecare.
Doctors are playing a bigger role in hospital administration. But they are
also being encouraged to move towards what some derisively call 'cookbook
medicine'. Instead of carrying out simultaneous tests and treatments, they
are being encouraged to move stage-by-stage from one procedure to the next.
Some politicians have promised that such reforms to improve the efficiency
of health care delivery will be sufficient to ease the financial crunch. The
Ontario government said in a recent paper that its reforms would ensure 'our
current system is maintained and actually enhanced'.
Others, however, predict more fundamental changes. Quebec set warning lights
flashing last year when it proposed a CDollars 5 (Pounds 2.20) 'orientation
fee' to be levied when a patient insisted on visiting a hospital casualty
ward without first going to a family clinic, or made an appointment with a
specialist without referral by a general practitioner.
A political outcry forced Quebec to drop the idea, but it is toying with
others that would have much the same effect. One is a surcharge on personal
income tax, based on the volume of medical services used during the year.
The surcharge would have an upper limit of CDollars 300-400 a year for the
average family.
Several provinces are gradually narrowing the definition of universal and
accessible care. Ontario sets strict limits on payments for medical care
outside Canada - a substantial burden, for instance, on the people who have
retired to Florida. Quebec is considering removing some services, such as
eyesight examinations and prescriptions for the elderly, from its health
plan coverage.
Mr David Levine, director-general of the Notre Dame hospital in Montreal,
says that 'piece-by-piece, there's going to be a way in which this is going
to be introduced'. Mr Berger predicts that at least one of the provinces
will introduce some form of user fee within five years.
The challenge for politicians is to put the changes in place without
unleasing a public furore. Though the long-term result may be a
significantly different system, Mr Levine predicts it will be achieved only
through small, incremental steps.

VIOLENCE erupted in a mainly Hispanic neighbourhood in northern Manhattan on
Monday night as hundreds of demonstrators burned cars and buildings and
looted shops in a rampage that left one man dead and 15 injured.
The rioting, in the Washington Heights section of New York, is an
embarrassment to Mayor David Dinkins less than a week before the city hosts
the Democratic party's national convention. Mr Dinkins has been trying to
smarten up New York's image.
The six hours of violence began when residents marched through the streets
to protest at the shooting by a policeman last Friday of Mr Jose Garcia, a
member of the local Dominican community. Police said Mr Garcia was shot dead
in a struggle to disarm him, but the protesters claimed he was unarmed.
The demonstrators split into smaller groups and began shouting and hurling
rocks and bottles at helmeted anti-riot police. The protesters - mainly
Dominican teenagers - then set cars, rubbish bins and buildings on fire. One
man died after falling off the roof of a five-storey building.
A police spokesman said the violence resulted in 28 arrests, the injury of
15 protesters, two fire fighters and eight policemen, and damage to eight
police cars and one ambulance.
Mayor Dinkins and other local politicians visited the neighbourhood as the
violence began, seeking to reassure the Dominican community that there would
be a full investigation of the circumstances of Mr Garcia's death.
Mr Brian Murtaugh, a Democrat in the New York assembly, who was an
eyewitness to the violence, said the incident was 'nothing like the recent
riots in Los Angeles' and consisted mainly of 'teenage looting and
rampaging'.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Clinton silent on running-mate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE days before the start of the Democratic party convention in New York,
one name is still missing from the programme: that of Governor Bill
Clinton's vice-presidential running-mate.
Mr Clinton yesterday met Mr Warren Christopher, the Washington lawyer who is
leading his search committee, but the Arkansas governor has succeeded in
preserving a veil of mystery over his choice.
Several names are widely circulated, but most tipsters are cautious enough
to include the possibility of a surprise on their short-lists. Even the
timing of Mr Clinton's announcement remains in doubt, with some pundits
suggesting he might wait until the middle of next week's All Star baseball
game to ensure a big television audience.
Three men are most widely mentioned as possible running-mates: Senator
Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana and
Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee. Senator Wofford leapt to the top of the
list yesterday when he met Mr Clinton in Washington. A surprise victor in
last year's Pennsylvania senate by-election, he would confirm an emphasis on
domestic issues, especially health care reform.
Mr Hamilton, on the other hand, would bring some of the gravitas and foreign
affairs experience that the presumptive Democratic nominee is thought to
lack. His odds lengthened this weekend when he distanced himself from Mr
Clinton and the centre of the Democratic party on the issues of abortion and
parental leave - although his reservations about abortion rights are similar
to Mr Wofford's.
Mr Gore would bring good credentials on environmental issues, but an
all-southern ticket could be risky: Yankee prejudice is alive and well, as
Mr Clinton himself discovered during the New York Democratic primary
campaign.
Also viewed as potential choices are three other senators: Mr Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, Mr Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Mr Bob Graham of Florida.
Of these six, only Mr Wofford and perhaps Mr Graham have the capacity to
bring Mr Clinton a big state he might otherwise lose.
The man Democratic delegates would most like to see alongside Governor
Clinton, according to a recent Associated Press poll, is Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey. The former basketball star has, however, repeatedly
ruled himself out.
In the end, the choice of vice-presidential running-mate may not mean all
that much. Some analysts say it is the candidate's first chance to show
himself as a decision-maker; others that voters elect a president, not a
vice-president.
While Mr Lyndon Johnson won his home state of Texas for President John
Kennedy in 1960, and Mr Walter Mondale of Minnesota may have helped
President Jimmy Carter in 1976, most vice-presidential candidates have no
effect on the outcome of the election.
Perhaps the clearest evidence of this came in 1988, when Mr Lloyd Bentsen
comprehensively outscored Mr Dan Quayle, but could do nothing to rescue the
losing candidacy of Mr Michael Dukakis.

<TEXT>
SANYO ELECTRIC, the Japanese electronics company, has filed anti-trust and
breach of contract suits in the US against Texas Instruments (TI), the US
semiconductor maker, in an increasingly bitter dispute which followed the
breakdown of year-long negotiations over a semiconductor cross licence
agreement.
Sanyo also launched a vituperative attack against TI, accusing it of
negotiating in bad faith and attempting to 'coerce' Sanyo into 'paying for a
patent that we neither want nor need'.
The dispute is the most bitter yet in a series of cross-Pacific patent
disagreements involving hundreds of millions of dollars of royalty payments.
TI, and other US companies, have been increasingly aggressive in seeking to
enforce patent rights in the courts.
Mr Hiroshi Yoshie, Sanyo managing director, said: 'We are extremely
disappointed with TI's behaviour in this matter, not only with regard to
their attempt to use their asserted market leverage. . . . to coerce our
company. . . . but in the total lack of integrity which they demonstrated in
our negotiations.'
Texas Instruments had no immediate comment on the substance of Sanyo's
allegations. However, Mr Norman Neureiter, vice president of TI Asia, said
in Tokyo: 'We question whether Sanyo's cause is really being well-served by
such intemperate and one might even say, nasty, language.'
TI filed a patent infringement suit against Sanyo on June 26, and sought a
declaratory judgment from the court that the conduct of the company's
negotiations with Sanyo did not constitute a misuse of patents or anti-trust
violation.
Sanyo, for its part, said in a complaint filed at the US district court in
California, that it wished to sign an agreement excluding TI's Kilby patent
 -named for the inventor of the semiconductor, Mr Jack Kilby - which covers
basic semiconductor technology in Japan. However, TI would agree to this
only by charging an 'exorbitant multi-million dollar penalty payment for the
'privilege' of excluding the Kilby. . . . patent.' Sanyo says this
constituted an abuse of monopoly power which violated US anti-trust law. It
is seeking treble damages under US law and injunctive relief.
TI believes the broadly-worded Kilby patent applies to all semiconductor
devices produced in Japan. Sanyo, however, says the Kilby patent 'covers an
outdated technology that is not valuable to Sanyo because it is not a
practical, competitively viable design for products that will compete in
today's semiconductor market.'
Sanyo warned TI in April that it would take legal action but on June 24 said
it would hold back pending a further meeting with the US company.
According to Sanyo, TI agreed to meet on July 16, but then filed suit
against Sanyo in a Texas court on June 26. 'TI deliberately deceived Sanyo
in order to lure Sanyo into not seeking judicial relief from TI's anti-trust
violations and related conduct, in an effort to obtain some tactical
litigation or negotiation advantage.'
Sanyo says this violated contractual provisions in the former cross-licence
agreement requiring TI to negotiate in good faith.
Texas Instruments and Fujitsu, the Japanese computer company, are currently
seeking a determination by the Japanese court as to whether TI's Kilby
patent applies to products made by Fujitsu. The two companies nonetheless
reached agreement on other patent licences.
TI has reached comprehensive semiconductor cross-licence agreements,
covering the Kilby patent, with 14 other Japanese companies.

FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Rotterdam of the east takes shape - Yvonne
Preston reports on Asia's dream port project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a vast port complex and trading zone in north-east Asia, sprawling
over the boundaries of China, North Korea and Russia, are under way after
securing the support of no fewer than six governments.
The Tumen River Area Development Programme (TRADP) is centred on a key Sea
of Japan coastal area and is optimistically described as 'the future
Rotterdam of the Far East.' Its estimated cost is at least Dollars 30bn
(Pounds 15.7bn) over 20 years.
The main achievement so far of TRADP, which is sponsored by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has been the diplomatic feat of
bringing together government delegations from the two Koreas, China, Russia,
Mongolia and Japan.
It would be hard to imagine six more disparate countries. The two Koreas,
locked in mutual hostility for 40 years, signed a non-aggression pact only
last December, and China has yet to establish formal relations with South
Korea. Russia was not even an independent country when the TRADP inaugural
meeting took place in February last year. Japan has no diplomatic relations
with North Korea and is in bitter dispute with Russia over the Kurile
islands, which were occupied by Soviet forces after the second world war.
No other intergovernmental organisation exists in this part of the world,
the UN development agency says, and the formation of a TRADP management
committee is the first time the six countries agreed to work together under
UN auspices.
The 516km Tumen river rises in China's Jilin province and has been the
border between China and Korea since ancient times. Sino-Soviet rivalry, the
Korean war and Japanese militarism have kept the area backward and
undeveloped. The dream is to turn the marshes and rice paddies of the Tumen
River delta into a metropolis of 500,000 people and entrepot to rival
Rotterdam and Hong Kong. UNDP officials acknowledge that the project is
still only a dream.
The delta provides landlocked Mongolia with its nearest outlet to the sea.
The hinterland is rich in resources, and the scale of the trading bloc could
rival the European Community.
The regional co-operation project consists of an inner economic zone of
around 1,000 sq km. A second and broader development area takes in the
Russian port of Vladivostok, Chongjin in North Korea and the Chinese city of
Yanji. The outer North-east Asia Regional Development Area occupies an area
of 370,000 sq km.
The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have shown interest in the
project, which will also seek funds from Japan and South Korea. The next
stage is an initial feasibility study for which the UN agency has allocated
Dollars 3.5m.
The involvement of North Korea in the planned development represents the
country's first step towards opening its economy after decades of isolation.

<TEXT>
URUGUAY's trade regime has gradually changed from a highly protected to a
relatively liberal one. But the benefits are being reduced by high trade
barriers in rich countries to Uruguay's farm and textile exports, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) says in a report yesterday
It warns that Uruguay risks lagging behind the economic liberalisation of
Brazil and Argentina, its giant neighbours and fellow members with Paraguay
of the Mercosur common market. This could mean rapid and painful structural
adjustment in Uruguay's import-competing industries when trade barriers are
scrapped within Mercosur from January 1995.
The Gatt council yesterday welcomed Uruguay's progress in liberalising trade
and deregulating its domestic market, despite economic difficulties. The
report notes that average tariffs have fallen from nearly 700 per cent in
1968 to 21.5 per cent by January 1992. The council urged Uruguay's trading
partners to support the reform process by reducing obstacles to its exports.
Entry barriers and subsidised exports under EC and US farm policies have
particularly hit Uruguay's exports. Uruguay, which hosted the launch of the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks in 1986, is a member of the Cairns Group
pushing for cuts in farm subsidies.

DR Eddie Fenech Adami, the Maltese prime minister, survived a vote of no
confidence yesterday following the decision by EC heads of state in Lisbon
not to include Malta in a list of countries lining up for full membership of
the Community.
The motion was tabled by the opposition Labour Party which claimed the
government had deluded Maltese about the island's chances of being accepted
as a full EC member.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, had argued institutional changes
would be needed if Malta were to be allowed to join.
Greece that insisted Cyprus would have to be admitted if Malta's application
was approved.
Maltese government officials said yesterday the island's application is
expected to come up for review again at an EC council of minister's meeting
within six months - by which time the EC commission will have finalised its
opinion on the Maltese application.
The Maltese now plan to put their case more forcefully. The foreign
minister, Dr Guido Demarco, will have his first opportunity this month when
he meets the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, in London.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN about ratification of the Maastricht treaty could distract the
European Community from the severe problems facing EC businesses, the
Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday.
'It seems to us there is a danger of what is essentially a political
question overshadowing this crisis of business competitiveness,' said Sir
Anthony Tennant, chairman of the CBI's Europe committee. Sir Anthony, who is
also chairman of Guinness, the UK drinks group, was in Brussels to highlight
the CBI's priorities for the British presidency of the EC, which began last
week.
He urged the UK government to press for completion of the single European
market, which would be the best way of halting the decline in EC
competitiveness. However, in its memorandum to the British government, the
CBI calls on the presidency to ignore 'bogus single market measures', such
as draft legislation to harmonise company law, data protection standards and
social policy. The CBI believes these measures would add little to the
creation of a single market.
Sir Anthony pointed out that the Community's share of world export markets
had declined by 30 per cent in volume terms over the past decade, and
Community productivity was growing at only half the Japanese rate.
But the CBI stressed that it was not advocating an interventionist policy,
and sounded a note of caution about the European Commission's budget plans
for the next five years. The Commission envisages targeting increased EC
funds on improved research and development and professional training.
Mr Dick Price, the CBI's deputy director general, said the organisation,
which represents 250,000 British companies, was 'instinctively wary' about
anything that might involve 'officials taking decisions to pump public money
into the promotion of individual sectors'. 'That's the quickest way of
wasting people's money that anybody has ever thought of,' he added.

EUROPEAN Community banks and bureaux de change still charge travellers too
much and display insufficient information on exchange rates and fees,
according to the European consumers' organisation.
The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) yesterday called on
the European Commission to introduce binding legislation to improve
cross-border payment systems and ease the establishment of the single
market.
The Commission estimates that consumers will save more than Ecu1bn (Pounds
700m) in bank charges annually, if financial institutions follow guidelines
issued in March.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC financial services commissioner, has threatened to
introduce legislation if the banks do not cut their fees and improve
transparency by the end of the year.
But Ms Laura Mosca, Beuc's chief economist, yesterday condemned the
Commission's voluntary 'users' charter' as a 'public relations gimmick' and
urged Sir Leon to take rapid and tough action which would bring financial
institutions into line.
'The consumer's lot has not altered since 1988 when the first (Commission)
recommendation on payment systems was adopted,' she said.
Beuc and UFC Que Choisir, a Paris-based consumer organisation, examined the
specific area of holiday money and found, for example, that two-thirds of EC
banks and bureaux de change displayed no information on exchange rates and
fees for travellers' cheque transactions.
The consumer groups also attacked banks and card issuers for the lack of
information available to consumers using payment cards and cheques when
overseas.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Bosnian carve-up in the making: Judy Dempsey on why a
unitary republic may never emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE declaration at the weekend of a Croatian state within the borders of
Bosnia-Hercegovina has prompted fears it could be too late for a unitary
republic to emerge from the civil war.
European Community peace efforts in recent months may in fact have played
into the hands of Serbia and Croatia, which agreed secretly last year to
carve up Bosnia along ethnic lines.
The plan was drawn up in March 1991, by Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman
and President Milosevic of Serbia.
Negotiations were postponed after the federal Yugoslav army, backed by
Serbia, invaded Slovenia in June 1991. When the federal army, supported by
Serb nationalists, attacked Croatia last July, Zagreb and Belgrade
re-started negotiations on Bosnia.
At the time Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, said: 'Any carve-up of
Bosnia would be sheer madness. This republic is an ethnic-patchwork. It
would lead to a terrible bloodbath.'
Bosnia's Croats, then led by Mr Stjepan Kljuic, Bosnia's Moslems, and the
Serbs of Sarajevo, keen to maintain the integrity of their multi-ethnic
capital city, pleaded with the EC to send monitors to Bosnia. They also
asked the UN to send peacekeeping troops before it became too late to keep
the peace.
But Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia,
said earlier this year that it was impossible to send peacekeepers. 'There
was no consensus among the three ethnic groups in Bosnia.'
The consensus did not exist for one reason. Serbia, represented by Mr
Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbian Democratic Party (a sister
party of the ruling party in Serbia), persistently blocked any attempts by
Bosnia's moderate Moslem, Croat and Serb communities to have UN peacekeepers
deployed.
With little prospect of the UN playing any peacekeeping role in Bosnia,
Croatia and Serbia used the opportunity to co-operate more closely in
dividing the republic.
Last January, for example, President Tudjman intervened in Bosnian politics
by replacing the moderate Mr Kljuic, head of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic
Union (a sister party of the ruling party in Croatia), with Mr Mate Boban.
Unlike Mr Kljuic, who was born in Sarajevo and regards himself as a Bosnian,
Mr Boban was born in the predominantly Croat region of western Hercegovina.
He considers himself a Croat nationalist. Mr Boban's promotion led to closer
co-operation with Mr Karadzic.
'We saw what was happening then,' said a senior UN official involved in the
Sarajevo relief effort. 'Although the UN was on the sidelines, we could see
why outside Serbs and Croats - unlike the people from Sarajevo and other
ethnically mixed cities - did not want us in. It would thwart their plans.
It was up to the EC to stop this division. If you want my personal view, the
EC's record in Bosnia has been shameful.'
Portugal, which took over the EC presidency in January, tried to tackle the
crisis. Under Ambassador Jose Cutileiro, who worked closely with Lord
Carrington, chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference, Lisbon drew up a plan
for Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'The EC March 9 plan was perfect for Zagreb and Belgrade, and for Boban and
Karadzic,' said a US diplomat. Under it Bosnia-Hercegovina's three leaders
would reorganise the republic into three autonomous ethnic units of Moslems,
Serbs and Croats. It was left unclear as to how the boundaries of each unit
would be drawn. The plan failed to take into account that some areas were so
ethnically intertwined that a simple division was not possible.
US and east European diplomats said Mr Izetbegovic was pushed into accepting
the plan because he did not want to be accused of blocking it. 'Essentially,
the EC plan gave Croatia and Serbia carte blanche to divide Bosnia,' a
Hungarian diplomat says.
By the time the EC recognised Bosnia-Hercegovina in April, Serb irregulars
and the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav army were blockading Sarajevo airport so
as to cut off the capital from the outside world as a first step in dividing
the city. They were also destabilising eastern Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic was simultaneously trying to create a corridor across northern
Bosnia aimed at linking Serbia with Knin, the self-proclaimed Serbian
republic in south-west Croatia.
Croatia was primarily concerned with protecting Croats in western
Hercegovina and with the eventual goal of carving out a swathe of territory
which would be annexed to Croatia. This strategy is reflected in last
weekend's announcement of the Croatian state of Herceg-Bosnia. Earlier Mr
Karadzic's Serb forces declared several autonomous Serb republics in Bosnia.
'The tragedy of all this is that the people of Bosnia - Moslems, Serbs, and
Croats - have lost. Like the people of Sarajevo, they see themselves as
Bosnian. They do not want ethnicity or identity imposed on them by outsiders
from Croatia, Serbia, or Montenegro,' according to a Hungarian diplomat.
'If they choose to be Bosnian, instead of belonging to one ethnic group,
they will be forced to choose their ethnicity, or else be killed or forced
to flee,' he said.
UN officials, journalists, aid workers and diplomats know precisely what
ethnic cleansing entails. The pattern is uniform, and methodical.
Serb forces surround the villages and towns. The citizens are given an
ultimatum. Either they surrender, and as a result are often put into labour
camps, deployed in the front line, or used as hostages; or else they flee -
if they are lucky.
'I think we, the people of Sarajevo and Bosnia, now realise we are alone,'
said Mr Mirsad Becerovic, a Moslem reporter at Radio Sarajevo. Mr Dragan
Miskovic, a Serb editor at the Bosnia-Hercegovina newsagency, says the
people of Sarajevo will never allow outsiders to divide their city. 'We will
never be broken. This is our city. This is our home.'

LEADERS of the now banned Communist Party of the Soviet Union, until a year
ago the commanding political force in the former Soviet Union, yesterday
told the Russian Constitutional Court that a continued ban on their party
would foreshadow a dictatorship.
The party officials included Mr Vladimir Ivashko, the former deputy general
secretary. But Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former general secretary, was
absent. The officials argued that the banning of the party by President
Boris Yeltsin after the attempted coup last August was unconstitutional.
The court ruled that a second suit lodged by Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, a senior
Russian deputy, alleging that the party itself was unconstitutional, will be
heard separately - in spite of an earlier decision to combine the two
actions.
Mr Victor Zorkaltsev, a former party official who represented the party,
said the ban set a precedent which was sure to be used against other
political parties and public movements. 'A ban on soviets (local councils)
will follow that on the party, thus setting the conditions for an
authoritarian takeover,' he said.
Mr Yeltsin has said that the court might find 'certain slip-ups of a
procedural nature' in his decrees, but added: 'Remember the atmosphere in
which these decrees were adopted, and the emotional wave of popular support.
It was probably the only course.'
Moldova's parliament yesterday urged deployment of a multinational force to
separate warring factions in the breakaway republic of Trans Dnestr, the
eastern part of Moldova populated mostly by Russians and Ukrainians.
It said the force should be composed of troops from Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria. Moldova was formerly part of
Romania, while 100,000 ethnic Bulgarians live in Moldova.

MRS SADAKO OGATA, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is due
to meet warring national leaders in Sarajevo today as continuing clashes
heighten fears the Bosnian refugee crisis could escalate further.
Some 1m people have been uprooted from their homes in four months of
fighting between Serb and Bosnian forces.
Ms Judith Kumin, the Belgrade representative of the UNHCR, said: 'The number
of refugees from Bosnia is increasing dramatically every day. We are very
concerned that it will continue. People who are now trapped in siege towns
will leave the minute they have to chance to seek safety.
'If Moslems continue to be forced from Serb-controlled territories, and
Serbs from regions controlled by Moslems, then the number of refugees will
be practically without limit.'
Serbs forces, which control more than half of Bosnian territory, are driving
out Moslems from eastern Bosnia in a policy of 'ethnic cleansing'.
Fighting eased yesterday in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital besieged by Serb
forces. UN officials said that by mid-afternoon 15 relief flights had
arrived in the capital. They hope to fly in some 200 tonnes per day to feed
some 380,000 people trapped with little food and medicines.
Serb militias opposed to Bosnian independence yesterday fought against
mainly Croat and Moslem Bosnian forces around Brcko and Derventa, northern
Bosnia, according to Croatian radio. Belgrade radio said Serb forces had
clashed with Croat forces in Kupres, Hercegovina, where the Croats have
launched an offensive.
More than 7,500 people have been killed in Bosnia since it was widely
recognised as independent from Yugoslavia in April.
Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for UN peacekeepers, yesterday said 93
prisoners were exchanged between Serb and Bosnian forces in the first
UN-sponsored exchange.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Bush winning few votes with folks back
home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS BRADY can be more frank than most. The US Treasury secretary was
going through his standard spiel for American journalists about why this
summit promoting international economic growth mattered to election year
voters back home when he allowed himself what amounts to a confession.
'Has it been well sold? Has that thought been well sold? No,' he said. 'Has
a better job got to be done on it? Yes.'
The more political of the White House spin doctors would not normally admit
as much, but Mr Brady had put his finger on a problem. Unless some rabbit
can be pulled out of the summit hat - and it is hard to see what it will be
 -the political benefit of President George Bush's attendance here does not
appear to be very great.
Mr Bush's presumed edge over Bill Clinton and Ross Perot is experience and
competence in foreign policy. This may not be decisive in a year when
domestic concerns are paramount, but in a close race every little bit helps.
That was certainly the case on Sunday in Warsaw when he was able to play the
role of the popular statesman abroad and bask in the warmth of his
reception. With 12m Polish Americans back home, the endorsement of President
Lech Walesa counts, and the pictures were lovely.
Munich is messier, mostly because the news out of here is essentially
indecisive. While it may matter that serious discussions have taken place on
Gatt and on Yugoslavia, as well as on the international economy, the
inability on all fronts to achieve what can be portrayed as decisive
breakthroughs makes the selling of the summit, to apply Mr Brady's words to
the geopolitical, that much harder.
Nor, half way through the event, does it appear that Mr Bush has been
playing the role of primus inter pares. To the extent that initiatives have
been evident at all they have come from Mr John Major and Mr Jacques Delors
on Gatt, Mr Francois Mitterrand on Yugoslavia and Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF
managing director, on his negotiations with the Russians.
Given the intractability of all three issues, Mr Bush may have calculated
that to be exposed on any of them would carry more risk than reward. But it
has also not helped the presentation of his performance to his domestic
audience that the principal conduit, the White House press corps, has been
isolated at a remote hotel and fed a diet of thinnish, almost defensive,
gruel. It has not resulted in favourable coverage.
This is not yet irredeemable, nor, in the greater and longer scheme of
things, may it matter. But Mr Bush may recall that since Rambouillet in
1975, two of the three incumbent US presidents who hoped that summits would
give them a boost - Gerald Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter in 1980  - went on
to lose. Ronald Reagan had it easy in 1984, but by the time he got to the
London summit he was already home and dry. Mr Bush is not.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Text of Yugoslav declaration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE, the leaders of our seven countries and the representatives of the
European Community, are deeply concerned about the ongoing Yugoslav crisis.
We strongly condemn the use of violence in the former Yugoslavia and deplore
the suffering inflicted upon its population.
We particularly deplore those actions directed against civilian populations
as well as the forced expulsion of ethnic groups. Although all parties have
contributed to this state of affairs the Serbian leadership and the Yugoslav
Army controlled by it bear the greatest share of the responsibility.
We support the EC conference on Yugoslavia chaired by Lord Carrington as a
key forum for ensuring a durable and equitable political solution to the
outstanding problems of the former Yugoslavia, including constitutional
arrangements for Bosnia and Hercegovina. We call on all parties to resume
negotiations in that conference in good faith and without preconditions.
We also welcome close consultations between the conference chaired by Lord
Carrington, the EC, the United Nations and the other parties concerned with
the Yugoslav crisis.
These consultations could lead to the holding of a broader international
conference to address unresolved questions, including issues related to
minorities.
We stress the absolute need for the parties in former Yugoslavia to show the
will for peace, which is indispensable to success and without which the
peoples of former Yugoslavia will continue to suffer.
The tragic humanitarian situation especially in Bosnia and Hercegovina is
unacceptable. We fully endorse the efforts of the international community to
provide relief.
We welcome the efforts made in achieving the opening of the airport of
Sarajevo and we support actions taken by UNPROFOR (UN protection force) to
secure the airport. The blockade of Sarajevo must be lifted and the shelling
of the town stopped in order to sustain a comprehensive relief operation.
We express our gratitude to all participants in the airlift to Sarajevo and
the supply of its population.
We appeal to all parties in Bosnia and Hercegovina not to imperil the
humanitarian effort.
We firmly warn the parties concerned, including irregular forces, not to
take any action that would endanger the lives of those engaged in the relief
operation.
Should these efforts fail due to unwillingness of those concerned to
co-operate fully with the UN we believe the Security Council will have to
consider other measures, not excluding military means, to achieve its
humanitarian objectives.
The airlift to Sarajevo can only be the beginning of a larger humanitarian
effort. Safe access by road to Sarajevo as well as to other parts of Bosnia
and Hercegovina in need must be guaranteed.
The needs of the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons
require further significant financial support. We are willing to contribute
and ask others also to make fair contributions.
We underline the need for Serbia and Croatia to respect the territorial
integrity of Bosnia and Hercegovina and for all military forces not subject
to the authority of the government of Bosnia and Hercegovina to either be
withdrawn or disbanded and disarmed with their weapons placed under
effective international monitoring.
We call on all parties to prevent the conflict from spreading to other parts
of the former Yugoslavia.
We urge the Serbian leadership to respect minority rights in full, to
refrain from further repression in Kosovo and to engage in serious dialogue
with representatives of Kosovo with a view to defining a status of autonomy
according to the draft convention of the EC conference on Yugoslavia.
Sanctions decided by the UN Security Council in resolution 757 as well as
all other provisions of relevant UN resolutions must be fully implemented.
We support the efforts of the UN peacekeeping forces in implementing the UN
peace plan for Croatia in all its elements.
We demand that Serbs and Croats extend their full co-operation to the UN
peace plan and make every effort to bring the bloodshed in Croatia to an
end.
We do not accept Serbia and Montenegro as the sole successor state of the
former Yugoslavia. We call for the suspension of the delegation of
Yugoslavia in the proceedings of the CSCE and other relevant international
fora and organisations.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (15) - Key facts for the
business visitor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Population: Dubai is the second-largest of the seven emirates which make up
the United Arab Emirates. It has a population estimated at about 600,000 -
some 80 per cent of whom are expatriate workers predominantly from Asia and
the Indian sub-continent but also from Britain, elsewhere in Europe and the
US. The UAE's population overall is some 2m. Figures are estimates, given
that the last census was in 1985.
Geography: Dubai lies in the southern Gulf, some 160km north of Abu Dhabi,
around a natural creek. Sharjah, the UAE's third-largest emirate, is just
12km away up the coast to the north. Dubai is also within about four hours
drive of Muscat, capital of Oman. The emirate sits in flat desert along a
curving coastline, but within a half-hour's drive eastwards to hills and
Fujairah, the emirate on the Gulf of Oman, 1 1/2 hours away.
Political system: The emirate's ruler is Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid, who is
the vice-president and prime minister. However, the Sheikh runs the country
closely with his brothers, Sheikh Mohammed, Sheikh Hamdan, and Sheikh Ahmed.
Dubai's ruler, along with those of the other emirates, is a member of the
Supreme Council, the overall authority in the UAE, which was formed after
the British withdrawal from the Trucial Coast in 1971.
Climate: The emirate is arid and sub-tropical, with hot summers averaging
38-40 deg C and winters 23-25 deg C. January is the coolest month, July the
hottest. Clothing should therefore be light and cool and sleeves, if
possible, short.
Language: Arabic is the official tongue, although Urdu and Farsi are spoken
widely among the expatriate workers. But English is almost universally
spoken, both in business dealings and by government officials.
Time: The UAE is four hours ahead of GMT.
Business hours: In winter, government offices are open from 8am to 2pm from
Saturday to Wednesday but close at noon on Thursday, the first day of the
Islamic weekend. All offices close on Friday. Government departments tend to
work from 7am to 1pm in the summer. Business hours vary, but generally
offices open at 8am and close at about 1pm for lunch, before reopening at
3pm or 4pm until 6pm or 7pm.
Currency: The UAE Dirham is tied to the US dollar at a rate of about 3.67.
Hotels offer fast and efficient foreign exchange services although rates
vary slightly. Changing money in banks can prove a bureaucratic and
painfully slow process.
Media: Dubai has two English-language newspapers, the Kaleej Times and Gulf
News, which carry both local and a wide range of international news often
with a focus on Asia and the sub-continent. Both also have fairly
comprehensive news of business affecting the region. Most British newspapers
are available in hotels and newsagents the day after publication. Time,
Newsweek and The Economist are also widely available.
Dubai TV also offers an English-language channel while most five-star hotels
also have satellite TV English services, often including the BBC. Most also
have the Reuter wire service in their business centres. Dubai Radio also
broadcasts in English on 92Mhz FM.
Telecommunications: The code to reach the UAE is 971, to which 2 is added to
dial Abu Dhabi and 4 to reach Dubai. Dialling within the emirates also
requires the prefix 2 for Abu Dhabi when dialling from Dubai, and 84 to
reach Jebel Ali. The telephone system is of high standards and offers no
problems for most computer modems. Hotels will generally, if asked, rig up
appropriate plugs for modem access. All main hotels offer both telex and fax
services. Local phone calls are free, though payphones need Dh1 or 50 fils
for a connection.
Roads and driving: Dubai's main city roads are busy but generally efficient
and traffic police are tolerant of a newcomer's mistakes. Drivers new to the
Gulf should be wary of sometimes erratic local driving habits, particularly
on roads out of the city. The Dubai-Abu Dhabi road is among the UAE's
busiest, most worn and prone to the most accidents. At night, camels can be
a hazard.
Taxis and car hire: Dubai abounds in taxis, both outside the main hotels, at
ranks in the city and generally prowling the streets. An average journey
across the creek will cost about Dh20, but many drivers leave the price up
to the passenger - within reasonable limits. Car hire deals vary and it is
best to check first with one of the main hire companies, most of which are
represented in Dubai, before setting out. In Dubai, the average hire charge
is some Dh200 daily, before insurance charges. It is also worth comparing
hire rates with those in Sharjah where they can often be cheaper
Visas: Britons with right of abode in the UK do not require visas, but most
other nationals do. Most business visitors will also require a nominal
sponsor to enter the country. However, hotels can arrange one easily, as can
the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, which has offices in London,
Philadelphia, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Generally, it is faster and simpler to arrange visas and sponsorship either
through the board, the hotel or a business contact in Dubai itself rather
than through a UAE embassy. Israeli passport holders or those with Israeli
visas in their passports will not be allowed entry. There are two sorts of
visa, transit visas which allow a stay of 14 days inclusive of arrival and
departure days, and visit visas, which allow a stay of 30 days renewable
twice to a maximum of 100 days, including a 10-day grace period.
Arriving at the airport: The airport is efficient and, for most western
business visitors, fairly swiftly negotiated. Unlike its more conservative
neighbours, Customs regulations permit the import of 2 litres of spirits and
2 litres of wine, 2,000 cigarettes, 400 cigars or 2kg of tobacco. Taxis are
the best bet for reaching the town centre, some 10-15 minutes' drive, though
most big hotels also offer courtesy buses - including the International
Hotel which, although only a stone's throw from the airport itself, is best
reached by vehicle to save negotiating a busy road in the heat.
Alcohol: Hotels alone are licensed to sell alcohol, which is partly why
hotel restaurants and night-clubs are the centre of Dubai's night-life.
Post and courier service: The post is remarkably fast for the region, but
this is not surprising given that Dubai is an important airline hub. It has
also made the emirate a convenient centre for many large courier companies,
all the big names of which are represented.
Social and night-life: Hotels will publicise any special events but where to
shop, where to go and what to see are also set out in Dubai Visitor, which
most hotels make available, and in What's On, a monthly guide to society and
events in the UAE and Oman. The latter also publishes a directory of
special-interest clubs and societies.
Useful telephone numbers: The two most important telephone numbers in Dubai
at present are 100 for the operator and 180 for directory inquiries. In
June, the emirate began changing all numbers to accommodate growth in demand
for lines and faxes. If you have an old number, the operator or directory
inquiries will provide you with the new one.
Rather than provide a list of outdated numbers, therefore, we have decided
simply to list the main hotels and relevant organisations.
Hotels: Ambassador, Astoria, Carlton Towers, Chicago Beach, Dubai Marine
Hilton, International Hyatt Regency, Intercontinental, Jebel Ali
Metropolitan, Ramada, and Sheraton.
Airlines: Virtually all leading airlines are represented in Dubai. The Dubai
National Air Travel Agency (DNATA) represents almost half of the 55 airlines
using the airport.
Trade representations: Most foreign embassies are in Abu Dhabi. However,
many countries have consular representation in Dubai. Countries which do not
are Algeria, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Indonesia, Japan, Morocco,
Philippines, Spain, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Turkey and Yemen.
Many have trade offices in Dubai, including: American Business Council,
Australian Trade Centre, Bulgarian Trade Centre, Cyprus Trade Centre, Danish
Trade Centre, Egyptian Trade Centre, Far East Trade Services, Hong Kong
Trade Development Council, Hungarian Trade Centre, Engineering Export
Promotion Council (India), Italian Trade Centre, Japan External Trade
Organisation (Jetro), Korea Trade Centre, Netherlands Trade Representative,
Norway Export Promotions Council, Singapore Trade Centre, and Thailand Trade
Centre.
Other useful contacts: The Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board which
offers a range of information services and literature. The British Business
Group which acts as a forum for UK businessmen and women in the area and
publishes a useful contact brochure. The British Bank of the Middle East
which also publishes a guide to British and US businessmen and women in the
UAE.
The Dubai Ports Authority which oversees both Port Rashid and Jebel Ali
where its headquarters are based.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (14) - A hectic sporting
calendar / The emirate hosts many international events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dubai is probably the only place in the Gulf where the Sporting Life and the
Racing Post are widely available, writes Anne Counsell. Jostling for shelf
space alongside a wide range of sports magazines, the extent of interest in
the subject is evident.
Sport pervades almost all aspects of life in the emirate; many apartments
come with swimming pools, squash or tennis courts while watersports and
other facilities abound.
There are now so many tennis courts and pools that even the semi-government
agency which monitors sports facilities is unable to give precise numbers or
keep track of all the new developments.
A lack of fitness does not exclude anyone from the sporting scene - a
satellite television channel broadcasts all international sports events and
many pubs and restaurants show live sports coverage.
The sporting calender is jam-packed: at almost any time of the year, Dubai
is likely to be hosting an international sports event, drawing the world's
top players. Even at the height of the Gulf crisis in November 1990, snooker
stars nudged Saddam Hussein out of the headlines when they contested the
Pounds 200,000 Dubai Duty-Free Snooker Classic.
Shortly after came the Dubai Sevens, claimed to be the biggest international
rugby sevens tournament in the world.
Each December, the desert dust rises as the Dubai International Rally gets
underway, while the waters of the Gulf swirl to the Dubai Offshore Powerboat
Race and the Emirates Powerboat Race.
Sea and watersports are important to the maritime emirate which has recently
revived the traditional dhow sailing race, now held each May. Each entrant
builds a boat - a replica of those once used for coastal trading, pearling
and fishing - at a cost of up to Dh90,000.
Equestrian events also feature prominently; hardly suprising considering the
Maktoum's keen and extensive racing interests. The new racing track and the
Dubai Horse Show and polo events regularly draw top international riders.
Every imaginable sport is catered for and catalogued on the sporting
calendar. From ice skating and sand ski-ing to karate and chess, there is a
venue and a coveted trophy. The competitive spirit is embodied in Dubai
which fiercely defends its crown as sports capital of the Middle East. Where
else but Dubai would host the annual Highland Games with sporrans, the skirl
of bagpipes and cabers being tossed in the desert.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (13) - Travellers almost spoiled
for choice / Hotels / Vying for custom in an already highly competitive
sector produces some innovative marketing and bizarre promotions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dubai is in the middle of a hotel construction boom. Five luxury hotels,
bringing a further 2,000 rooms on stream, are under construction with
scheduled openings from next month to the end of 1993.
This is quite apart from plans for 37 two-star hotels and a proposal to
build two extensive tourist villages, each with full recreational
facilities. Travellers are already almost spoiled for choice with more than
8,500 existing rooms in four- and five-star hotels, and a present total of
173 hotels.
Standards are generally very high and the service is excellent. Vying for
custom in an already highly competitive sector produces some innovative
marketing. Promotions occasionally verge on the bizarre - such as the
Sheraton's plan to stage speed-boat racing up and down the Creek in central
Dubai.
In addition to a non-stop round of specialty food promotions, theatrical
productions, international bands, entertainers and exhibitions, the hotels
are also active in sponsoring and staging a host of sporting events.
They also serve as 'community centres' and are meeting-places for business,
evenings out, or just a coffee between friends, fulfilling a role rarely
played to the same extent in other societies.
Architectural students may also find the lobbies useful for a study of
building design and interpretation. The foyers, encompassing every
imaginable style from baroque, through Arabesque to art deco, or a pastiche
of several unlikely combinations, can be both awesome and entertaining. Even
allowing for widely divergent tastes, visitors cannot but admire the
ingenuity and often audacity of the architects who have been given free rein
with their creative talents.
The Sheraton has clearly set out to impress. Triangular in shape to afford
views over the Creek, its futuristic atrium is seven storeys high - the
levels cordoned off with railings, in changing colours to break the
starkness. Mainly open plan, there is no cosiness or privacy. A fountain
arrangement is cleverly executed. It starts with a gentle trickle and
descends through three floors and two waterfalls to end in a torrent.
The Ramada hotel makes a bold statement with its balconied foyer. One wall
of the atrium is composed of a 13-storey stained glass window - the tallest
such feature in the world at 135 feet high. In the Mogul style it
incorporates 28 species of flowers and shrubs in graduated colours and
requires 300 fluorescent tubes for illumination. On the opposite wall are
external cable-car lifts which descend into the coffee shop and ascend at
speed to afford a view of the glass mural.
Oozing opulence, the Royal Abjar Hotel is preparing its lobby for opening in
October. The pink marble floor uses geometric shapes, repeated throughout
the hotel, and is overlooked by a series of walkways and hanging gardens to
balance the sheer size of the foyer. External lifts with glass doors descend
into the lobby from where the floor-to-ceiling aquarium can be seen.
All the five-star hotels provide spacious and comfortable bedrooms with all
the trimmings. Each hotel offers its own little extras - such as the Tiara
Club for female executives at the Royal Abjar - but in essence they are all
excellent, with every useful facility. Catering largely for business
travellers, all the five-star hotels provide a range of fax, computer,
typing and secretarial services, although the services may not be 24-hour
unless requested in advance.
Standard rooms do not usually have plugs for modems but the business centres
can transmit any documents or material using their IBM-compatible computers.
Executive suites are typically provided with a personal fax but the
telephone bills can be expensive. Oddly it is less expensive to call the US
and England (Dh6 to Dh7.5 for three minutes) than France, Germany or Hong
Kong (Dh10 to Dh13).
Dubai is small and all areas are easily accessible, so hotel locations are
more a matter of preference than necessity. All the main establishments have
their own swimming pools, health clubs and tennis courts and offer a range
of leisure and other sports facilities. Many hotels provide courtesy buses
to their own beach clubs or one of the resorts. A list of hotels appears in
the guide.
The 'holiday' hotels include the Chicago beach hotel, the Dubai Marine,
Metropolitan and Hilton hotels which all have their own beach clubs, and the
Jebel Ali Hotel. The peak season for winter-sun seekers is October to April
but even then the expansive, clean sands are uncrowded.
The Chicago Beach is predominantly a self-contained tourist resort,
especially popular with Scandinavians and Germans for its watersport
facilities. The other hotels cater for a more mixed clientele of business
visitors, conference delegates and tourists.
The Hatta Fort hotel, popular for weekend breaks and out-of-the-way
conferences, nestles in the mountains some 100km from Dubai.
Surrounded by landscaped lawns, the hotel accommodation is in the form of
Swiss-style chalets, which are somehow not totally incongruous after a stay
in the city. Its lobby is modest by Dubai standards and the hotel features
stone-faced walls built from local rock.
Hotel tariffs start at about Dh580 per night for a five-star hotel and Dh400
for four-star. Prices vary quite considerably and do not usually include
breakfast.
It is worth bearing in mind that a 15 per cent service charge and 5 per cent
municipality tax are added to all hotel bills for any facility, including
meals and telephone calls.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (12) - Perfect mix of
ingredients / Incentive Holidays / Fun, sun and fantasies, but business
clients are never far away from five-star food and accommodation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medieval banquets, Venetian masked balls and Beefeaters charging among the
dunes do not raise eyebrows in Dubai. It is possible to stage the most
Disneyesque event and carry it off with the accompaniment of superb food and
five-star accommodation.
Little wonder that Dubai has captured the fertile imaginations of incentive
operators. They are always looking for different destinations, mostly for
business clients, and Dubai provides the almost perfect mix of the right
ingredients. It is off-beat enough to be exotic but in this case the
travel-speak does not mean roughing it. There is an efficient ground system
of experienced operators, in addition to a wide choice of excellent hotels.
Whacky incentives and corporate promotions could not be executed with the
same aplomb in many Arab countries. All well and good being lost in the
desert and fending off the marauding Bedouin, but the tired and thirsty
businessman will require a hotel with showers that work, and a drink. In
some other Arab countries, the paperwork required for a bash in the desert
would take until nightfall while the implications of helicopters circling
the dunes in somewhere like Syria are too awful to contemplate.
Business-based incentive travel fits the profile of Dubai's tourism
promotion drive. Business promotions, after all, are good for business -
large companies entertaining their clients who are, in turn, businessmen.
For a country which effectively has a No Backpackers sign at the airport,
this is good news. Lots of businessmen coming in, even if they do insist on
dressing up as tribesmen.
Dubai is well accustomed to the eccentricities of the English and the words
of Noel Coward have been adapted to account for the vagaries of business
promotions and incentive tours. Largely unsuitable for publication, the
refrain is: 'Mad dogs and businessmen go out in the desert sun'.
Ever vigilant on the opportunities front, Dubai's hotels have developed a
range of both tourist and business incentive programmes. The Hatta Fort and
Jebel Ali hotels produce tailored events, complete with drawbridge, longship
or any other props which may be required. They are a very good deal, with a
40 per cent discount on normal rates for groups of 15 people or more. Other
hotels are jumping on the wagon (stagecoach or canvas-covered, available on
day rates).
Ms Jill Thompson energetically operates a range of Dubai incentives in
co-operation with Gulf Ventures, part of the Gray MacKenzie travel group.
She enthusiastically reports considerable interest in Dubai incentives from
France, Germany and Spain. With wide experience of the Gulf region, Ms
Thompson was well placed to spot the advantages of the emirate and has
helped develop the promotion of Dubai incentives.
They are having the desired effect. Mr Tony McIver from Maritime &amp;
Mercantile International (MMI), enthuses over a recent desert jaunt. The
group set off for a desert outing and spent a couple of hours dune-climbing
in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
There is something exhilarating and perverse about racing up a dune and
plunging down the other side, defying both gravity and common sense.
Stranded in the desert after a breakdown, the driver set off to find help.
Several 'Bedouin' appeared over the horizon, each riding a camel decked in
the company colours and sporting the corporate logo, their riders bearing
gifts of company products. An enforced but thankfully short camel ride
later, the group were enjoying a barbecue, belly dancing and Arabian sunset
before being whisked back to their hotels by helicopter.
Mr McIver's verdict: Impeccable timing, perfectly executed, excellent fun
and jolly good for business.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (11) - A nightmare for weight
watchers / Eating out / International cuisine and specialty foods abound.
The open system for imports allows in all foods from all places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The wrong place to embark on a diet is Dubai; a weight-watcher's nightmare
and a gourmet's delight.
A taste of things to come begins on Emirates airline which serves
appetising, well-selected food and fine wines - for which its won its first
in a string of awards.
Hotels are the predominant eating places in Dubai, for the most part because
they offer such a range of quality cuisine but also restaurants outside
hotel premises are unlicensed and not permitted to sell alcohol.
International cuisine and specialty foods abound - French, Chinese, Indian,
Persian, Thai, Brazilian, Mexican, Persian, Italian and Arabic - and in
typical Dubai fashion there are 'International' menus offering a selection
from around the globe.
There is no published guide to the restaurants but a glance at the English
language newspapers - Gulf News or the Khaleej Times - and the What's On
magazine, will soon alert the hungry reader to a variety of tempting hotel
restaurants and food promotions.
The widest selection of eateries appears in the guise of 'pub' lunches and
bar snacks. Initially established to cater for the large British expatriate
contingent in Dubai, the pubs have become an almost obligatory part of every
hotel, akin to cement factories in the Arab industrial sector.
The 'traditional' English pub is carried off with varying degrees of
credibility and it is fascinating to try and fathom how this inherently
British institution has been perceived and copied, often to the horror of
purists. There is a disconcerting sense of deja vu on entering several of
the 'pubs' but this also makes them relaxing and informal - they are also
very good for meeting expatriate businessmen who gather in the dark recesses
for sandwiches and a beer.
Ignoring the fibre-glass beams, dart-boards, imitation hand pumps and other
'pub' embellishments, the food is generally value for money, served quickly
and ideal for a quick lunch or snack. The ubiquitous fish and chips is
unexpectedly good: local hammour (rock cod) served in a light batter costs
about Dh35 while 'ploughman's platters' arrive with large bowls of fresh,
crisp salad for about Dh25.
Hotel coffee shops provide a wide selection of meals at reasonable prices.
They are a better bet than more sumptuous (and expensive) formal dining
rooms if you intend to do any serious work in the afternoon. The Lou Lou
restaurant at the Sheraton, however, offers an excellent lunchtime buffet
for businessmen for about Dh100, complete with panoramic view of the Creek.
All the hotel coffee shops provide varied menus and reasonably priced
lunches. A pasta meal with seafood sauce, glass of wine and dessert costs
about Dh85 while the choice of fresh salad dishes is excellent. Vegetarian
food is easy to find and most hotels will also gladly 'adapt' dishes to
cater for particular tastes or requests.
Evenings are the time to savour and enjoy the cuisine. Arabian food makes up
an important part of most buffet spreads with Lebanese mezza - a selection
of salad, vegetable and meat dishes.
Fresh fish from the Gulf and the Indian Ocean - lobster, prawn, hammour,
tuna, kingfish, pomfret and red snapper - are resplendent on many menus.
Possibly the best sea-food restaurant is the Fish Market at the
Intercontinental Hotel. Guests select their fish - which arrive on the table
bigger than expected, even after gutting and removal of fins. The more
adventurous may sample grilled baby shark while the less daring gourmand
could do worse than indulge in Gulf king prawns fried in garlic, lemon and
butter. As with the fish, the bill also comes back larger than expected -
allow at least Dh200 per person for an indulgent evening out.
The Hyatt Regency has initiated a 'Progressive Dinner' held on a weekly
basis and enabling guests to work their way through the hotel's restaurants,
sampling a course from each for Dh100 per person. The evening ends with
dessert and coffee in the roof-top revolving restaurant.
Indian and Pakistani food is well represented in Dubai with restaurants
offering more than just a curry. There are delicately spiced dishes from the
north and fiery foods from the south, with the full range in between.
Cantonese, Szechuan and Shanghai specialties are served in separate
restaurants and there are also general Chinese restaurants with a wide
selection of each. A Chinese menu may be the only place that pork dishes are
in evidence. In accordance with the Moslem faith, food is generally prepared
by the halal method and rashers on the breakfast table will invariably turn
out to be beef. Pork dishes are, however, comparatively expensive.
Dubai imports almost 90 per cent of its food requirements - milk, yoghurts,
cheeses are locally available as are a selected few fruits and vegetables.
Dubai's open system for imports allows in virtually all foods from all
places. Despite the air freight, other transport and refrigeration costs,
stated prices are reasonable by international standards although a 15 per
cent service charge and 5 per cent municipality tax pushes up the final
bill.
Although the restaurants outside hotels are unlicensed, they are air
conditioned, clean and culinary adventures in their own right. The Iranian
restaurant opposite the World Trade Centre is highly recommended by the
locals. A meal of soup, salad buffet with a meat and rice dish costs about
Dh110 for two. The menu is mainly kebabs and rice and the food simple but
tasty.
Ravis in the Satwa district is a no-frills Indian restaurant. The kitchen
opens out onto the pavement and there are two eating areas, a cafe
frequented by Indian workers and an adjacent 'family room' where expatriate
teenagers gather for soft drinks and a chat. The menu is basic Indian fare
and very cheap. Chicken tikka, mutton and vegetables with rice and side
dishes costs Dh19 - less than the Dh20 taxi fare from the business district
hotels. The curry house was used by the Dubai rugby club for its annual
black jacket and tie bash - but anything goes in Dubai and it would take a
lot more to upset the serene waiters.
There are many other small restaurants and bistros in Deira, Bur Dubai and
Jumeirah and anyone on an extended stay should consider venturing out of the
hotels and exploring the local scene. Fast food outlets and ice-cream
parlours can be found in or near the shopping centres while stands serving
shawarma (grilled shavings of meat inside Arabic bread) and kebabs are
tucked away in the souks. It is hard to go hungry in Dubai.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (10) - Start here and nowhere is
hard to get to / Location has been an important factor in the emirate's
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nowhere is hard to get to from Dubai - which is hardly surprising given that
Dubai's location betwixt Europe and the Far East has been one of the prime
motors of its development, writes Mark Nicholson.
Within the emirates itself, Dubai is 10 minutes' drive from Sharjah and a
series of shortish hops thereafter to Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain and Ras al
Khaimah. The Indian Ocean emirate of Fujairah is just an hour-and-a-half's
drive over the mountains, while Abu Dhabi is two hours away by road to the
south-west along what is perhaps the emirates' least impressive and most
hazardous main route. The daily Emirates Air services shuttle from Dubai
airport is less hair-raising, and would probably be even if undertaken in a
Sopwith Camel.
Muscat, the capital of Oman, is also within four hours' drive, but visitors
will be allowed entry only on production of a No Objection Certificate. It
is best sought well before leaving because obtaining one takes time to work
through the bureaucracy. The same advice holds for all other Gulf states,
all of which require visas for non-Gulf nationals.
Most other Gulf states are best reached by air. Gulf Air, in which Abu Dhabi
holds a stake, flies four times daily to Bahrain, twice a day to Doha and
once to Muscat. Emirates Air flies twice daily to Kuwait City, as does
Kuwait Airways. Saudia, the kingdom's carrier, has six flights a day to
Riyadh, four to Jeddah and three to Dhahran, the oil centre on the east
coast.
Sanaa, Yemen's capital, can be reached four times a week with Yemenia. Iran
Air flies twice weekly to Bandar Abbas and Tehran, as does Emirates, Dubai's
carrier. Both also fly to Shiraz at least once weekly.
For all trips in and around the Gulf, it is worth checking the Moslem
calendar, since flights tend to book solid in the days just before and just
after the main Eid holidays in the first half of the year.
Further-flung destinations are if anything even better served. The huge
number of Asian and Indian expatriates in Dubai, combined with its
traditional place as a fuelling stop for European-Asian flights means that
there are several daily flights to most big Indian and Pakistani cities,
Singapore, Hong Kong and, though slightly fewer, to Tokyo. Most big European
cities are similarly well served and from July Emirates is to add Paris,
Rome and Zurich to its European stops.
Dubai is replete with travel agents. The biggest is the Dubai National Air
Travel Agency, headquartered in the vast Airline Centre off the main airport
road. to the airport. DNATA is the main agent for 25 of the 55 airlines
which use Dubai International airport. House of Travel, a Kuwaiti-owned
business, also offers a 24-hour booking service and associated car hire and
hotel bookings.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (9) - Business is the very
fabric of Dubai / Ethos / A relative absence of red tape reflects the
commitment to attract more investment and enterprises. According to Dubai's
glossy literature, there is no better place to do business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There is some good reason why expatriates should refer to this Gulf port as
'Do Buy' rather than in impeccably correct phonetic Arabic. If people here
are not selling things, they are as often as not selling the marketing to
sell them better.
Business is the very fabric of Dubai and the fabric of business itself is
sold as hard as the cotton garments which are made up locally, sewn with
designer labels and shipped off towards America, Europe, Iran, Pakistan or
anywhere else that can pay.
Believe the glossy literature, much of it pumped out with abandon by the
Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, and there is no better place in
the world to do business. No taxes, no recruitment problems, no currency
restrictions, efficient services, abundant energy, hassle-free bureaucracy
and a market of over 1bn people (if you include places within range of
Dubai's airport, that is).
Much of it is true. But - and it is a sizeable 'but' for anyone unrehearsed
in Gulf ways - there are some things the brochures do not mention about
business in Dubai which a visitor will notice well before he or she spots
the market of 1bn people.
Getting into Dubai is the first small hurdle. Only Gulf nationals and
Britons, whose privileged status is a relic of empire, require no visa.
Everyone else must apply for entry visas before arrival. Obtaining one from
a United Arab Emirates embassy is usually just a formality, but the process
can be expedited considerably by seeking a visa through either the Commerce
and Tourism Board (whose overseas offices are listed in this survey's
Business Guide) or a hotel in the emirate (also listed). Along with visas,
Dubai also requires visitors to have sponsors, which again can usually be
best arranged through either hotels, the board or, if you have one, a good
local business contact.
That leads to a second proviso. Nothing in Dubai can be accomplished with
reasonable speed without having a good local Arab or Arab-speaking contact.
Although 'who you know' matters less in Dubai than anywhere else in the Gulf
 -and arguably than anywhere in the Middle East - it still counts for a lot.
There is no shortage - rather a glut - of advice available about how to
enter Dubai's business world, mainly from the Commerce and Tourism Promotion
Board. Moreover, the emirate's way of business is so wholly western in
approach that there is very little about the place which appears foreign.
Dubai's government ensures that this so by paying some people good salaries.
That, in turn, raises the question of Dubai's government, and the issue of
bureaucracy. Some established local businessmen will tell you with a grin
that Dubai has no government. Some newer enterprises, still unravelling
residual pieces of red tape, are less positive on this score.
It is certainly true that Dubai's government - essentially the Makhtoum
brothers together with their respective offices and ministries - appears to
do everything in its power to cut to a minimum the sort of form-filling and
foot-tapping bureaucracy for which other Gulf states have become legendary.
Earlier this year, it established a ministry of the economy, headed by the
youthful Mr Mohammed al-Abbar who spent six years running a government
property company in Singapore. Its specific purpose is to eliminate
bureaucratic delay, collect and collate useful economic data and, generally,
to be a 'service-oriented company'.
More than this, Dubai also set up in the early 1980s the Jebel Ali free
trade zone, a sprawling 67-berth port 30 minutes' drive from Dubai in which
410 companies have already established themselves as 100 per cent owners.
They pay no corporate taxes for 15 years - a holiday renewable for a further
period of the same length - can repatriate all profits and benefit from
cheap power, ample land and cheap labour, and a smart resort hotel.
The whole concept was revolutionary in the Gulf. As a result of it, Dubai
won few friends in the region but many friends from elsewhere. But even
doing business in 'hassle-free' Jebel Ali can suffer from delays. For
instance, one new arrival disputes marketing claims that gaining a licence
to operate in Jebel Ali takes only 30 days.
He says that it took him three times as long and he could accomplish nothing
until he had obtained it - no telephone, and so no headed notepaper or
business cards; not even a driving licence. 'It's a shock when you come from
a European system', he observes.
Nevertheless, Jebel Ali is probably as bureaucracy-free as anywhere in the
Middle East. Indeed, the local rule of thumb in Dubai is that red tape
proliferates the further one ventures from this free port into the
surrounding Gulf.
Anyone setting up a company in Dubai proper must do so with a local partner
owning a majority share, as is the practice elsewhere in the Gulf. The forms
of ownership, agency agreements and company structures vary widely and are
negotiable up to a point and apparently binding rules can be side-stepped
but with some assistance.
A new commercial law has been expected for some time. Its aim is to codify
all forms of joint venture or corporate arrangements in the United Arab
Emirates. But its details have still to be formulated adding an element of
uncertainty to launching a new enterprise.
The effects of this uncertainty should not be overstated. Dubai is too eager
to invite new investment and fresh business to allow much to discourage
them. And whatever vestigial delaying Gulf practices remain, the emirate's
business culture is essentially western in feel.
For most practical purposes, for example, not a single Berlitz Arabic phrase
is required - nearly all transactions can be conducted in English.
While Jebel Ali is a corporate nirvana in the Gulf, Dubai is a manageable
hinterland, albeit one muddied by 'a quagmire of clerks', in the words of
one local.
The UAE federal government, the next grudgingly conceded layer of authority
and one referred to usually as Abu Dhabi, is viewed by many natives of Dubai
as a rather strange place up the coast without a golf course.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (7) - Thriving bit of living
history / Historic creek / Wooden dhows still moor seven or eight abreast
along the quay but modern development has radically changed the landscape.
And a new facelift is under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best bit of living history in Dubai is its creek, where neither the
shape of the wooden dhows, nor their profitable trade, have changed much
since 800 settlers, led by the the Maktoum family, deserted Abu Dhabi to set
up shop on its shores more than 160 years ago.
Only the contents of the galleon-hulled boats, and the replacement of sails
by diesel engines, mark the tides of time. Stacked boxes of Sony TVs,
Zanussi fridges or plastic-wrapped Japanese car tyres along the quay are
recent additions to hand-written cargo manifests which still include the
bags of rice and spices which have always found their way from Dubai's port
to Iran, Pakistan, India and beyond.
While locals are keen to point out that little arrives illicitly in Dubai -
customs officials say illegal drug imports are minor and hotly pursued by
the police - it is still a thriving source of smuggling into Iran, India and
Pakistan. 'We pay no taxes to work here,' says one Indian shipper. 'But we
use the money we save to pay the Iranian police.'
The creek was also once among the world's biggest gold trading centres,
mostly supplying gold to India. At its peak in the late 1960s, Dubai was
importing 280 tons of gold for re-export, a figure down to just over 100
tons these days.
Dubai's creek curls further inland than any other in the emirates, and has
traditionally been the coast's busiest and most cosmopolitan. The earliest
settlers lived on the western spit of Shindaghah, now essentially part of
Port Rashid, Dubai's man-made port, but by the late nineteenth century, a
large Indian community had settled on the western Dubai side of the creek,
with Arabs and Persians principally on the eastern Deira shore.
By the late 1800s Dubai was already the busiest trading port among the
Trucial States, named after their treaty agreement with colonial Britain,
and among the busiest pearling centres, a trade worth around Pounds 1.5m a
year to the region at the turn of the century, before the advent of the
Japanese cultured pearl killed the industry in the late 1920s.
But trade, notably dhow trade smuggling sugar, tea, cloth and gold into
Persian and Indian ports, flourished. By 1951, Gray &amp; Mackenzie, the British
shippers, built Dubai's first port crane, which still stands near the
ruler's office, where all cargo was unloaded.
The first road bridge over the creek, the Maktoum Bridge which is soon to be
replaced with a newer eight-lane cousin, was opened in only 1963, before
which passengers between Dubai and Deira had either to drive around the
creek to the north, or cross on the small wooden abra vessels (water taxis)
which still dissect the dhows' paths today.
By the mid 1960s Dubai's creek was full to bursting with dhows and steamers,
and the arrival of pioneering oil construction companies such as McDermott
to Dubai, so clogged the emirate's main artery that Sheikh Rashid, the
father of the present ruler, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum, decreed
the building of Port Rashid, adjacent to the creek and still Dubai's busiest
port.
With the later addition of Jebel Ali port in 1979, the creek's contribution
to Dubai's trade has diminished considerably to around half a per cent of
the total tonnage landed yearly in Dubai. But it thrives about its own
business as ever, with dhows lining the length of the eastern shore moored
three, four, or even seven or eight abreast - congestion which a new marina
to be built over the next year or so is designed to clear.
The quay is busiest at dusk, as steel-shouldered crew load the wooden dhows,
bhoums and launches - which, old as they appear, have for the most part been
built recently - with bundles, boxes and, in some cases, and with the
minimum of mechanical assistance, small cars, ready for the two-day journey
to Kish Island or Bandar Abbas in Iran, or on to Karachi in Pakistan.
Most of the boats are chartered by local shippers. One, typically, was
loaded with 700 Sony TVs bound for Kish Island in Iran, a trip for which a
local electronics distributor had paid Dh7,000, having unloaded the Sonys
from Port Rashid for re-export.
Most of the Iranian, Indian, Pakistani or Sri Lankan crewmen live very
simply on board their boats, beneath the flat sunshade canopies at the rear,
housing a few basic mattresses and perhaps a small barbecue or the
occasional hubble-bubble pipe.
Today, the creek where Wilfred Thesiger, the great British Arabist explorer
of the 1940s, watched as 'naked children romped in the shallows, and rowing
boats patrolled the creek to pick up passengers from the mouths of alleys,
between high coral houses, surmounted with square wind-turrets' is lined on
the east by a motley collection of bold and modernistic high-rises and
retains its romance only at quay side.
Gone too is the British Bank of the Middle East's 'very special lavatory'
remembered by Edward Henderson, the Iraq Petroleum Company's representative
in Dubai in the late 1940s.
This, he recalls, 'was really no more than a platform sticking out over the
water, with the essential slit in its middle, tastefully boxed in and
screened from view with palm branches'.
But changed as it is, the creek is in for a further facelift. A grassy
18-hole golf course on the north-eastern side of the creek, Dubai's second,
is already almost complete, and a further illuminated nine hole course and
yacht club will follow.
On the west bank, earth is already being moved to create what will become
Dubai's biggest and greenest park while at the end of the creek, near where
a shallow lagoon has become a temporary home to hundreds of flamingos, the
occasional osprey, reef herons and countless plovers and shanks, is planned
a theme park.
'The old creek is coming under a lot of developmental pressure,' remarks Mr
Lawrence Mills of the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotions Board.
Thesiger, contemplating the creek more than 50 years ago, reflected that
'here life moved in time with the past', adding, regretful of his
distinguishing European garb, that 'I myself felt that I was little better
than a tourist'.
How times have changed.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (8) - Up the Creek without a
handrail / An 'abra' water taxi ride is not for the faint-hearted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German lady in the group decided against it and called a taxi. The
precipitous steps down to the quay were bad enough, but the sight of the
flat boats banging together in the murky water proved too much, writes Anne
Counsell.
An 'abra' water taxi ride across the Creek is not for the faint-hearted.
There are no niceties such as handrails or handles, or even seats.
The only concession to comfort is a length of striped canvas overhead to
shield passengers from the sun, but this seems gratuitous since travellers
have, save for a piece of carpet or tiling, to perch on the scorching heat
of the engine casing.
A raised plank is the only barrier between passengers and the water a foot
below.
Some abras, when laden with Indian workers, appear to be only the width of
the plank away from sinking.
The drivers, using a small wheel which turns the wooden rudders, appear to
obey few accepted rules of the waterways - heading straight for the nearest
docking point from all directions and often denting the sun-bleached wood of
the boats and the quay in the jostle to moor.
There are no tickets on the abras and the fares are collected after the boat
casts off. Its a good idea to have a handful of change as you may not see
much back from a note in the scramble to disembark.
An hour-long trip around the Creek is worthwhile, costing Dh40. It takes in
most of the sights and provides an insight into Creek activity.
There is a slight breeze which makes the journey more pleasant than
attempting to sightsee on foot and an abra is a far better vantage point
than a taxi. Short abra crossings can also be included in city tours which
are run by most of the travel operators.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (6) - Carving out their own
market niche / Conferences / All the main hotels have facilities while the
World Trade Centre leads the way with both exhibitions and conferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unashamedly promoting itself as the last word in luxury, the soon-to-be
opened Royal Abjar Hotel's list of features includes: 'wide door space to
drive in vehicles for product launches.'
This, appearing alongside descriptions of lavish elegance, such as 2,200kg
of crystal chandeliers cascading from the ceiling, illustrates the emphasis
on and the importance accorded to fairs and seminars. Extravagant
furnishings are the jam, conferences and trade promotions are the bread and
butter.
Hotels have carved out their own niche in the market. Attracting a steady
flow of press conferences and business gatherings, the spin-offs include the
provision of catering facilities and accommodation for those attending the
gathering. In April and May there were nearly 300 product launches -
everything from a new nail varnish to the Ford Aerostar compact bus - with
more than half staged in hotels.
Notice boards in hotel foyers make interesting reading and are tantamount to
advertising bulletin boards. In the space of three days, one hotel staged a
seminar on 'Investment in East Germany' held by the Treuhand privatisation
agency, two product launches, a shipping conference, a bankers' business
lunch and a kiwi fruit promotion.
All the main hotels can boast of sizeable display facilities and a variety
of meeting rooms furnished with presentation aids from flip charts,
projectors and videos to, in some cases, electronic voting and translation
services.
In tandem with its increased trading activities, the emirate has developed
the trade promotion and display side to a sophisticated level. A case in
point was Dubai Airport's state-of-the-art Cargo Village and the prestigious
'91 Airshow. The official opening of the freight handling and storage
complex was timed to coincide with the air show in November.
At the very time that the international aerospace industry needed to bring
in cumbersome and expensive aircraft equipment for the high-profile show,
the ribbon for the cargo village was cut. Clearance times through the
freight terminal had been honed down to just 13 minutes and the air show
subsequently went on to put Dubai firmly on the aerospace circuit, third in
size after Farnbrough and Paris. Hotels are already fully booked for the '93
Dubai Airshow.
Similarly, the defence exhibition staged in January this year attracted a
lot of interest from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the Gulf crisis still fresh in
their memories. Equipment such as the Starbust laser-guided anti-aircraft
missile was on display alongside armoured vehicles, weaponry and
surveillance systems. Sales and contract figures were not readily
forthcoming but were respectively estimated as being 'large' and 'good.'
Leading the way in both exhibitions and conferences is the World Trade
Centre (WTC). Putting itself on the map was accomplished in physical terms
by virtue of its size - at 39 storeys it is the tallest building in the
Arabian Gulf. Making its mark on the international exhibitions circuit has
been achieved by a combination of efficiency and sheer audacity on the part
of the centre's dynamic management team.
Epitomising the free trade spirit of the emirate, the centre pulled off the
Middle East International Motor Show in record time and against all the
odds. In November 1991, two years ahead of schedule, the Dubai motor show
became international and succeeded in attracting manufacturers such as BMW
which had declined to exhibit their 5-series Touring at London's Motorshow.
Forlorn exhibitors, who had moped around at the Frankfurt, London and Tokyo
motor fairs, depressed by strikes, recession and stock market falls, brought
their vehicles to Dubai and found a booming market and sales. The trade
centre then did it again with the Watersport and Powerboat show in February.
May saw the 'Britain in the Gulf 92 ' exhibition, the largest mounted in the
Arab World with 250 British companies displaying their products. Exhibitors
such as Starlite Chandeliers, sold their entire stock before the exhibition
started and notched up a Pounds 115,000 order on the first day. FEL
International negotiated a Pounds 3.5m order for four straddle cranes.
The calender of exhibitions and conferences at the centre now extends to 40
a year and encompasses every sector from oil and gas to computing and
camels, fashion and overseas investment. The WTC is a member of the World
Trade Centres Association and is supported by its own residential apartments
complex and on-site hotel, the Hilton. The three exhibition halls with
adjacent external display areas provide a total of 14,509 square metres of
internal floor space plus 6,120 square metres for outdoor exhibiting, all
backed by an array of administrative and management services.
The WTC has also established a management development centre offering a
range of courses in management and results-oriented training, in addition to
an Arabic language centre with a range of general and private courses at all
levels.
Succumbing to the jam side of the conferences business, the centre has set
up the World Trade Club on the top floor of the tower. Its membership list
reads like a Who's Who of the region's senior businessmen and, like the
Royal Abjar Hotel, it oozes luxury with panelled dining rooms on different
themes.
A recent conference entitled the 'Travel Trade Forum' drew participants from
leading hotel chains, international airlines and global marketing agencies.
The active management of the World Trade Centre, rubbing shoulders with
tourism ministers and senior advisers and mingling with speakers from the
Economist Intelligence Unit and the City University Business School, seems
to have followed the line of one of the conference's workshops: 'Even if
you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (5) - Nature turned on its head
/ Emirates Golf Club / The course is both a masterpiece of modern
engineering and a defiant snub to the surrounding desert
</HEADLINE>

The Emirates Golf Club is as much a source of national pride as it is a
hefty display of one-upmanship over Dubai's neighbours.
Locals delight in repeating an old joke: 'Five years ago Bahrain, Abu Dhabi
and Dubai each decided to build a golf course - Bahrain is still arguing
over its location, Abu Dhabi continues to study the plans while Dubai plays
its 100,000th round.'
Dubai has a right to gloat; the course is a masterpiece of modern
engineering and a defiant snub to the ravages of the surrounding desert.
Even the glossy brochures and superlatives showered upon the club do not
prepare the first-time visitor for the sheer impact of seeing nature turned
on its head.
Standing emerald green amid miles of yellow sand in all directions, the golf
course is tantamount to a national monument. The first grass course in the
Middle East and the first championship golf course between Rome and
Singapore, the Emirates Golf Club was designed and built to impress. The
striking architecture of the clubhouse, symbolising the traditional Bedouin
tent, the pristine fairways and imaginative landscaping are replete with
five-star service and flamingoes.
The 700,000 square metres are landscaped with thousands of cooling
Casuarinas, Royal South American Palms, Washingtonias and giant Arizona
cacti. The daily requirement of 500,000 gallons of desalinated water arrives
via a 5km pipeline across the desert from an aluminium smelter.
The irrigation system challenges belief and Middle East temperatures with
750 computer-controlled pop-up sprinklers. A triumph of brute engineering,
it also one of the best advertisements for Dubai.
Now one of the most popular and prestigious venues on the PGA (Professional
Golf Association) European Tour, it has been played by all the top
international players. Around the world, thousands of armchair golfers who
know next to nothing else about Dubai, know about the golf course - some can
even describe the lakeside green of the ninth hole in detail.
Millions of dollars spent on advertising would not have implanted such
positive connotations of Dubai nor reaped such handsome dividends.
The economic spin-offs can not be overstated - the Emirates Golf Club is a
big asset, acting as a catalyst for both tourism and business. Such is its
success that a second course, the Dubai Creek, is under construction and
nearing completion.
Almost surpassing previous engineering feats, the Creek clubhouse traces the
lines of a sailing dhow and affords a panoramic view of the city. Membership
of the Emirates Golf Club spans senior executives from multinationals,
international institutions and leading banks - and accordingly the club
provides a comprehensive range of corporate facilities.
The club management is not certain which makes up the larger proportion of
its clientele - the golfers who then find business or the businessmen who
come to play to golf. Either way, golf in Dubai is big business.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (4) - A formidable choice of
goods / Shopping / This consumer's paradise seems to be approaching
saturation point and over-capacity as an ever-increasing number of new
shopping centres open their doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If you have the money to pay for it, you can get anything in Dubai and if
you can't afford an original there are always some very good copies to be
found. The choice of goods is formidable and even the most ardent, dedicated
shopper would be hard pressed to cover all the retailing areas and the souks
in a week of intense consumerism. Even if this were accomplished, another
centre would open in the interim.
Hub is probably the most over-used term in Dubai - employed to describe the
emirate's role in everything from trade and travel to commerce and sport.
But for shopping it is an appropriate word in the context of the Gulf
region. Although Dubai's facilities are not yet on the scale of Singapore's
dedicated centres, the choice there is vast and prices are low. But
saturation point appears to be nearing as far as the local market is
concerned with over-capacity looming as ever more centres open their doors
with a fanfare of publicity.
A large watch distributor estimated that the existing shops contained three
watches for every man, woman and child in Dubai, many of whom already own
several. This is apart from the designer copies and cheap digital watches
which find their way into the souks and shops in the Indian districts. As
for clothes, a comparable figure may well be the contents of five walk-in
wardrobes per person.
Electrical goods move through Dubai at great speed and all the latest models
of leading brands are available at very competitive prices. Shoppers should
not be deterred by the appearance or size of electronics shops. Dealers
rarely have the time or inclination to display goods properly because they
sell so fast.
The electronics souk near the Ambassador Hotel comprises a host of small
shops selling everything from a mini-calculator to a hi-fi set, but it is
advisable to check whether the warranties are international. Jumbo
Electronics, National Electronics and Eros Electronics are known locally for
their TVs, videos and compact discs. Cassette tapes (Thomsun Originals) are
widely available and cost a mere Dh6 while compact discs retail for Dh60.
Dubai's boutiques offer designer and international brand names at reasonable
prices compared to the fashion houses of Europe. Al Maktoum Street and the
Satwa area have many clothes shops for men and women, as do all the main
shopping centres and hotels. Designer copies, many of them of quite high
quality and well-executed, can be found in the Karama district. A fake
'Chanel' T-shirt at Dh30 is one third the price of an original, while the
price differentials on luggage is even greater - an entire fake 'Gucci'
suitcase and travel set can be bought for less than the cost of an original
Gucci hold-all.
Many of the new shopping malls are eerily empty during the day with only a
few uncomfortable-looking shoppers in the marble-clad halls. The evenings -
traditional shopping hours in Arab countries - are busier. However, the
majority of people are in the coffee shops, pizza restaurants and ice-cream
parlours because the shopping centres serve as meeting places and venues for
family outings. Recognising this, the Galleria complex next to the Hyatt
Regency hotel has built its shopping area around an ice rink.
Residents acknowledge they are spoiled for choice and variously attribute
the lack of shoppers to a variety of factors. 'Everyone is too busy working
to shop,' says one businessman while his wife bemoans the tendency for
shopping centres to open with too much publicity and only a few units. The
Bur Juman centre has only 30 per cent of its units open for retailing one
month after opening, while the Wafi centre near the airport recently secured
Salam stores to bring its occupancy up to 85 per cent - 16 months after its
launch.
Developers and property managers are unperturbed by the apparent lack of
customers. The marketing manager of a large property management agency says:
'We have no Canary Wharf here - all the developments are paid for, there is
no borrowed money on the construction side.'
Such optimism also prevails at the of the Dubai Commerce and Tourism
Promotion Board. Mr Lawrence Mills, the board's chief executive, shrugs off
questions about the proliferation of shopping centres. 'It is up to
individuals where they put their money,' he says. 'Now everyone wants to
build shopping centres, but if the mood and the market change, those
buildings could become hotels, apartments, offices or whatever. . . Dubai is
very adaptable.' The developers continue to 'adapt' - last month Lamcy, the
largest department store in the United Arab Emirates, opened its doors.
Somewhat exaggerating its merits with a claim to contain 'the world and more
in a single store,' the Dh25m complex contains 66 departments, dominated by
Dubai's largest electronics department, spread over 18,000 square feet.
Many of the centres are impressively laid out and well-designed but somewhat
antiseptic and impersonal. Shops display 'fixed prices' signs to notify
would-be customers that there will be no discounts or haggling. This is also
the practice in the main shopping areas, although there is an informal 'last
price' system whereby shopkeepers will climb down from the price shown on
the tag. If a shopper has the time and energy, prices can be beaten down by
five-10 per cent, often through persistence over several days.
Arab antiques and curios such as worry beads, soapstone figures, silver
boxes and pearling knives used by divers can be found in Al Nasr square and
the shopping arcades of hotels, but the prices are quite steep. Inlaid
rosewood boxes from Pakistan and brass camels or coffee pots are around 30
per cent more expensive than the same items in Sharjah's beautiful souk a
20-minute drive away.
It is well worth the effort to visit the upstairs galleries of the
impressive building on the neighbouring emirate's Corniche. Saddle bags,
incense burners, rugs, carpets, muzzle-loading guns and almost any 'Arabian'
or 'Oriental' treasures are jammed into small, dusty shops which have a
distinctly Arab feel.
The time-pressed businessman who cannot trail around all the malls and
centres still cannot avoid the shops - every large hotel has an impressive
arcade selling everything from razor blades to designer ball gowns. Shopping
is unavoidable in Dubai - even if you try to leave without having set foot
in a single retail establishment the Dubai Duty Free in the airport beckons.
The complex has more than 20 shops and is the largest single duty-free
operation in the world. There is even a Duty Free for arriving passengers.
Considering all the temptations, it is hardly surprising that Emirates
airline makes more money on excess baggage than it does at the duty free
shop.
In contrast to the often echoing emptiness of the shopping centres, Dubai's
souks (markets) are bustling, lively and noisy. In the wholesale market,
running parallel to the Creek on the Deira side, large suitcases full of
cash are opened in shop doorways and row upon row of clothing changes hands.
Narrow streets are jammed with vehicles and people, while goods spill onto
the pavement and cluttered shop windows are obscured by external hanging
displays.
However, the souks are not Arab bazaars such as those in the Maghreb,
Damascus, Cairo or Yemen. Customers are more likely to encounter an Indian
proprietor and will not find the sweet glass of tea, haggling and the
livestock associated with an 'Arab' souk. In essence, the souks are shops,
not stalls, and they are open for business rather than a chat over sludgy
beverages. Even haggling is perfunctory: carefully-cultivated clicks of the
tongue and heavenward glances, feigned disinterest or theatrical horror are
all but wasted. Negotiation is the operative word and discounts, sometimes
sizeable, can be secured but seldom haggled.
Dubai's main souk area comprises seven alleys of assorted shops -
predominantly hardware, household items and clothes. Located near the main
abra (water taxi) station, it adjoins the spice souk and a short distance
away is the gold market. A far cry from the 'dark caves' described by
Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, in 1948, the souk nevertheless
retains its own character despite being surrounded by extensive building and
development in recent years. Mostly cheap and cheerful though the wares are,
it is unlikely the casual visitor would wish to purchase brightly-coloured
foam mattresses or cauldron-like cooking pots. But some of the side streets
house more interesting shops where curios and Arab artefacts such as
hubble-bubble pipes, veils and falconry accoutrements can be found.
Asense of Dubai's history is evoked in the nearby spice souk. Sacks of
cardamom, saffron, coffee and rose petals are stacked in a covered alleyway
while the small shops are bursting with jars, bowls and bags of assorted
aromatic spices. The smell pervades the area and lingers in the air long
after closing time.
Evocative of times past, the spice souk has a heady atmosphere. Earthenware
incense lamps hang from the ceiling while chillis, dried nuts, apricots,
cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, green and yellow peppers and henna crowd
the shelves in confectionery jars, buckets, jars and other receptacles.
A short walk away from the spice market lies the gold souk. Its rows of
intricate jewellery and lines of orderly shops offer soothing respite after
a walk through the spice market.
It feels almost self-indulgent just to gaze upon the myriad adornments
filling the windows and display cabinets.
The Dh800,000 construction of a parking area, wood-covered walkway and paved
pedestrian area through the souk are underway and thankfully have begun to
restore a semblance of its original character - just before it risked
becoming a gold shopping mall.
All the jewellery is sold by weight and priced according to carat. The
difference is a mere 1 per cent tax which makes it a decidedly attractive
buy.
There is an additional charge of Dh4-Dh15 per gramme for smithed work -
either done by hand in India and shipped to Dubai or machined locally - with
the price depending on the work involved.
Most merchants also deal in precious stones and pearls, for which Dubai was
once famous although for many years the latter have been mainly cultivated
and from Japan. You can be assured that, if you are told that a stone is a
diamond it will not turn out to be cut glass.
The shops in the souk are closely monitored and trade descriptions are
checked.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (3) - Take a break by the Indian
Ocean / Fujairah / Beyond the Hajar mountains is a coastline which is as as
sweepingly picturesque as any on the Arabian peninsula
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Anyone feeling beaten into submission by hard-sell, high-octane Dubai could
do worse than drive the hour and a half over the Hajar mountains to the
United Arab Emirate's stretch of Indian Ocean coast. It is sandwiched
between Oman and the Sultanate's exiled territory on the Musandam peninsula
which guards the Straits of Hormuz.
This 70 km of coast is as sweepingly picturesque as any on the Arabian
Peninsula. Its small towns are a good deal sleepier than their bustling
high-rise cousins on the Gulf coast. Even here, though, modernity has crept
over the mountains, and visitors are more likely to bump into groups of
western skin divers than gaily turbaned fishermen hauling in shoals of
anchovies and sardines.
Nevertheless, once out of Dubai and through the neighbouring emirate of
Sharjah, the dual carriageway road opens into pleasingly be-cameled desert
scrub, complete with acacia-studded dunes. After an hour, and a right turn
at the one-camel town of Masafi, the road weaves through Hajar's craggy
basalt peaks and deep gulches to the flats on which stands Fujairah, the
lone eastward facing emirate.
Fujairah has no oil and for years depended solely on its fishing industry,
and the compact concrete town which houses its 50,000 or so inhabitants
reflects its more slender means. But its Indian Ocean shores were plied
liberally with cautious trade during the Gulf war, enabling the emirate
better to afford the de rigueur international airport and beside it the
cement factory which is also a pre-requisite of any self-respecting Gulf
city state. Beside this in turn, is a small factory which bakes a form of
the local basalt and spins it into a fibre used to make some forms of
insulation. Even modest Fujairah manages to turn the rocks into wool.
A visitor's most promising first stop is the Hilton International hotel,
which sits amid lawns and palm trees housing some particularly noisy
crickets next to a small strip of sand compactly endowed with every seaside
amenity. Rooms cost Dh220 a night for a stay during the Moslem weekend
(Thursday and Friday nights), and with that comes everything a Hilton guest
would expect - even in what is billed as the smallest Hilton in the world.
For Dh35 a day visitors can use the hotel pool and bar - one of only two in
Fujairah which serve alcohol. The other, the Beach Motel down the coast, is
rather seedier. But it is better beached and hires out windsurfers (Dh25 an
hour), water skis (Dh25 for three starts) or a fishing boat (Dh80 an hour).
Alcohol is pretty much the Beach Motel's main attraction.
On the sea horizon, though, sits the traffic jam of large crude oil tankers
which make Fujairah one of the world's largest bunkering stations, where
tankers sit waiting for passage through the Straits of Hormuz to the oil
terminals of the Gulf. The resulting spillage takes its toll on Fujairah's
beaches, and the Hilton's sign warning of tar on beach is, as the hotel's
staff acknowledge, there for good reason. The day of my visit, a sad-looking
cormorant was airing its wings on the beach in a vain effort to cleanse
itself.
Fujairah's other main tourist trap is the remains of the old town, guarded
by a sandblown, crenellated fort, the rounded lines of which have not been
helped by the addition in the 1960s of a square concrete turret.
In the heat, particularly, this tourist attraction can be safely
accomplished with a fairly brief camera sortie.
A drive north along the coast to Khor Fakkan, which lies in the territory of
Sharjah, is far more rewarding. In winter, which hereabouts means from
October to April, gaily-turbaned fishermen can be spotted, hand-hauling
great curved seine nets from the shore to bring in anchovies, sardines and
the odd small but nevertheless disconcerting shark. The sardines are then
laid out in great silver strips over the sand, dried and sold as cattle
fodder, much to the delight of local seabirds.
Khor Fakkan immediately betrays the greater opulence of oil- and gas-endowed
Sharjah - its main street is greened and trim and the corniche along the
coast road towards the Oceanic hotel, one of the UAE's three main beach
hotels, is colourfully paved, ornately gardened and relieved at appropriate
intervals by ice-cream kiosks.
The Oceanic, under the gaze of the summer palace of Sharjah's ruler, sits
opposite Khor Fakkan's less-than-sightly port, but also beside craggy coves
with clean white sand and limpid azure water.
'The coastguards here are rather more environmentally aware than down the
coast,' says Mr Arun Kapoor, the hotel's assistant manager, in a
characteristic display of inter-emirate rivalry. The beach, to back him up,
looks tar-free.
Like the Hilton, the Oceanic offers the gamut of water sports, at roughly
the same rates. It also offers diving - for those who have had diving
instruction - offering packages from Dh120 for a day trip to the coral reefs
around Paradise Island a few hundred yards offshore, to Dh1,100 for a
package, with equipment, for seven days. If you can spare the 10 days
required to win a diving licence, the hotel can arrange that.
The Indian Ocean coast, or the Gulf of Oman, as the waters which actually
lap the shore are known, is reckoned to offer the clearest water and most
varied sport for divers and snorkelers. The sharks, white tipped and whale
shark alike, are said not to be unfriendly. Other inhabitants of the sea's
coral reefs include barracudas, red snappers and sting rays.
Snorklers or fishermen will have to celebrate their finds and catches either
down the coast or soberly with fruit juice in the Oceanic, because Sharjah
is dry. Nightlife, as in Fujairah, is less than heady, although the Oceanic
threatens 'world-famous entertainment troupes' to break the evening calm.
North from placid Khor Fakkan, the road hugs the curling coast through
chiselled peaks and past long white beaches punctuated only by small,
intriguing fishing villages such as Sharm, a tight grid of squat little
ornately coloured and crenellated palaces which sit in calm private silence,
strolled largely by goats.
The road passes the mosque of Bidya, again guarded by a crumbling
watchtower, which is said to be the oldest - and may well be the smallest -
in the UAE. Its four meringue-like domes are an obligatory photo
opportunity.
Thereafter, the road curves inland to Dibba, once the capital of Oman and
scene of a violent victory in 633 of Moslem forces from Mecca over local
Omani tribes which helped establish Islam in the region. Just beyond Dibba,
by the border with Oman's mountainous Musandam peninsula, lies a bleakly
sandswept cemetery of standing stones said to be the site of the battle.
Dibba sits almost as silent as this monument, its locals wandering only
rarely outside their beautifully adorned little palaces. The small dhow
harbour comes alive only by morning and late evening.
It is only a few minutes' drive from Dibba, weaving through the mountains
(and Dibba's cement factory) to close the circle back to Masafi.
And, as if to acknowledge that a visitor may have encountered few locals
during a short trip to this coast, a road sign just inland from Dibba reads,
rather fetchingly, 'Goodbye'.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (2) - Quest for alternative
revenues / The Economy / The government is determined to diversify the
emirate's sources of income before the oil wells eventually run dry - within
the next 20 years unless there are large finds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Dubai has never been simply a Gulf oil town. Although oil money has
fertilised its fast growth in the past 25 years, in character it has always
kept much more the feel of a traders' haven.
Oil and gas, in fact, came later to Dubai than most Gulf states and, when it
was discovered and exploited in the late 1960s, there was less of it. The
emirate's reserves of 4bn barrels of recoverable oil are modest by the
standards of some Gulf peers and dwarfed by the 98bn barrels beneath the
sands of Abu Dhabi, its rival emirate down the coast.
By most estimates, Dubai's oil will run out within the next 20 or so years,
barring large finds which oil industry executives in the city presume
unlikely. The impetus behind Dubai's economy is therefore the government's
determination to diversify the emirate's sources of income as fast and
ambitiously as possible. Otherwise, as a local banker puts it: 'when the oil
dries up, so will Dubai.'
While it lasts, Dubai is pumping oil for all it is worth and, with
characteristic distaste for any external restraints on its behaviour,
pumping to capacity regardless of any Opec quotas for the United Arab
Emirates as a whole. At present, the emirate is lifting around 440,000
barrels a day.
Rather than nurture its oil endowment, a policy which Dubai's rulers have
decided would only postpone slightly a far less prosperous future, Dubai has
instead tended to reap what it can now, to invest in ventures which will
sustain its buoyancy when the wells dry up. The emirate's non-oil sector
already accounts for around 60 per cent of its gross national product, which
stood at Dh123bn last year - although this proportion varies somewhat
according to the prevailing oil price.
But Dubai's oil income has always been disproportionately important as the
wellspring of its investment strategy. This, broadly put, amounts to pouring
money, marketing and as much imagination as it can muster into making it an
unavoidable trading hub for the Middle East, and preferably somewhat beyond
 -and the region's most desirable place to set up manufacturing plants.
In this ambition, Dubai has been blessed both by location and tradition. In
the days of dhows and steamers, Dubai's natural creek quickly became the
Gulf's busiest port in the late nineteenth-century, soon after it was
settled by a branch of the Bani Yas tribe, led by the Maktoum family, who
still rule Dubai. With the advent of air travel, Dubai found itself
conveniently sited midway between Europe and Asia and, offering cheap
aviation fuel, a natural stopover point. Last year, 4.4m passengers used its
airport; an average of 12,000 daily.
In the early days, moreover, the Maktoums' liberal hospitality offered to a
large number of Arabs and Persians across the waters a more profitable home
from which to trade than Persia itself, which imposed severe restrictions on
trade in the early 1900s. These merchants, later joined by hundreds from
India and the sub-continent, still form the core of Dubai's thriving
merchant class which has defined the city's character.
Trade with Iran, the porous coastline and closed economy of which helped
turn Dubai into a bustling smuggler's nest, helped keep Dubai's port alive
after the demise of the pearling industry in the late 1920s. Gold, food and
all manner of other goods also found their way from Dubai's creek to the
ports of India, Pakistan and to other Gulf ports.
But with the arrival of oil, and a boom which saw Dubai's population double
between 1967 and 1973 to 120,000 people, high-rise buildings began to spring
up amid the palm-frond houses. The city state's late ruler, Sheikh Rashid
bin Maktoum, began to define the longer-term strategy carried on today by
his sons.
In an infrastructural binge during the late 1960s and 1970s, the man-made
Port Rashid was opened in 1972, bridges were built over the creek, the
airport expanded and, in 1979, Dubai created the 67-berth deepwater harbour
of Jebel Ali, 30km south of Dubai complete with an enveloping 100 sq km free
trade zone, opened in 1985, in which foreign companies could operate as 100
per cent owners - virtually unprecedented in the region - and pay no tax,
repatriate all profits and also profit from cheap land, labour and power.
The result has been to turn Dubai into far and away the Gulf's busiest
trading centre. Between them, Port Rashid and Jebel Ali - which combined
under the single Dubai Ports Authority (DPA) in a rationalisation last year
 -handled 1.25m teu (20-foot equivalent units - essentially containers),
making DPA the world's 19th busiest container port.
Japan, the biggest purchaser of Dubai's oil and its main supplier of cars
and electronics goods, is the emirate's main trading partner, but the
greater part of Dubai's imports are then re-exported, predominantly to Iran
and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsular. Dubai
officially accounts for 60-70 per cent of the United Arab Emirates'
re-exports, a figure which most likely underestimates the true picture,
given that many of its imports are also re-exported by other emirates.
Dubai also opened a 25,000 sq metre air cargo village in July last year to
corner the region's sea-air freight business and is intent on chasing
Seattle's crown as the world's fastest and busiest sea-air freight terminal.
In keeping with its determination to become the region's unavoidable hub,
Dubai also set up Emirates, its own airline, in 1985 - a move met with some
scepticism given that Gulf Air, jointly owned by Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
Abu Dhabi, was already well established in the region. But such scepticism
has not deterred the airline from a sustained pattern of growth which in
June saw it sign deals to add seven Boeing 777s to its present fleet of 11
aircraft, with an option on seven more, and with a further five Airbus jets
due for delivery from July. Although the airline publishes no figures, its
managers insist it is already returning an operating profit.
While Dubai has soared away from its local competitors as a trading centre,
it has had the same mixed success as elsewhere in the region in attracting
manufacturing investment.
On its own initiative, Dubai created the Dubal aluminium smelter - one of a
growing number in the Gulf where low-cost energy makes sense of such
ventures - which last year neared its expansion target output of 240,000
tonnes a year.
But while Jebel Ali, into which the government invested Dollars 2.5bn, had
attracted 410 companies by June this year and was registering new entrants
at the rate of 10-12 a month, the majority are either distribution or
packaging companies or attendant light industries. Jebel Ali is still
waiting for a big multinational investor to select the free zone as a big
manufacturing base.
Jebel Ali has not turned out to be the white elephant some critics branded
it at its conception. Nevertheless it has far to go before it fulfils Sheikh
Rashid's forward-looking ambition. Just over 5 per cent of its space is
taken up so far and, although the zone has capacity to absorb 8,000
companies, Mr Sultan bin Sulayem, the DPA chairman, says the port reckons
conservatively that there will be 2,000 in place by the turn of the century.
As to why no leading multinational has yet taken the plunge at Jebel Ali, Mr
Sulayem suggests that it is simply a question of 'awareness' - too few
companies have yet focused on the potential of the region, he argues. Dubai
is moving heaven, and large quantities of earth, to try to rectify the
problem.
Not only has the government set up the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Board, now
represented in seven foreign cities, to market the city energetically, the
emirate has also sought to attract world class sporting events - such as the
Dubal Desert Classic golf tournament, the first round of the PGA circuit,
world-ranking car rallies and snooker competitions - to draw the attention
of potential investors.
The city's two grassed golf courses, the second of which will soon be
completed along the banks of Dubai's creek and the first of which was the
also the first of its kind in the region, have been built primarily to help
attract foreign investors. The emirate's rulers know well how much Japanese
businessmen like to play golf.
Yet awareness of what Dubai has to offer - and besides golf, it also has
perhaps the most liberal and pro-business government in the Gulf - may not
be enough to guarantee the kind of investment the emirate needs to escape
the shackle of diminishing oil revenues. Japanese investors, for example,
also like cheap labour and while the predominantly Asian workers abundant in
Dubai cost far less than in any developed country, they are more expensive
to hire in Dubai than in Asia itself where Japanese companies prefer to
invest anyway for their own cultural reasons.
Another uncertain cloud over Dubai's development is the future of Iran,
which, having gratefully used the emirate's busy services as an entrepot
throughout the Iran-Iraq war and since, is now rather ungratefully trying to
develop its own duty-free and development zones at Qeshm and Kish Islands,
near the Straits of Hormuz.
The recent reshuffling of Iran's exchange rates has already hurt some of
Dubai's traders and opinion in the city is mixed as to the likely effects on
Dubai of Iran's determination to open its economy and develop its own trade.
Either you believe that this will irrevocably reduce trade with the
emirate's biggest single market, or that a bigger, more prosperous Iranian
economy can only, even with a smaller Dubai share, mean more trade for the
emirate. Last year, for instance, re-exports to Iran rose 8 per cent by
value, but fell 19 per cent by volume.
The jury is out on that, as with the eventual success or otherwise of
Dubai's strenuous attempts to replace its oil revenues. But Dubai cannot be
blamed for not trying.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (1) - Ideas from everywhere /
First impressions / This cosmopolitan city-state has always hosted people
from many lands. Now it is trying to acquire the most attractive qualities
and features which other countries have to offer
</HEADLINE>

Dubai wants to be everywhere else in the world at once. It would like its
ports to be the Singapore of the Middle East and its air-cargo terminal the
Seattle of the Middle East; it wants to become a Miami-style cruise centre
for the Middle East and it wants its golf courses to make the emirate the
Wentworth of the Middle East. There are plans to make it the Epsom of the
Middle East with a new horse-racing track.
And those are just a few of its ambitions - leaving aside for a moment plans
to build its own GulfoDisney-type theme park.
About the only places in the world Dubai apparently does not want to
resemble are Riyadh, for example, or Abu Dhabi, its big-brother emirate down
the coast.
When Dubai's promoters, who are ubiquitous, talk of this magpie city-state
being 'cosmopolitan', what they mean is that Dubai is not a particularly
typical Gulf, or even Arab city.
Even its indigenous locals apparently feel much the same way. 'I love it
when people say Dubai is like San Diego,' says Mr Mohammed al-Abbar, the new
head of the city's Economics Department, in his impeccable US accent. He is
just back from six years in Singapore.
One obvious reason why Dubai does not have a specially Arab feel is because
local Arabs make up a only small proportion of the city's estimated 600,000
inhabitants - perhaps only a fifth. Indians, Iranians, Pakistanis,
Filipinos, Sri Lankans and a large helping of Americans, Britons and other
Europeans make up the rest. And it was ever thus.
Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, arrived in Dubai circa 1948 to find
the soukhs crowded with 'pallid Arab townsmen; armed Bedu, quick-eyed and
imperious; Negro slaves; Baluchis, Persians, and Indians. Among them I
noticed a group of Kashgai tribesmen in their distinctive felt caps, and
some Somalis off a sambuk from Aden.'
Dubai's promiscuous port has attracted buyers and sellers from everywhere
since it was settled by the Maktoum family, who seceded from Abu Dhabi in
1833. The Maktoums have traditionally barred few from entering Dubai who
might add to its wealth.
Today, as a result, quick-eyed armed Bedu are thin on the ground. There are
a couple slung with worn wooden carbines guarding the British Bank of the
Middle East, one of Dubai's founding colonial institutions, but these days
they are allowed only one, symbolic, bullet between them.
Thesiger would also recognise little of the town itself - in his heyday a
sparsely-settled Gulfside village with a fort, now the city's museum, and
few big buildings among the settlers' palm-frond houses.
Although Dubai's first concrete house was not built until 1956, the advent
of oil and the development ambitions of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed bin Maktoum,
the emirate's second ruler who died in 1990, quickly turned Dubai into a
sprawling, low-rise city which today is crossed by multi-lane highways
roaring with traffic and which is studded with prestige modern hotels and
occasional high-rises.
You can spot the desert from some of these, but you would need a car to find
a camel.
Its plethora of soukhs, shopping streets and cavernous marbled malls burst
with cloth, clothes, watches enough for the wrists of a small continent,
cameras, TVs, walkmans and almost anything else, at knock-down prices which
brave and persistent souls can try knocking down further.
If there is a shopping equivalent of Stendhal's Syndrome - a condition
identified in Florence of dizziness brought on by excessive exposure to
great works of art - its first victims will fall palpitating in Dubai.
Just as dizzying is Dubai's kaleidoscope of cultures. By wanting to be
everywhere at once, the city ends up not really knowing what it is.
The streets of Satwa, with their curry houses, tiny tailor shops and
mirror-tiled barbers, might be the suburb of an Indian city. The Chicago
Beach village, just out of town, could be a corner of Marbella; its
satellite shopping malls perhaps Calgary or Edmonton. It may reflect Dubai's
cultural indecision that the city has roundabouts with traffic lights.
Its interiors can be equally bemusing. Sit in one of the hotels' de rigueur
English-style pubs and you will likely be served by a Filipino in full
oriental dress against a backdrop wallposter view of the Eiffel Tower -
probably while enjoying 'Caribbean night' music. The new and elite Aviation
Club is resplendent with roman pillars, pagodas and English lawns, all done
with an austere Swedish finish. As a rule of thumb, what is not Arabesque in
Dubai is pastiche and everything, preferably, is brand new.
But Dubai specialises in its incongruities. No sight in the Gulf is more
arresting, for example, than the Emirates Golf Club, an undulating 18-hole
oasis in the greened sands east of the city, which earlier this year Seve
Ballesteiros conquered to win the first round of the PGA circuit. The Creek
golf club, nearing completion in the city's south, with its sharpened Sydney
Opera House clubhouse and a yacht marina to follow, is a similarly defiant
sight.
These golf clubs, and Dubai's beach resorts, innumerable sports clubs and
other grand facilities are not folies de richesse - even at a cost of Dhs8
per gallon of water to green the fairways. Rather, they are part of a
concerted and extremely high-energy campaign to champion Dubai as the Gulf's
most attractive centre for foreign investment. And without more foreign
investment, the emirate's opulence will not survive the drying of its oil
wells - at present rates due some time early next century.
Behind this lies the determination of Dubai's government - that is Sheikh
Maktoum bin Rashid, the ruler, and his brothers - to do all in its power to
make the city-state an atypically easy place to do business by Gulf
standards.
Flowing from this desire are the development of the Jebel Ali free trade
zone outside the city, where foreign companies can enjoy 100 per cent
ownership; the creation and aggressive marketing of Emirates airlines; the
sponsorship of world-class sporting events and the selling of Dubai as a
tourist resort; the golf courses, and a generally hands-off approach to
government.
About the only thing preventing the government from turning Dubai into a
full-blown Hong Kong is the emirate's place within the seven-city state
United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is dominated by the far more
conservatively Gulf Arab, and far more oil wealthy, Abu Dhabi.
'They're more capitalist here than Thatcher,' is how one expatriate
businessman puts it. 'The only reason they don't deregulate things more is
because of the UAE and the Gulf Co-operation Council (which groups the six
main Arabian Peninsular states): they don't want to upset people.'
Instead, and in keeping with an abiding rivalry with its bigger neighbour,
Dubai seeks to distinguish itself by the audacity of its ambition.
After the golf courses will come a horse-racing track which will host an
international meet. Dubai will host a round of the world's power boat
championships; then build a theme park. Then, perhaps, run its own cruise
liners; maybe build a new cricket pitch which some people are already
suggesting might vie for the cricket world cup. Perhaps it will even install
a monorail linking all Dubai's hotels to the theme park.
One rumour even has it that Dubai is considering creating a ski-slope on the
mountains to its west, with real snow. Presumably the idea is to turn Dubai
into the Gstaad of the Middle East.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Advanced details on the
autumn issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To be published on Sept 11, 1992
The Autumn issue of Software At Work will examine users' experiences of
human resource systems, plus marketing and market research databases.
The 'hot topic' section will look at Europeanisation: the development of
software to serve different countries.
Here are details of the synopsis:
Human resource systems: payroll systems have been grinding away since the
early days of business computing, doing a dull but vital job.
The arrival of the personal computer raised the possibility of personnel
managers getting little administration systems of their own. But more
recently, payroll and personnel package users and suppliers have been
looking at exploiting basic data about employees to greater effect to help
plan, manage and use an organisation's biggest and usually most expensive
resource to maximum advantage.
Marketing and market research databases: marketing and selling demand the
right information to ensure the best return on effort. Market research
information is now available in a variety of forms, ranging from computer
bureau services to CDs which can be used with personal computers. What are
the options and how can the information best be used?
Europeanisation: the advent of the single European market is likely to bring
an increasing number of international mergers and partnerships, plus
overseas expansion by companies which have traditionally concentrated on
their home markets. This will bring demand for software running on different
computers which can handle multiple currencies and languages and the
oddities of different countries' business methods.
Following the September review, future issues of Software At Work will look
at developments in computer-aided design and manufacturing; document image
processing; project management; contingency planning and disaster recovery;
and electronic funds transfer at the point of sale.
For details of how Software At Work operates and how to contribute to the
next issue, see details in the article at the top of this page: Users have
their say. Information from users and suppliers is needed by Mon, July 13.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): The users have their say
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This issue of Software At Work - the fifth in the FT's series of quarterly
software reviews - looks at three main topics:
Bespoke systems: software developed precisely for your company's needs,
rather than cheaper, standard packages.
Computer-related training for specialist staff.
The 'hot-topic': groupware - an extra level of applications software which
aims to create genuine interaction between people through a computer
network.
A strong emphasis of Software At Work is always to let the users have their
say. Once again, we have selected site visits and case studies with the hope
that these various approaches will help other software- users formulate
their own strategies.
For the site visits, our approach includes an overall report on how software
is chosen and applied, together with a company snapshot, describing its main
area of business.
Then for each site report there is a technology or system profile, listing
the software and hardware at the site. And, finally, we include in most
cases a consultant's critique on just how effective - or otherwise - the
system appears to be.
We hope to return to selected sites in future issues, to track their
progress. Sometimes today's success story is tomorrow's problem.
We also try to avoid technical jargon: this review is intended for the
executive decision-maker who may not have a technological background,
therefore a list of buzzword definitions is included on this page.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (32): The walk through the
warehouse no longer needed - Case Study / Hayward Promotions / Michael
Powell describes how a small children's book distributor is now able to
forecast with much greater accuracy the stock levels it should keep.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN A relatively small business can benefit from custom additions to
standard packages. Hayward Promotions of Park Royal stocks and distributes
children's books and story tapes to the toy trade and prominent chain
stores.
The company, which was set up 10 years ago, uses the Multisoft accounting
package on its Elonex machine, running Xenix, and has a turnover of Pounds
1.6m.
According to Colin MacMillan, managing director of Hayward, the company
recognised that it had a stockholding problem in 1990.
The company deals in thousands of titles, and its control and forecasting
mechanisms were manual.
'We would walk around the warehouse to see what we had in stock, and act on
that. This would cause overstocking of some lines, and stock outs of others.
It's very annoying to have an order and not be able to fulfil it.'
Publishers only print a certain number of copies of a title, which can sell
out very quickly. If the correct number is not ordered, sales can be
permanently lost.
The company's Multisoft accounting system had a stock ledger, but there were
not sufficient analytical capabilities in it to allow Hayward to build
accurate forecasts of stock requirements.
To solve this difficulty, Mr MacMillan called in an old acquaintance, David
Halstead, of software house The Transition.
He designed a forecasting system which would be able to use a profile of the
company's monthly turnover to show where extra stock would be needed, to
cater for cyclical trends and sales patterns.
The system would use current turnover for each item and project future
turnover based on that. This would enable Hayward to buy in the correct
quantities of stock, based on demand.
The initial stage of the project was implemented over a period of three
months, and showed immediate benefits. Order fulfilment increased to 90 per
cent.
'One of the great bonuses for us was the reduction in time that our
management had to spend sorting out our mix of stock,' Mr MacMillan says.
The program was developed using a C programming language code generator
called Fred, from a UK company, Forefront.
According to Transition's sales manager, John Burden, C is used for
multi-platform support - 'we try to provide standard packages as much as
possible, with some bespoke portions where necessary.'
The program uses Multisoft's file structures for its data.
The development was done on a time and materials basis, bills being
presented and paid as it progressed. The total cost was around Pounds 4,000.
Transition is now adding demographic analysis of the population of parents
throughout the country. This will enable Hayward Promotions' agents to
target areas on which to concentrate their sales efforts.
'We can push a button to get data on best sellers and so on, to send to our
agents all over the country.
'There are 30,000 children's titles available, and we keep 6,000, so we
could not do this by hand. The system tells us what we need,' says Colin
MacMillan.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (30): Flexibility in the
securities business - Case Study / London Global Securities / A
recently-formed securities firm has used a fourth-generation language to
develop a fast-moving system for its own needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOFTWARE development requires more than just a clever programmer: it must
also have a great deal of input from the user or from an expert in the
field.
Indeed, using a fourth-generation language can significantly diminish the
amount of computer expertise required.
Moreover, in fast-moving businesses, advantage can be gained by being able
to develop a product more quickly than a competitor.
London Global Securities (LGS) is a securities lending intermediary which
was formed 18 months ago by experts in the market. It teamed up with
international software house K-Tek to produce a system.
'Like many of the players, we have used the Reuters Blend system until now,'
says director of operations, Stephen Jennett, 'but it's a bureau system. We
have spent the last 12 to 15 months specifying and building our own system,
which is in parallel running now and should go live in the next few weeks.'
K-Tek specialises in financial software systems for multi-national companies
which borrow and lend on, internationally. It has already installed a
general ledger system at LGS running on an IBM RS/6000. This will be fed
directly by the new administration system, once it is live.
K-Tek recommended the use of System Builder's SB+, a tool which uses Pick,
for this development.
Pick is a relational database-cum-fourth-generation language which offers a
high degree of portability and flexibility.
On LGS' RS/6000, this runs with the Universe Pick system - 'it's easy to add
reports, the system is very powerful and it looks like a PC,' says Mr
Jennett.
'The problem with the bureau system is that if we want to make a change we
have to tell the bureau. If it is acceptable, every other user benefits, so
we do not gain competitive advantage. The bureau has to be convinced that it
is to its advantage to make changes.'
However, Reuters Blend has enjoyed a monopoly until recently. Several larger
companies and software houses are working on their own products, but these
are not yet written. LGS believes it will be the first, because it is using
a fourth-generation language.
'We've no historical foundation to build in, because we're a young company.
We started later than some, but we are using up-to-date technology and
architecture.'
The product will be fully supported by K-Tek, which will also market it
under licence to other companies, with modifications or tailoring as
required.
Its name will be Global One, and there is already interest from US agents.
Using fourth-generation language techniques, the developers have brought
together software expertise, and the user experience of LGS, without
becoming bogged down in technicalities. The result is expected to be a
flexible product which should find a niche, and be ahead of its opponents.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (31): Sales staff are alerted to
future problems - Case Study / Wiggins Teape / Combining a relational
database with a fourth generation language has created a sophisticated new
order processing system
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMER service is often the key to success for commercial companies.
Achieving high levels of customer satisfaction often means that detailed
changes must be made to systems during their development. The choice of
development tools is crucial to this, writes Michael Powell.
Wiggins Teape is the largest paper merchant in the UK, part of the Arjo
Wiggins group. It developed a new order processing system which it calls
GENISYS (which stands for new GENeration of Information SYStems) to replace
a 14-year-old Assembler-based system, using Software AG's Natural
fourth-generation language (4GL), and IBM's relational database, DB2.
'DB2 is a strategic DBMS within this company, and Natural is a standard,'
says information systems director Russell Storey. 'It also gave Software AG
the opportunity to establish Natural/DB2.'
The development, started in 1990, is being performed by Software AG, at a
project cost of Pounds 1.5m. The initial feasibility study was performed by
consultants from Nolan Norton, which led to the decision to go for a bespoke
system.
Hoskyns was selected to do the systems design on a fixed price contract.
Wiggins Teape then went to the market again to tender for a developer.
Software AG offered the best deal and was selected.
Around 80 per cent of Wiggins Teape's sales orders come in through telephone
calls. The system provides all information needed to support the sale. For
instance, it displays action messages to alert sales people to potential
problems with orders. This enables them to provide a more focused service
using information based on exceptions.
A system on this scale cannot be introduced in one move - 'we don't believe
in big bangs,' says Mr Storey. The first phase, sales from stock, is
implemented.
The second phase, covering direct and indirect sales from third parties, is
being implemented, and the detailed work on the next phase, covering
accounts consolidation and stocking - back-office functions - is in
progress.
The entire project should be completed in September and will then have taken
some 25 man-years to develop.
The system handles around 2,500 transactions a day, and must provide good
information to the sales person, with reasonable response time - 'our
previous system was low on functionality, high on response time,' says Mr
Storey. 'The new system responds in around two seconds.'
He adds: 'We tend to be fairly cautious - state-of-the-shelf rather than
state-of-the-art. We do a lot of transactions and need to retain competitive
advantage, which means flexibility and the ability to make small changes to
the system to improve services to the customer. We've been able to modify
the system as we develop.
'Flexibility is the key word as far as we are concerned. That's why we went
for Natural, and a relational database - which lets us make changes without
massive re-structuring.'
Wiggins Teape is developing a complex, carefully designed system, using
high-level tools, which has enabled it significantly to improve the levels
of service to its customers.
The previous system did sterling service for many years but sacrificed
flexibility to fast response. The choice of 4GL and relational database has
enabled the company to retain flexibility during this development, without
compromising the overall design.

FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reflects worries about US
economy
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
SHARE prices traded in a narrow range on either side of opening values
yesterday, as the markets digested the implications of last week's bad
economic news and the interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.92 at 3,339.21. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also little changed at the
finish, up just 2.07 at 413.84, as were the Amex composite, up 0.03 at
382.58 and the Nasdaq composite, 0.19 lower at 563.16. Turnover on the NYSE
was 187m shares.
Last week shares fell despite a big cut in interest rates by the Fed because
investors were more concerned with what the bad June employment figures said
about the state of the economic recovery. That concern continued to hamper
the market yesterday, and with the first batch of second quarter corporate
earnings due out soon, investors are likely to tread warily until they see a
clear sign of improvement in company profits and in economic activity.
Among individual stocks, consumer-related issues fared well in active
trading on hopes that they could be a good defensive play during tough
economic times. Philip Morris firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 78 1/4 ,
Procter &amp; Gamble climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 1/4 , Johnson &amp; Johnson
firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 , Coca-Cola rose Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 42 1/2 in turnover of almost 1.5m shares, and RJR Nabisco put on
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 3/8 .
Banks were mostly weaker as analysts warned that competition for customer
accounts might prevent them from reducing their already low deposit rates in
the wake of the Fed's discount rate cut. Chemical fell Dollars 1 to Dollars
37 7/8 , Citibank by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 20 3/4 , Chase Manhattan by
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 and BankAmerica by Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars
44 5/8 .
Some of the broking stocks that rose after Thursday's rate cut also gave
back some of their gains, with PaineWebber easing Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 21
1/2 and Salomon falling Dollars 2 to Dollars 35 5/8 , although Merrill Lynch
recovered from early losses to end up Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 52 1/8 .
Airline stocks took off in expectation that approaching increases in fares
will boost flagging margins without damaging demand too much. Delta was
Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 55 1/4 , AMR, parent of American Airlines,
put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 66 1/4 , UAL was up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars
117 3/8 , USAir gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 13 1/8 and Southwest Airlines
rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43.
On the Nasdaq market, FedFirst Bancshares jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 33
1/2 after Southern National agreed to acquire the company in a stock-swap
deal worth Dollars 88.8m. Southern National fell Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 15
1/2 .
Canada
SHARE prices in Toronto closed slightly higher in relatively light trading.
Based on preliminary data, the composite index gained 6.77 points, or 0.20
per cent, to close at 3,426.91. Declines edged advances 274 to 243, trading
volume of 20.643m shares was above Friday's 15.021m shares, and trading
value was CDollars 242.6m against CDollars 166.9m.
The financial services group posted the day's biggest gain. Royal Bank was
up  1/4 to 24 3/4 , Bank of Montreal was up  1/2 to 47, Scotiabank gained
5/8 to 22 5/8 and Canadian Imperial Bank gained  5/8 to 28 3/4 .

FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Turnover dries up as holiday
season progresses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven summit in Munich and the summer holiday season reduced
turnover levels across the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reversed Friday's index pattern with a better performance in the
broadly-based FAZ, which rose 1.54 to 700.46 at midsession, than in the
30-share DAX, which eased 4.62 to 1,772.36 at the close.
Turnover fell from DM8bn to DM4.5bn. The move from cyclical to defensive
stocks which marked most of last week was hard to detect yesterday with
banks fairly flat and utilities flat to lower, although carmakers, engineers
and steels fell by more.
Among special situations, the meat processor, A Moksel, closed DM10.20
higher at DM399 after DM406.50 on news that the German brewery group
Gebruder Marz was close to taking a 33 per cent stake in the company. There
was talk in the market that it might pay DM480 a share.
In retailers, Asko recovered DM29 of Friday's post-suspension drop of DM109
to close at DM665. Mr Frank Raschke of Nikko Securities said that there were
two views on Asko: first that there was more trouble to come from
investments in companies like Adia, the Swiss employment agency group, and,
secondly, that Asko would now concentrate on retailing and make lots of
money. In the meantime, he said, yesterday's rise was simply a technical
reaction.
PARIS closed at its lowest level in nearly five months and the lack of
business made many brokers wonder why they had bothered to come to work. The
CAC 40 index lost 15.12 to 1,868.52, its lowest close since 1,865.11 on St
Valentine's Day, in turnover of just FFr1.1bn.
Leisure and tourism stocks suffered the most from the truck drivers' strike
which has brought French motorways to a standstill. Euro Disney closed
FFr2.20 lower at FFr102.90, its lowest close this year, while the hotel
company Accor fell FFr7 to FFr739.
Hachette was the sole provider of any news, announcing that it would sell
some buildings in central Paris for FFr500m. The stock closed flat at
FFr127. Meanwhile, worries about the state of the property sector continued
to weigh on financial stocks, with the insurer UAP losing FFr17 to FFr447 in
thin trading.
MILAN sank further into its depression following the Bank of Italy's
decision to raise the discount rate to 13 per cent. The Comit index fell
2.81 to 441.35 in turnover estimated at L65bn after Friday's L79.9bn.
Fiat fell L51 to L5,061 and eased to L5,040 after hours while bigger losses
were seen in second-line stocks. Burgo fell L360 to L4,880 and Italcementi
dropped L290 to L10,450.
In COPENHAGEN, trading re-opened in Hafnia shares after a three-day
suspension, with Hafnia B falling as low as DKr94 in early trading but
closing at DKr97, down DKr9, writes Hilary Barnes. Institutional investors
guaranteeing the DKr2bn rights issue by Hafnia Holding might have to take up
the entire issue. The all-share index rose 0.20 to 319.70 in a day of very
low turnover.
STOCKHOLM was led down by banks and finance which fell 2 per cent as the
Affarsvarlden General index closed 10.5 to 904.1.
Concern about loan losses left SE-Banken A SKr0.50 down at a new 1992 low of
SKr27.50, and Svenska Handelsbanken lost SKr1.50 to SKr49.50. OSLO recovered
a little on bargain-hunting after its latest slide, the all-share index
rising 3.85 to 397.10 in turnover of NKr191m.
The insurance company Uni Storebrand also recouped some of its recent
losses, the A shares rising NKr2 to NKr33 as a domestic newspaper apologised
for an article last week saying that Uni was 'technically bankrupt'.
ZURICH traded in its new bourse building, where it saw profit-taking in
insurers as the SMI index lost 8.4 to close at 1,862.6. In addition, the
weak dollar hurt shares in export-oriented industrials, which earn a large
portion of their revenue abroad.
Bearer shares in the chemical group Ciba-Geigy topped the active list as
they eased SFr4 to SFr683; Zurich Insurance bearers were SFr20 easier at
SFr1,910 and Winterthur bearers SFr50 lower at SFr3,100.
MADRID dropped in thin trade with investors discouraged by the gloomy
outlook for the Spanish economy. The general index finished 2.70 lower at
236.74.
Banesto underperformed in the banking sector, with a fall of Pta65 to
Pta2,410. Constructions saw weakness again in Cubiertas, Pta260 lower at
Pta7,000, and Uralita down Pta118, or 11 per cent, at Pta927 after last
week's agreed merger with the chemicals company Argonesas, which dropped
Pta200 to Pta1,150.
AMSTERDAM closed lower as the dollar weakened. The CBS Tendency Index closed
at 122.2, down 0.8.
BRUSSELS closed mixed in thin trading as the Bel-20 index was almost
unchanged, down just 0.20 at 1,174.60 in low turnover of BFr491m. Petrofina
dropped BFr200 to BFr10,950, while CBR climbed BFr110 to BFr8,200.
ISTANBUL leapt 5 per cent in a rally which accelerated towards the close
after the market overcame nervousness hanging over from the heavy
profit-taking of late last week. The 75-share index closed at 4,387.02, up
211.06.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Farmer's Viewpoint: Advice tops shopping lists at Royal Show
 -Coping with reform is the main concern of visitors to Britain's premier
farming event
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CYNIC might suggest that there are only three areas of potential trading
growth in UK agriculture today: weed-trimmers, to keep tidy the 15 per cent
of British land that will be set-aside and growing weeds next year,
following last month's reform of the European Community's Common
Agricultural Policy; farm sales and receiverships, as growers get out of
business, voluntarily or because they are pushed; and advice on how to cope
with the reforms, which are so fundamental that they will change the face of
Britain. The greatest need is for advice.
It is offered in variety and profusion at this week's four-day Royal Show,
which opened at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, yesterday. The Royal Agricultural
Society is staging seminars four times a day in a hastily erected marquee.
Firms of land agents, management advisers and just about anyone who can
drive a computer have programmed their portable machines with the
information so far available to produce on-the-spot print-outs of inquirers'
likely gains and losses.
The organic farming movement announced yesterday that it did not want
set-aside at all and would much prefer everybody to stop using fertilisers
and sprays and reduce production capacity in what they claimed was a more
environment-friendly way. They were only partly satisfied that for the first
time Community funding might, as a result of the reform package, be
available to help them. They will only believe that when they see it.
Even the British Ministry of Agriculture, through its now part-privatised
Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, was touting solutions to
problems raised by the policies introduced by its own political masters -
for a fee of course.
But, as the leaflet accompanying the ADAS sales pitch conceded, the fine
detail of the new EC agricultural policy, agreed on May 21, is unlikely to
be announced until mid-August. The advice offered can only be approximate,
therefore, but such is farmers' confusion at the complicated package,
together with their need to know in order to be able to prepare cropping
plans for implementation this autumn, that all such sources of advice are
likely to be kept busy until the show closes on Thursday.
Meanwhile, enthusiasm in the machinery lines was muted. Farmers enjoy
looking at machinery and will buy it if they can possibly afford it - and
sometimes when they cannot. But with 15 per cent less land to cultivate next
year, there is neither the cash nor much need to purchase. Recognising this,
some big manufacturers withdrew from the show only a few weeks ago.
Notable among these was John Deere, the US/German tractor manufacturer,
which has been a staunch supporter of the show for many years. It was
following the example of other, similarly high-profile firms that have been
pulling out by dribs and drabs since the farm recession began.
The organisers claimed, quite accurately, that such absentees had been
replaced by many more companies in the farm machinery business. But a chap
selling hand-tools out of the back of a van is no substitute for a big
international company with shiny tractors, flapping flags, and an
entertainment complex spreading over half an acre of showground.
It is all a sad reflection of the fact that UK tractor sales, always a good
guide to the health or otherwise of the agricultural industry, have declined
even further from the disastrously low 15,250 sold last year. This compares
with between 28,000 and 29,000 in 1983. For 1992, the Agricultural
Engineers' Association is predicting, perhaps somewhat optimistically, that
sales will reach 15,000.
It bases this forecast largely on the fact that many tractors are growing
old and unreliable and will have to be replaced soon. I can only report that
most of the farmers I met at the show told me they would not be buying
anything until they had absorbed exactly what CAP reform meant to them and
that few thought they would be in a buying mood after that. I share their
feelings entirely.
One often-expressed hope of relief from all this gloom at the Royal Show
yesterday was the environmental aspect of CAP reform. The National Farmers'
Union led the way. The reform package, Mr David Naish, the NFU president,
pointed out, specifically allowed for farmers to be financially encouraged
to improve conservation on farms. Moreover, limited cash had been allocated
to help pay for such activities.
For this to become worthwhile for British farmers, however, it would be
necessary for the UK Treasury to match the EC allocation, and this at a time
of financial stringency. Like the organic movement, therefore, the NFU fears
that little real help may be forthcoming.
To the casual observer the Royal Show may look much as it did ten years ago.
But that is an illusion. The theme and concentration has moved from the
production of food to marketing it, and to business expertise in general.
The supermarket group, Safeway, led the way in bridging the gap a coupled of
years ago by taking and sponsoring trade stands. This year it has been
joined by Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, together with McCains, the large buyer
and processor of potatoes. Collectively, farmers hope, this represents a
slowly growing acceptance by the food trade that it relies on British
farmers for much of its raw materials. It is certainly welcomed by the
farming industry at large, always provided that the retailing companies in
question back their presence at the show with fair terms and prices for the
food they buy from British farms.
For, although farmers hope that selling to such multiple giants will enable
them to earn premium prices, the present reality is that it is necessary to
cut all possible costs to stay in business.
I found myself questioning, as I walked around the show, the 150-year-old
motto of the Royal Agricultural Society of England prominently displayed all
around the ground. 'Practise with Science' it reads. That, I suggest, may
now be a little out of date. Perhaps 'Survival through Economy' would now be
more appropriate.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Italian dealers still cautious despite
rise in discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SOME stability returned to the Italian government bond market and the lira
yesterday after the Bank of Italy's weekend increase in the discount rate by
1 percentage point to 13 per cent.
However, dealers remained cautious about the outlook ahead of details of the
government's planned emergency budget package announced on Sunday.
The package, destined to help correct the overshoot in the budget deficit,
which is now expected to reach at least L160,000bn this year, should involve
a mixture of revenue-raising and cost-cutting measures, including a freeze
on public-sector prices.
Prices rose slightly at the long end of the market yesterday as banks
digested the weekend news in relatively quiet trading.
An early test of the confidence in the new government of Mr Giuliano Amato
will come on Thursday, when L13,000bn of short-term Buoni Ordinari del
Tesoro (BOT) will be auctioned.
Auctions of longer-term fixed and floating-rate paper last week gave a taste
of the market's growing frustration with the lack of action to curb the
deficit.
UK government bond prices slid yesterday as hopes for an early cut in
interest rates were quashed. The Bank of England's actions in the money
markets on Friday had left traders optimistic about the authorities'
intentions of pushing down rates further to revive the flagging UK economy.
But the Bank's market operations yesterday, and the weakness of sterling,
killed off the more optimistic expectations. 'It would be a bit of a
disaster to cut rates now,' said one observer as the DM/sterling rate fell
from 2.889 to 2.885. 'The chancellor (of the exchequer) looks as boxed in as
ever.'
With little else to support gilts - and with little expectation of any
positive news from the G7 meeting taking place in Munich - prices of most
stocks fell by between one-third and a half of a point later in the day. The
benchmark 9 per cent bonds due 2012, ended the day at 36 13/16 , close to
the 36 at which they closed last Thursday, ahead of the Bank's actions.
Meanwhile, 9 per cent gilts due 2008 lost  15/32 of a point to close at 101
7/32 , a yield of 8.82 per cent. As prices fell, the yield differential
between UK and German 10-year government bonds climbed to 1.29 percentage
point.
GERMAN government bond prices remained largely unchanged yesterday as
investors continued to wait for an outcome to the debate over the
introduction of an interest income tax. 'People are worried about getting
involved ahead of a potentially difficult decision,' one trader said.
The market expects a tax of 30 to 35 per cent, but no erosion of bank
secrecy in Germany. Any attack on secrecy could lead to some flight of
capital from the banking system, unsettling the market.
Despite the pause in the German government bond market's rally, many
observers continue to remain optimistic about its prospects in the near
future.
US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the maturity range yesterday as
investors continued to buy government securities in the wake of last week's
big interest rate cut.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 104
3/8 , yielding 7.618 per cent. The two-year note was even firmer, up  3/16
at 101, yielding 4.450 per cent.
Although confidence in the outlook for the bond market following the policy
ease has been widely spread among investors, demand has been noticeably more
robust at the short end than at the long end of the market - hence the
bigger gains among two-year securities yesterday and the steepening of the
yield curve.
In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve arranged three-day matched sales
with Fed funds trading at 3 3/16 per cent. The intervention, aimed at
draining reserves from the market and pushing Fed funds higher, confirmed
that the Fed's new target for the rate is 3 1/4 per cent. By late afternoon,
however, Fed funds had eased to 3 1/8 per cent.

NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest broking house, is abandoning a floor of
its stock and bond trading headquarters in the heart of Tokyo's business
centre. The building also houses the Tokyo branches of Salomon Brothers and
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The move is a part of a cost-cutting programme led by a task force
officially set up yesterday. Nomura also plans to cut 2,000 jobs over the
next five years by paring back new recruits and reducing computer investment
costs by 60 per cent.
Japan's brokerages face sharp falls in profits due to the prolonged slump of
the Tokyo stock market. With daily average volume failing to recover from
around 300m shares during the first three months of the fiscal year which
started in April, officials reckon operating profits at Japanese brokers
have plunged into the red.
Other leading brokers are expected to follow Nomura with restructuring
plans. Daiwa Securities said that while it had no official programme, it
reduced headquarters personnel in February by moving staff to its domestic
branches, and expected to cut recruitment by up to 40 per cent. Nikko
Securities said it was considering a rationalisation plan.
Nomura will cut recruitment of female employees, who serve as assistants and
secretaries, to 400 from the usual 800, and will reduce investment in new
computer systems to Y4bn (Dollars 32m) from Y10bn.

R. J. REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco group, has formed a joint
venture company with Tabacalera, the Spanish government-owned cigarette
manufacturing company, to produce and market RJR's Camel and Winston brands
in Spain.
The two brands have been produced under licence by Tabacalera since the
early-1980s. However, RJR said that the joint venture company structure  -
which will be owned 50:50 by the two manufacturers - will aid co-operation
and help further growth.
RJR is contributing its manufacturing facility in La Palma in the Canary
Islands, to the joint venture, and Tabacalera is understood to be putting in
an unspecified cash element.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday postponed its
planned increase in domestic fares until July 10, writes Nikki Tait. Earlier
in the day, shares in most US airline stocks had climbed, in the hope that
some measure of price stability was finally returning to domestic market.
Fare increases were due to take effect from today.
During the spring, American led the way with a pricing initiative designed
to reduce dramatically the number of discount fares on offer. But this was
quickly overtaken by a vicious bout of domestic 'fare wars'. The US airline
industry has lost over Dollars 5bn in the past two years, and only last week
Braniff, one of the smaller carriers, grounded its fleet.

GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber's second-quarter net income is expected to be at the
high end of analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 1.40 per share,
according to Mr Stanley Gault, the group's chief executive, Reuter reports
from Ohio.
Mr Gault added that the US group stood a good chance of posting record sales
for the quarter and first half.
'We are going to be in that range, and hopefully we are going to be at the
upper end of it,' he said in an interview.
The group's previous second-quarter sales record was Dollars 2.87bn in 1990.
It also set a first-half sales record in that year of Dollars 5.56bn.
In last year's second quarter, net income amounted Dollars 22.5m or Dollars
0.38 a share on sales of Dollars 2.79bn.
Mr Gault said he expected the gains to continue. 'We are having an excellent
year,' he added.
Asset sales and improved sales of replacement tyres were the reasons for the
strong quarter.

MONSANTO, the US chemicals company, has formed a joint venture in Thailand
that will invest Dollars 150m to build a specialty plastics manufacturing
plant south-east of Bangkok.
The venture, with Premier Enterprise of Thailand, is being formed in
co-operation with Monsanto Kasei, a 50-50 Tokyo-based plastics venture
formed two years ago between Monsanto and Japan's Mitsubishi Kasei Polytec.
The new Thai company - to be known as Monsanto Premier Kasei - will be 44
per cent owned by Monsanto of the US, 30 per cent by Premier and 26 per cent
by Monsanto Kasei of Japan. Premier is a private sector conglomerate.
Monsanto expects the Thai plant to employee 200 to 250 people at Map Ta
Phut, 125 miles south-east of Bangkok, and to produce special engineering
resins by early 1995.
The venture is supposed to produce about 66,000 tonnes of engineering resins
a year, to be marketed throughout south-east Asia and China. Main uses for
the resins include business machine enclosures, refrigeration liners,
appliances and general purpose moulding.

<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has privatised its eighteenth and last bank by
selling 66.3 per cent of the shares in Banco del Centro for 869,381m pesos.
The privatisations will have raised 38,665bn pesos (Dollars 12.9bn) when all
payments are made, far more than expected.
The average bank was sold for 3.068 times book value and 14.75 historic
earnings. In the US and Europe, banks are typically sold for 2.2 times book
value and 14 times historic earnings, according to the Mexican Finance
Ministry.
The government sold 70.7 per cent of Banamex, the largest bank by assets,
for 9,706bn pesos; 56 per cent of Bancomer, the second largest, for 8,559bn
pesos; and 51 per cent of Serfin for 2,827bn pesos The most expensive bank
relative to earnings was Banorie, which went for a multiple of 23.7.
The bank sales appear to have been free of the corruption and string-pulling
that have plagued many developing-country privatisations. But questions were
raised when the winning bidder for Banco Somex pulled out, after his
investors balked at the price he was to pay. The bank was immediately
awarded to the second highest bidder.

ROTHMANS, the UK tobacco group, has emerged as a 4 per cent shareholder in
Albatros Investment, the holding company for Bollore Technologie of France,
writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The two companies plan to liaise in the tobacco field. Rothmans is a world
leader in the tobacco market with brands such as Peter Stuyvesant, Cartier
and Dunhill. Bollore, best known for its industrial and distribution
activities, has cigarette interests in Asia and Africa.
Under the terms of their agreement, the two companies will work jointly to
expand Bollore's tobacco activities into Europe.
Rothmans is one of the major shareholders in Albatros, alongside Assurances
Generales de France, the French insurance group, and IFINT, a company
controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy.

Boge, Mannesmann's automotive supply unit, returned a 1991 group loss of
DM52.7m (Dollars 34.7m) after a loss of DM400,000 a year earlier, the
group's chairman told shareholders, Reuter reports from Eitorf.
Mr Roland Mecklinger said that 1991 group sales slipped to DM732.9m from
DM756.6m. The parent company showed a 1991 loss of DM51.4m after a 1990 loss
of DM4.6m. Parent company sales dipped to DM629m from DM649.7m last year.
The company will not be paying a dividend.

Hugo Boss, the German menswear company, said its supervisory board had
chosen Mr Peter Littmann as the new management board chairman, replacing the

Mr Littmann, a 44-year-old businessman with international experience, will
join the board on January 1, a statement from Boss said.
Banca Commerciale Italiana said its merchant banking unit, Fincomit, has
purchased a 10 per cent stake with an option for an additional 5 per cent in

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Financial profits set to account
for half of Siemens' earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DRESDEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS is on target for an 8 per cent rise in net profits to at least
DM1.9bn (Dollars 1.2bn) this financial year, but is feeling the impact of
weak economic growth in important markets, said Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann,
finance director.
Around half of the German electrical and electronics group's earnings for
the financial year to end-September 1992 would again come from financial
profits on large holdings of cash and securities, he said.
Operating profits of Siemens' industrial activities showed highly different
trends, with some producing losses and others benefiting from a healthy
order inflow.
He declined to forecast the operating profits trend for the full year - in
1990-1991 lower operating profits were more than offset by higher financial
earnings - noting that while some areas like telecommunications were making
higher profits, semiconductors, computers and the US businesses were in the
red.
He said losses at Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), formed by the
acquisition of the ailing Nixdorf computers, were coming down more slowly
than hoped. Semiconductors would show a higher loss because of the weak
trend in the industry. In the US, losses would be higher, mainly due to the
slow recovery from recession there.
The German economy was also feeling the impact of weakness in foreign
markets. But Mr Karlheinz Kaske, chief executive, said there had been 'a
surge of business' from east Germany for modernisation of the
infrastructure.
'This more than compensated for weakness in the standard products sector,
which is still suffering the effects of a stagnating international economy,'
he told the half-yearly press conference. However, Siemens' worldwide labour
force of 415,000 people would tend to decline in the face of poorer orders
in some sectors.
Siemens has already reported an 8 per cent rise to DM859m in earnings for
the first six months. Mr Kaske, who will be succeeded on his retirement in
October by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, said its rail, automation, automobile
electronics, telecommunications, power generation, and medical technology
activities were all performing well.
New orders rose by 5 per cent in the first eight months to DM57bn, with
turnover up by 7 per cent to DM48bn. Mr Kaske repeated his forecast that
turnover would show a gain of some 8 per cent to DM80bn for the full year,
with new orders 4 per cent higher at DM86bn.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex poised for Dollars 1.7bn
takeover of Valenciana
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CEMENTOS Mexicanos (Cemex), North America and Mexico's largest cement
producer, is expected to launch a Dollars 1.7bn takeover for Spain's biggest
producer, Valenciana de Cementos, in Madrid today. Yesterday it acquired
almost 25 per cent of the company.
The bid, which would be the largest ever takeover in Spain, will help Cemex
directly challenge Holderbank, of Switzerland, the world's leading cement
producer, and Cemex's main rival in the North American market.
According to sources at the Spanish stock market commission the bid for 100
per cent of Valenciana will be made at Pta15,000 a share. Valenciana's stock
closed yesterday at Pta14,600.
The Cemex bid represents a significant reversal of investment in the
international cement business, which during the 1980s was characterised by
heavy European investment in the North American market.
Cemex yesterday bought 24.9 per cent of Valenciana directly from the Spanish
company. This was Treasury stock held by the company which has been
supporting its share price as cement shares have weakened because of a sharp
slowdown in construction activity. At the price of the bid this stake would
be worth Dollars 425m.
Cemex is one of Mexico's largest industrial companies, with sales last year
of 5,300bn pesos (Dollars 1.76bn), and profits of 1,4000bn pesos. It
produces 22m tonnes of cement a year, the fourth highest cement production
in the world. Over the past few years it has disposed of its non-cement
holdings, and used the proceeds to make itself more competitive in the
domestic and international market.
In 1989 Cemex acquired Empresas Tolteca de Mexico, then the second largest
cement company in Mexico, for Dollars 663m. Cemex also owns over 50
ready-mix plants in southern US. In 1989 Cemex was the largest exporter to
the US, but in 1990 a successful anti-dumping case was brought against it,
bringing an abrupt end to its exports.
Valenciana is Spain's largest cement company, with production around 6m
tonnes, and 17 per cent of the market, the second largest in Europe after
Italy's.
Cemex has benefited from the Mexican government's recent relaxation of price
controls, and will earn in the next few years plenty of spare cash with
which to finance this latest acquisition. The company is already
well-capitalised, thanks to Dollars 637m share offering completed earlier
this year.
Cemex is planning to invest Dollars 1bn in the next three years to boost
capacity in Mexico by 35 per cent, and meet the growing demand for cement,
and ready-mix concrete. Once the expansion is complete, its production will
be 33m tonnes a year, just 2m less than the world's third largest producer,
La Farge of France.

</HEADLINE>

   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN HARRIS, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, the regional
electricity company privatised two years ago, was awarded a 102 per cent pay
increase last year. The rise, disclosed in the annual report published
yesterday, lifted Mr Harris's remuneration from Pounds 114,476 to Pounds
230,969 for the year to March 1992.
The increase is likely to reawaken the row over salaries in the privatised
electricity industry. Prof Basil Weedeon, chairman of the East Midlands
Electricity Consumers Committee, said: 'I am sure that the general public
will be greatly concerned by such a massive pay increase at a time of
recession.'
The chairmen and chief executives of the 12 regional electricity companies
were castigated by Labour politicians at this time last year, when they
increased their salaries by as much as 200 per cent. Most were earning
between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between
Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later.

TWO BIG mining groups, Minorco and Outokumpu, are to increase their
interests in Ivernia West, the junior Irish exploration company which owns
48 per cent of Europe's second-largest known zinc-lead deposit, at Lisheen,
County Tipperary.
Ivernia is to raise IPounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.15m), before expenses, by a
conditional placing of 11.6m shares at I39p each compared with an unchanged
closing price yesterday of I37p.
Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa, is to subscribe for enough shares to take its present 16.9 per
cent stake to 24.5 per cent while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish
resources group, will raise its shareholding slightly from 24.3 per cent to
24.5 per cent.
The balance of the Ivernia shares have been conditionally placed. Proceeds
will be mainly spent at Lisheen where Ivernia expects to contribute IPounds
3.75m to the joint venture during the coming year.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hanson sells off Beazer division in Pounds
52m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK contracting division of Beazer, the housebuilding, construction and
building materials group, has been sold to its employees and management in a
deal worth Pounds 52m.
Last year Beazer was rescued by Hanson, the conglomerate, and the sale marks
the first large disposal by Hanson since it paid Pounds 351m for Beazer.
Hanson earlier this year sold Beazer's Australian construction and property
interests for ADollars 34.5m to B&amp;B Asia, a Hong Kong based company
controlled by Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the German construction group.
The sale of the UK contracting division, to be renamed Kier Group after one
of its best known construction subsidiaries, will leave employees and
management controlling 90 per cent of the shares.
Hanson retains a 10 per cent stake in the new company, which is thought to
have generated sales of Pounds 570m in the year to the end of June,
including turnover of Pounds 47m from international contracts. This compares
with sales of Pounds 600m in the previous 12 months.
Under the terms of the deal Keir will pay Pounds 40m, raised through the
cash resources of its subsidiaries, to Hanson, which will receive a further
Pounds 2m from last year's profits
A further Pounds 2.7m has been raised through the issue of ordinary Kier
shares of which 45 per cent have been acquired by the company's 73
directors. A further 45 per cent is held in trust on behalf of the company's
3,000 workers.
In addition to its 10 per cent equity stake, Hanson has acquired Pounds 9.7m
of 5 per cent redeemable preference shares. Mr Colin Busby, chairman and
chief executive of Kier, said that the total package valued Kier at Pounds
52m.
He said the company, even after the Pounds 40m payment, would have net cash
of Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m. Kier, which has an order book currently worth
Pounds 376m, will have shareholders funds of Pounds 12.4m.
In a separate deal Kier has paid a further Pounds 1m to acquire Dudley
Coles, which was previously part of Hanson's ARC division.
Hanson said yesterday that it had no plans at the moment to dispose of
Beazer's other businesses, which include UK housebuilding and US contracting
and building materials interests.
It was pleased with the sale of the construction divisions which followed an
approach from Keir's directors at the end of last year.

Despite poor conditions in the property market, City Site Estates returned

Profit came to Pounds 190,000, against a loss of Pounds 1.99m for the

preference dividends, losses per share came to 2.43p (16.67p).
Mr William Syson, chairman, explained that the modest profit and continuing
uncertainty in the market prevented the directors from declaring an interim
dividend. Last year it was 0.96p.

Maintaining market share at the same time as tightening cost controls and
increasing efficiency enabled Wilshaw to lift pre-tax profit from Pounds
732,000 to Pounds 1.34m in the year ended March 31 1992.
Earnings per share rose to 1.07p (0.61p) and the final dividend is 0.3p for
a total of 0.4p (0.3p).
The group saw turnover decline to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 24.9m); but operating
profit improved to Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.81m), including an exceptional
credit of Pounds 56,000 (charge Pounds 182,000), and interest costs were cut
to Pounds 709,000 (Pounds 1.08m).
Specialist metals contributed Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 418,000) to operating
profits, primarily because SG Magnets turned from a significant loss to a
satisfactory profit.
Building products fell to Pounds 365,000 (Pounds 933,000).

Associated Nursing Services, the USM-quoted private nursing homes operator,
consolidated its return to black at the interim stage with a strong second
half and finished the year to April 4 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.53m.
The result was struck on turnover of Pounds 18.5m and compared with a loss

The net interest charge fell to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.82m). Gearing, after
the Pounds 6.27m placing in February, fell to 87 per cent against 229 per
cent last time. Net assets were 166p a share.
Earnings per share came out at 25.7p (42.8p losses) - after adjusting for
the placing pro-forma earnings were 18.2p. Again there is no final dividend,
the last payment being the 1991 interim of 1p.

AN INCREASED awareness of the need for security helped Reliance Security
Group raise its pre-tax profits by 5.5 per cent, from Pounds 3.25m to Pounds
3.42m, in the year to May 1. Turnover advanced 13 per cent, from Pounds
56.1m to Pounds 63.4m.
Mr Brian Kingham, chairman of this USM-traded group, said there was also a
continuing trend of large companies contracting out non-core activities and
Reliance was expanding its geographic coverage with the number of offices
rising from 17 to 27.
The profit increase was partly offset by the costs incurred in expanding
into electronic security. The bulk of these, amounting to Pounds 906,000,
came in the first half and Mr Kingham said there were signs that its market
was showing signs of recovery.
The result was achieved despite net interest costs rising to Pounds 291,000
(Pounds 197,000). Earnings per share were 20.5p (19.4p) and a final dividend
of 6.8p (6.2p) is proposed for a total payment of 9p (8.4p). A 1-for-1 scrip
is also planned.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: TT buys AB Electronic stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the acquisitive industrial holding company, has made its third
proposal so far this year by taking a 6.35 per cent stake in AB Electronic
Products, a loss-making components maker, and suggesting a merger.
AB Electronic said it was 'seeking clarification' of TT's intentions and
would make a further announcement 'in due course'.
AB's shares gained 12p to 90p, valuing the company at Pounds 25.7m. TT's
fell 7p to 215p.
The response by AB was more cordial than those from TT's previous targets.
TT still holds a 7.5 per cent stake in ML Holdings, another components
maker, and sold its 4.6 per cent stake in Renold, the chain and gear maker,
after Renold said the approach was unwelcome. TT also holds a 39.9 per cent
stake in Magnetic Materials following last year's unsuccessful takeover bid.
TT is keen to expand the business of its Crystalate division, maker of
electronic components, and may be especially attracted by AB's resistor
networks.
TT expressed interest in some AB operations earlier this year, but the
discussions faltered. TT's latest approach was unexpected.
AB, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.95m in the six months to 31
December, has also been discussing the sale or restructuring of other
divisions

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Searching for a new niche in the
supermarketplace - John Thornhill considers Asda's attempts to return to
basics and restore its former fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROMAN emperors who wished to enhance their prestige would often start their
reigns by running down the achievements of their predecessors and erasing
their names from their monuments, a process known as damnatio memoriae.
There was a touch of the laurel leaves about the new Asda team yesterday as
they chose to take a swingeing exceptional write-down of Pounds 451m, mostly
to cover the previous management's costly mistakes. Their greatest trophy,
the 60 superstores acquired from Gateway for Pounds 705m in 1989, is now
listed in the accounts at about Pounds 270m below acquisition price.
Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman of the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain, left
little doubt as to where the blame for Asda's current woes should be pinned.
'These results reflect the past management failures and the decisive first
steps by the new team to address the situation. It is the end of the past,'
he said at yesterday's press conference.
In saying so, he handed over to Mr Archie Norman, Asda's youthful chief
executive, who then laid out the strategy designed to ensure its 'robust
renewal'.
Mr Norman emphasised that this was at least a three-year programme which
would not produce significant results in the immediate future. Nevertheless,
he suggested that the company was already achieving a number of small 'wins'
by pegging its costs and insisting on more competitive pricing.
The 10-point recovery plan, which has already been presented to 1,000 store
managers, concentrates on returning the company to its early successful
heritage of 'meeting the weekly shopping needs of ordinary working people
and their families'.
The strategy, which has been evolved over the past six months, calls for a
narrower definition of Asda's marketplace, the re-establishment of its
reputation for keen prices, an increased emphasis on fresh foods, greater
product innovation and more varied regional ranges and higher levels of
productivity.
Although these changes might not sound revolutionary, Mr Norman nevertheless
claimed that they would produce significantly enhanced results and give Asda
a distinct position in the grocery marketplace.
'We need to break out into a virtuous circle,' Mr Norman said, arguing that
improved productivity would increase price competitiveness, restoring
customer flow and sales volumes, leading to better buying terms and
increasing profitability.
Over the next three years, Asda will redesign 140 of its 200 stores to
emphasise the values associated with the company's new strategy. 'We aren't
going to be like anybody else. We are going to be like Asda,' Mr Norman
said.
Asda will differ from the likes of J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway by
continuing to stock a wide range of non-food items, although the lay-outs of
these departments will be significantly altered.
'We are committed to clothing, home and leisure and we can do a lot more
with George,' Mr Norman said, referring to the range of casual clothes
stocked by Asda, designed by Mr George Davies, the former head of Next.
But although Asda will not be opening any new stores, it does not rule out
the possibility of rolling-out entirely new store concepts. It is currently
experimenting with a discount superstore concept, called Dales, which will
sell a range of 7,000 cut-price lines in a smart shopping environment. The
first Dales store has already opened in Longsight, Manchester, and initial
customer reaction is said to have been encouraging.
Another experimental store format will open this autumn although the
company's scope for such ventures will be limited by this year's capital
expenditure budget of Pounds 130m.
Asda also promises to move to staunch the losses at its Allied Maples
furnishings subsidiary. The company, which incurred a Pounds 9.8m loss last
year, is being cut to its profitable core, focusing mainly on carpets.
Already 17 stores have been shut and 13 per cent of the staff shed.
Such action will help stabilise Asda's financial position, allowing it to
concentrate on developing its core business. 'We are more confident than we
have ever been about making Asda a great company again,' Mr Norman said.
At present, the City is not quite sure what to make of this line. Asda is
undoubtedly a finely-balanced risk-reward scenario and the stockbroking
community is sharply divided about its prospects.
The bulls argue the downside of Asda's position is now distinctly limited.
Its financial position is stable, if still uncomfortable with year-end
borrowings of Pounds 677.8m, its sales losses are beginning to be stemmed,
and its core business can steadily restore its profitability.
There is little reason why Asda cannot successfully renew its trading format
and derive meaningful profits from its Pounds 4bn of sales and Pounds 2bn of
assets, they argue.
But the bears suggest that the industry's highly competitive pressures leave
little room for error and that Asda will be unable to drive down its debts
from normal cash flow. Raising further equity to enable it to do so further
down the line will only dilute any future rewards for shareholders.
Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, argues that
Asda's shares represent dead money, at best.
'Asda is not going to die. But shareholder value will be at least three
years in coming and maybe five. Why should you hold the shares in the
interim?' he asks.
The answer for the big institutional investors, who were persuaded by
Cazenove to back last year's rescue Pounds 357m rightsissue is that they
have no alternative, given Asda's current share price of 29 1/2 p, which is
still 5 1/2 p shy of the rights issue price.
But no doubt they will be persistently whispering such thoughts of mortality
into the ears of Asda's new emperors.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Asda in annual loss after Pounds 451m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the Leeds-based grocery chain, yesterday made an exceptional charge of
Pounds 451.6m as it announced its annual results.
The huge exceptional charge - combined with a 31 per cent reduction in
operating profits to Pounds 180m - resulted in a Pounds 364.8m pre-tax loss,
compared with a Pounds 168.3m profit the year before.
The write-downs at the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain had been well
trailed and Asda's share price barely flinched yesterday, closing down 1/2 p
at 29 1/2 p.
Mr Archie Norman, who took over as chief executive six months ago, said: 'We
were determined to restore credibility to the balance sheet and to move
forward from a prudent and realistic base.'
Asda wrote off Pounds 318.9m on its property and fixed assets. The company
said it had adopted a highly prudent policy of revaluing its superstores on
an open-market basis rather than at original cost, as is the practice at
most other grocery chains.
Asda also swallowed exceptional charges of Pounds 72.8m at Asda and Pounds
29.7m at its Allied Maples furnishings subsidiary relating to
rationalisation of those businesses. A further write-off of Pounds 30.2m
resulted from central distribution start-up costs and last year's financial
restructuring.
Asda's group turnover grew marginally from Pounds 4.47bn to Pounds 4.53bn in
the year to May 2.
Sales at Asda's 200 superstores were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 4.31bn but
its operating profits slid 26 per cent to Pounds 185.6m as a result of
higher operating costs and promotional spending and a tightening of margins.
Losses per share amounted to 18.41p (earnings of 8.66p) and Asda announced a
final dividend of 0.85p - as indicated at the time of last year's emergency
Pounds 357m rights issue - making a total payout of 2.1p (4.8p).
The company hinted however at a future cut in dividend; warning that any
payout would have to be covered twice by earnings.
During the year, Asda said, sales volumes were 'marginally positive' but
after stripping out food inflation of 4 per cent to 5 per cent they showed
significant slippage. Mr Norman said: 'Following the election there was a
recovery in confidence and spending. But in the last two to three weeks that
seems to have slowed up a little bit.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Gulf separates KIO from its former glory: Peter Bruce
outlines the problems of Kuwait's international investment arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) had a reputation as a powerful, secretive
and astute investor until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Now, as it struggles
to solve the problems of Ercros, its loss-making Spanish chemicals company,
it is also suffering from poor morale at its London headquarters and a
rapidly shrinking portfolio.
KIO sources inside and outside the group say that, since the invasion in
August 1990, its worldwide investment portfolio has shrunk by more than 50
per cent - it once stood at about Dollars 100bn (Pounds 52bn) - as the KIO
has been forced to help to cover the costs of the war. At one stage shortly
after the war, the KIO was actually paying most of the salaries in the
Kuwaiti government.
Employees are concerned that KIO's reputation as a quick, aggressive
investor is fast being bled away under a new management that is promoting
inexperienced Kuwaitis over long-serving UK staff at its London
headquarters. British employees were earlier this year paid lower bonuses
for their efforts during the Gulf war than their Kuwaiti colleagues.
Mr Ali Raschid al-Bader, the new president, a banker with long experience of
the highly bureaucratic state sector in Kuwait, will not discuss group
strategy. He bewildered the City earlier this year, however, by selling most
of the KIO's 10.3 per cent stake in Midland Bank after Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank first bid for it.
'The takeover could not have happened without KIO's consent,' says a former
KIO official. 'They could have made up to Dollars 60m more had they waited.'
The KIO had accumulated immense international influence by the time of the
invasion. It once held more than 20 per cent of BP, though it was forced to
cut this back. In addition to Midland in the UK, it had big holdings in Hogg
Robinson, Henry Ansbacher and Triplex Lloyd. It has big holdings in
Daimler-Benz, Metallgesellschaft, Hoechst, Fiat and Paribas.
It was in Spain with a young Catalan banker, Mr Javier de la Rosa, that KIO
made its single biggest economic impact. Its Spanish assets, built up since
1984, are worth between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 7bn. It owns Spain's biggest
chemicals company, Ercros, its biggest paper producer, Torras Papel, its
richest foods group, Ebro, and controls one of its largest property
companies, Prima.
The future of all of those businesses has now been thrown into doubt by
KIO's decision last week to force Ercros - with 10,500 employees and debts
of Dollars 2.5bn - to seek protection from its creditors.
Mr de la Rosa has severed his links with KIO and its Spanish holding
company, Torras, and the new management at KIO, knowing little about Spain,
may have ruffled years of carefully constructed financial relationships by
refusing to pump more money into Ercros and forcing its bankers to go to the
courts for their money.
The banks are angry and, with the Spanish economy in deep trouble, so is the
government. Ercros's problems stem from its ruinous fertiliser businesses,
which have failed to fight off a dramatic rise in imports in the last two
years. Some of the blame lies with a former president who incorporated the
state's fertiliser company into Ercros in 1990 but never followed through
with a rationalisation programme.
By the time the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, it was too late for KIO to take the
necessary action. Kuwait was lobbying for Spanish support for the liberation
of its territory and could not sack thousands of Spanish workers at the same
time. 'In a way', says one former KIO official, 'while we paid for US,
French and UK support for the war with cash, we paid Spain by employing
people we did not need at Ercros.'
Ercros may be a symptom of a deeper malaise at KIO. The new management views
its Spanish portfolio as an ugly inheritance. Technically, as Torras claims
to own only 39 per cent of Ercros, KIO is only an investor and not liable
for its debts.
That fits neatly with the KIO's new view that its global vocation is as a
more passive investor, but it raises questions about the future of its other
Spanish companies. Its treatment of Ercros - some of whose creditors will
have their loans guaranteed by the state or by Torras - has depressed shares
of Ebro and Prima. Banco Santander, heavily exposed to Torras, is said to be
pressing for guarantees of repayment.
'If the KIO starts running down its Spanish businesses in public it will
become a self-fulfilling prophecy,' says a Madrid analyst. 'It will become
impossible to sell off Ercros without a massive injection of funds.'
KIO's problem is that it is the public face of Kuwait in international
capital markets, and its credibility as a borrower may be at stake in
Ercros.
It administers a Dollars 5.5bn loan to help rebuild Kuwait. Torras also has
a convertible bond, worth some Dollars 100m outstanding which, if banks come
to view the Ercros filing as a default, could be threatened.
'Ercros will definitely reflect on their credibility in the markets,' says
an analyst in Madrid. This year Kuwait will earn about Dollars 3bn from oil,
while its budget for 1992 is worth Dollars 15bn. The deficit will have to be
financed by borrowing or disposals by KIO, which does not admit that it is
selling assets and has never recognised the scale of disposals it has had to
make since the war.
'Our problem is that we have imported Kuwait into London headquarters', says
a former KIO official, 'and the office is much more bureaucratic and not
able to deal quickly the way it used to. The effects of the Ercros decision
may show that perceptions are much more important than the legality of what
we are doing.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Union Discount shares fall after warning of Pounds 15m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Union Discount, one of the City's leading discount houses, plunged
from 115p to 64p yesterday following a warning that interim results would
reveal a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 15m.
Union, which traded at 445p 12 months ago, also said it would pass the
interim dividend and review the final payout.
Mr George Blunden, who was appointed chief executive on June 1 following the
departure of Mr Graeme Gilchrist in February, said it was unlikely that the
group would make a profit in the full year.
He said he was determined 'to clear out the stables' so shareholders 'don't
get any more bad news'.
The warning was accompanied by an announcement on the sale of part of
Union's dental equipment leasing business, Herald Financial Services, for
Pounds 18.2m cash.
Yesterday's statement was seen as a further blow to the group's hard pressed
money market operations. Last year Union announced its first loss on
discounting operations in 29 years.
The chief executive said the discount house had an 'excessive' cost base in
relation to its reduced capital base. Steps had been taken, however, and
further redundancies were expected.
The City was shocked at the warning and news of more provisions on the Sabre
Leasing office equipment business.
'It is just short of disastrous,' said Ms Karen Bennett of BZW. 'Herald was
the only saleable asset they had left. The longer the recession continues,
the more pain Sabre is going to inflict.'
Union fell into the red in 1991 with a Pounds 23.6m pre-tax loss. Sabre
accounted for most of the Pounds 16.25m operating deficit on leasing.
Mr Blunden said Union would in future concentrate on its money market and
equity operations, in effect reversing the ill-starred move into leasing
begun in 1986. However, he refused to be drawn on whether there were any
buyers for Sabre.
Ms Bennett said BZW was forecasting a Pounds 17m loss for the full year.
However, there were still questions over the valuations of two properties.
Mr Blunden refused to comment on possible property provisions. He was also
unable to disclose the amount of provisions for Sabre because of reporting
restrictions.

FT  07 JUL 92 / ENI to sell majority of Agip and Snam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENI, the state-owned Italian energy and chemicals group, plans eventually to
sell more than 50 per cent of the shares in Agip and Snam, its petroleum and
natural gas subsidiaries.
Selling more than 50 per cent of the companies would be a rare move in the
Italian public sector.
ENI hopes to raise a minimum of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) by selling the
first 10 per cent of shares in Agip before the end of this year.
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's chairman, said his ambition was to sell more
than 50 per cent of both companies. Plans to float both are at an advanced
stage, he said. Subject to approval by Italy's new government, an initial
public offering could take place before the year-end, with shares being
quoted on international stock markets. State-owned companies, even when
quoted, remain under strict government control. Only the Sirti cables group,
part of the state's telecommunications interests, has more than half of its
ordinary shares listed.
In this instance, state control is guaranteed through a formal pact between
public and private-sector shareholders. Otherwise, listings above the
crucial 50 per cent level involve only non-voting savings stock.
Analysts say pricing for the flotation of Agip, which last week signed a
huge oil and gas deal with the government of Kazakhstan, would be complex.
However, an initial 10 per cent stake in the company, which has reserves of
around 5bn barrels of oil equivalent, could be worth around Dollars 2bn
based on the value of its reserves, priced at Dollars 3 to Dollars 4 a
barrel.
Mr Cagliari said the aim was to sell an initial 10 per cent to 20 per cent
of Agip and Snam. Further dilutions of ENI's stake would come in stages,
with the timing depending partly on assurances that no individual
shareholder was building up a preponderant position.
ENI may have a political battle on its hands to push through its plans. Some
politicians have called for a flotation of ENI itself, rather than its
subsidiaries, to boost the Italian exchequer.
The destination of the proceeds from privatisations could be the single most
important issue in determining the timing and nature of flotations, both at
ENI and, possibly, Iri, Italy's biggest state holding company.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Paris acts to break road blocks: Riot police move in as
shortages force companies to lay off workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government moved strongly against defiant lorry drivers
yesterday, calling in 13,000 riot police with armoured cars and helicopters
to dismantle some of the road blocks thrown up over the past week.
But the tussle between police and the recalcitrant truckers continued last
night, with drivers in some cases erecting new road blocks just a few miles
away from those dismantled. Many barriers were still in place.
Drivers embarked on the national blockade in protest against tough new
licence rules under which drivers can be banned from the road after clocking
up six penalty points.
Police mounted a determined effort to crack some of the strategic points in
the truckers' blockade as signs emerged of economic strain caused by the
protest.
Until the weekend the damage to French business had been comparatively
slight, but yesterday dozens of companies announced temporary lay-offs
because of supply shortages.
Peugeot, the car company, said it may lay off up to 18,000 workers today.
Citroen warned of the suspension of 2,500 employees.
The Patronat, the French employers' federation, said the situation was
becoming 'very serious' in vulnerable sectors such as tourism, petrol,
farming and food in the regions where the protests had been strongest,
including the Mediterranean coast and Rhone Alpes. The Patronat warned that
if the dispute continued, many companies could face cash flow problems.
Neighbouring countries have also felt the effects of the dispute. The
British arm of Peugeot resumed production yesterday after being left
temporarily short of components, but the Confederation of British Industry
said many more companies would be affected if the dispute continued.
German industry has so far taken the inconvenience in its stride. But
Volkswagen chartered a transport aircraft to carry parts to its Spanish car
plant.
It appeared last night the Socialist government was beginning to master the
most serious threat to public order since Mr Pierre Beregovoy became prime
minister three months ago. But it was unclear how long the improvement would
last, given protesters' skill in forming new roadblocks.
Police relied on a show of force, which appears to have persuaded many to
drive away. Truckers have also been discouraged by a government campaign to
confiscate the ringleaders' licences.
One of the first roadblocks to go was on the northern A1 Paris-Lille
motorway, the main artery to central France from the Channel ports, Belgium
and the Netherlands. An armoured tractor towed away a truck at the head of
the queue. The remaining protesters then drove off, sounding their horns.
One driver said: 'That's it. We are off. They are not going to bust our
working tools,' after a policeman smashed the window of his truck to reach
the brake.
By yesterday morning rail traffic had returned to normal between Marseilles
and Lyons, after weekend travellers were held up by rail blocks imposed by
farmers protesting that truckers had prevented deliveries.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: BSkyB view of current financial profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is hardly surprising that Mr Christopher Bland takes such a
jaundiced view of BSkyB's financial position (Letters, July 3) as the loss
of the Premier League contract must have come as a considerable blow to his
company. However, some of his points should not pass unchallenged.
In March 1992, BSkyB announced that it had reached operating profitability
and that it would achieve cash flow break-even in May 1992. This forecast
has proved to be accurate, and the Pounds 33m of remaining shareholder
financing is now unlikely to be required.
The debt in the company is all either owing to shareholders or guaranteed by
shareholders. The interest payable out of operating cash flow is less than
Pounds 12m per annum. The rest accrues and will be paid to shareholders when
they so decide. The 'negative net worth of Pounds 1.3bn' therefore
represents the shareholders' initial investment in the company, which is in
the form of a debt instrument rather than an equity instrument.
The future programme rights contracted (but not provid-ed for in the
accounts) of Pounds 950m are in respect of BSkyB's output deals with
Hollywood studios.
These contracts give the company exclusive rights to pay-television in the
UK, and will be largely responsible for the company's growth to become the
largest broadcaster in the UK.
More informed comment on the company's financial position and prospects has
come from a number of stockbroking research companies, including Warburgs,
which was ranked (July 2) number one in the league table of research
companies. The two most recent analyst reports, from BZW and Morgan Stanley,
have both valued BSkyB in excess of Pounds 3bn.

Non-alcoholic fumes could soon be wafting Japanese businessmen into the land
of nod. Suntory, the country's leading drinks producer, seeking a solution
to the problem of sleeplessness caused by stress, has stumbled on a new
nightcap.
Scientists at its Institute for Fundamental Research in Osaka put a number
of human guinea-pigs under pressure by giving them a maths test and keeping
them 'in a state of arousal'. Their rooms were then filled with six
different smells to see which most quickly soothed them to sleep.
Although a slug of Suntory Royal whisky ought to have done the trick, a
sniff of bitter orange proved most effective.

Francis Maude, the second youngest of the bunch of Tory ministers to lose
their parliamentary seats, seems to be winning the race to get rich quick in
the private sector while he plots his political comeback.
Having advised the Hongkong Bank in its successful bid for Midland, Maude
has picked up a lucrative job as head of privatisation at Salomon Brothers
and now he has been given a seat on the Asda board. Not bad going for a
39-year-old who stands as good a chance as anyone of getting the next safe
Parliamentary seat, especially now that Chris Patten has emigrated to Hong
Kong.
John Maples who, like Maude, would almost certainly have also been picked
for the Cabinet if he had held onto his seat, has also found a nice little
earner as chairman of a government lobbying arm of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. But he
is ten years older than Maude and his political future is less certain.
Sir David Trippier's name is beginning to appear as a non-executive director
but the likes of Michael Fallon, Colin Moynihan and Christopher Chope have
yet to resurface in the appointments columns.

It will take a lot more than the collapse of the Japanese stock market to
knock Japan's Taikichiro Mori off his perch as the world's wealthiest
person.
Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the world's billionaires shows that
despite falling property prices the 88-year-old Japanese real estate tycoon
still boasted a personal fortune of Dollars 13bn. Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, 58, a
railway and golf course tycoon, remains the second richest with a Dollars
10bn fortune arising from a 40 per cent stake in the family-run company,
Kokudo.
By contrast, Bill Gates, the 36-year-old Harvard dropout and founder of
Microsoft, may be the richest American, but he is only worth Dollars 6.4bn.
But despite Japan's pole position, the US tops the list with 101 individuals
or families out of 291 worth Dollars 1bn or more. Germany is second with 44
billionaire fortunes and Japan comes in third with 34. For the first time,
Richard Branson joins the billionaires list; Forbes says he is worth about
Dollars 1.2bn.
But it is Latin America which has unearthed a surge of capitalist energy; up
from eight to 21 billionaires this year.

Sir Bryan Carsberg, the new director-general of fair trading, wants a couple
of months to read himself in before making grand pronouncements about
general competition policy. But one tentative judgment can already be made.
Sir Bryan, the former telephone regulator, seems to be taking a tougher line
on the buffet lunch - a sensitive indicator for many journalists.
Whereas the outgoing Sir Gordon Borrie laid on a good spread, Sir Bryan
seems to be under the impression that journalists can be influenced with
peanuts, crisps and wine. As a result, some of Fleet Street's finest were
not overly impressed with their first briefing session with the new OFT boss
yesterday.
But what can you expect when you replace a barrister with an accountant?

FT  07 JUL 92 / Observer: Discounted directors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to remember in these days of enlightened corporate governance
that some City firms used to pack their boards with non-executive directors
who were also customers.
For clearing banks in particular it was a good way of making sure that the
competition did not poach a customer's business.
But the custom was never more prevalent than among the City's discount
houses. Unlike the old accepting houses, the discount houses were never
great powers in the land so they relied on friends in high places to funnel
business in their direction.
It is no longer enough; Union Discount, once the sector leader, passed its
dividend yesterday after another horrendous loss and is now worth a mere
Pounds 12 1/2 m or so in the stock market.
Its board of non-executive directors used to read like a who's who in the
City. Could this perhaps be part of the reason for this famous firm's sad
decline? Certainly, its dismal record can't be blamed on a shortage of well
qualified non-executive directors. It has always had lots of them.
John Sclater, the new chairman of Hill Samuel and chairman of Foreign and
Colonial, has been on the board since 1981 and Lord Remnant, chairman of
National Provident Institution, has been a director since 1968. Less than a
decade ago, the chairmen of Barclays Bank and Morgan Grenfell were also on
the Union board.
Given that The Union's problems stem largely from its shift from core
business to ill-advised diversification, on which sage part-time directors
with wide experience ought to have been able to advise, the corporate
governance experts may have cause to ponder the lessons of Union's unhappy
experience.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Obituary: Interventionist with a zest for action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Kearton, who died last week at the age of 81, was one of the
outstanding industrialists of the postwar era. As chairman of Courtaulds
between 1964 and 1975, he drove the company forward from its base in fibres
into fabric and apparel manufacture, and in the process reshaped the British
textile industry.
His influence extended to other industries, particularly through his
chairmanship of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the 1960s, and
British National Oil Corporation in the 1970s.
To all these posts - and to many other part-time roles in both public and
private sectors - Frank Kearton brought a zest for action and a readiness to
seize opportunities. It was these qualities which transformed Courtaulds
from a respected but declining member of the British business establishment
into a vehicle for dynamic growth.
Some of the growth was ill-conceived. It might even be said that Kearton
saved Courtaulds and then nearly destroyed it through over-expansion. The
problems which he bequeathed to his successors, compounded by the severe
recession and overvaluation of sterling in 1980-82, were formidable. Yet
Kearton gave Courtaulds new life, broadening the range of businesses which
the company could do well.
Born in 1911, Christopher Frank Kearton was educated at Hanley High School
and at St John's College, Oxford, where he took a first class degree in
chemistry. Despite earlier thoughts of becoming an academic, he joined the
oil-from-coal project at ICI's Billingham works, and was later involved in
the production of aviation gasoline for the second world war. He was invited
to join the Anglo-American nuclear weapons programme, and worked on the fuel
enrichment side of the project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
He rejoined ICI briefly after the war, but in 1946 he was recruited by
Courtaulds to head the chemical engineering department. Six years later he
was appointed to the board and played an important part in the more
expansionist strategy that began after 1957.
Kearton was closely involved in the merger with British Celanese,
Courtaulds' main rival in rayon, in the development of Courtelle acrylic
fibre and in Courtaulds' diversification into paint and packaging. But it
was the bid from ICI in 1961 which galvanised Courtaulds into a far more
aggressive set of policies and put Kearton into the driving seat.
A press conference held by Courtaulds to explain its attitude to the bid
began with introductory statements from the deputy chairman and other
directors. Then, as D C Coleman, historian of the company, described the
scene: 'Kearton took over and began more and more to dominate the
conference. It was an egocentric performance with plentiful use of the first
person singular, but it was also vigorous, assertive, fluent and confident.
He laid about ICI . . . He threw facts and figures about with cheerful
abandon and some inaccuracy. He raised laughs, bubbled with ideas and was
the total antithesis of the old, stuffy Courtaulds.'
Seeing off ICI was one thing. Devising a strategy for profitable growth was
quite another. Courtaulds was over-dependent on a declining group of
wood-based fibres, viscose rayon and acetate; its principal customer, the
Lancashire textile industry, was extremely weak. Diversification, both in
the newer synthetic fibres and away from textiles, had been seen as a
priority before the ICI bid. But after the bid the urgent need to secure
outlets for fibre impelled Courtaulds into a hectic programme of taking over
spinning, weaving, knitting and garment-making companies.
As Arthur Knight, Kearton's successor as chairman, later wrote: 'At no stage
was the objective of Courtaulds becoming a fully fledged vertical group
(from fibres through textile manufacture to garment-making) explicitly
enunciated, and an account in retrospect of the development makes it all
seem much more logical than it appeared while it was going on.'
Vertical integration was a reaction to events - the threatened disappearance
of a large part of Courtaulds' UK customer base - and Kearton plunged into
it with characteristic verve.
Was this strategy correct? Courtaulds seemed to have no alternative if it
was to safeguard its fibres business. But Kearton assumed too readily that
managers brought up in capital-intensive fibre production could adapt
quickly to the fashion-sensitive and shorter-term requirements of the
downstream industry. There was an optimistic be-lief that competitive
success could be won by throwing management and money at the problem.
With hindsight it might be said that Kearton approached the textile
industry's problems from the wrong end. Retailing was central - and one of
Kearton's errors was to try to build up Courtaulds as a counterweight to the
retailers. He resented the domination of Marks and Spencer; he wanted to
call the tune himself. What also proved to be wrong - again with the benefit
of hindsight - was the idea that Courtaulds could become a low-cost,
high-volume supplier of standard textile goods to the rest of Europe.
The climate of the l960s favoured large-scale mergers, reflecting an
over-simplified diagnosis that British industry was too fragmented to
compete effectively in world markets. Appropriately enough, Kearton was
chosen by the Labour government to chair the Industrial Reorganisation
Corporation (IRC), which helped to bring about some of the biggest mergers
of the late l960s.
Kearton's commitment to active state intervention in industry made him a
natural choice, under the next Labour government, to head the British
National Oil Corporation - a post which he took on after retiring from
Courtaulds in 1975.
Supported by the then energy minister, Mr Tony Benn, Kearton was not content
with a passive role in the North Sea, monitoring developments on behalf of
the government. After the transfer to BNOC of Burmah Oil's North Sea assets,
Kearton's team was soon completing the Thistle field as operator and
building up its own exploration programme.
The Thatcher government saw no place for a state-owned oil company, but
Kearton's retirement from BNOC enabled him to start a third career as an
active member of the House of Lords, a dedicated chancellor of the
University of Bath, and a participant in numerous committees and
institutions connected with industry, technology and education.
As a businessman, Kearton was a breath of fresh air in the staid ranks of
British industrialists. He was unusual in combining scientific distinction
with entrepreneurial flair; to this was added remarkable stamina and a
fierce will to win.
His enthusiasm was infectious, especially among younger colleagues. He had
an extraordinary capacity to absorb and retain information, and a readiness
to deploy it selectively in support of whatever point he might be making. He
could be a formidable, even ferocious opponent, but he showed unswerving
loyalty and friendship to those who worked with him.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Fighter tamed by friendly skies: Volker Ruhe, Germany's
defence minister, explains his government's decision on the EFA to David
Marsh and Edward Mortimer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has always considered himself
an Anglophile. It is a matter of regret to him that his first important
decision as defence minister, to end German participation in the European
Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, is one that causes problems between Germany
and Britain. But he is quite firm about it, quite clear about his reasons
for it, and philosophical about the unkind things the British press has had
to say - though he does resent suggestions that Germany has shown itself an
unreliable partner. 'My relationship with Britain started with Shakespeare,'
he declares, 'and it's not going to end with EFA.'
One point he was anxious to get across in London yesterday, both to his
opposite number Mr Malcolm Rifkind and to Conservative back-benchers, was
that Germany never committed itself to production of the aircraft. The
commitment was to research and develop it, and Germany is still willing to
pay its share of the development costs if its partners decide to go ahead.
Mr Ruhe would prefer, however, to redirect the money not yet spent (which he
estimates at DM 3bn (Pounds 1bn) - 50 per cent of the total) to the
development of a new, 'drastically cheaper' aircraft, corresponding to the
requirements of a strategic context which has changed out of recognition
since the original decision to develop EFA was taken in 1984.
Mr Ruhe argues that the present EFA cannot be slimmed down any further. He
says it has already been cut to a point where it no longer makes sense, by
cutting out a number of crucial features such as friend-foe identification -
savings he regards as illusory, since both manufacturers and the purchasing
air forces would certainly argue for the reinstatement of such features
later in the programme.
With his penchant for plain speaking, Mr Ruhe brings a touch of populism to
his job entirely absent from the desiccated tones of his predecessor, Mr
Gerhard Stoltenberg. Whereas Mr Stoltenberg could sound like a somewhat
academic pastor, Mr Ruhe peppers his conversations with phrases such as:
'When the earth changes, shouldn't the plane change too?'
Perhaps most irritating to his British interlocutors is Mr Ruhe's relaxed
position on the timing of any decision on the production of a new aircraft.
He would be happy to leave it till 1996, since Germany is modernising the
American Phantom fighters it already has in service, and will not need
replacements before 2000 or even 2001. The British and Italian air forces
are in much more of a hurry.
Yet Mr Ruhe believes his worries about cost overruns are shared by Germany's
partners. His semi-ironic message, repeated incessantly in London yesterday,
was that 'Germany is not the only poor country in Europe'. The Spaniards, he
believes, are already close to his position, and the Italians for budgetary
reasons will almost certainly not be able to take up their full quota of
aircraft. And if his partners do agree, he would very much like to bring in
the French as well.
There is always the obvious fall-back option of buying American, but this
has been ruled out by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr
Ruhe refuses to discuss it publicly. Mr Waigel's Christian Social Union,
based in Bavaria, home to much of the German aerospace industry, has argued
strongly in favour of the EFA.
Mr Ruhe points out that the economics of the EFA have been undermined by the
increased number of arms manufacturers (including Russians) jostling for
position on a much reduced export market for sophisticated weapons systems.
The vital position, he agrees, is that of the UK, but he believes the debate
there is only beginning, in contrast to the intense political argument which
has raged in Germany over the aircraft's future ever since it was first
mooted.
Mr Ruhe would like to end this 'religious warfare over weapons systems' by
starting a dialogue with the 'constructive forces' in the Social Democratic
opposition.
A similar dialogue is necessary in another controversial aspect of German
defence policy - whether German troops are to be deployed outside the Nato
area, either as 'blue helmet' peacekeepers or in a more active 'peacemaking'
role.
Mr Ruhe has already stretched the consensus to its limit by despatching a
150-man medical corps to Cambodia, and three 'humanitarian' aircraft to
Sarajevo. He has argued that combat units could be sent on peacekeeping
operations without amending the German constitution, but on this point both
his Free Democrat partners and the Social Democrat opposition disagree.
He makes no bones of the fact that his motives for dropping the EFA are
political as well as budgetary. Traditionally in post-war Germany the
defence ministry has been a graveyard for political careers. Mr Ruhe - a
foreign policy spokesman and adviser before Mr Kohl made him general
secretary of the CDU in 1989 - would certainly have preferred to be foreign
minister, had that post not been the preserve of the junior partner in the
coalition, the Free Democratic Party.
But Mr Ruhe, who clearly harbours ambitions to become chancellor himself one
day, has skilfully exploited his new post by adopting the popular role of a
cost-cutting defence minister - an option made available by the end of the
Cold War - rather than the previously inescapable one of spokesman for the
armed forces.
He is also, more than some other west German politicians, acutely conscious
of the need to cement the unification of the country. Born in 1942, he spent
a few years of his early childhood in the east after the end of the war, and
has lived with the knowledge that if his mother had stayed there, instead of
returning to Hamburg, he would have grown up as an east German. As a result
he was always sensitive to the consequences west German policy might have
for the lives of ordinary people in the east, and when unification came he
was quick to proclaim, as a north German Protestant, that the country as a
whole must expect to change.
Today, he justifies his decision on the EFA by pointing out that the
aircraft was commissioned at a time when there were thousands of Soviet
aircraft in east Germany. He argues that if the government went ahead with
it now east Germans would see it as 'a symbol of west German business as
usual' - exactly the wrong signal for the government to send at a time when
there is talk of forming separate east German parties.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Sharp split in Spain: Government and industry disagree about
the costs and benefits of the aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's decision not to participate in the prod-uction phase of the
European Fighter Aircraft project has exposed sharp divisions between the
Spanish govern-ment and the country's aerospace industry.
Immediately after a majority of the German government coalition decided last
week not to include production funds in the budget for next year, Casa, the
state-owned Spanish aerospace group and the lead EFA contractor in the
country, announced it was determined to go ahead with the project even if it
meant assuming new costs.
For Casa and the Spanish aircraft industry, the EFA is vital; the project
has already involved large transfers of technology to Spain, particularly in
composite materials. A joint venture with Rolls-Royce to build EFA engines
in the politically unstable and economically deprived Basque region is also
dependent on the project going ahead intact.
By the time the German decision had been made, however, Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
Spain's prime minister, was already entertaining serious doubts about
whether Spain would stay in the project.
Mindful of the strains being placed on the economy by a 55 per cent growth
in the government deficit this year, the defence ministry warned the
aerospace industry that budgetary considerations would be paramount when it
came to deciding whether, or how, to proceed with production.
Last week, the defence ministry said that Spain, which has a 13 per cent
share of the project, wanted to cut the costs of the aircraft by changing
EFA's technical specifications and cutting the cost of the overall project.
The ministry added that it hoped it would be possible to build a
pan-European aircraft to replace its ageing Mirage F/1 air defence aircraft.
In addition to the costs of the EFA, Spain has also been uncomfortable about
the absence from the project of France, its most important European economic
and political partner.
Last week, after meeting Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, in
Madrid, Mr Gonzalez said he had invited France to consider rejoining some
form of project to build a European fighter. 'The project has changed since
it was begun,' he said, 'and it would be advisable to adapt it to the new
(international political) situation.'
For the moment, however, Madrid is unlikely to make any precipitate
unilateral decision over its future participation in the project. Spain will
probably use the next round of discussions with its EFA partners to try to
find some common ground between Germany's wish for a cheaper and lighter
aircraft and Britain's desire to proceed with the original project.
Should Spain be forced to choose between producing the original aircraft
with just two remaining partners or to drop out of production, current
budgetary restraints make it likely that it would be forced to take the the
latter course of action.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A beleaguered government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S A funny old world, as Mr Major's predecessor remarked after her abrupt
exit from office. Three months ago, Mr Major was a hero to his party. Now
his supporters are fretful about the Maastricht Treaty and, still more,
about the economy. People even ask whether UK membership of the exchange
rate mechanism, Mr Major's most important decision, was not a mistake.
The questioning is unsurprising. The latest consensus of forecasts is for UK
economic growth between 1991 and 1992 of only 0.4 per cent. Last December,
by contrast, growth was expected to be 1.8 per cent. This collapse in the
forecast parallels what happened last year, when what turned out to be a
decline of 2.2 per cent had been forecast the previous December as growth of
0.3 per cent. No growth at all this year, and perhaps a decline, are
plausible. The consensus forecast for growth of 2 1/2 per cent between 1992
and 1993 could also end up as optimistic.
Consider what even the current consensus would mean. Between 1986, when the
economy was start-ing to take off, and 1993, when the economy is at present
expected to recover, growth would have averaged 1.8 per cent a year. All
that those years of low growth would have achieved is a reduction in retail
price inflation from 3.7 per cent between 1985 and 1986, to the forecast
level of 3 1/2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993. True,
inflation might be lower than that next year, even substantially lower, but
only if economic growth were also still less.
Painful side effects
This is not all. Recession has had painful side effects, among them the
deterioration of the public finances. The public sector borrowing
requirement could be much more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product
this year and still more thereafter. So healthy were the UK's public
finances at the end of the 1980s that some years of heavy borrowing can be
contemplated. But in the end deficits on this scale will destroy the
credibility of the exchange rate policy on which the government has set its
heart.
Mistakes have been made. Yet current policy could still pass the 'Bundesbank
test', this being whether the German central bank would adopt current UK
monetary policy if it were to be directly, instead of only indirectly,
responsible for that lumbering beast. Faced with an economy 'bumping along
the bottom', but with underlying inflation running at about 5 per cent a
year and earnings at 7 per cent, though both on a declining trend, the
Bundesbank might retain short interest rates at 10 per cent.
The question is for how long it would do so. Contrary to government
propaganda, low inflation does not guarantee a recovery. Lower inflation
normally produces recovery, because it allows substantial reductions in
short-term interest rates.
Remote chances
The chances of lower British interest rates depend on Germany. But every
piece of news on German monetary overshooting and the resilience of the
German economy makes the chances of marked monetary easing look more remote.
If German rates stay up, the more successful the UK turns out to be in
lowering its inflation, the higher will real interest rates become.
For an economy in the midst of debt-deflation, this is alarming. The nature
of the danger is revealed by the US, with official short-term rates of
interest at 3 per cent, and Australia, with rates of 6.5 per cent. Both
countries share the British debt problem; both have far more expansion-ary
monetary policies; both are making only modest recoveries, nevertheless.
Unhappily, all options are dismal. These are to:
soldier on, hoping that the economy will soon turn up or German interest
rates turn down;
seek a realignment, which would probably lead to higher UK interest rates
and, unless substantial, would give only a modest boost to economic
activity;
quit the ERM, which would leave the government without a monetary policy and
be like a nuclear bomb landed on top of its European policy as well; and
push for the earliest possible move to economic and monetary union, with a
central bank that would look at the European economy as a whole, not just
one region of it.
Given the nature of the alternatives, there can be no question of changing
policy today. A government dedicated to lower inflation could also justify
its current policies, even if it were not constrained by the ERM. But how
long could it do so? The answer must depend both on what happens to the
economy and on the costs of any policy change.
Since the point of entering the ERM was to put the UK in a straitjacket, it
is not surprising to find that it is indeed in one. The patient has derived
some benefit from the treatment. The question is how long the UK will bear
to wear it.

There is, of course, no one way to tackle a masterpiece. While Welsh
National Opera is busy touring southern Britain with its new production of
Gluck's penultimate opera, it seems peculiarly rewarding that the same work
should have been chosen by English Bach Festival for Sunday's annual
presentation at the Royal Opera House. The contrasts of style and approach
between the two stagings are extreme; since both are valid and deeply
affecting on their own terms, our appreciation of the work's naked power can
only be sharpened thereby.
Welsh National Opera, true to its fashion, has come up with a hard-edged
modern re-invention of the tragedie-lyrique form and Gluck's magnificently
concentrated dramatic language. English Bach Festival, true to its, has
tried to re-create, as faithfully as its not limitless resources allow, the
'period' usages of that form and language.
People familiar with the recent English Bach Festival accounts of Gluck's
Paris Orfeo and Alceste and Mozart's Mitridate and Idomeneo will have known
what to expect: the deft scene changes, the classically proportioned scenic
vistas, the graceful floating movements of chorus and dance-troupe, the
helmets, breastplates, feathered head-dresses and ballooned skirts, the
aristocratic plastique of the principal players.
What may have surprised them were the qualities of lightness, clarity and
intensity that these 'period' traits and properties, carefully trained and
focused, can strike up in the opera. This performance, conducted by Marc
Minkowski, produced by Alain Germain, designed (after 1770s Paris models) by
Terence Emery, choreographed by Stephen Preston and lit by Roger Frith, was
indeed thus trained and focused. The 'beautiful simplicity' that Gluck once
proclaimed the goal of all his innovations was its guiding principle.
Every movement seemed musically inspired, every combination of word, action,
vocal colour and instrumental detail unforced, and newly meaningful. From
the raised pit the orchestral sound issued with a tensile directness worlds
away from any applications of driving force or mere loudness. Similar
concerns were evident in the phrasing of the leading singers, none more
distinguished, eloquent or affecting than Jennifer Smith in the title role.
The dignity of Miss Smith's performance lay above all in its expressive
refinement; a slight curdling of tone at the top of the stave appeared here
a chosen interpretative device, not a vocal failing.
Russell Smythe's Orestes, in spite of minor pitch sharpenings, was of
classically French baritonal authority - lean, pure, noble; Andreas Jaggi
(Pylades) gave a skilful display of his more slender vocal means; Donald
Maxwell was far more successful at conveying the dark terrors of Thoas's
single aria than the usual bawler of modern productions. This Iphigenie en
Tauride seemed to me the peak of EBF achievement in recent years.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: Alfred Sisley, an Englishman abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the great impressionists, Alfred Sisley was the one Englishman. He was
born in Paris in 1839 of English parents and, for all that he had recently
applied for French citizenship, still English at the time of his death early
in 1899, at the age of 59. But the question of nationality is less important
than that of the work in its context - as with Whistler and Sargent, his
near-contemporaries. In this respect Sisley was French enough, intimate
colleague and member of a profoundly French school.
But yet, perhaps by virtue of his equivocal expatriate status, and the
habitual deference retrospectively imposed upon his reputation, we consider
him still 'the forgotten', 'the minor', patronisingly 'the one true
impressionist'. It is as though to find oneself, and then to remain true to
that vision, is in some sense an admission of inadequacy, even a betrayal,
so strong have the orthodoxies of modernism, with their assumed necessities
of innovation and experiment as opposed to quiet development, become.
Small as it is, for so significant an exercise, this retrospective
exhibition at the Royal Academy is - astonishingly - the first substantial
critical study of his life's work attempted by any large institution. And
even now, with the opportunity of direct comparison offered at the National
Gallery by the exhibition around Manet's Execution of Maximilian paintings,
the carping continues. Sisley lacks, it would appear, Manet's historical
scope, his political commitment, his radical engagement.
Well, so he does. And he also lacks, while we are about it, Pissarro's
openly socialist and narrower technical preoccupations, the broad sweep of
Monet's ambition and his radical technical innovation, the humanity and
technical graphic finesse of Degas and Lautrec, the simple hedonism of
Renoir.
To which one can only answer: that Sisley was Sisley, with his own peculiar
gift and quality. His contemporaries, it would seem, had rather less
difficulty with him in their own minds. Asked by Matisse what an
impressionist was, Pissarro replied that he was 'a painter who never paints
the same picture, who always paints a new picture'. And the typical
impressionist? 'Sisley'.
As Sisley lay dying, Monet could write of him: 'He is a truly great artist
and I believe he is as great a master as any who has ever lived. I looked at
some of his works again, which have a rare breadth of vision and beauty. . .
' One does not knowingly speak ill of the dying, but even so.
What is that peculiar quality, that gift, that vision? The show is hardly
exhaustive in the evidence it offers and, in the early period especially,
the picture comes rather 'warts and all', Sisley's youthful awkwardness all
too apparent.
He was a slow developer, looking to the Barbizon painters and to Courbet for
his early examples, and not really coming to that clarity of palette and
lightness of touch by which we know him until he was past 30. His work of
the 1860s is not crude exactly, but dour, earnest, a shade pedestrian.
The change comes quite suddenly around 1870, a time of great change and
disruption in France at large, with the Franco-Prussian War, the Commune and
the fall of Napoleon III.
For Sisley it was marked by the loss of his studio at Bougival, on the Seine
below Paris, looted and destroyed by the Prussians, and yet by rather more
permanent a commitment to that district on the great loop of the river.
He moved to Louveciennes nearby, and in the early 1870s began the successive
series of landscape subjects, of town, river and countryside, at
Louveciennes, Marly, Port-Marly and Argenteuil, by which his true character
as a painter is established. As typical as any is the sequence painted on a
visit to England in 1874, along the Thames at Molesey and Hampton Court.
The palette has cleared and the handling become looser and more confident,
the paint as thick as before but less slabbed and clotted, more mobile on
the surface, and the marks of the brush more active and particular, often
quite calligraphic in their articulation.
As Sisley grows older, so it seems he develops his own peculiar notation, a
set of conventional signs, a stroke and flick of the wrist by which, with
the utmost rapidity, a figure, a branch, a reflection in the water or the
cast of a shadow may be signified.
The paintings of a lane at Louveciennes under snow (1874) and of the floods
at Port-Marly (1876), with their punts and pollarded trees and heavy, grey
spring skies, are particular miracles of this suggestive economy. And from
such an example, neither the cheerful directness of the fauves, nor the
quieter refinement of Vuillard or Bonnard, are at all remote.
The great strength of this exhibition is that what it lacks in scope and
numbers is more than made up for by the several series it offers, of
Louveciennes, Marly and Hampton Court, and, in the 1880s and 1890s, at
Saint-Mammes and Moret, Sisley's last home, on the Seine above Paris. They
make together a nicely ironical comment on Pissarro's remark, of never
painting the same picture, for indeed they confirm its essential truth.
The sequence of paintings along the river at Saint-Mammes (1885), following
the village strung out along the opposite bank, caught in the early summer
sunshine, is at once consistent in scale and practice, yet infinitely
varied, catching in each a particular and achingly poignant nuance of time
and circumstance, of light, season, weather.
'A Cezanne', said Matisse, 'is a moment of the artist while a Sisley is a
moment of nature', and Matisse was quite right.

<TEXT>
Britten's last opera is taking its place in the British repertory - and
about time too. The Glyndebourne Touring Opera production two years ago, a
forceful reminder of the opera's remarkable qualities, was the
turning-point. Early this year came Covent Garden's much-praised staging.
Now, as the final production of the last Summer Festival in the 'old'
Glyndebourne, which is soon to vanish, comes this revival. The conductor,
Graeme Jenkins, is the same, so are producer and designer, Stephen Lawless
and Tobias Hoheisel.
The impact remains vital but is slightly different. The London Sinfonietta
played for GTO: the Festival orchestra is the London Philharmonic. The GTO
performance impressed not only by the brilliance in Britten's score but by a
haunting quality.
The LPO's accomplished playing does not so much haunt as hit. The nightmare
scene and other episodes have an aggressiveness more usual in Janacek than
in Britten. The words none the less come across almost unscathed. There is
new choreography by Ian Spink, and a new Tadzio. Daniel Squire's features
are more Greek-archaic than classical. He moves hieratically-cool, distant,
hardly human. The ending is finely managed. This Tadzio is a little too
mature - taller than Aschenbach. Likewise his companions, more beach-boys
than children of well-heeled summer visitors. I doubt if the Games of Apollo
 -a kind of baroque divertissement in aspic - will ever fully succeed, but
Spink comes nearer success than most.
Robert Tear repeats his compelling portrait of the tormented writer
Aschenbach, delivering the rapid recitatives which are an essential part of
this drama with masterly clarity.
Alan Opie impresses as the suavely forbidding hotel manager. His other
incarnations of the mysterious 'Traveller' are admirably sung but less
sharply in focus. The smaller parts are well done, notably the English clerk
of Peter Snipp, and the hotel porter of Christopher Ventris.
The promotion of Apollo (Michael Chance) from off-stage counter-tenor to
towering, hooting, on-stage deity in a white silk suit, with some facial
resemblance to both Aschenbach and his familiar, is surely a mistake. The
alter ego aspect is overdone - the Traveller's near-parody of Aschenbach's
appearance and manner confuses more than it illuminates.
There is still too little suggestion of either the crumbling sea-city with
its oriental undertones or of the wide, horizontal sweep of the Lido. No
doubt if asked, Britten would have maintained that the opera was not about
Venice and the Lido but about people in Venice and on the Lido. Yet
references to place and milieu are so specific that Hoheisel's lonely
chandelier and two or three gondola-poles don't suffice.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: LSO at the Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Davis was making one of his too infrequent London appearances to
conduct three of his favourite composers - Beethoven, Berlioz, Stravinsky.
In Stravinsky's 1923 Octet for wind, the LSO players could easily have
managed without any conductor but Davis kept a benevolent eye and ear on the
proceedings. It was probably he who ensured some particularly smooth
transitions. Smooth, not bland, yet the Octet sounded less perkily
mischievous than usual. Where we expect some fairly rude braying and
chugging, the Stravinsky was svelteness and light. At first I thought it was
simply losing some of its aural bite in this large hall; but then
Beethoven's Eighth Symphony arrived with the same buoyantly innocent air, at
least in the earlier movements. With the Finale, however, the old Davis
spark (ie the younger Davis spark) asserted itself. The playing fizzed, and
the sudden key-swerves in the music had their full disorienting force.
Perhaps all that the mellowing of Sir Colin amounts to is that more than
ever, in music he loves, his instinct is to make everything seem as
lyrically natural as can be. If that is indeed his guiding principle now,
the Berlioz Harold in Italy showed that it does not cramp his insights. Its
soloist, Yuri Bashmet, a violist sans pareil; freighted Berlioz's curiously
shy, edgy solo role with dense but classically controlled feeling.
Davis's contribution was no less inspired. There is no more penetrating
Berlioz conductor now. He went far beyond realising the familiar sonorous
effects, beyond even his own distinguished performances in years past. The
orchestral 'marginalia' set the score alight with fresh expressive sense.
Some 20 years ago Sir Colin rehabilitated Berlioz for modern French
musicians; his latest work sets a new, deceptively 'natural' standard for
interpreters from anywhere.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: Grand Hotel - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Hotel was originally a German novel by Vicki Baum published in 1929.
It came to fame in the early 1930s as a Hollywood movie starring among
others Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo, and was the vehicle for Garbo's
celebrated line 'I vant to be alone'. Since then there have been remakes,
including one called Weekend at the Waldorf with Ginger Rogers and Walter
Pidgeon.
Much more recently the musical diversion has been a widely acclaimed hit on
Broadway. The show opened with a different cast at London's huge Dominion
Theatre yesterday.
Since a large part of the audience plainly appeared to enjoy it much more
than I did, I shall be gentle. For every criticism I make, there is probably
a perfectly reasonable response. The adjective that most immediately comes
to mind about Grand Hotel is 'heavy'. The hotel is grand in the sense of
big, not splendid, rather as the Germans tend to have grand rather than big
coalitions. Moreover, the difficulty in trying to portray elegance in a
stage musical is that Hollywood does it so much better.
It might be said that this is Berlin 1928, so what do you expect from
central Europe at that period? Well, I would have liked a few more jokes, a
bit more sharpness and perhaps even some satire. The only direct reference
to one of the problems of the time is that some jews are more acceptable
than others, and even then the jew in question manages to adapt to the hotel
quite easily: he does, of course, have money.
There is very little plot to speak of. Again it might be claimed that that
is precisely the point. As the doctor/narrator says of the hotel 'guests
come, guests go, new guests arrive.' True enough, but it is still pretty
thin for a story line.
It is also odd to play a musical as big as Grand Hotel without an interval.
To be sure, the show last only 2 1/4 hours, but that is a long time for one
sitting, and there is certainly room for a natural break. Possibly the task
of getting the audience back to their seats in such a large theatre was
thought too daunting.
Apart from that, how does one enjoy the music? The answer is not a great
deal. Grand Hotel, with songs by Robert Wright and George Forrest, seems to
me to lack the subtlety and sustained sweep of the best of Sir Andrew Lloyd
Webber, by which I mean Evita and Phantom, both of which have stories to go
with them.
There are, however, some fine performances. Liliane Montevecchi in the
ballerina part once played by Garbo takes a while to warm up, but you can
see the attraction of the role. In the one scene that is remotely dramatic,
Lynnette Perry distinguishes herself as the secretary whose seduction by her
boss threatens to get out of hand.
Brent Barrett is an effective, poverty-stricken baron, seven months behind
with his hotel bill. Many people will admire Barry James as the jewish
book-keeper who ends a happy man, though for my part sentimentality is never
far away from the whole show. The dancing, foxtrot, Charleston, ballet and
waltz, is good.
Grand Hotel is directed and choreographed by the appropriately named Tommy
Tune.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (GEC At The Crossroads): Defence of the realm -
Part Two, Charles Leadbeater reports on the group's strategy for Marconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<TEXT>
Sir Robert Easton was exhausted. He was at the end of five days and nights
negotiating with a group of Malaysian admirals to win an order for two
frigates. Each day the negotiations ended later than the day before, only to
resume promptly at 8.30am.
For Sir Robert this was a make-or-break deal. It had taken four years of
patient persuasion to get this far. The fate of his Yarrow shipyard on
Glasgow's Clydeside hung on the outcome of the talks in a luxury hotel in
Kuala Lumpur.
A dearth of defence orders had forced the yard, bought by GEC in 1986, into
hibernation. The long halls from which boats had been launched since the
19th century were filled only by the echoes of welders fabricating steel for
Drax power stations.
The business was hanging on by its finger tips. And the drawing office -
central to the yard's ability to design as well as build ships - was in an
even worse position. The Malaysian order was the only chance of work for the
highly-skilled draughtsmen.
Sir Robert knew that, in spite of a recent Pounds 400m British government
order to build three frigates, the design office did not have enough work to
keep it going. He was also aware that if the drawing office shrank there was
a risk it could set off an irreversible decline at the yard.
The Malaysian admirals gave Yarrow the Pounds 400m order last March. But Mr
Murray Easton, the yard's chief executive and Sir Robert's son, recalls how
close it had been: 'If we had lost that order the future of the yard would
have been in severe jeopardy. There was little prospect of diversification
or exports keeping it going. We would have faced some very painful choices.'
Even so, the orders only offer Yarrow security until the mid-1990s. The
desperate hunt for orders will soon have to start again. With three other
warship builders in the UK, the competition will be intense. Indeed Yarrow's
fight for survival is just one example of how perilous the defence business
has become since the end of the Cold war.
Spending on defence is falling. There are fewer large programmes, and those
left are becoming more uncertain. Contractors are having to put large sums
into development work, even though orders are being cut and delayed.
Customers are expecting more sophisticated products and, taking advantage of
cut-throat competition, demanding cheaper prices. Thus the contractors'
profit margins are being squeezed. Companies are so desperate to keep their
factories working, that they are prepared to lodge loss-making bids for
business.
Once a company has won an order - whether for a frigate, a fighter or a
radar system - it will have to spend more of its own money to develop the
product than it used to, it will have to wait longer to get paid and an
increasing share of the payments will be withheld until the product proves
itself in the field.
This is an upheaval for defence contracting, which until six years ago
worked like a comfortable club.
A former senior official at the Ministry of Defence describes how cosy life
used to be for the contractors: 'Large defence suppliers thought the purpose
of the MoD was to keep them fully occupied. The assumption was that if they
were working on a large contract they would get paid Pounds 20m a month no
matter what they did.'
Those days are no more, and their passing strikes at the heart of Marconi,
GEC's defence arm.
Marconi is now under siege. As Mr David Fletcher, Marconi's managing
director, puts it: 'It is becoming an all-or-nothing business in some areas
where there are fewer and fewer big contracts. If you lose one deal then you
may have to exit the field altogether.'
Marconi is the largest single chunk of GEC's business, with an annual
turnover close to Pounds 3bn, and its future is central to that of the
group. Most of the other big parts of GEC's business are run jointly with
partners - Alsthom in power engineering, Siemens in telecommunications and
General Electric of the US in domestic appliances - but in defence GEC's
future is entirely in its own hands.
In the last few years it has taken a Pounds 1bn gamble to go deeper into the
market in spite of the end of the Cold war. Marconi's turnover rose from
Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn through the acquisition of large parts of the
defence businesses of Plessey and Ferranti. But as yet the results of these
takeovers are not flattering.
GEC executives admit the Plessey purchase has yet to pay its way. Three
years on, the deal is still diluting GEC's earnings. And the Ferranti radar
business in Edinburgh, which GEC bought for Pounds 300m two years ago, could
also face problems. It was purchased mainly because it is developing the
radar for the European Fighter Aircraft. Now the EFA programme is in doubt
and if it collapses, senior GEC executives say there would be serious
consequences for Ferranti.
These problems in mind, it will be difficult enough to consolidate Marconi's
position in the defence market, but in addition the company is being asked
to provide much of GEC's future growth by attempting what it has never yet
achieved: success in consumer electronics markets, competing with the big
Japanese groups.
If Marconi thrives, it will drive GEC forward. If it fails, GEC's
wholly-owned activities could be reduced to a motley rag bag of defence and
industrial companies. Senior GEC executives are in no doubt how much is at
stake. One non-executive director says: 'We have to exploit Marconi's
technology to move into consumer, industrial and medical electronics
markets. Unless steps are taken in each of these areas it is difficult to
see how the group will achieve growth.'
Senior GEC managers are acutely aware that so far Marconi has failed to
exploit fully the potential of its technology. Lord Prior, GEC's chairman,
admits: 'We have not got that right yet.'
The plain speaking Mr Fletcher, who became Marconi's managing director last
year, is well aware of the difficulties facing the group. 'If we behave in
an old fashioned, insular way, relying on our old defence markets our fate
will be gentle decline,' he says.
He is attacking Marconi's weaknesses with gusto, forcing through a more
aggressive approach to defence markets. By the end of the decade he wants 50
per cent of its sales to come from non-defence areas.
In defence itself, Marconi starts from a strong position. It is the dominant
defence electronics group in the UK. Its acquisitions in the 1980s have
eliminated competitors so, in electronics, it does not face cut-throat
competition of the type that Yarrow still faces in warships.
Its acquisitions also have an international significance. Through its
purchase of Plessey, GEC now has some important US defence interests. Among
them is a potential electronic gold mine tucked away in the suburbs of New
Jersey, GEC Marconi Electronic Systems. This is likely to supply most of the
US Air Force with the system known as JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information
Distribution System) that should replace radar as the means by which fighter
aircraft identify targets.
GEC's dominance in British defence electronics has also strengthened its
bargaining position within the European defence industry. An example is the
way its relationship with Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group,
has expanded since the Ferranti and Plessey purchases. But perhaps most
importantly, Marconi can draw upon great technological resources.
GEC is often accused of undervaluing technology. Marconi, however, is
crammed with talented engineers. At its research centres at Caswell near
Milton Keynes and Great Baddow near Chelmsford it has a stockpile of
technology which is the envy of competitors. It has laser-guided weapons and
gyroscopes in Edinburgh and torpedoes and satellites in Portsmouth.
When all Marconi's strengths converge the result is a world-class company.
One example is the avionics division in an old Short Brothers' hangar at an
airfield just outside Rochester, Kent. From this unprepossessing base the
avionics group has become the world's largest supplier of head-up displays
for fighter aircraft, one of the leading suppliers to the US armed forces
outside North America and a leading sub-contractor to Boeing.
At Rochester high technology, sound finance and commercial ambition combine.
But even at its best Marconi has some nagging weaknesses, which are
inextricably linked to the way GEC works. It g with GEC's traditions.
Marconi is usually a sub-contractor, supplying components, often very large
pieces of equipment, to other companies. It now needs to become a prime
contractor - integrating important projects.
Prime contracting is how defence companies earn their healthiest profits. Mr
Fletcher explains: 'If you are just a supplier of bits and pieces you will
get lost. You only keep charge of technological developments if you are a
prime contractor. If not you end up being a lackey working within someone
else's system.'
To prevent Marconi becoming a high technology 'lackey' Mr Fletcher needs to
pull together his company's far-flung resources. Marconi is a loose
federation of about 40 companies, collected by a string of acquisitions.
This federation, however, has a history of sectarianism. It has frequently
been prone to border disputes which constantly threatened civil war. There
is deep rivalry and sometimes outright hostility between Marconi companies.
As a senior GEC executive puts it: 'Marconi companies only used to talk in
order to tell one another lies.'
Some customers say they used to see a string of Marconi companies. Each
would seek to undermine the others and all would distance themselves from
GEC.
The Eastons of Yarrow saw no merit in highlighting their links with Marconi
when the yard was bought by GEC. Mr Murray Easton says: 'In the late 1980s
this company did not make a strong play of its links with GEC. There was no
great attempt to find synergies.'
The tension between Marconi companies was partly created by a policy of
divide and rule from on high. GEC encouraged them to compete against one
another.
The antagonisms ran deep. Staff at the Caswell research centre recently
brought together the four Marconi companies which use its gallium arsenide
semi-conductors, to discuss joint product development. One executive present
recalls: 'The polite description is that there was tough negotiating. The
reality is there was almost a punch up.'
The warring Marconi baronies only really came under the sway of GEC's
Stanhope Gate headquarters in the mid-1980s. Lord Weinstock was far from
ruthless with Marconi. 'We took it very slowly because the companies fought
with one another,' he says. 'It was very difficult to knock heads together.
If we had alienated people we might have lost them without having
replacements. We were very gentle with it.'
GEC eventually paid for this gentleness with the Nimrod fiasco. One of the
biggest cost overruns in British defence history, this became a byword for
all that was bad with the cosy world of cost-plus defence contracting.
The Nimrod early-warning radar was scrapped in December 1986 after almost
Pounds 1bn had been spent on its nine-year development. The project was
several years behind schedule and hugely over cost.
Many of the problems were of the MoD's own making. It kept changing its mind
about what kind of system was needed. But Nimrod also exposed Marconi's
weaknesses. A former MoD official closely involved in Nimrod, says: 'One of
the problems was that people were not telling Weinstock the truth about the
project and he had no way of really checking what was going on in Marconi.'
Nimrod was the turning point. The MoD introduced competitive tendering and a
long overdue change came to Marconi in the shape of Mr Fletcher, who says:
'Life was easier in the past. That kind of competition between our own
companies is a luxury we can no longer afford.'
Now Marconi has a younger, more aggressive management with plans to shake up
the business by pulling together its resources through greater central
direction. The old guard has been overthrown at its headquarters at Stanmore
in Middlesex. About three quarters of the managing directors of Marconi
companies have been replaced in the last 18 months.
Teams are being formed from companies across the group to focus their
diverse skills on the same market. The marketing chiefs of all Marconi
companies recently gathered at Stanmore to discuss their plans. It was the
first time they had met.
Lord Weinstock remarks: 'I have seen two generations of management at
Marconi. These are the ones we have most given their heads, the least
conservative, the most adventurous and the most aggressive.'
But for all his drive and confidence Mr Fletcher still has a huge task on
his hands apart from the bewildering maze of subsidiaries. The group's
initial outings as a prime contractor have not got off to an encouraging
start. Its bids for the Merlin helicopter, the Asraam missile and the
initial phase of the command system for the future Anglo-French frigate all
failed.
Mr Fletcher is pulling his subsidiaries together. But they still all report
their financial results directly to Lord Weinstock, and to break Marconi's
centrifugal culture the group will have to claim more independence from
Stanhope Gate - a move which is bound to provoke tension. One senior Marconi
executive says: 'We want more freedom and in time we will get it. If Lord
Weinstock fell under a bus tomorrow we could carry on as normal. We are the
ones running the company.'
On top of this the really difficult task will be doubling Marconi's sales in
non-defence markets. There are no easy pickings in consumer electronics.
Thomson of France, which has spent large sums to build an international
television manufacturing business, is making big losses on its consumer
activities. And Philips, the leading European consumer electronics group, is
up to its knees in red ink in spite of two years of restructuring. This is
the lions' den Marconi is about to throw itself into.
There have been some successes already. Marconi's expertise in signal
processing for military communications has led it into making receivers for
satellite television. There are also some exciting products on the way - a
video phone which is attracting interest from large US telephone companies
and an interactive video system which United Airlines has chosen in
preference to a Japanese design for its in-flight entertainment system.
Marconi's expertise could spawn a wide range of products in
telecommunications, air traffic control, transport and environmental
monitoring. Marconi executives are excited at taking their first faltering
steps into the bright world of consumer market. But they face big obstacles.
What Marconi needs are alternative families of products to replace the
defence work. Yet even when companies have excellent technology, it is
extremely difficult to turn an idea into a product which could support a
business.
At Ferranti Defence Systems in Edinburgh, a trawl brought to the surface 530
ideas without any plans to turn them into a product. Thirty ideas had a
business plan but lacked people or cash to turn them into a product. Just 20
activities might provide the basis for real businesses. Mr Roy Tait head of
Ferranti's civil businesses says: 'It would cost Pounds 1m just to winnow
the ideas down into realistic proposals.'
Armed with new products, the next hurdle is to achieve commercial viability.
Marconi's defence factories will need overhauling to compete in consumer
areas.
The Broadacre missile plant in Portsmouth has started and the shock of
making simple electronic components for satellite television receivers, at a
cost of less than Pounds 2 each, has forced the management to revolutionise
manufacturing methods. It has slashed stocks, reduced the number of
suppliers, and improved the design of products in a drive for efficiency.
The plant now makes electronics components as efficiently as commercial
competitors. It is also making missiles much more efficiently. In 1990 it
took 1,700 hours to produce the key part of an Alarm missile. With
just-in-time manufacturing that has come down to 700 hours.
But the final obstacle Marconi faces is the biggest - its lack of marketing
expertise.
At their most introverted, Marconi executives believe they are the
industrial arm of the MoD. In the words of a Stanhope Gate executive: 'They
are trying to market their video phone as if it were a frigate.'
Mr Fletcher plans to offset this marketing weakness by forging alliances
with well established consumer electronics groups. But Marconi will require
more than that. It is just dawning on executives that they will probably
have to make significant acquisitions.
Marconi's consumer efforts seem chaotic. A plethora of companies are working
on overlapping products. Some GEC executives believe Marconi needs radical
surgery.
'There are two world class operations struggling to get out of a rambling,
sprawling business,' says one director. 'Marconi is making a lot of money,
but it would be making a whole lot more if it were split into a defence
electronics company and a consumer electronics company, with separate
boards, separate balance sheets, separate factories. It is a mess now.'
It will take Marconi at least five years if not 10 to develop any businesses
to match the scale of its military activities. Thus GEC is already searching
for alternative routes to bolster its civil businesses. Top executives say
the company needs to find another non-defence leg to stand on, a division
with a turnover of at least Pounds 500m a year.
Several companies outside Marconi might provide the source of new growth,
but GEC's record in this area is mixed. In 1981 it bought AB Dick, the US
photo copier group, as a launch pad into the office equipment market. It now
admits that strategy has failed and AB Dick is a prime prospect for
disposal.
One candidate for growth could be Picker, the US-based medical electronics
business with a Pounds 500m-a-year turnover. It makes a variety of high
technology scanners and is holding its own with much bigger competitors,
such as Siemens of Germany. It can probably afford the investment to stay
abreast of the industry leaders, but is unlikely to be able to grow rapidly.
Nor is Picker likely to form the core of a larger medical division. The
abortive talks which GEC held with Philips in the mid-1980s to merge their
medical businesses are unlikely to be rekindled, and Mr Carey Nolan,
Picker's managing director, does not want to expand into the health care
businesses outside scanners.
GEC's other civil activities are too scattered and too small to form the
basis for a major business. It has some tidy niche businesses, such as
Gilbarco, one of the world's leading manufacturers of petrol pumps based in
North Carolina; Videojet, the US specialist printer; Avery, the
weighing-machine maker based in Birmingham; and GPLS, the specialist
semi-conductor maker in Plymouth. All these - especially Gilbarco and
Videojet - are good, well-run businesses. But they are not the stuff from
which industrial empires are made.
These limitations are recognised by GEC, which is cooking up an alternative
plan. It goes something like this: The company could sell the least
attractive of the collection of small businesses which it owns - AB Dick and
GEC's cable operations would lead the way. Combined with the company's close
to Pounds 1bn of cash reserves, the disposals could finance a major
acquisition to form a new leg for the business.
The problem is to decide what to buy. In the 1980s GEC spent most of its
famous cash mountain by expanding into defence. What will it do in the
1990s?
A move outside its traditional areas of manufacturing is out of the
question. A senior GEC executive explains: 'We do not want to buy something
in a business we know very little about. That is how we have got into
trouble in the past. It would be better to give the money back to the
shareholders than to do that.'
An alternative is to expand away from manufacturing into related service
areas.
For instance Lord Weinstock would like to bring together all the after sales
service operations within GEC to create a large business which would service
anything from petrol pumps and weighing machines, to computers and washing
machines.
GEC has also considered a move into telecommunications services, possibly by
running a mobile communications network.
To GEC's critics, a turn away from manufacturing into services would be the
final proof that the company does not have the ambition to build a great
industrial combine on the industrial assets it inherited. To the group's
senior executives, a move into services which are related to its
manufacturing interests, managing electricity grids as well as making
switchgear, managing telecommunications networks as well as making switches,
could provide the best counterweight to the defence decline. It would be
proof of the group's maturity and balance.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Stop selling yourself
short - Fees that professional advisers charge clients can lead friction.
Charles Batchelor offers a word of of advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a professional adviser what the price of his service is and, too often,
he will not give a straight answer.
There are at least 15 ways to describe the cost of a professional service,
from the barrister's 'honorarium' to the consultant's 'retainer', but price
is not a term which readily passes the professional's lips, says Aubrey
Wilson, a marketing consultant.
'Firms play down the price element quite substantially,' notes David Keeble,
a Cambridge researcher and author of a recent study of the business services
sector. 'What we don't know is if that view is shared by their clients.'
Anecdotal evidence suggests that many clients of the traditional professions
such as lawyers, accountants, surveyors, and of the burgeoning growth areas
of business services such as management consultancy, market research and
public relations, do not share this view.
Clients frequently complain that they do not know in advance what a service
will cost; they have no way of judging whether the fee charged is fair in
relation to the work done; and the final bill invariably comes out far
higher than they had expected.
Professional firms, and to a lesser extent the new business services firms,
advance professional ethics as a reason not to take too close an interest in
price. A Law Society booklet* explaining how firms should calculate costings
notes that professionalism 'transcends the profit motive'.
Some clients, confronted with a larger-than-expected bill, might question
whether these sentiments are any more than a cloak for self-interest.
Whichever view is correct, in the long-term this uncertainty works against
the providers of professional services. 'Very often the client will pay up
but go away disenchanted,' says Wilson. 'The unhappy client always tells
more people than the does the satisfied one.'
Emboldened by the pressure on their own profits in the current recession,
clients have been taking a tougher stand. They have become far less willing
to pay large fees and are quick to demand that the professional explains how
many hours have been worked. Clients then expect to pay on a time-related
basis, says Christopher Honeyman-Brown, a partner at accountants BDO Binder
Hamlyn.
'We are moving more to a time basis for charging from a transaction basis,'
says Tim Manning, managing partner of solicitors Boodle Hatfield. 'Fixed
rates are also becoming more prevalent.'
The matter of professional fees is no longer an issue for a limited number
of long-established professions. The business services sector was the
fastest growing part of the small business revival of the 1980s and
increasing sums are spent by business on buying in professional services.
Manufacturing companies are not always adept at managing costing and pricing
issues but, among service businesses, understanding appears to be even less
highly developed. There is very little in the way of guidance on the issue
from the professional associations and published literature.
'This is an absolutely critical issue for professional firms but their
approach is very unscientific,' says Wilson.
'Most service organisations are not very good at measuring costs and setting
prices,' comments Victoria Tomlinson, founder of a Harrogate-based public
relations and marketing agency, Northern Lights. 'Service companies tend to
meet their clients' needs, come what may, and then absorb the costs.'
When the economy is booming, this failure to monitor costs and draw up a
pricing strategy may not have serious consequences but problems can arise
when economic conditions worsen.
Boodle Hatfield, a 27-partner firm, had to reduce staff and partner numbers
for the first time when it realised that total numbers and overheads were
too high for the number of fee-earning partners.
So how should professional and business services firms determine their costs
and set prices? Salaries form a greater part of the costs of a service
business but there will also be a sizeable monthly charge for premises,
telephones, insurance and cars. 'We invest large amounts in computer
technology,' says James Mendelssohn, marketing partner of accountants
Neville Russell. 'We need to recover those development costs.'
These costs must then be apportioned over the number of fee-earning partners
and staff and the hours they work. But beware of concentrating too much on
recovering costs and relating fees too closely to the hours worked, says
Honeyman-Brown.
'Avoid an inward focus on the management of your costs because people and
time are a finite resource and you run the risk of underperforming on your
revenue,' he advises. 'Focus on the value that you are providing to the
client and his ability and willingness to pay.
'If you save a client Pounds 200,000 on a Pounds 1m deal or prevent a Pounds
3m turnover business from going into receivership, then you deserve to be
paid more than the standard time rate.'
But selling an intangible business service depends on the customer
understanding what he is getting. A client can judge the work which goes
into an audit because the auditor's staff are on his premises and visibly
doing a job. But the effort which goes into a market research project, where
most of the work is done behind the scenes and where some lines of
investigation may prove to be a waste of time, will be less obvious.
'The client only sees the initial meeting, perhaps a couple of meetings in
the middle and the final report,' says Honeyman-Brown. 'He does not see the
50 hours of work you have put into it.'
Basing an estimate on a time-rate alone encourages the client to pull out
his calculator and compare the consultant or professional's hourly rate with
what he pays his cleaner or the garage mechanic. Price should be a mixture
of time and value with possibly a 'cap' on the final bill to reassure the
client.
Business services firms should be open about their fees and discuss the
basis on which they will charge at the outset. 'Give the client an estimate
and an explanation of how you got there,' suggests Wilson. In the US, he
notes, some professional firms present 'draft bills' which can be discussed
with clients. 'There is no macho issue if it is changed,' he says.
In 'commodity' areas such as conveyancing, audit or market research
interviews, there will often be a market price and tough competition. But an
opportunity to maximise revenues comes from long-term relationships with
clients - where the consultant or professional has in-depth knowledge of the
business which is not immediately available from a competitor.
For a new client, or where the full implications of a project are not
immediately visible, accountants Neville Russell might agree a price for an
initial two or three days work and then negotiate the price for the rest of
the contract once they know what is involved, says Mendelssohn.
Current pressure on professional fees will almost certainly ease with the
ending of the recession. But clients have become more demanding and it is
unlikely that a pricing policy which comes down to 'charging what the market
will bear' will be such an easy option in future.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Buying out of the company
 -In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate divestments provided the source for an increased number of
management buy-outs in Europe last year, according to the 1992 edition of
Europe Buy-out Review.* Last year, 62 per cent of buy-outs were the result
of corporate restructuring compared with 53 per cent in 1990.
The number of buy-outs of private or family-owned businesses fell to 33 from
36 per cent of the total while 'other' sources accounted for 5 per cent (11
per cent). Only in France and Italy did private or family companies account
for more than half the buy-outs. The number of continental European buy-outs
fell from 411 in 1990 to 318 last year but there was a much smaller fall in
the value of completed deals: from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 3.9bn. This compared
with a UK market in 1991 of 564 deals with a total value of Pounds 2.8bn.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Chambers plan closer
links - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London's 40 or so chambers of commerce, representing between 15,000 and
20,000 of the capital's businesses, have begun discussions which it is hoped
will lead to closer links.
London has three large chambers - in the City of London, Westminster and
Croydon - and many very small ones. Most have no full-time staff and many
are too small to provide a full range of services.
'The chambers in London are far too fragmented,' says Ronnie Jacobson,
marketing manager for the London Chamber. 'If we can all talk with one voice
we will be much more effective.'
There are no plans for mergers of the chambers but they hope to work
together on training and lobbying for members' interests.
At the same time the Westminster Chamber is in an advanced stage of
discussions with chambers in Camden, Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith
and Fulham to establish a Central London Chambers of Commerce.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Challenge to the ancient
charters - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Market charters dating back several centuries are being used by some local
authorities to prevent the creation of retail centres which provide premises
for small independent shops.
The ancient charters, which give exclusive rights to street market traders,
prevent anyone else establishing 'a concourse of traders', according to Tim
Brookes, chairman of the publicly-quoted In Shops group.
In Shops operates more than 60 serviced retail centres which provide space
for small shops on one to three year licences and avoid the need for
retailers to sign up for conventional 25-year leases. It unsuccessfully
challenged one council in the English courts and is now considering whether
European Community statutes might provide redress.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Technology: Digital waves clear the air - Michiyo Nakamoto
reports on a new type of radio giving CD-like clarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine having a radio in your home that would allow you to choose from
hundreds of music stations and then to make your own high quality digital
recordings, much like a personalised compact disk.
The radio, more like a record library than conventional broadcasting, would
have a small screen attached, providing information on the kind of music
available and on which station.
The 'armchair record store', as it is called by Mr Michael Tyler, a partner
at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, the market consultancy, and an active proponent of
the concept, would provide the consumer with 'the functional equivalent of
records'.
Recordable MiniDiscs, like small CDs or digital cassette tapes - both due to
appear on the market later this year - might be used to make near perfect
copies of crisp, clear CD-like quality sound at home.
It would mean music enthusiasts would no longer need to go to a record store
to buy a CD, unless they wanted to browse through the collections to look at
the cover designs.
Such a futuristic vision may become a reality soon with the advent of
digital audio broadcasting, the broadcasting of radio programs in digital,
rather than analogue, form. DAB offers the same high quality sound as CDs.
DAB has several other advantages over conventional analogue broadcasting.
The main benefit is that the high quality sound of DAB is effectively free
from interference. Unlike FM radio, which provides high quality sound but is
flawed by poor reception, fading and distortions, particularly on portable
receivers, DAB is practically free from interference and it provides
excellent reception even when the receiver is mobile.
FM is particularly frustrating in built-up areas where obstacles to
transmission, such as towers and buildings, produce what are known as
multipath distortion. When signals from the transmitter arrive at the
receiver along different paths as a result of reflection from buildings and
other obstructions, the result is hissing and other sound distortions in
conventional analogue broadcasts.
Simply switching from analogue to digital signals would not solve the
problem, but a digital broadcasting scheme developed in Europe by a team led
by Centre Commun d'Etudes de Telediffusion et Telecommunications, the French
broadcast and telecommunications research body, and funded through the EC's
Eureka project, overcomes multipath signal interference.
The system uses low data rate signals that are less susceptible to multipath
interference and boosts sound quality by sending hundreds of copies of the
signal simultaneously.
Even if parts of one signal are lost, there are plenty more copies to
replace them.
Mr Henry Price, head of engineering information at the British Broadcasting
Corporation offers the analogy of a garbled written message. Even if the
sentence is partially illegible, if enough of the information can be read it
is possible to work out what is missing from the overall sense of the
sentence.
DAB also eliminates the problem of having to retune car radios.
Long-distance drivers listening to an FM station on the radio are forced to
retune as they move away from the area covered by one transmitter into that
of another.
The problem arises because, with analogue broadcasting, two separate
transmitters cannot send signals on the same frequency.
With DAB, this is possible. As a result a car radio does not need to be
retuned, since the same radio station will be on the same frequency wherever
the car is, at least within a national or regional service area.
This also means tuning becomes unnecessary. The radio can be pre-set to the
different stations, allowing the listener to select channels by push-button.
A further important advantage of DAB is that it occupies relatively little
of the radio spectrum. Although DAB does send a lot of information at once,
the information is packed closely enough to create a six-fold improvement in
spectrum efficiency over FM, according to Mr Price. That means it is
possible to increase the number of radio stations without congesting the
radio waves.
While each FM network needs 2.2 megahertz of spectrum to provide coverage to
98 per cent of the UK population, a DAB service could pack five national
stereo channels in 1.75 MHz.
To use DBA, consumers will need to buy a new type of programmable digital
radio built on computer chip technology. The cost of these, although
initially higher than conventional receivers, is expected to drop sharply as
manufacturing volumes increase.
With an estimated 2bn radios currently in use around the world, electronics
manufacturers look forward to a huge new market for digital replacements.
Digital audio is being enthusiastically embraced in Europe, where the BBC
and Germany's Institut fur Rundfunktechnik are conducting tests, in addition
to the French work. Prospects seem less bright in the US, however, where
small regional radio stations are resisting the introduction of expensive
new technology.
At an international conference in Montreux last month organised by the
European Broadcasting Union and the National Association of Broadcasters of
the US, a speaker from NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, hailed the
European DAB system as 'the best system for terrestrial DAB'.
Digital radio has been given added impetus by the allocation of frequency
for satellite sound broadcasting by the World Administrative Radio
Conference (Warc-92) held in Torremolinos earlier this year. The frequency
band that was allocated by the WARC is particularly well suited to satellite
DAB. However, the bands allocated are currently in use in many countries and
are not expected to be entirely free until 2007.
Meanwhile, discussions are being held between several countries on agreeing
a frequency range for terrestrial services. In Europe, it is likely that
frequency bands generally used by television will be opened up as 'parking'
bands for DAB services to be run in parallel with FM until sufficient
receivers have been installed to make a switch from FM to DAB possible, says
Mr Price.
As for the arm-chair record store, the vast amount of information involved
would require transmission via cable systems rather than broadcasting. Such
services are already being offered in the US by several television cable
operators.
The thorny issue of copyright protection for music distributed over cable or
digital broadcast systems and then copied on to tape or disk by subscribers
has yet to be addressed. However, since TV viewers are free to record
programmes, it seems likely that arm-chair record store services will emerge
in time.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley sidesteps accusation that
benefits will be cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was accused yesterday of planning cuts in unemployment and
training benefit as Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, sidestepped
Labour questions on the subject in the Commons.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, seized on Mr Lilley's
less-than-full-blooded denial to make the accusation, saying it was as near
as any minister could come to admitting there was 'some validity' in press
reports last weekend.
Mr Meacher described the government's reported deliberations as 'a further
smack in the face for the unemployed' whose benefit had been halved in
relation to average earnings through 11 cuts since 1979.
The reports suggested the government was studying a series of options as
part of a Treasury initiative to reduce the annual Pounds 70bn social
security budget - the largest single item of public spending.
Steps under consideration were said to include limiting unemployment benefit
payments to six or nine months, rather than a year as at present, and
replacing training allowances of up to Pounds 35 a week to those on Youth
Training schemes with the equivalent of child benefit.
Tory MPs are convinced that concerted efforts to rein in social security
spending will be made as part of a tough public spending round.
Commercial interests associated with private prisons would want to keep the
prison population at a level which ensured profitability, Mr Barry Sheerman,
a Labour spokesman on home affairs, told the Commons last night.
He said Labour MPs were opposed in principle to the privatisation of prisons
because they believed the deprivation of liberty should only be undertaken
by the State.
Mr Peter Lloyd, home office junior minister, said the first privatised
prison - Wolds in Lincolnshire - was providing a more positive regime for
remand prisoners than any other prison in the country.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine firm against devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's 'relatively uncompetitive inflation figures' compared with the US
and Japan were cited by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
in the Commons last night when he re-affirmed the government's determination
not to devalue the pound.
Responding to Labour accusations that he had failed to make any impact on
the recession since taking charge of his department, he maintained that a
realignment of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism would
encourage domestic inflation.
Mr Heseltine stressed that Britain's inflation rate was still above that of
her principal competitors - the US at 3 per cent, and Japan at 2.5 per cent.
He said Labour MPs who called for a cut in interest rates and favoured
letting the pound 'take the strain' were indulging in escapism.
That did not deter Mr John Biffen, a Tory who has held cabinet posts as a
trade and Treasury minister, from advocating a cut in interest rates and the
return of exchange rate policy to national governments.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, insisted that Mr John
Major, the prime minister, should be using Britain's presidency of the
European Community to secure 'interest rate cuts across Europe'.
Mr Heseltine argued that more importance should be attached to the level of
wage settlements, and emphasised that last year manufacturing earnings grew
by about 8 per cent in Britain compared with 6 per cent in Germany, 4 per
cent in Japan and 3 per cent in the US.
He warned: 'There are no policies of any domestic government which can
prevent the conversion of those figures into lost jobs, lost competitiveness
and higher unemployment'.
Dismissing suggestions that there was no sign of economic recovery, Mr
Heseltine pointed to the rise in car registrations and the improved showing
of commercial vehicles as examples of where it was 'beginning to emerge'.
He drew encouragement, too, from the growth in exports, stressing that for
the first time since the Second World War Britain's share of world trade had
stabilised and 'even a little improved'.
Mr Brown contrasted the forecasts of economic recovery made by the prime
minister during the general election campaign with the fact that in the
succeeding three months business failures had risen by 15,000.
Unemployment had continued its rise for 24 consecutive months, and in
south-east England had increased by more than 150 per cent in the space of
two years.
A Labour motion pressing for policies aimed at reducing unemployment,
promoting investment, tackling Britain's training and skills crisis and
boosting the regions was defeated by 301-262, a majority of 39.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minister to 'sell Britain' in
Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE is to follow his reorganisation of the trade and
industry department with a new emphasis on his role as a high-profile
salesman for British industry in the former Communist countries of eastern
Europe, Philip Stephens writes.
The trade and industry secretary plans to visit Moscow in September as part
of a drive to increase the access of British companies to the former Soviet
Union.
He is understood to be anxious to explore whether his department can take a
more active role in ensuring that British consortia of manufacturing
companies and banks win a bigger share of energy and industrial projects.
One suggestion is that the Export Credits Guarantee Department's budget
could be used more effectively to secure such contracts.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Advisers' fees in Maxwell probe may
be curtailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCALE of fees paid by Maxwell pension funds to professional advisers has
persuaded ministers that the unit led by Sir John Cuckney should be given a
role in co-ordinating the efforts of the various Maxwell pension funds in
recovering assets, in order to curtail their expenditure on fees to
professional advisers.
The unit's remit of helping to identify and remove areas of potential
overlap was spelt out by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, in
a meeting yesterday with Mr Frank Field and Mr Richard Page, co-chairmen of
the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners.
Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, has highlighted
the fact that the Maxwell pensioners have paid Pounds 5m in fees - twice the
amount set aside in the government's emergency arrangements to ensure that
no fund has to stop making payments. He has called for the government to pay
the fees itself.
The MPs came away from the meeting reassured that the government would not
cease the 'drip-feed' once the Pounds 2.5m runs out. Miss Ann Widdecombe,
the junior social security minister, told MPs in a written answer that so
far just under Pounds 300,000 had been paid to trustees of the Maxwell
Communication Works Pension Scheme and of the Headington Pension Plan.
Ms Majorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on the City, expressed anger that the
trust fund for Maxwell pensioners has still not been set up four weeks after
it was announced.
In a separate written answer, Miss Widdecombe said the trust deed would be
prepared once the terms of the trust had been agreed. There was pressure
yesterday for ministers to consult the director of public prosecutions and
the Serious Fraud Office on guidelines to avoid 'unnecessary humiliation' of
potential defendants in high-profile cases. Concern follows last month's
arrests of Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Canals may help combat droughts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHORTAGE of water in eastern and south-east England, made acute by low
rainfall in the past three years, could be alleviated by transferring
supplies by canal from areas with ample resources.
British Waterways, responsible for the canal system in England and Wales,
said yesterday it was commissioning a feasibility study into whether
millions of gallons of water could be diverted into canals and transferred
south without damaging animal and plant life or affecting recreational use.
Consultants are expected to be chosen within two months and their study
should be completed in about nine months. Until then, British Waterways
intends to continue talks with water companies and the National Rivers
Authority (NRA), the rivers watchdog, to assess who needs more water and who
would pay for its transfer by canal.
Mr David Ingman, British Waterways chairman, said initial studies showed it
would be several times cheaper to improve the channels of its canals than to
build long-distance pipelines to form a national water grid.
He said: 'We approached the NRA more than a year ago with our ideas and we
could be up and running within five years. The next step is a full
engineering and environmental feasibility study which is essential before
volumes of water could flow, and we are now in the process of seeking
tenders from major consultancies.'
One preferred option is for water from the north-west to be diverted south
via the Shropshire Union, Trent &amp; Mersey, Coventry, Oxford and Grand Union
canals to the rivers Nene and Great Ouse serving East Anglia, and down to
the Thames. Other possible sources are the Cambrian Mountains in Wales and
Kielder reservoir in Northumberland.
The feasibility study will consider the effect of extra water on locks,
bridges and aqueducts; the number, location and cost of pumping stations;
the protection of wildlife, fisheries, heritage and architecture, and the
maintenance of water quality and the character of affected canals.
Mr John Taylor, British Waterways water development manager, said supplies
destined for public use had been flowing along canals for many years. At
present, 148m gallons a day were carried, including 45m gallons which met
half Bristol's daily requirement. The initial plan would add about 60m
gallons, but other schemes could be added.
The rivers authority welcomed the feasibility study and said it would
consider any proposals to alleviate water shortages. Mr Jerry Sherriff, head
of water resources at the authority, said the proposal did not offer a
'quick-fix' solution, but it could be implemented more quickly than some
other options such as regional grids and desalination plants.
Curbs on water use because of the drought affect 6.75m people. The drought
is considered to be the worst in parts of the south and east since records
began in the mid 1700s.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Polls on water metering 'mislead'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER METERING would be less popular if consumers knew the full cost and how
much water was lost through leakage, the National Consumer Council warned
yesterday.
Surveys carried out for Ofwat, the water industry regulator, suggest
widespread public support for metering.
However, Mr Robin Simpson, deputy chairman of the council, says in Consumer
Voice magazine that the surveys were misleading. 'In none of the surveys
were the respondents told that the average leakage is about 25 per cent of
the water supplied by the water companies.'
About 64 per cent of 290,000 respondents to a questionnaire sent to 18m
homes said they would prefer metering. But Mr Simpson said: 'The
questionnaire gave a range of increases in water charges due to metering,
with an increase of Pounds 29 a year at the top end. Yet there are
well-documented cases where water charges have increased by more than that.'
Water companies have three options after the present system is phased out:
metering; a flat licence fee; and a bill based on the type of property.
Ofwat said that with metering - the fairest option - customers would pay for
leakages only if they were in their own supply pipes - not any in the mains.
The director-general of Ofwat should have powers to compel companies to
compensate customers for poor service, the chairmen of Ofwat's regional
customer service committees said yesterday.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Safeway will drop secrecy about product sales data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the UK's third biggest grocery chain, is to sell sales data on
every product category in its 322 stores as part of an initiative to develop
closer relationships with suppliers.
The company has formed a joint venture with Nielsen, the market-research
group, to collate sales information from the electronic point-of-sale (Epos)
equipment in its stores.
Safeway claims to be the first of the big grocery chains to scan every sale
made in its stores.
The information is likely to be eagerly sought by manufacturers of consumer
products, because they can use the information to adjust production levels
and assess promotions.
Until now, most of the big grocery chains have closely guarded their sales
data, believing that it could be of value to competitors and that it is,
therefore, of considerable commercial sensitivity.
Mr David Coles, Safeway's marketing director, said it was an appropriate
time to start sharing sales information with suppliers as closer links
developed between retailers and manufacturers. The data would provide a
'common language' which could benefit both parties. 'We are looking for ways
to develop more of a partnership relationship with our suppliers so that
they can manage alongside us, rather than being kept at a distance,' he
said.
Safeway sells between 15,000 to 20,000 different lines in its stores and has
about 6m customers a week.
The Safeway/Nielsen service will start reporting sales data by the end of
the year.
The cost of access to the service has not been finalised, but Mr Coles said
the rate would be 'flexible'.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Consumers slow debt repayments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPAYMENT OF debts is slowing although people remain wary about taking on
new credit, according to government figures released yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said that in the three months to May people
repaid a seasonally adjusted Pounds 146m on credit agreements with building
societies and finance houses and on credit cards that are part of the
Mastercard and Visa systems.
This was the smallest three-monthly total since the June-August period last
year - the last time there was a net injection into the economy of this type
of credit. It may provide an early sign that consumers are becoming more
willing to spend rather than to save.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of UK output, has been
depressed in recent months. This has been a big factor inhibiting a
recovery.
In May, a net Pounds 19m was repaid on credit agreements covered in the CSO
series - which does not include mortgages and bank loans. It was the ninth
net monthly repayment for this type of credit in the 10 months to May,
confirming individuals' preoccupation with repaying debts that occurred in
the 1980s.
However, the May repayment was the smallest monthly figure since February,
when people took on Pounds 13m of new credit. In March and April, the
repayments came to Pounds 71m and Pounds 56m respectively.
In the three months to February, the net repayment was Pounds 246m, while in
the previous three months consumers repaid a total of Pounds 200m.
In May, people borrowed Pounds 94m on Visa cards and Mastercards, up from
Pounds 83m in April. The Pounds 94m was the largest amount of extra
borrowing recorded on these cards since the Pounds 129m net credit extended
in July last year. However, the extra borrowing on cards in May was offset
by a Pounds 109m repayment on credit agreements with finance houses.
The amount of new credit advanced to consumers in May - an indicator of
retail activity in the credit business - was Pounds 3.77bn compared with
Pounds 4.11bn in April.
The total amount of consumer credit outstanding as categorised in the CSO
series was Pounds 30bn at the end of May. At the end of last year the figure
was Pounds 30.2bn and at the end of 1990 Pounds 29.8bn.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers,
the US investment house, said that the figures suggested that the level of
repayments on credit 'may be stabilising'. However, there was little in the
statistics to support theories about anything other than a weak upturn.
Separately, the CSO said that businesses took on new credit from finance
houses worth a net Pounds 27m in May, little changed from the Pounds 24m in
April. Between March and May, this type of credit handed out to businesses
increased by Pounds 50m compared with Pounds 31m in the three months
previously.
The longer leading index of economic indicators compiled by the Central
Statistical Office increased from 104.4 in April to 104.8 in May, suggesting
an upturn later this year.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Allied Dunbar covenants to face High Court test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR FORMER sales asso-ciates of Allied Dunbar, the financial services
company, will today mount a High Court challenge to the company's attempts
to prevent them from soliciting business from its clients.
The hearing is seen as a test case for the use of restrictive covenants by
which companies prevent former employees or associates taking business with
them when they leave.
Covenants are common in the insurance sector and in other service
industries. Although former employees or associates frequently challenge
them, cases are normally settled out of court.
The Allied Dunbar case arises from the departure from the company in 1990 of
Sir Mark Weinberg, Mr Mike Wilson and Mr Keith Carby, chairman, chief
executive and managing director respectively, and their subsequent creation
of J. Rothschild Assurance (JRA), a rival life company.
Allied says JRA has recruited 200 of its 5,000 self-employed sales
associates, all of whom had signed contracts with restrictive covenants of a
year.
Four of the 200 will today seek a declaration that the covenants are
unlawful. Allied fears that JRA will recruit more of its associates if the
four win their case.
Counsel for the four - Ms Pat Miller, Mr Ken Clark, Mr Paul Rothwell and Mr
Nigel Cousins - will argue that the covenants are in restraint of trade.
However Ms Denise Kingsmill, a partner with DJ Freeman acting for Allied
Dunbar, said Allied would say it was protecting a reasonable commercial
interest and that the covenant was reasonable.
'There has been a significant investment in training,' she said. 'Twelve
months is reasonable in the insurance business.'
JRA began recruiting former Allied sales associates at the end of last year.
If the High Court hearing lasts several months, the effect on the
complainants will be limited since the year-long restrictive covenants will
expire shortly afterwards.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Drawings show sketchy success: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK of Old Master sales in London got off to a sticky start yesterday.
Although well over half of the lots at a Sotheby's sale of drawings found
buyers, the three lots that were estimated at more than Pounds 100,000 each
 -works by Philippe de Champaigne, Claude and Boucher - failed to reach
their reserves.
A delicate pen and brown ink and wash drawing by Parmigianino was also
bought in.
There is, however, a continuing interest in good 16th and 17th century
Italian drawings that are fresh to the art market.
The top lot yesterday was a highly finished preparatory study (circa 1623)
by Ferrau Fenzoni for an altarpiece now in the Pinacoteca at Faenza. The
keen interest forced the price up to double the amount estimated, and it was
bought by Flavia Ormond Fine Art for Pounds 55,000.
A rare and newly discovered red chalk drawing of Fortitude by Primaticcio
also did well, changing hands at Pounds 34,100. An early GB Tiepolo pen and
ink drawing of the Holy Family and saints realised Pounds 37,400.
Dutch drawings also held their own. The sale totalled Pounds 638,702 with 55
per cent by value of the items left unsold.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Recession blamed for policy cash-ins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies, stung by criticism from the regulators, yesterday said
that the recession had been the biggest single factor in early surrender of
long-term life policies.
But Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, director of Prudential and chairman of the group
of nine companies which commissioned research, admitted that the life
insurance industry 'must do better'.
The companies outlined measures to ensure that fewer policies are sold to
those for whom they are inappropriate and to ensure that consumers
understand the risks of long-term policies. Figures published by the
companies found that more than a third of customers said they were not told
about the financial implications of allowing a policy to lapse. In the first
five years of a 25-year policy, often used to back a mortgage, the surrender
value will usually be significantly less than the total premiums.
A survey by the Securities and Investments Board at the end of last year
found that during 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies and 23
per cent of with-profits policies were terminated within two years of being
started.
Mr Bedell-Pearce said: 'There was a very clear message that the rate of
persistency had deteriorated, and that they were unacceptable. It was also
clear that no hard reasons yet existed.' The companies intended to change
the selling techniques in order to ensure that customers understood that
they could lose money by surrendering their policies.
They would also follow their report's recommendation that product design
should be altered to allow policyholders more flexibility when affected by
events such as redundancy or divorce.
The survey found that 68 per cent of customers gave up their policies
because of a 'change in personal circumstances'. The main reasons within
these were inability to continue paying premiums (15 per cent), redundancy
(10 per cent) and a need for extra cash (7 per cent).
However, 14 per cent of surrenders came as a direct result of problems with
advisers or with service direct from the life office, while 17 per cent were
caused by complaints about value for money.
The insurance companies whose customers were interviewed were: Commercial
Union, Eagle Star, General Accident Life, Guardian Royal Exchange, Legal &amp;
General, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal Life, and Sun Alliance.
The research was carried out by Survey Research Associates, and 7,569 people
were interviewed.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Postal watchdog calls for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Post Office Users' National Council, the industry's official watchdog,
yesterday accused the government of backtracking over its plans to reform
the Post Office.
Before the last election the government's Citizen's Charter contained
proposals to establish mandatory standards and introduce more competition by
reducing the monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1.
The Queen's Speech in May contained no reference to proposals for the Post
Office and Mr Tom Corrigan, Pounc chairman, says in the council's annual
report: 'For the second time in barely six months the possibility of
legally-backed reforms had been shelved.'
He argues there should be no loss of momentum in putting charter principles
into practice. In particular he does not want to see any stepping back from
making the achievement of delivery performance standards mandatory.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday said it remained committed to
reforming the Post Office. It added that while it hopes to bring forward
legislation in the next Parliament this would depend on whether other issues
took priority.
The users council is also concerned at the closure of 200, mainly rural,
Post Offices in the past year and called for better consultation with local
people. Mr Corrigan says: 'We recognise there must be commercial realism but
that must be balanced with social needs.'
The Post Office said the views of local people were always taken into
account before an office was closed.

FT  07 JUL 92 / OFT likely to attack ITV network plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading is likely to be critical of two crucial aspects
of proposed central networking arrangements for the new independent
television system, to be set up next year.
There is disquiet about ITV's insistence that independently produced
programmes made for the ITV network must be made through sponsoring ITV
companies, and about ITV's wish to buy rights to such programmes for up to
15 years.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, has made it clear that the
purpose of buying such rights would be to prevent potential competitors
getting access to them.
There is a growing feeling that both ITV policies could be interpreted as
prima facie breaches of competition rules.
The OFT, which has a statutory duty under the 1990 Broadcasting Act to
ensure that ITV's networking arrangements are not anti-competitive, plans to
publish a discussion document later this month.
Independent access and control of programme rights will be identified in the
document as 'issues', although the OFT has not decided how forthright the
public discussion should be. The competition body has further work to do and
more evidence to hear before it makes up its mind, probably in the autumn.
It is clear, however, that strong evidence against the need for independent
producers to be sponsored by ITV companies has already been submitted to the
OFT.
The ITV companies, backed by the Independent Television Commission, have
argued such sponsorship is needed because from the beginning of next year
each ITV company will be the legal programme publisher. It has been pointed
out, however, that this could not apply to programmes bought in from the US
or to news.

FT  07 JUL 92 / National Savings launches new bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings yesterday fulfilled Mr Norman Lamont's Budget promise of a
new product by launching a one-year fixed-rate bond.
However, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building
Society, said the rate was 'a bit strong' and was not helpful in enabling
building societies to cut mortgage rates.
FIRST (Fixed Interest Rate Savings Tax-Paid) Option Bond goes on sale today
with a guaranteed interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to 10.34
per cent gross) on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. Tax is deducted at source and
the bond is aimed at the country's 25.1m basic-rate taxpayers. A higher rate
of 8.05 per cent is payable on Pounds 20,000 and above.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said it was aimed at
funding the government's public sector borrowing requirement this year of
Pounds 28bn. He said that in setting the rate, the government had been
mindful of protests from banks and building societies that National Savings
rates were too high.
National Savings has outperformed building societies for several months of
this year. In May, National Savings recorded net receipts of Pounds 333m
against net receipts of Pounds 179m by building societies. The Building
Societies' Association said yesterday that the new bond 'will provide more
competition for savings.'
National Savings contributed a net Pounds 3.1bn to government funding last
year and it has already raised Pounds 1.5bn in the first quarter of the
year.
Halifax, the UK's largest building society, which launched a similar product
in May, the Guaranteed Reserve, said yesterday that it had anticipated
public demand for the bond and believed its own product offered 'attractive
and realistic rates of interest'.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Sales of new cars up 4.4% in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in the UK rose for the third month running last month. But the
recovery remains weak and there is concern in the industry about prospects
for the rest of this year.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday that sales in
June were up 4.4 per cent, to 102,566 units, compared with the same month a
year ago. This followed year-on-year increases of 9.1 per cent in April but
only 1.4 per cent in May.
The overall result is that sales for the first half of the year, at 768,745,
are still languishing 4.11 per cent below 801,684 in the 1991's first half.
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the society, warned yesterday that total
sales this year remain in danger of falling below even last year's level of
1.59m units.
The industry is now monitoring order intakes for August, when the new
registration prefix is introduced. More than a fifth of each year's total
sales are made in August, with July typically accounting for only about 2
per cent of annual sales.
'If the industry doesn't achieve 400,000 sales in August it's going to have
a big problem', one senior Vauxhall executive said. To achieve this, sales
would have to be nearly 9 per cent above the 367,646 achieved last year.
Ford, the market leader, saw its market share drop to 20.66 per cent last
month from 27.30 per cent a year ago.
However, Vauxhall's market share rose to 16.18 per cent in June, from 14.09
per cent a year ago.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Doctors open the debate on care rationing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S doctors yesterday opened the way to involving the government and
the public in discussions on one of the most sensitive of medical issues,
the rationing of health care.
The British Medical Association plans a national conference early next year
and intends to invite senior ministers.
Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the association's council, said the
conference would also draw speakers from a wide range of backgrounds
including doctors, philosophers, economists and patients.
'Rationing health care is not a party political issue,' he told the
association's annual conference in Nottingham. 'It is an unavoidable fact of
life and there is no doubt in my mind that it must be done openly.'
There is growing recognition by governments that not all medical demands can
be met with equal speed and that some form of priority setting is required.
This has been done most controversially in the state of Oregon in the US
where the authorities have developed a league table of medical and surgical
priorities related to available funds.
In the UK, the separation of healthcare purchasing from its provision under
last year's health reforms is making health authorities more critical about
allocation of resources, bringing the issue higher up the National Health
Service agenda.
Delegates at the association's conference supported a motion declaring that
the rationing of health services was 'an unfortunate fact of life' and that
it should be done openly by agreement between the Department of Health and
the medical profession.
Dr Lee-Potter said that the issue of rationing had to be faced as a matter
of urgency, with clear guidelines agreed to bring consistent decisions on
medical and surgical priorities throughout the NHS. Healthcare resources
would always be finite while demands for services were not.
A number of speakers in the debate supported this view but opponents, such
as Dr Tony Hicklin from Surrey, argued that if the association endorsed the
principle of rationing, ministers would regard it as the medical
profession's agreement to 'any cuts in funding they decide to make'.
Leaders of the association hope that opening up the debate on priorities may
draw renewed attention to the relatively low level of GDP devoted to health
care in the UK, which they regard as the NHS's worst structural problem. Dr
Lee-Potter said that rationing 'must never be allowed to become another word
for underfunding'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL investors are showing a lack of confidence in the market, according to
a survey commissioned by ProShare, the government-funded organisation set up
to promote wider share ownership.
The survey was conducted by Mori which found that 43 per cent of private
shareholders think it is a bad time to invest in stocks and shares, and only
37 per cent think it is a good time.
Sectors favoured for investment are food and drink, followed by chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, oil and gas. Those in which the least confidence was shown
are construction, motor vehicles, metals and mining.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Lecturer takes test case to the Lords
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lords yesterday began hearing a test case to decide whether senior
university lecturers can rely on keeping their jobs until retirement without
fear of being made redundant on cost-cutting grounds.
Five law lords will hear three days of legal argument in an appeal by
Professor Edgar Page, 61, of Hull University, who in October 1988 became the
first tenured lecturer to be made compulsorily redundant
Prof Page's case, which is backed by the Association of University Teachers,
is thought to hold job security implications for up to 18,000 senior
university staff. The contracts of younger staff contain redundancy
provisions.
Prof Page was granted a tenured appointment at Hull in 1966 to run until a
retirement age of 67.
He claims the university's decision to make him redundant because of its
financial difficulties was unlawful because it was contrary to its own
charter and statutes, which state that staff can be dismissed only for
incompetence or gross misconduct.
The Court of Appeal upheld the university's case and ruled last year that it
did have the right to dismiss Prof Page.
He is now seeking to overturn that ruling in the Lords. The law lords are
expected to reserve their decision at the end of the hearing and give
judgment later.

FT  07 JUL 92 / BT bars many redundancy applicants: Voluntary package
oversubscribed Unions say workforce is further demoralised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of British Telecom-munications employees who want to leave their
jobs as part of a voluntary redundancy programme are being told they will
have to stay. Unions say the move has provoked fury among BT's employees and
has further demoralised an already insecure workforce.
BT is spending more than Pounds 1bn on Release 92, its scheme to shed 24,000
employees this year from a workforce of 200,000. However, terms are so
attractive and, the unions claim, morale so low that the redundancy scheme
is heavily oversubscribed.
BT intended to cut 8,000 engineering jobs but 17,000 engineering staff want
to take voluntary redundancy. A total of 7,000 clerical workers want to
leave compared with a target figure of 2,000.
Half the total workforce initially expressed an interest in receiving more
information. The deadline for final acceptance under the scheme is the end
of next week.
The National Communications Union, the main BT union, says some members have
already bought small businesses, put their homes on the market or made plans
to emigrate on the strength of indications from management that attractive
redundancy terms would be available.
Under Release 92 payments could be as high as Pounds 100,000 plus pension
entitlement, although the average sum is likely to be about Pounds 30,000.
Training vouchers worth Pounds 1,000 and at least three months' guaranteed
work through an employment agency are also on offer.
Because of the demand BT is introducing criteria for redundancy selection.
Those who have gained high marks in performance appraisals will not normally
be eligible for the scheme, and those with long service will also go to the
bottom of the list because of the high costs of paying them off.
Mr Bill McClory, NCU assistant secretary, said it was clearly prejudicial to
his members' interests to be good at their jobs.
The Union of Communication Workers, whose members in the operator service at
telephone exchanges are threatened by future job cuts, added that there had
been a high level of interest from operators.
BT said yesterday it had made clear from the outset that management 'would
ultimately have to decide whether or not it could allow an applicant to go.
People should not have made any firm plans for their future until they had
received confirmation that they could go, been given a confirmation of their
entitlements and made a formal decision to accept the offer.' It added that
further job reductions were likely, although no specific posts had been
identified. The terms of Release 92 were unlikely to be repeated under any
future redundancy scheme, said BT.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Dentists take preventive action against cut in fees: John
Willman on a dispute caused in part by a successful treatment drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE over fees for providing dental treatment on the National Health
Service intensified yesterday with the threat by dentists to refuse NHS
treatment to many patients.
The cause of the dispute is the decision by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, to cut the fees for NHS dental work by 7 per cent. She says the
fees need to be cut because dentists' earnings are higher than the levels
recommended by the Doctors and Dentists Pay Review Body.
The overpayment appears to have been caused by a misfit between the new
contract introduced in October 1990 that encourages dentists to sign up new
patients and a pay-review body system which tries to establish a target
income for the dentists working under the contract. The success of dentists
in signing up new patients has led to higher-than-expected earnings which
the fee cuts are now designed to claw back.
The difficulty arises because almost all NHS dentists are self-employed,
contracting with the health service to provide dental care. They are paid a
per capita fee for each NHS patient on their list, plus fees for procedures
or treatments carried out. The fees are set by the Dental Rates Study Group,
which brings together dentists and health department officials under an
independent chairman.
Out of the gross income produced by these fees, dentists must pay their
expenses - premises, staff, equipment, materials and laboratory services. It
is their net income after deduction of expenses which the pay review body
sets.
However, setting the fees requires an estimate of the average gross income
which dentists need to earn. This is calculated by adding an allowance for
expenses and notional rent to the target net income set by the pay review
body.
The table shows how this calculation was done for 1992-93. The pay review
body recommended an 8.5 per cent rise in net remuneration and set average
net earnings at Pounds 35,815. This was more than 8.5 per cent above the
1991-92 figure because that year's award was staged.
The health department's calculations for expenses and notional rent meant
that this required a target average gross income of Pounds 83,207. However,
the fees set in the previous year would have produced an estimated turnover
per dentist in 1992-93 of more than Pounds 90,000. Meeting the target
average gross income appeared to require a cut in fees.
The reason for this is the dentists success in signing up NHS patients.
Aided by a health department campaign, they have raised the number of
patients on their lists to around 30m, against an estimate of 24m.
Mr Michael Watson of the British Dental Association, larger of the two
dentists' associations, said: 'Going to the dentist is becoming more
popular, thanks to the tremendous effort by Britain's dentists. If the
government's policy of rewarding performance means anything, it must mean
that this improvement in health care cannot lead to a cut in fees.'
The original proposal to cut fees by 13.8 per cent was shelved before the
election. Last month Mrs Bottomley came up with a proposal for a 7 per cent
cut, which the government claims would still leave dentists' average net
earnings at more than Pounds 40,000 a year - well above the review body's
target.
Dentists say the extra work they have generated has forced their expenses
above the department's estimates and the result of the 7 per cent cuts would
be an average net income of around Pounds 30,000 a year  - well below the
review body's target.
Both sides appear prepared to go to the brink in defending their positions.
The dentists' ballots are likely to mean an acceleration in the numbers of
dentists withdrawing from NHS work, a process already happening because of
discontent with the terms of the new contract.
Dentists' leaders are anxious to avoid precipitate action, and are
cautioning their members against undue haste. NHS patients already on
dentists' lists are unlikely to be refused treatment immediately but
patients signing up for the first time or transferring from another dentist
could find it harder to get registered.
The government is standing behind its promise of a 'fundamental review'
aimed at developing a more effective remuneration system for dentists which
meets criticisms that the current contract under-values preventive work.
Mrs Bottomley has said that threats by dentists to withdraw from NHS work
will not be allowed to undermine the service. She has promised to expand the
number of dentists directly employed by the health service in areas where
dentists fail to offer NHS treatment.
However, whether this can be more than a stop-gap remains to be seen. There
are fewer than 100 salaried dentists at present. With pay at between Pounds
18,755 and Pounds 27,305 a year, the attractions of a salaried post would
need to be considerably improved if there were mass withdrawals by
self-employed dentists.
If such withdrawals accelerate, they will give credence to the dentists'
claims that the government is intent on privatising NHS dentistry.
Yesterday's ballots by the two main associations indicate that whether or
not this is the government's intention, a failure to resolve the dispute
soon is likely to have privatisation as its ultimate effect.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Cuomo agrees to nominate Clinton: Democratic candidate needs
party unity

NEW YORK Governor Mario Cuomo yesterday agreed to give the formal nomination
speech for Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas at next week's Democratic
convention.
Mr Clinton, who has had feuds with fellow Democrats during the US
presidential primary season, has thus made sure that at least one running
squabble will be smoothed over in time for his big moment, when the party
anoints him as its candidate in the November 3 election.
Mr Cuomo's shadow has loomed over the Democrats this year. His partisans
hoped he would run in the primaries himself; when he did not, they began to
plot ways to draft him as candidate at the convention.
By winning his agreement, Mr Clinton has taken a significant step towards
building the party unity which the Democrats have traditionally found so
difficult to achieve.
With 57 per cent of the convention delegates committed to voting for him, Mr
Clinton is assured of the nomination, but he cannot yet boast solid support
from fellow Democrats.
Of the defeated primary contenders, only Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has
formally endorsed the victor, and several Democratic heavyweights, including
Governors Ann Richards of Texas, Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and Lawton
Chiles of Florida, have been unenthusiastic about their fellow Democratic
governor. But Mr Cuomo's absence from the convention, which will take place
in his home city of New York, would have been a particularly glaring signal
of disunity.
Party managers now hope Mr Cuomo can match his eloquence at their 1984
convention, when he enthralled the audience with a indictment of the Reagan
presidency.
Although Mr Clinton's opinion poll showing has recently shown a modest
revival - some polls last week showed him leading both independent
challenger Mr Ross Perot and President George Bush - he still clearly needs
a successful convention to bolster his fragile candidacy.
Mr Cuomo's selection to nominate Mr Clinton should also quell lingering
speculation that the Arkansas governor might pick him as his
vice-presidential running mate. He is expected to announce his choice this
week.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Collor goes on counter-attack
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor has launched a counter-offensive against
the flood of corruption allegations threatening his political future.
Drawing on his two main assets - the respect commanded by Mr Marcilio
Marques Moreira, the economy minister, and his own marketing skills - Mr
Collor hopes to win over what he calls 'the silent majority' and thus resist
pressures by the media and political opponents for his resignation.
Documents emerged on Sunday further linking Mr Collor to Mr Paulo Cesar
Farias, the businessman under congressional investigation for alleged
extortion, and purporting to show that deposits averaging Dollars 53,000
(Pounds 28,000) a month have been made into the account of the president's
secretary by a company owned by Mr Farias. The money was allegedly used to
pay Mr Collor's household expenses.
To show his defiance in the face of the latest accusations Mr Collor resumed
his traditional Sunday run, after a break of six months. The message printed
on his T-shirt was 'Don't talk about crisis. Work]' He has also begun
sending out daily handwritten notes referring to the existence of a
'syndicate of coup-makers' whom he accuses of 'irresponsible anarchism',
insisting they will not succeed in forcing him out of office.
Mr Moreira is meanwhile taking every opportunity to predict good economic
news, despite little evidence of improvement, and has relaxed restrictions
on consumer credit to stem complaints about the recessionary effects of
tight government monetary policy.
Predicting economic growth this year of 2-3 per cent, Mr Moreira says real
interest rates will fall next month. He insists that the political crisis is
not damaging the economy.
'The allegations of Sunday, the speculations of Monday and the rumours of
Thursday will not affect the functioning of the country because this
government has withdrawn from the economy, no longer fixing prices or
regulating everything, and allowing it to function independent of political
problems,' he said.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Duran considers what to do first: Sarita Kendall outlines
the problems facing Ecuador's president-elect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE margin of victory in the second round of presidential elections on
Sunday should give Ecuador's president-elect, Mr Sixto Duran Ballen, the
leeway to embark on the campaign goals he set himself.
Mr Duran's main campaign promise was to pursue the goal of 'national
consensus'. He also pledged to introduce market-oriented policies to escape
economic stagnation and dependence on oil.
But while his 15 percentage point victory should help him pursue these aims
early in his four-year term, a more lasting consensus will come under severe
pressure from Ecuador's traditional regional, political and racial
divisions.
Mr Duran, 70, was born in Boston while his father was serving in Ecuador's
diplomatic corps. An architect and former cabinet minister, he earned a
reputation for public works as mayor of Quito. To run for the presidency he
had to leave the Social Christian party, which he had helped to create but
which fielded his opponent in the second round, Mr Jaime Nebot. Mr Duran
founded the Republican Unity party, which won only 12 of the 77 seats in
congress.
The vice president-elect, economist Mr Alberto Dahik of the Conservative
party, adds five more seats to the parliamentary alliance. He is expected to
be a stronger influence on economic policy than previous vice presidents and
shares Mr Duran's desire for market-oriented reforms.
Looking pleased and relaxed as he scanned the regional voting results which
gave him victory in 19 of the 21 provinces, Mr Duran stressed the need for
multi-party agreement. He must negotiate the support of at least two more
political parties to have a small majority in congress, and though this may
be easy at the beginning of the government it will be harder in his second
two years.
Mr Duran's immediate worry will be the economy, especially the steady but
high inflation rate of 50 per cent and the large budget deficit.
Devaluation, as well as increases in the price of petrol, transport and
other services, are some of the unpopular measures he will have to take in
the first weeks of government.
The role of the state will be reduced: 'I believe it should be a regulator,
but the state is a bad administrator - look at our railways,' said Mr Duran.
'We can do lot with private sector contracts, for example in the maintenance
of roads, in housing and in the provision of water and sewerage. This will
generate employment and reduce costs.'
The present government made little progress on rescheduling the Dollars
12.3bn foreign debt, about half of which lies with the commercial banks. Mr
Duran plans to increase debt swaps and 'use the debt as a factor for
development'.
As part of the liberalisation strategy, the new administration needs to
attract foreign investors: 'Foreign capital should be treated in the same
way as national investment with no discrimination. There must be security
for the repatriation of profits and investment recovery and, I hope, a
climate of peace and confidence.'
Foreign oil companies in particular have become frustrated with the present
government's delays and changeability.
President Rodrigo Borja has however earned praise for his energetic and
unexpected action against Ecuador's main drug-trafficking group. Mr Jorge
Reyes and other members of the Reyes clan, allegedly linked to Colombia's
Cali cartel, were arrested at the end of June. 'In the next government we
must continue, and make sure the justice system does its job,' said Mr
Duran.

THE United Nations Security Council yesterday demanded that Iraq immediately
let UN inspectors search Baghdad's Agriculture Ministry for weapons
information.
It said Baghdad's attitude was a 'material and unacceptable breach by Iraq'
of a Gulf war ceasefire resolution but did not say what it would do if Iraq
did not comply.
The confrontation began on Sunday when a weapons inspection team was unable
to enter the ministry. Iraqi authorities said information kept there was
beyond the scope of UN weapons inspections and not covered in Security

FT  07 JUL 92 / Thomson tries to reframe bid for US missile maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury said last night that Thomson-CSF, the French
state-controlled defence electronics group, had withdrawn its offer to buy
the missiles division of LTV, the bankrupt US conglomerate.
The French company was reported to be in negotiations on a new deal under
which a US group would take over and operate the LTV missile division.
Thompson would be just a minority partner.
These moves were prompted by US government hostility to Thomson's bid, which
has also encountered opposition in Congress.
In addition the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a review
body chaired by the Treasury, is understood to have voted to recommend that
President George Bush should block the LTV deal.
If Thomson's bid had been rejected by Mr Bush, it would have been only the
second company to receive such a rebuff, after the China National
Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, whose application to buy a
Seattle-based aircraft parts maker, Mamco, was denied in 1989, largely as a
rebuke to the Chinese government over the Tiananmen Square massacre.
The Thomson bid for the missiles unit, in conjunction with a bid for the LTV
aircraft division by the Carlyle group, a Washington merchant bank, would
have put around Dollars 450m (Pounds 235m) in the pockets of LTV, which has
operated under the supervision of a New York bankruptcy court for the past
six years.
Northrop, the US defence contractor which has signed a memorandum of
understanding with Carlyle to buy a minority stake in the aircraft division,
has been most frequently cited as a likely partner for Thomson in a new bid.
Even such a restructured deal, however, was expected still to face
opposition in Washington. Thomson said during congressional hearings that it
would not accept a blind voting trust or proxy arrangement, but this might
be the only structure acceptable to the Pentagon.
A deal in which Thomson would have only a minority of the voting rights, but
pay most of the purchase cost by buying non-voting preferred stock, could
still be viewed sceptically.
The campaign against the Thomson-LTV deal has been led, right down to
punctuation and misspellings in statements by congressmen and expert
witnesses, by Lockheed and Martin Marietta, whose joint bid Thomson topped.
But Thomson had been unable to assuage fears about the possible loss of US
military technology, or to calm the broad streak of francophobia which has
been demonstrated in Congress.
Although LTV creditors still have a back-up bidder in the shape of the
Lockheed-Martin Marietta consortium, the outright failure of the Thomson bid
would raise difficult questions about US policy on similar foreign
acquisitions in the future.
As defence budgets are slashed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
US is reluctantly facing the same dilemma as other, smaller countries which
have discovered they cannot on their own order enough military materiel to
sustain a domestic industry covering the full range of defence equipment.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S leading foreign banks were yesterday thrust to the forefront of the
Bombay financial scandal when a central bank report claimed that
controversial securities market trading had been concentrated in their hands
and in those of four brokers now under arrest.
The report prepared by a committee under Mr R. Janakiraman, deputy governor
of the Reserve Bank of India, said that Citibank, Standard Chartered, Bank
of America and ANZ Grindlays Bank accounted for 67 per cent of the
transactions in the interbank securities market.
The report says about two thirds of the transactions went through brokers
rather than being handled directly by the banks. Of the transactions in
which brokers were intermediaries, a fifth were accounted for by Mr Harshad
Mehta, Mr Bhupen Dalal, Mr Hiten Dalal and Mr V B Desai. All four face fraud
charges.
The report makes no specific charges against the foreign banks. But the
Reserve Bank over the weekend ordered a special audit of the four
institutions. Citibank accounted for 23 per cent of the 58,000 transactions
since April 1991, Standard Chartered 18 per cent, Bank of America 16 per
cent and ANZ Grindlays 8 per cent.
A senior government official said last night that the report painted 'a
black picture' of the role of foreign banks. Another said that the audit by
the Reserve Bank was intended to show whether the two American banks - which
have maintained that they had a clean slate - had employees who were also
involved in questionable trading.
The report points to widespread deficiencies in the internal control systems
of both foreign and domestic banks. It says that in 20 per cent of the
transactions book entries between banks failed to match.
The committee makes clear that it thinks this would not have happened if
banks had dealt directly with each other rather than through brokers. It
says that the mismatching 'could not have occurred if cheques paid and
received for transactions in securities and other documents had been
directly exchanged between banks and also if bankers' cheques had not been
credited to brokers accounts. . . '
ANZ Grindlays has, under Reserve Bank instructions, made provision for more
than Rs5bn (Pounds 92m) for a cheque issued to National Housing Bank that it
credited to the account of Mr Mehta.
Laying the ground for what may emerge as another scandal, the report points
to abuses of the government's privatisation programme. It says that public
sector shares sold to state owned financial institutions were re-sold in
collusive deals between the institutions and brokers.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said yesterday that the government
intended to appoint soon a 'strong' supervisory agency to monitor the
banking system.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Oil and gas spending cuts predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEEP cuts in the energy industry's 1992 spending on oil and gas exploration
and production in North America were forecast yesterday by Salomon Brothers,
the investment bank. It based its prediction on a survey of 247 companies.
The survey - which also found that 40 per cent of big US oil companies had
underspent their planned exploration budgets in the first six months of this
year - discovered that on a worldwide basis there could be a 3.2 per cent
year-to-year decline in spending.
Mr Jim Crandell, a Salomon Brothers analyst who participated in the study,
said the lower spending plans appeared to have been based partly on the drop
in natural gas prices this year and the relative weakness of crude oil and
refined product prices.
The mid-year survey is designed to assess how spending is progressing
relative to 1992 budgets, and to provide a glimpse of industry plans for
next year.
Spending in the US in 1992 is predicted to decrease by 18.5 per cent for
independent companies and by 20.1 per cent for the majors. Canadian
expenditure is estimated to drop by 20.5 per cent in 1992.
Salomon said the forecast drop in US exploration and production spending by
big companies could translate into a decline in absolute terms from Dollars
13.5bn last year to Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in 1992.

FINANCING for the Dollars 260m (Pounds 136m) third section of a new
Algeria-to-Italy gas pipeline, to be built by Transmediterranean Pipeline
Co, has been completed after eight banks have agreed to underwrite the
venture.
Transmediterranean, a Jersey-based venture between Snam, the gas and
petroleum subsidiary of ENI, Italy's state-owned energy group, and
Sonatrach, Algeria's state-owned hydrocarbons company, is building the
pipeline beside an existing pipe from Algeria, through Tunisia and the
Sicily Channel, to Italy. Snam has been buying gas from Sonatrach since 1983
and is contracted to buy 530bn cu m by 2019, one of the world's biggest
energy supply pacts.
Morgan Grenfell has been working since October to bring eight banks together
to finance the third section of the pipe, through the Sicily Channel, where
work is due to begin soon.
The two facilities comprise a Dollars 200m Italian buyer credit guaranteed
by SACE, the Italian export credit agency, and a Dollars 60m commercial
loan. Financing was secured for the trans-Tunisian section last year, and
financing for the Dollars 400m Algerian section is expected to be in place
by the end of this year. The pipeline will contribute significantly to
Italy's energy needs.
Reuter reports from Algiers: Sonatrach has signed an agreement with BP
Exploration of the UK to study ways of co-operating in oil and gas
exploration and production.
Sonatrach, seeking foreign partners to increase oil and gas output, said the
two also agreed to look into co-operating in selling and transporting
natural gas in Europe.
BP's chief executive, Mr Richard Newton, signed the pact after talks with
Algeria's oil minister, Mr Nordine Ait-Laoussine and Sonatrach's
director-general, Mr Abdelhak Bouhafs.
Sonatrach said negotiations were also being held to finalise a contract for
exploring in Algeria's Atlas Tellien mountains. The range divides Algeria's
north coastal region from the Sahara desert.

THE future of the Andean Pact - grouping Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,

overtures to a southern cone common market, Sarita Kendall reports from
Quito.
The government of President Jaime Paz Zamora said Bolivia, which has lower
tariffs than the other Andean countries, 'may well' seek full membership of
Mercosur, the proposed customs union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. Such a move, reflecting Bolivia's growing links with Mercosur
countries, would require it to withdraw from the Andean Pact.
Venezuela's decision to break diplomatic relations with Peru, because of
April's suspension of the constitution, has also halted negotiations over
tariffs and compounded failures to define a common external tariff.

Bridgestone of Japan should raise its market share in Europe and North

FT  07 JUL 92 / French Transport Dispute: Economy counts the cost of its
travails as industry starts lay-offs
</HEADLINE>

FRANCE yesterday counted the economic cost of the lorry drivers' dispute as
food and fuel shortages worsened and dozens of factories were forced to lay
off workers because of supply shortages.
The worst affected sectors have been petrol, food, farming, chemicals, cars,
textiles and tourism, according to the Patronat, which represents French
employers. Provence, Rhone Alpes, the Cote d'Azur and Nord Pas de Calais
have been hit hardest.
The Patronat said it was impossible to quantify the damage caused so far but
warned that lay-offs had begun and that many companies could eventually
incur 'huge losses'.
Small companies are particularly vulnerable. Mr Lucien Rebuffel, chairman of
the French small companies' federation, said many businesses were running
short of parts.
Rockwool, a specialist chemical company at Saint-Eloi-les-Mines in
Puy-de-Dome with 90 employees, was partially shut down yesterday because it
was receiving only 10 of its usual 85 daily lorryloads of supplies. Mr
Gilbert Cattin, a director, said a shutdown would cost FFr500,000 (Pounds
51,500) a day.
French business is unlikely to be able to claim insurance as compensation
for any losses. There is also concern about longer-term cashflow,
particularly among small companies.
Some companies are concerned that foreign competitors will take advantage of
their problems to poach their contracts. Mr Vincent Ginestet, chairman of
Motolita-France, a motor parts maker in Bordeaux, said: 'Unless we can make
our usual deliveries to our US customers this week they will find other
suppliers.'
The impact on consumers also grew yesterday. There were reports of garages
rationing petrol in Toulouse and Lille and in southern rural regions. There
were also reports of fresh food shortages, mainly in small shops.
The huge wholesale fruit and vegetable market at Arnavaux, north of
Marseilles, received deliveries from only three lorries yesterday, rather
than the 60 lorryloads it would expect on a normal Monday.
France's importance as a transit country for goods travelling between other
European states threatens to extend the effects. Spain and Portugal are
particularly vulnerable. Italy is also badly exposed because Austria and
Switzerland, the main alternatives to France as points of entry, tightly
restrict heavy goods traffic. So far, sufficient traffic seems to be getting
through France to have averted an immediate crisis. The effects on European
industry have also been cushioned because businesses have been able to draw
off stocks. But there is growing concern among European countries:
Britain: The British manufacturing arm of Peugeot, the French car maker,
re-started operations yesterday after being left temporarily short of
components. The search for alternative transit routes has led many UK
hauliers to switch to the Benelux countries. P&amp;O European Ferries said 50
per cent of the freight normally carried on its Dover-Calais route had
switched to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.
The Netherlands: Dutch companies have suffered damages exceeding Fl 250m
(Pounds 75.8m) in lost sales and ruined goods, according to the EVO group,
representing 40,000 Dutch companies. The organisation suggested members
might shift freight to France, Spain and Portugal to coastal freighters. The
Dutch Railway has also reported a sharp increase in demand for space on
freight trains to France.
Belgium: The Renault car factory at Vilvoorde temporarily suspended 1,500
employees from a workforce of 3,800 as a result of supply shortages. Mr Guy
Coeme, , the Belgian transport minister, has written to his French
counterpart to lay the groundwork for possible compensation claims by
Belgian companies.
Germany: A handful of German trucks managed to escape the French gridlock
and return home yesterday thanks to police efforts to break the blockade,
according to the BDF road transport industry association. However, between
500 and 800 German-registered lorries are still stuck.
Spain: The dispute has cost Spanish companies more than 3bn pesetas (Pounds
16.4m) in agricultural exports and lost revenue from tourism, the government
said yesterday. Some 500 Spanish trucks are stranded in France leaving
10,000 tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables to rot.

FT  07 JUL 92 / French Transport Dispute: France may miss out on tourist
record

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S road chaos means it is unlikely this year to achieve the hoped-for
record of attracting 56m foreign visitors, outnumbering the country's
population for the first time.
The French tourist industry says it is suffering badly in spite of reports
from travel companies and motoring associations across Europe that the
dispute has not stopped many travellers from setting off.
Some 60 per cent of people who have reserved hotel rooms since July 1 have
failed to appear, said the Federation Nationale de l'Industrie Hoteliere.
The situation was 'delicate, even catastrophic', said Mr Jacques The,
president of the federation, which is asking the government for financial
aid. Accor, France's largest hotel operator, said occupancy was down to 10
per cent in its Formule 1 cut-price chain, normally 95 per cent full at this
time of the year.
Euro Disney, the newly-opened theme park outside Paris, admitted the dispute
was doing some damage. While its hotels had been 'very slightly affected',
the impact on admissions to the park had been more noticeable. France, the
world's second largest tourist destination after the US in spending terms,
can ill afford to upset foreign visitors. Its tourist industry recorded a
FFr51.3m (Pounds 5.26m) trade surplus last year, the largest of any French
industrial sector. In Germany, which provided 11.2m visitors last year, the
largest number from any country, ADAC, the motorists' club, suggested
tourists take circuitous routes to the south of France.
It advised trippers to be cautious, following reports of attacks by lorry
drivers on German holidaymakers trying to skirt truck barricades.
In the UK, France's second biggest tourist market, with 7.9m visitors last
year, P&amp;O European Ferries said it had carried 130,000 travellers to France
over the weekend, the same number as last year.
The Automobile Association said it was advising motorists to use minor
roads, carry spare blankets and food and a good map.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Basle code to avoid repeat of BCCI case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING industrial countries have agreed to follow new minimum standards
when regulating international banks, in an attempt to reduce banking
malpractices in the wake of last year's closure of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
The main safeguard against a repetition of the BCCI scandal, which led to
losses of hundreds of million pounds for depositors, is that big
international banks will be policed on a worldwide basis by a single bank
regulator.
In the case of BCCI, no one regulator took responsibility for vetting all of
the banking group's worldwide operations, thereby allowing it to disguise
the extent of the fraud it perpetrated.
The standards were issued yesterday by the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision and were endorsed by the central bank governors from the Group
of Ten leading industrial countries together with Luxembourg and
Switzerland.
If the rules had been in force before the closure of BCCI, responsibility
for supervising BCCI would have rested with the Luxembourg regulator,
because BCCI's domicile was in Luxembourg. In other words, the regulator in
a bank's 'home' country is obliged to take responsibility for the bank as a
whole. The standards constitute a voluntary code of practice. However, Mr
Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the Basle Committee and president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was confident that they would be enforced.
Nonetheless he stressed that 'no system of supervision is failsafe . . .
There is no ironclad protection against fraud or deceit'.
There are four main features to the minimum standards:
Any international banking group should be supervised on a 'consolidated
basis', taking account of its operations anywhere in the world, by a single
home country authority.
If a bank wants to set up branches in a jurisdiction outside its home
country, it will need the consent of both its home country regulator and the
regulator in the country playing 'host' to the new branches.
A home country supervisor should have the right to receive information on
the international operations of banks under its supervision. This will
require an understanding on the gathering and sharing of information between
the home country and host country supervisors.
If a country is unhappy about the international supervision of a bank whose
domicile is elsewhere, it can impose 'restrictive measures' on branches of
that bank on its territory.
Mr Corrigan described this last clause as the newest element in the
international regime of bank supervision. He said these 'restrictive
measures' could take one of a number of forms.
The most draconian sanction would be to ban the branches from the territory.
However, a bank regulator might simply set a deadline for the the bank and
its home country regulator to meet acceptable standards.
Mr Corrigan said there was a 'middle path' available between these two
sanctions. A regulator could allow a bank to set up in its territory so long
as operations in this territory were grouped in a separately capitalised
subsidiary, which would be fenced off from the rest of the banking group.
Mr Corrigan hopes that bank regulators throughout the world will adhere to
the new standards. Copies have been sent to authorities in more than a 100
countries and he hopes to receive their approval at the annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund in France this October.
However, he accepted that it would be a considerable time before all bank
regulators had sufficient resources or expertise to monitor an international
banking group effectively.

GRUNDIG, the German electronics group, is to reduce its workforce by 3,000
because of a severe decline in the home entertainment market.
Most of the job losses are expected to be incurred in Germany, where rising
labour costs are hampering efforts to remain competitive in the face of
overseas competition.
The television factory and components works in Nuremberg and Furth are
likely to bear the brunt.
At the end of last year about 60 per cent of the company's 21,000 workforce
was employed in Germany. However, employment has been rising in subsidiaries
in Portugal and Malaysia, where pay is lower.
Grundig, minority-owned by Philips of the Netherlands and managed by a Dutch
team, announced in March that it planned wide-ranging rationalisation
measures to regain competitiveness.
The two companies' video recorder businesses are to be merged and Grundig's
manufacture switched from Nuremberg to a Philips plant in Vienna. The
Grundig television factory in Barcelona has already been closed.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Twelve may delay new deal for Turks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S failure to introduce human rights legislation before parliament
went into recess last week could jeopardise British efforts to secure Turkey
a better deal with the EC during the UK's six-month Community presidency.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, is set to present a special
report on Turkey in mid-July, and diplomats believe Ankara has missed an
historic opportunity to improve its human rights record, the main blight on
relations with the EC.
The delay, with the draft now not due to be brought to parliament before
September, represents a personal setback for the prime minister, Mr Suleyman
Demirel, whose election pledge 'to make the police stations out of glass'
was warmly welcomed by western governments. Since forming his coalition
government in October, Mr Demirel has created a Human Rights Ministry and
assigned an ethnic Kurd to run it, signalling a new approach to the
long-running problems faced by Turkey's minority Kurdish community. For the
first time, Turkey encouraged open debate on human rights.
The proposed amendments to the criminal procedure code - central to stamping
out the problem of torture - came unstuck when ministers were unable to
agree the treatment of political and terrorist offences, and in particular
the period of police detention.
President Turgut Ozal earlier vetoed the draft, arguing that any reduction
in detention periods would hamper investigations, an attitude Mr Demirel
appears to support.
For all the rhetoric, in Mr Demirel's first 200 days in office, both the
number of deaths in custody and the incidence of unexplained disappearances
and killings in the Kurdish region appear to have increased.
The draft proposed that police custody for 'conspiracy' crimes be limited to
eight days, extended to 16 on referral to a judge. The current anti-terror
law allows for a maximum 30-day detention.
Mr Demirel and his Social Democrat coalition partners were then unable to
agree a compromise which would have allowed the law to take effect for all
but those cases handled in military controlled state security court - in
effect making an exception for Kurdish prisoners.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is set to take the first step towards outlawing a
far-reaching programme of state subsidies for Ilva, Italy's state steel
company, at its meeting in Strasbourg tomorrow, writes Andrew Hill in
Brussels.
Any attempt to change the mind of the Commission is likely to be
unsuccessful.
A formal procedure against the subsidy plan will probably be opened at
tomorrow's full Commission meeting. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the Italian
research commissioner, dropped his efforts to delay a decision yesterday.
The Italian government will then have a set period - usually two or three
months - to convince Brussels that its plans will not distort competition in
the EC market. If the government fails, then Ilva, Europe's third largest
steel producer, will have to repay the L350bn (Pounds 159.5m) it received in
September when it absorbed Sofin, the state agency entrusted with economic
development in southern Italy. Further tranches of aid would be blocked.
Rome's attempt to justify support for the loss-making state steel company
has already been undermined by the company's announcement of a L498bn loss a
month ago. That ruled out the possibility of a stock market flotation in the
near future and aroused deep concern in Brussels.
The state aid code for steel companies is particularly strict because of
over-capacity in the EC industry. The Commission believes no private
investor - the classic test in state aid cases - would have pumped money
into Ilva given its ailing finances. Ilva says it has been handicapped by
Brussels' insistence that it should carry more debt than it wanted when Ilva
took over the Italian state steel industry in 1988.

A POLITICAL row is brewing in Ireland over last weekend's dismissal of Mr

tele-communications company, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
Mr Hynes was sacked by Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn, the transport and
telecommunications minister, just six months after having been appointed to
the post with a brief to carry out a thorough review of the company's
operations, and, it is thought, to prepare it for privatisation within two
or three years.
No reason has been given for his dismissal, although deep differences over
the company's direction between Mr Hynes and other board members are thought
to lie behind the decision. Ms Geoghegan Quinn is due to make a statement to
parliament today.
Opposition leaders are to press for an explanation. Questions are also
expected about the inquiry into a property deal for a new corporate
headquarters, which resulted in the resignation of the previous chairman, Mr
Michael Smurfitt, last September.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Group of Seven embraces the Sinatra
Doctrine - Policymakers are intent on doing it their way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE officials briefing the press did not use the expression, but yesterday's
opening session of the world economic summit in Munich confirmed that the
'Sinatra Doctrine' now dominates global economic policymaking.
Fourteen years ago in Bonn the first economic summit to be held on German
soil saw agreement on an elaborate trade-off among the big industrial powers
with the aim of spurring world growth. The latest summit in Germany is
celebrating the fact that everybody 'does it my way'.
After the first sessions of talks among the leaders of the Group of Seven
countries and their finance ministers yesterday, it became clear there would
be no dilution of national economic priorities as a result of the meeting.
All seven heads of government and their finance ministers registered dismay
at the weak state of global economic recovery. But it was equally clear that
German interest rates would stay high for as long as necessary to defeat
inflation, even though last week's half percentage point cut in the US
discount rate to a 29-year low of 3 per cent has brought the gap between
comparable US and German official rates to a yawning 6.75 percentage points.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, reaffirmed Britain's policy of
maintaining a strict control on public spending with the aim of eventually
bringing down interest rates. He made clear that he sought no quick fix for
the UK economy.
He was prepared to accept the disciplines of the European exchange rate
mechanism, and strive to put sterling into the narrow bands of the ERM at
DM2.95 in the hope of lower interest rates in the long term.
Japan, which has come under pressure from its international trading partners
to boost its domestic economy, showed it was in no hurry to comply. The
government in Tokyo might at some time decide on further spending measures,
but the moment for that would be in the autumn, after assessment of whether
the front-end loading of public spending in the first half of the current
fiscal year - starting in April - had had any effect.
In the meantime, Mr Yuichi Ezawa, director general of the international
finance bureau of the Ministry of Finance, assured journalists that the
recent fall in the Tokyo stock market and other signs of financial fragility
in Japan would not have a noticeably adverse effect on the real economy.
Indeed, Japan's economy, Mr Ezawa said, was already showing signs of
recovery and was on the way to achieving sustained non-inflationary growth.
Although there has been much talk in the ruling Liberal Democrat party of a
Y7,000bn-Y10,000bn (Pounds 29.4bn-Pounds 42bn) boost to the economy this
autumn, he underlined that Japan was still enjoying full employment.
The government wished to avoid too much reliance on short-term policy
measures for fear of triggering a stop-go cycle, he added.
Germany too was anxious yesterday to stress the medium-term nature of its
policies. Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, insisted that
Germany had contributed a great deal to the world economy and would do more.
The shift in its current account balance of payments from a surplus of
DM108bn in 1989 to a DM33bn (Pounds 11.3bn) deficit in 1991 was proof of
that.
Germany had not and would not suffer recession. Indeed, according to the
OECD, growth this year of 1.75 per cent was likely to be followed by 2.75
per cent growth next year, he said.
What the German government could not ignore, however, was the 'intolerable
and unacceptable' annual inflation rate of 4.5 per cent. Although inflation
is expected to fall to about 4 per cent by the end of the year, the rapid
growth of money supply meant the Bundesbank could not cut interest rates at
an early stage. The Bonn government fully understood the Bundesbank's
position, Mr Vogel said.
He offered some crumbs of comfort. Although the government decided a tough
1993 budget at the start of this month, it had at the same time suspended
the special 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge that had been levied to
finance the absorption of eastern Germany.
The US, which earlier this year put pressure on Germany to redress its
fiscal imbalances with the hope that this would lead to lower interest
rates, has so far applauded the German budget moves and the apparent
intention of Japan to boost its economy if necessary. The US administration
cannot appear too gloomy about world economic prospects so close to the
November presidential election.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday that US growth of
2.5-3.0 per cent was attainable this year and he predicted 'banner years' in
1993-4 if commitment to growth to be undertaken at the summit was fulfilled.
'Growth,' Mr Brady said, 'is not a light switch to be turned off and on, but
a flame that needs to be fed.'
He repeated that US exports would lead the nation's expansion as it had over
the last five years. He cited the recent agreement to build a BMW car plant
in South Carolina as evidence that 'hard-nosed businessmen' had confidence
in the US economy.
The weekend decision by Italy to raise its discount rate by a full
percentage point to 13 per cent and lop L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) off the
budget served as a timely reminder of the hostile economic climate facing
the industrialised countries. While Italy's G7 partners welcomed the move to
deal with the country's huge budget deficit, the fact that the deficit will
partly be pared by tax increases bodes ill for consumption in an economy
where demand is already growing too slowly to prevent rising unemployment
and business failures.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Expansionist talk nudged off the agenda -
Munich Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THIS loose talk, inspired by President George Bush, over whether Russia
should become an honorary member of an expanded G8 has officialdom worried.
How do you say 'forget it' to the Russians in a way which will not upset
President Boris Yeltsin, and correct the unscripted remarks of the US
president without actually saying he got it wrong?
The answer is to say it is all rather 'premature'. That is clearly the
unanimous twist of the media manipulators in trying to kill a story which
was never supposed to run.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the wry German spokesman, said it was obvious 'from many
reactions, not only in Germany, that this (G8) might be a bit premature. . .
I have no doubt that at some point in the future Russia might be in a
position to join the then G8. At present this is not the case.' That's clear
enough.
The obvious candidate to be number eight in the G8 has clearly emerged in
Munich, however. It is the Free State of Bavaria. For this is not a German
summit, it's a Bavarian one.
For a start, six out of eight world leaders attending arrived at the royal
Residenz in Munich in Bavarian cars - BMW and Audi. The only exceptions were
Mr Bush, unreconstructed in a Cadillac, and for some reason President
Francois Mitterrand, who appeared in a rather ancient Mercedes 600 (from
neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg).
There are strange examples of Bavarian culture all round the Residenz to
entertain hangers-on at the summit. So there are dancing men, dancing girls,
organ grinders in straw hats, and the inevitable lederhosen-clad
knee-slapping gentlemen doing something related to British Morris dancing.
Some people seem still to think there are two groups - a G1 and a G6. At
least that is the conclusion one might draw from the US information
exercise, which takes place in glorious isolation in the Sheraton Hotel, a
good 20 minutes from the summit headquarters and press centre. It means it
is physically impossible for most correspondents to cover US briefings and
those of its partners. Back in the Sheraton, the White House press corps is
spoon-fed the national line, undiluted by any hint that the world is
somewhat larger.
A US information official tried to explain it by saying the US had been
refused a briefing room in the palace. When it became obvious that this was
untrue, she suggested it was because 'the White House press corps pays for
it all'. So let's blame the press again.
Meanwhile, down the road in the City Kino, something called Toes is taking
place - The Other Economic Summit. It is largely an environmental
counter-event, to remind world leaders of their commitments, or lack of, at
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Delegates question the whole ethos of a
G7 meeting, too, which seeks to set the economic agenda for the rest of the
world.
They seem to have picked up a surprising ally in Mr John Major, the British
prime minister, who sought to brush up his environmental credentials with a
letter to his colleagues reminding them of just what they promised to do. It
appears to be one of those letters more important in the sending (or the
reporting of it) than in the response, from a government with a pretty thin
record on the environmental front.
And finally to the question of costs. Given that this is an economic summit,
an anxious German Finance Ministry insists that it is well within its budget
 -some DM35m (Pounds 12m). A mischievous German newspaper (the Welt am
Sonntag) calculated that meant DM8,000 a minute of summit time.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Leaders shrink from force in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Group of Seven industrialised countries are tomorrow due to
adopt a separate declaration on Yugoslavia, leaving open the use of military
force as a last resort to back up United Nations sanctions and relief
operations.
It will make clear that such a decision can be taken only by the UN Security
Council.
At a dinner meeting last night, President Francois Mitterrand of France
argued strongly in favour of installing non-UN troops on the road from
Sarajevo airport to the city. These troops would protect convoys carrying
humanitarian aid into the city and would be empowered to shoot if necessary.
But Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary-general, was worried that the plan could lead to confusion
between UN and non-UN troops, and so endanger the lives of UN troops. This
was one of the issues still unresolved last night.
Mr Enzo Scotti, the Italian foreign minister, said the G7 leaders also
discussed a possible naval blockade to enforce UN sanctions against Serbia.
Officials from the nine-nation Western European Union have already been
examining contingency naval plans. WEU foreign ministers may discuss the
idea further at a special meeting in the margins of the 52-nation summit of
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki
later this week.
British officials, however, stressed that the question of military action
did not arise at the moment. They said it would become an option only if
humanitarian aid to Bosnia was not getting through, which was not the case
at present.
The G7 leaders also discussed new French and Italian proposals for
transforming the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia,
chaired by Lord Carrington, into a wider international conference under the
umbrella of the UN.
But it was not clear whether this proposal would figure in the planned
declaration on Yugoslavia.
Meanwhile, officials in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo said
yesterday the international relief effort was not stopping fighting or
preventing Bosnia from being divided between Croatia and Serbia.
According to Croat television, Serb forces have captured the strategic town
of Derventa in central Bosnia, setting houses ablaze.
Relief agencies said Serbs had also seized control of a string of towns in
eastern Bosnia, on or near the Serbian border. Moslems in the region had
been killed, imprisoned or forcibly deported.
Refugees who escaped from Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, say there are hardly any
Moslems left in the town, though they used to make up 70 per cent of the
population.
The Serbian offensive coincided with the formation at the weekend of a new
Croatian state in western Hercegovina.
A British official said the new state, backed by the government in Zagreb
under President Franjo Tudjman, 'would not be recognised'. He said western
diplomats might now be pushed into considering sanctions against Croatia in
view of Zagreb's attempts to undermine UN peacekeeping operations in
Croatia, and its de facto annexation of western Hercegovina.
Mr Milan Panic, the California-based businessman who last week was appointed
prime minister of the new Yugoslavia, consisting only of Serbia and
Montenegro, appealed in Belgrade yesterday for a delay of 100 days to
determine the status of the country at the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
In a letter to CSCE delegates, he said his goal was to stop the fighting.
The US and other countries want to exclude Yugoslavia from the CSCE which
starts a two-day summit in Helsinki on Thursday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE participants at the summit are desperately scratching around to
find something meaningful and positive to say about the world economy, Japan
is pursuing its own, very specific national agenda for tomorrow's meeting
between the seven and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia.
Well aware that they have rarely been in a stronger position to exert
financial and economic pressure on the Russians, the Japanese intend to use
the occasion of Mr Yeltsin's appearance at the forum of the world's richest
nations to press for an early settlement of the long-running issue of the
'Northern Territories', four Japanese islands occupied by the Soviet Union
in 1945.
The language is diplomatic: 'Japan fervently hopes to provide a firm legal
basis for mutual trust between the Japanese and Russian peoples by resolving
the territorial issue and concluding a peace treaty', in the words of the
official brochure on the subject. Given that, 40 years after the second
world war, no peace treaty has been concluded between the two countries,
that can hardly be considered an excessive demand.
No one listening to Japanese spokesmen here, however, can doubt that Japan's
full weight will not be put behind international efforts to bail out
Russia's economy until Moscow agrees at least on the principle of Japanese
sovereignty over the islands at the southern end of the Kurile chain.
It is not that Japan refuses to participate point blank in these efforts. On
the contrary, officials underline the substantial assistance Japan has
already given to the former Soviet Union, notably its contribution of
Dollars 2.7bn to the Dollars 24bn aid package promised by the western
industrialised nations.
But, with infinite regret, they find themselves obliged to point out to
journalists covering the summit that the issue of the Northern Territories
is both a question of justice and a matter of national pride. 'There is a
national consensus that, unless there is a solid political basis for
relations between our two countries in the form of a peace treaty, we cannot
envisage the granting of massive economic assistance at the cost of the
Japanese taxpayer,' an official said.
One of the areas in which they have demonstrated their reluctance to go much
further is that of the proposed Dollars 700m multilateral fund to finance
safety measures at the 57 Soviet-built nuclear reactors in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. They have made clear that they expect the
former Soviet and east European states to bear a substantial share of the
costs before they will agree to contribute.

IMF managing director, Mr Michel Camdessus, yesterday strongly urged G7
finance ministers to back the phased reform plan he has agreed with the
Russian government.
He also insisted that the plan still complied with Russia's reform promises
last April.
He stopped short of urging them to agree a debt rescheduling for Russia,
still under negotiation in the Paris Club of official creditors, although he
said President Boris Yeltsin was entitled to ask for creditors'
understanding.
Mr Camdessus, who flew from Moscow to brief the ministers before Mr Yeltsin
arrives tonight, spelt out the broad conditions agreed by the Russian
government. It was up to Mr Yegor Gaidar, prime minister, to reveal details,
he said.
However, he said that on the controversial question of energy price
liberalisation, both sides had agreed on a progressive approach of freeing
the prices gradually.
'Liberalisation, especially of energy prices, is one of the key elements
agreed by us with Russia in April,' he said. 'What the Russians do not want
to do (and we agree) is to liberalise energy prices all of a sudden. At the
moment the gap between the world energy price, and domestic prices, is too
huge.'
As for debt rescheduling, both Mr Camdessus and Mr Theo Waigel, German
finance minister, refused to prejudge the decisions of the Paris Club.
However, it is clear that the G7 wants to do a deal if details can be
agreed. 'Russia I believe will continue to enjoy the support of the Paris
Club, and explain what it is doing at the next meeting,' Mr Camdessus said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday put forward proposals to break the logjam of the
stalled round of trade liberalisation talks in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
During a day of intensive discussions on the future of the Uruguay Round at
the economic summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, Mr
Major made what British officials described as a forceful intervention in
the opening session.
His officials refused to give further details but Mr Don Mazankowski, the
Canadian finance minister, later disclosed that the UK prime minister had
brought forward proposals which he expected to be discussed later in the
summit. The proposals are thought to include an extension of the period for
reduction of farm subsidies.
Mr Major's decision to bring the Uruguay Round to the heart of the summit
involves a high-risk strategy that reflects the British government's
determination to find a settlement, and to put Britain's stamp on the EC
presidency.
Even before Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, had completed the
ceremonial welcome of the leaders of the US, Japan, France, Britain, Italy,
Canada and the European Commission, the Gatt talks were a subject of intense
discussion.
The issue was raised amid concern about the lacklustre growth of the world
economy and rising unemployment. Mr Mazankowski noted that unemployment in
the Group of Seven countries had risen to 22.9m this year from 18m in 1990.
Finance ministers meeting separately agreed that the only way forward was to
curb excessive budget deficits and strive for stable non-inflationary
growth.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, confirmed that Britain would take an
especially tough line on government spending in the current expenditure
round.
He pledged again to take sterling into the narrow bands of the European
exchange rate mechanism at the current DM2.95 central rate as part of the
British government's continuing fight against inflation.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, conceded that US growth in the
second quarter of this year would not match expectations but that expansion
of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent over the full year was attainable.
He also predicted 'banner years' for the economy in 1993-94 if the
commitment to growth to be undertaken at this summit is fulfilled.
In a summit where all the nations are intent on maintaining their own
economic policies, the leaders and their finance ministers underlined that a
satisfactory solution to the trade talks could be an important spur to world
growth.
According to British officials, a success in the Gatt talks would add
between 1 per cent and 2 per cent to world gross national product.
Mr Major cited calculations that a Gatt success would add Dollars 200bn to
annual world income of which Dollars 90bn would accrue to developing
nations.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Dentists vote to freeze NHS lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 25m patients not already registered with a dentist will find it
harder to get NHS treatment and may have to pay for private treatment, after
dentists voted for partial withdrawal from the National Health Service.
The dentists are responding to government plans to cut their fees by 7 per
cent from tomorrow. Some are likely to withdraw from NHS work altogether.
Two-thirds of members voted in separate ballots of two dentists'
associations, the results of which were announced yesterday, and neither of
which is binding.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday urged dentists to think
'long and hard' before taking action which would jeopardise NHS dental
treatment. She pledged to take 'all necessary steps' to safeguard NHS dental
services.
Members of the 16,000-strong British Dental Association voted to stop taking
all new NHS patients - including children and people on low incomes who
would be eligible for free NHS treatment. A proposal to remove adult NHS
patients from members' lists was defeated, with 55 per cent voting against.
The 4,000 members of the General Dental Practitioners' Association voted to
withdraw all NHS services from patients not entitled to free treatment.
There is unlikely to be a rapid exodus from the NHS, with both associations
warning against hasty action. Scope to opt out of the NHS may also be
limited in some areas, where private practice may not be viable.
The BDA described the future of NHS dentistry as 'bleak', and both
associations appealed to the government to avert the crisis. Dentists'
leaders said the government was effectively privatising NHS dentistry by
forcing practitioners out of the health service through the cuts in fees.
Mrs Bottomley said she regretted the dentists' ballot decisions in reply to
an emergency question in the Commons from Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow
health secretary.
Detailed arrangements for a 'fundamental review' would be announced shortly,
she said. It would aim to 'find a system which is fair to dentists, fair to
patients and fair to the NHS'.
The government claims the fee cuts are needed because dentists are earning
more than the target income set by the doctors' and dentists' pay review
body. Dentists' negotiators say earnings have risen because they have
registered more patients and that cuts will lead to bankruptcies.

FT  07 JUL 92 / DoE may buy office building at Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sale of a Canary Wharf building to the government is being negotiated in
a last-ditch attempt to save the Jubilee Line extension and attract civil
servants to the troubled east London property development.
Canary Wharf's administrators, who have run the project since it filed for
insolvency protection five weeks ago, will offer to sell a building to the
Department of Environment. An offer could be made as soon as today.
The proceeds would be returned to the government to pay for part of the
London Underground Jubilee extension into east London, without which the
future of Canary Wharf would be even less certain.
Some government ministers are keen on moving civil servants to Canary Wharf,
the biggest property development in Europe, whose success may be vital to
the long-term regeneration of London's Docklands. However, the Treasury is
insisting that Canary Wharf should only win if it offers the best terms.
The DoE's property adviser, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, last week told the
administrators, partners from the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, that it is
prepared to negotiate the purchase of a building at a market price.
Before Canary Wharf went into administration, its owner, Canada's Olympia &amp;
York Developments, had agreed to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of
building the line in staggered payments over 25 years, including a payment
this year of Pounds 40m and Pounds 60m next year. The contract was never
signed and the administrator is under no obligation to honour the agreement.
The DoE is keen to move 2,000 civil servants to Docklands and has been
looking closely at four sites: Harbour Exchange, East India Dock, Thomas
More Square and Canary Wharf. Ministers are likely to move there too in
order to encourage civil servants unhappy about the move from central
London.
Until now, Canary Wharf's rivals have consistently offered lower rents.
Canary Wharf's last bid, made on 18 June, was rejected by the DoE.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Germany confirms EFA pullout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday rejected the idea of a cheap version of the European
Fighter Aircraft as a compromise between Bonn and London and confirmed that
it was pulling out of the Pounds 20bn project.
Talks in London between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, and Mr
Volker Ruhe, his German counterpart, left both sides further apart than
ever.
Mr Ruhe called on the partners in the EFA consortium - the UK, Spain and
Italy - to abandon the project and develop instead a smaller aircraft suited
to post Cold war military needs.
'The tactical requirements of EFA were established in 1984. Everything has
changed except the aircraft,' said Mr Ruhe.
He said Spain had expressed sympathy with the German position and that
France, which withdrew from the EFA project in the mid-1980s could be
approached to rejoin.
Mr Rifkind said that to start again with a new aircraft 'would be to throw
away the Pounds 5bn of taxpayers' money already spent on the project.'
Germany said last week it would not be involved in the production of the
aircraft, which is designed to come into service around the turn of the
century.
Details of an alternative aircraft would emerge after discussions between
the partners and with technical experts, Mr Ruhe said yesterday.
The aircraft would not need to be as powerful as EFA because examination of
Russian-built MiG-29s, once part of the East German airforce, had shown them
to have been overrated by western military experts.
The cash saved could also be diverted into land-based defence systems
against long-range missiles, which Mr Ruhe's advisers had said would be an
increasing threat.
Disagreements also emerged on the actual cost of the aircraft. Mr Ruhe said
that each EFA would cost up to DM200m (Pounds 69m) when delivered early next
century. The UK has put a Pounds 45m price tag on each aircraft.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Russia plans to cut deficit and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has undertaken to make sharp cuts in its projected budget deficit and
its inflation rate by the end of December to secure a deal unblocking its
first International Monetary Fund credit of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m).
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's foreign economic relations chief, revealed
the agreement in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday.
In a warning to the leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations
meeting in Munich, he stressed, however, that Russia would be unable to
achieve the IMF's proposed reduction in the budget deficit to 5 per cent of
gross domestic product unless it was allowed to reschedule its foreign debt.
The deficit is believed by western experts to be heading towards 17 per cent
on present trends.
The agreement also commits the government to reduce the monthly inflation
rate, presently estimated at 20 per cent, to no more than 10 per cent by the
end of the year. Government subsidies including spending on state
procurement of grain and fuel are also to be limited.
The conditions attached to the Dollars 1bn deal were finalised after a
lightning visit to Moscow at the weekend by Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's
managing director.
He managed to rescue negotiations which had all but broken down between the
government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, and IMF experts on
such issues as the raising of energy prices and the size of the permitted
budget deficit.
'I think Mr Camdessus was rung up not just by Gaidar but by other heads of
government,' Mr Shokhin said, referring to pressure by G7 leaders for the
two sides to reach an agreement before the G7's meeting with President Boris
Yeltsin in Munich tomorrow.
In Munich last night, Mr Camdessus spelt out what other conditions had been
agreed: a single rouble exchange rate, strengthened fiscal policy,
maintaining tight constraints on monetary policy, and continuing structural
reforms.
In particular, he mentioned land reform, bankruptcy legislation and an
accelerated privatisation programme as critical to the process.
'We decided that if all that were put in place, we would extend our
financial support,' he said. He rejected suggestions that the Fund was
prepared to relax its traditional conditionality. 'The IMF does not extend
credits without conditions,' he said. 'We need a package of reasonable
measures to be able to extend our support.'
The short-term programme to which the Dollars 1bn is tied represents the
first stage in a three-step approach for releasing Dollars 24bn promised by
the west to support Russia's market reforms.
The second step, on which talks will begin this month, is to reach agreement
on a full IMF standby programme. This would unblock further fund resources
and western credits for Russia.
Mr Camdessus said this should be finalised by October. It would depend on an
agreement on future co-operation in the rouble zone, and 'clean
arrangements' for all those former Soviet republics wishing to leave the
zone.
The third stage relates to a Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise the rouble as
part of plans to turn it into a partially convertible currency. Mr Shokhin
said Russia would only be ready to take receipt of this fund at the end of
the year or the beginning of 1993. 'We know quite well we are not yet ready
for stabilisation,' he said.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (40): Training courses, time well
spent - Consultant's Viewpoint / For patient trainees, most computer
training courses offer big benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS a freelance consultant, I do not often have the opportunity to attend
training courses. Time is precious, and I find it more efficient to train
myself whenever possible.
Since I also, on occasions, present courses, I am more accustomed to giving
than to receiving - so it was a rare luxury to be invited to attend the
training course on Recital given by Richfords Computer Services. The company
provides 'hands-on' training on many different database products, and on
programming in 'C'.
They are located in the South Bank Technopark, at London's Elephant and
Castle area. At this course, each of the attendees was seated in front of a
terminal, which is connected to a Unix machine.
I had reviewed and used the product in an earlier version. It is one of the
'xBase' family of database management-cum-programming languages. I have some
recent experience of the excellent Foxpro product, so understand the
principles. Recital is unique in being available under many versions of Unix
and Dec's VMS.
It has some differences from the other xBase products - additions which make
it unique, such as its data dictionary.
We were led through a rather slow introduction - slow for me and two of the
other three, but the fourth had less experience, so the course was naturally
run at his pace. But this was no great disadvantage, because I was able to
play around with the machine, exploring both Recital and Unix, which I had
not used for about a year.
This led to an embarrassing moment, when I managed to freeze my terminal
whilst trying out one of the games I had found - and I couldn't remember how
to clear the problem. Unfortunately, neither could the instructor, and his
only recourse was to restart the whole system.
When I stupidly did the same the next day, I had remembered how to sort it
out, but I still had to ask for his help.
The course was accompanied by a very competent manual. This covered each
topic, both giving practical padding to the instructor, and amplifying what
was being said.
The instructor, Neil Blakemore, was suitably knowledgeable, and efficiently
led us through the examples. As a trainer you always have a dilemma. Do you
assume the attendees have read the page you have pointed them to, or do you
read it to them?
I usually try to paraphrase its content, so that it does not sound as if I
am teaching by rote. Neil Blakemore did this nearly every time, but very
occasionally inspiration would fail him and he would fall back on reading
the page back to us.
The advantage of having a terminal in front of you in such a course is that
you can explore subjects at your own pace, once you have finished the set
sections.
I was unable to attend the last day, but was anxious to try out some
programming, and was pleased to be able, during the lunch hours, to mess
around and do some of the examples from the last day's notes. I also have
the manual, and can lead myself through the rest of the course on my own
machine. Incidentally, Richfords provided a very adequate sandwich lunch.
I've been on courses where this is not provided: the attendees wander off to
the local hostelry, and then come back late and sleep the afternoon away.
But by providing food, you can control this tendency. You can also give
students the chance to explore the system, catch up with parts they may have
missed or misunderstood.
Some observers may arge that time spent on courses is not always well spent
 -particularly when you have a comprehensive set of notes, so that you can
often teach yourself perfectly adequately. However, for more patient
students, most courses have great value. You are led along at a sensible
pace, uninterrupted by telephone and colleagues. You have the attention of a
person with expertise in the subject who can answer your questions, without
you having to go to the manual. Moreover, his answers will be more focussed
and comprehensive.
My main reason for attending this course was to prepare myself for some work
in Recital. I believe that it achieved its aim. I now know my way round the
system, and have some notes to help me to explore it further.
THE NEXT ISSUE of Software at Work will appear on September 11, 1992.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (39): GUIs bring training
advantages - Impact of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) / Much of the pain
of learning basic computer skills is removed with graphical user interfaces.
They also reduce the learning curve on training staff for new applications
software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GRAPH below shows the dramatic impact of graphical users interfaces
(GUIs) on the learning curve for new computer applications.
It was first published by Apple Computer a couple of years ago to highlight
one of the advantages of the Macintosh personal computer and its innovative
GUI software. But following the success of Microsoft Windows, the GUI for
IBM-compatible personal computers, the graph has a much wider relevance.
It shows that the learning curve for a user getting to know their first
application is steep - as one would expect. But when users move on to a new
application, the curve is shallower - because they are able to transfer
knowledge of one application to another.
The skills they have learned in a word processor - like saving a file or
re-formatting text - can be used in the same way in a spreadsheet or a
desktop publishing package. This is a direct result of the use of standard
GUIs and the influence they have brought to bear on applications software
developers. By their very nature GUIs are easier to use than previous
interfaces. And they force developers to use standard methods of doing
things, which works to the benefit of the user.
The basic controls for all software applications are the same in a GUI
environment - similar to the way that controls on a 35mm camera or a motor
vehicle are consistent across different manufacturer's products.
This has significant implications for training - particularly in the area of
basic IT skills training. In the future, GUIs will help to enforce standards
across applications and make both the users' and the trainers' job much
easier. Attention can be focussed on the application, rather than on the
demands of the technology.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (38): Sceptics persuaded by
careful training - Case Study / Northern Electric was faced with complex
training problems when it equipped its sales force with laptop computers.
But a carefully designed training programme brought success and helped it to
keep its experienced sales staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
NORTHERN ELECTRIC, the northern UK power utility, decided to use IT to
support its sales and marketing operations following privatisation. It
wanted systems which could back up its sales force with up-to-date customer
information and capture data for market research purposes.
Training the sales force to use the technology effectively was crucial to
the project's success - especially given the nature of the established sales
force and the change in Northern Electric's business.
The hub of the sales and marketing system is a large ICL mainframe which
administers a database of Northern Electric's customers - covering domestic,
commercial and industrial. The mainframe uses an Ingres database management
package to handle the data and act as a 'server' to smaller computers at the
various regional offices.
'The system contains a complete model of the sales and mark eting
life-cycle,' explains Tim Crick, the project manager at Northern Electric.
'We can use it to find market opportunities - for things like direct mail
shots or for placing advertising.'
The front-end of the system relies on the sales force equipped with laptop
computers. Each night the laptops are connected to the electricity supply
and the telephone system and 're-charged.' The mains re-charges the
batteries and the telephone line transmits customer data for future sales
visits from the regional offices.
The laptops also contain software to work out sales quotations for central
heating systems and other products - as well as taking orders from
customers. The orders are transmitted back to the regional office during the
overnight 're-charge.'
Northern Electric was faced with a complex problem when it came to training
the sales force. The wide range of age and experience - from bright
20-year-old novices to 60-year-old veterans - and the different levels of
computer awareness, led Northern Electric to use a multi-level approach.
'Our industry is going through great change after a long period of
stability. Some of our sales staff have worked the same way for many years
and we knew we had to change this - and the culture around it,' says Mr
Crick.
'We asked Kernel Training to help us design a programme which was selective
and could help everyone - and bring them all up to the same level of
competence.'
Kernel Training (now FI Training) specialises in training programmes for
custom-built applications software and had been used to help with previous
training projects at Northern Electric.
Tim Crick says that it was important to get users involved early in the
project: 'We began with a public relations exercise when we were actually
developing the system with a review group and a clear role for people from
the sales force right from the beginning.'
The next stage was to instruct the sales force in how to use the laptop
computers: 'We ran computer familiarisation courses for those with no
previous experience - how to turn the machine on, how to re-charge it,
things like that. And we gave them a machine to take home with packages that
they could explore for themselves.'
Tim Crick adds that 'a couple of games' were included in the package to
break novice users in gently.
The basic familiarisation phase was followed by workshop sessions on the
applications software and a role-playing 'dress-rehearsal.'
'We took the sales people to a show-house and went through a role-playing
exercise to let them see how it worked in a real sales situation,' he says.
By this stage, some of the sales force were ready to 'fly solo' - while
others needed more instruction and confidence building, says Mr Crick.
'It was more often a lack of confidence and seeing the laptop as an aid
which some staff found hard.'
The important lesson learned by Northern Electric is that the multi-level
approach has paid dividends. Not only is its sales force better equipped and
collecting important management information, it has built on its experience.
'We have managed to take everyone across so far and we are now in the final
stages. Even the hardened sceptics who said 'we will never use computers'
have been won over and see it as part of their sales pitch now,' adds Mr
Crick.

Software development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE delegates at a Nato conference in 1968 bequeathed to the computer
industry something far more valuable than any item of 1960s hardware. They
left a philosophy and a name: software engineering.
The chief concern at the conference was how should large scale software
systems be built in the 1960s? Significant projects of the day missed their
deadlines, sometimes by years, and they often failed to stay within budget.
The answer, said Nato, was software engineering, an array of development
technologies to make computer programming a true engineering discipline, no
longer a black art.
Two decades later, the real cost of developing software is still immense. By
1995, world-wide software development costs, growing at about 12 per cent a
year, are expected to top Dollars 450m.
Even small improvements in productivity can still significantly reduce
costs, especially in the area of large real-time systems, those used in
avionics and manufacturing systems, for instance.
With the emphasis firmly on engineering, rather than intuition, it is not
surprising that software developers have now become adept at devising and
using software tools to help them in their task.
These can be project management programs or relational database management
systems, sometimes known has fourth generation languages. However, many
programmers put too much emphasis on tools at the expense of the programming
methods which they support, methods such as SSADM and Yourden.
With greater software developments taking place on pan-European projects, it
is in the everyone's interest to talk the same development language, and to
this end a Euro-method has been on the table for years.
As usual, however, Euro-infighting has stalled any decision. Britain is
calling for more elements from the British method, SSADM, while France
prefers the chic of its method, Merise. As yet there is no sign of
compromise.
The most discussed formal programming style of recent months is
object-oriented programming which can be used to dived large programming
tasks into manageable chunks.
It can also 'hide' certain information, generating opaque software bases
that do not allow the user to see beyond them. A simplistic view of an
object-oriented environment would be Apple Macintosh's graphic user
interface, where users can move files and data around without knowing
exactly what or where the data really are.
Vendors are promoting object-oriented techniques fiercely and this in itself
may turn off some potential buyers, says Barry Daniels, head of consultancy
at the National Computing Centre's software engineering section: 'I think it
has suffered a lot of hype, but it's hype with a bit of substance behind
it.'
One of the reasons developers feel good about object-oriented techniques is
the news that IBM and Apple have committed Pounds 2bn to a joint venture,
Taligent, to develop Pink, Apple's previously proprietary object-oriented
environment.
Other vendors are working on object-oriented development systems, or
object-oriented interface builders, says Apple, which only attack one part
of the problem.
Next's Nextstop environment, for example, is object-based, but only deals
with a small part of the application developing the user interface.
'The Taligent system, however, is a whole new environment for developing
software but it will be 1995 and beyond before it achieves any critical mass
in the market,' says Steve Everhard, Apple's national and corporate
marketing manager. Some users might therefore see the venture as an attempt
to lock users into Apple or IBM product lines, for fear they will be barred
from taking advantage of future developments.
Mr Everhard disagrees - 'this is not a market-stalling activity. This is not
an architectural announcement that's intended to stifle the market. Quite
the opposite. What we're intending to do is give companies and users
confidence that they won't be excluded, on a technology standpoint, from
what we're doing in the future.'
Barry Daniels at the NCC sees the joint venture from a different
perspective: 'IBM put the PC on to the market place, but MS-Dos took over
from PC-Dos. In addition, OS/2 hasn't taken off and Microsoft's Windows 3 is
around. So IBM, corporately, hasn't got much to offer that competition. Then
it sees Apple being fairly successful in some markets and maybe that's the
answer: an alliance between the two.'
In other words, the deal with Apple is nothing more than a quick fix to keep
users tied to an IBM growth path.
Whatever the industry's view of the IBM-Apple venture, there is little doubt
that object-oriented programming will have a large part to play in software
development.
Oracle, the US relational database vendor, has launched object-oriented
extensions to its SQL tools. However, it felt reassurance was in order for
users attending the European Oracle Users Group in Cannes earlier this year.
'It is very important, as we move to object-oriented technology, that we do
not abandon our user base or the investments already made,' says Larry
Ellison, Oracle's president and chief executive.
Mr Ellison's point about not abandoning investments is sound, for the
investment in developing software is substantial: first, in acquiring the
tools and the hardware resources to use them, but also in training time.
Investment in a hotch potch of tools, no matter what the vendors say, is
wasteful and ineffective.
But as long as users listen, the hype will continue, because now, almost 25
years after the Nato conference that created software engineering, the
software crisis is still here. There is still a need for better tools,
techniques and methods and better education and training.
Barry Daniels places much of the blame on the software vendors: 'In a sense,
I am disillusioned. Everything gets hyped. People make far too many
promises, far too early and perhaps far too optimistic benefits from
relatively small advances.'
'That is really the frustration. It's a pity, but it does seem to be a fact
of life in the IT world.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (36): Tying the knot between
training and the needs of business - Analysis / Companies can choose from a
wide range of training options to support new software applications, ranging
from traditional 'blackboard-and-chalk' to advanced multimedia technology.
But increasingly the emphasis is on the end result, rather than on the way
it is achieved

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) has had an enormous impact on training and
education in the last decade. Computer-based training (CBT) packages for
personal computers have spread computer skills, techniques for creating
training material have improved and people are generally more receptive to
the idea of learning from a computer.
CBT has been especially effective in training novice users of personal
computers in basic skills. The art of 'wordprocessing,' or the skills
involved in designing a useful spreadsheet, can be presented in a simple
instruction package and easily absorbed by users. All popular software
packages nowadays come with several diskloads of CBT tutorials and a wealth
of instruction manuals and back-up material.
Despite these developments, the tried-and-tested training methods of the
past are still in wide use - particularly if users want to get the most out
of their 'home-grown' application systems or when they need to train non-IT
staff.
If CBT is used, it is used as part of comprehensive training package which
includes 'blackboard and chalk' sessions, self-study and workshop
discussions.
There is, it seems, still room for the human touch -and, if anything, the
need for good lecturers, tutors and teachers is as important as it ever was.
'CBT is great back-up - but it needs a dynamic person acting as a tutor to
help people get the most out of it,' says Rosalyn Stein, a director of
training specialist Stein-Hodgins.
'It is good for reinforcing what has been learned in lectures and workshops.
The technology is really just icing on the cake - a bit of multimedia or a
bit of animation helps - but it can't do the whole job.'
Stein-Hodgins devises tailor-made training programs for customers who use
Microsoft's Windows environment. Ms Stein goes on to say that the demand is
for 'customised training which fits in with wider business aims.
'We aim to get people productive with an application as quickly as possible.
It is not just training; it is making sure that the training is relevant to
the aims of the business,' explains Rosalyn Stein.
Richard Atkinson, head of FI Group's training subsidiary FI Training, takes
a similar view: 'We see CBT as offering a useful set of tools. But you must
see what the training needs are and develop a training programme which fits
them.'
Market research backs this up, pointing to greater emphasis on the
end-result of training, rather than on the method used to achieve it.
'There are clear indications within the marketplace that demand for training
is moving from technology in isolation towards a requirement for
consideration of commercial and strategic issues,' says the research group,
IDC, in its recent report on the UK IT training market.
Although revenues for IT training suppliers in the UK fell by three per cent
in 1991, IDC says there is a still a strong demand.
It also notes that most organisations look outside for their training needs.
The training demand varies from sector to sector. Central government is the
top consumer, with 87.9 per cent of the IDC sample using external training
services. About 80 per cent of financial institutions use external training,
and the mining and construction sector uses the least amount; only 58 per
cent.
IDC sees management training for IT staff as one of the key growth areas and
also notes a latent market for general IT appreciation for non-IT staff -
although it suggests that the recession will hold back growth in this area
in the short term.
More important are the observations that training must show a genuine
cost-benefit, and must be related to business needs. Users want to see
productivity gains and improved performance coming from their training
investments. IDC notes that training organisations will need to 'align
training with service products that meet demonstrable business need.'
This is especially true with training staff who are to use custom-built
software applications. These applications are often most likely to be the
basis of any strategic IT system. Training staff to use generic software -
like spreadsheet programs and wordprocessors - is much less demanding and
can be accommodated within CBT tutorials and self-study. But the specific
nature of custom-built applications requires specific training and, here,
the old methods prevail.
There are sound economic and eminently practical reasons for this.
Good CBT tutorials are costly to produce. So, if the investment is to be
worthwhile, a tutorial must have a large potential audience.
Most custom-built applications are used by only a small number of people -
which means that it is uneconomical to use CBT.
It follows, therefore, that training staff to use custom-built software
applications, demands custom-built training materials - which are cheaper to
produce with the traditional approach.
The obvious starting point for custom-built application training is, of
course, the application supplier. Users recognise that the builders of the
custom application system are in the best position to train those who are to
use it.
FI Group's decision to acquire Kernel Training last year was typical of the
gambits that service companies are using to get into the training business.
The FI Group is an established custom software developer and saw good
reasons to expand its training resources: 'Training has always been an
important part of the service industry. We saw that the primary route in to
it was through acquisition. And we wanted to take Kernel Training and expand
into a more general role within the FI Group,' says Mr Atkinson of FI
Training. Services suppliers are keen to exploit this useful 'add-on' market
and are, increasingly emphasising training as part of a full systems
integration service.
This market has also attracted established hardware manufacturers such as
ICL and Siemens Nixdorf.
Hardware builders have a long tradition of providing technical training to
customers. They are now looking for ways to extend their existing training
services into the applications area and have chosen CBT packages as one of
their tactics.
ICL recently signed the distribution rights for a multimedia authoring tool
called Authorware to support its training initiatives.
Nationwide Building Society is an early customer and is using the package to
create training materials for cheque-clearance procedures. Siemens Nixdorf
introduced its SITE CBT package earlier this year - with the aim of making
it easier for users to produce good-quality training materials for their
internal applications.
SITE can work across a range of different hardware - making it possible to
distribute training materials in the same way as the software itself. Even
more promising is the looming prospect of multimedia technology - which
seems destined to have its greatest initial impact in the training area.
Some users are taking the lead in the use of multimedia - but once again
within the context of a wider training strategy.
The Bradford and Bingley Building Society set up a training project back in
1990 which uses a Sony interactive video (IV) system to train its staff in a
variety of skills. The building society wanted to see a pay-back from the
system within two years and recently claimed to have achieved this. But
despite the cost-benefits from the IV system, it is still seen as only one
part of a much wider training strategy.
'Our training is a mix of media because each type of delivery has its
benefits. Disadvantages of IV occur if you try and use it for everything;
it's no good for a target audience of five people, for example,' says Philip
Hunter of Bradford and Bingley's training department. He goes on to say,
however, that it is not just cost savings which are driving users to look
for new training methods - 'we are saying that if we don't adopt these
alternative methods of training, we will have to recruit more staff in order
to cover our training needs. In fact, IV methods are sometimes the only way
that training can be done.'
This supports the view that successful training of staff in the use of new
software lies in combining traditional methods with advances in technology.
And as computer technology continues to improve and becomes easier to use,
the emphasis in training will shift from the technology to the application
and the demands of the business.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (34): Still a new market -
Groupware Products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH there are increasing numbers of software packages which are claimed
to be groupware products, this is still a relatively new market. Two of the
most innovative products in the UK are Lotus Notes and FCMC's Staffware,
writes Philip Manchester.
Lotus Notes has attracted significant support from large consultants such as
Arthur Andersen, Touche Ross and Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, all of which
are developing systems based on Lotus Notes. Customers include BP, General
Motors and Lloyds Bank.
Lotus Notes provides a groupware application environment for use in personal
computer networks. It contains the bones of groupware applications and
programming features which can be used to create customised applications. It
can be used for applications such as customer tracking, status reporting,
project management and what Lotus calls 'collaborative free-form
discussion.'
Although the roles of many corporate head offices are being devolved and
modified, more controls are nevertheless needed to ensure that decisions
which are made at various levels - ie closer to the customers - are not
eventually detrimental to other parts of the organisation, explains Winston
Muktarsingh of Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte.
'This requires controls on information-flows in very quick time. Lotus Notes
helps to facilitate this,' he adds.
Like most groupware products, Notes uses the client/server model of
computing which separates the 'front end' of an application from the 'back
end.'
The user or 'client' sees a screen with a graphical user interface (GUI)
similar to any other personal computer application. Under the covers, Notes
links to services such as database management systems and electronic mail
which are powered by other computers known as servers.
These servers can be located in the same office or across the network.
Lotus Notes can handle different data formats which are produced by other
software packages - processing documents and tagged image format files
(TIFF).
Notes works with both of the main PC networking systems - Novell's Netware
and OS/2 LAN manager.
Price: from Pounds 395.
Further enquiries: Lotus Development (UK), Lotus Park, The Causeway,
Staines, Middlesex, TW18 3AG. Tel. 0784 455445.
Staffware: this system can be used to set up 'workflow' procedures with
rules which can be applied to the flow of data. This can be something as
mundane as the procedures in an accounts department to complex quality
control procedures manufacturing.
Like Lotus Notes, Staffware can be used with existing software such as
databases and wordprocessing programs or complete office automation systems.
The Staffware rule structure accommodates deadlines to ensure that
procedures are completed by staff using the system. Staffware will send
reminders if deadlines are missed. The system also keeps track of progress,
giving management an up-to-date 'audit' of the system and the current status
of specific procedures.
Staffware runs under the Unix and Xenix operating systems.
British Telecom uses Staffware to automate its buying procedures, and also
as an electronic suggestion box. The US Veterans' Administration uses
Staffware for document tracking.
Staffware is also sold by ICL under the name Powerflow, and by Unisys under
the name Office Procedures.
Last September, FCMC signed up IBM UK to combine Staffware with the Uniplex
office automation system which is sold under the name Application Pack (AP)
6000, an office automation package for IBM's RS/6000 workstation.
Price: from Pounds 750 per workstation.
Further enquiries: FCMC, 46 Chagford Street, London NW1 6EB. Telephone: 071
262 1021.
Other products: Beyond Mail - from European Software Products (ESP) in the
UK. Price from Pounds 750 for up to 10 users. ESP, 36 King Street,
Maidenhead, Berks. SL6 1EF. Telephone 0628 23453.
Microsoft Mail 3.0 - from Microsoft, price Pounds 485. Details from
Microsoft's Customer Response Centre, telephone 0734 500741.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (35): Electronic mail turns into
groupware - Technology Update
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the main thrusts into groupware has come from suppliers of electronic
mail systems. The latest version of Microsoft Mail, version 3.0, is being
promoted as a groupware product and WordPerfect has upgraded its Office Mail
package to embrace groupware features.
The most interesting of these electronic mail products, however, is the
recently-introduced Beyond Mail package from US software developer, Beyond.
Beyond Mail evolved from a research project at the Massachussetts Institute
of Technology (MIT). The project aimed to add 'intelligence' to electronic
mail systems by introducing rules for processing messages and help users by
'filtering' out inappropriate ones.
'As electronic mail networks grow, the number of messages flying around the
system causes information-overload,' explains Peter Sketch, advanced product
manager at ESP, Beyond's UK distributor.
'Beyond Mail gives you the power to process electronic messages with sets of
rules which can be turned on and off, according to your needs,' he explains.
The rules can be created by users with an easy-to-use Windows-type front end
(a Microsoft Windows version will be available later this year). Rules can
be used to filter out mail, re-route it or give it a priority and can be
based on a combination of criteria. A rule might be used, for example, to
filter mail from a specific source and give it higher priority. Another rule
might cause the text of the message to be searched for certain key words.
'You can get Beyond Mail to work for you while you are away from your desk,'
explains Peter Sketch.
'As well as handling messages, rules can invoke other applications. Data
might come in the form of a spreadsheet or a database. You can build a rule
to re-format it or update an existing database.'
Beyond Mail provides a 'folder' or directory structure for filing messages,
including what Mr Sketch describes as a 'tickler' file for date-specific
messages: 'You can program Beyond Mail to route certain messages to this
file so that they come up on a particular date automatically.'
Beyond Mail works on all MS/DOS personal computers and supports gateways
into the X400 and X25 networking standards.
In addition, it can link to other MS/DOS applications programs.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (33):  The promise of truly
integrated systems - Analysis / Spreading the productivity advantages of
personal computing  across an enterprise demands a new approach to
applications software. Groupware offers a promising way forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE drive for productivity has always been one of the main justifications
for the use of information technology. The first computer systems were used
to speed up mundane clerical tasks like the calculation of the company
payroll and issuing sales invoices.
In the last decade, personal computers have helped to boost personal
productivity. It ought to be a simple task to spread these personal
productivity gains to an entire business enterprise: install a network,
connect the personal computers to it and watch efficiency increase and costs
fall.
Unfortunately, it is not that simple.
The physical connection of personal computers to a corporate network is not
enough in itself to bring productivity gains. A multi-level software
infrastructure is also needed. Network management software, communications
software and usable 'front end' software - such as graphical user interfaces
 -must be in place before the network can be exploited fully.
There is also a need for a different type of applications software. The
traditional approach to personal applications is inadequate because it
assumes that there is only one user of the system, working in isolation. If
networks of personal computers are to be used effectively by groups of
people, the applications software must be able to cope with the interactions
between users and control them.
This is where groupware comes in. Groupware is an extra level of
applications software which aims to create genuine interaction between
people through a computer network.
'The personal computer has given people individual power, but stand-alone
personal computers are not aimed at getting people to work together - even
if you put them on to a network,' says John Matthews, a consultant at
management consultancy, Infact.
'Groupware should do this - but it needs something more. You have to give
people an incentive to use the technology properly. The telephone is a
primitive groupware tool - some use it well and some use it badly,' he adds.
Mr Matthews sees the growth in the use of groupware as a management issue -
a view shared by others: 'Groupware is a bit like a mirror - an awful lot of
work in an organisation is already group-oriented. Most of the technology is
available - so the issue is a management one, rather than a technical one,'
says Michael Skok, chairman of European Software Publishing (ESP), UK
distributor of the Beyond Mail groupware package.
'It is a simple evolutionary step from electronic mail. Instead of just
sending messages, you can share all sorts of information across the network.
You can put some intelligence into the system and begin to automate workflow
and office procedures,' he continues.
The idea of groupware has its roots in research into computer-supported
co-operative work (CSCW) in the US, dating back to the 1960s.
Among others, Douglas Engelbart (the originator of the ubiquitous 'mouse'
pointer) and his team at the Stanford Research Institute carried out
pioneering work in CSCW with a system called On-Line System (NLS).
This system was designed to support a team of people drawn from different
disciplines and the software included a set of core tools such as a text
editor, graphics programs and data managers.
The research on NLS later influenced the work at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Centre (PARC) which led eventually to the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft
Windows.
Engelbart's original aim was to 'augment individuals doing knowledge work.'
But as networking became available, NLS was extended to support groups of
workers who could communicate via the network - making it the first
groupware.
NLS let researchers work together on a project and develop ideas by
co-operating with each other through the system.
This has been the aim of 'office automation' systems for many years and it
could be argued that groupware is just another name for an old idea. Office
automation systems such as IBM's Officevision and DEC's All-in-one package
provide many of the features that would be expected in a groupware product -
including electronic mail, file-sharing and personal computing facilities.
But although traditional office automation systems and groupware share many
similar features, true groupware goes much further than just providing an
application environment within a network. It must enable co-operation
between staff and extend the productivity gains from the desktop personal
computer to the whole enterprise.
'The problem with office automation systems is that there is a tendency for
people not to use them - they can be a distraction because people have to
learn all sorts of new skills,' says John Matthews of Infact.
'But with some of the groupware products, a lot of the problems are
overcome. A product like Filenet, for example, provides automated access to
mainframe resources - getting rid of what has been somewhat of a burden for
users who do not know the complexities of logging on to these systems.'
In its most advanced form, groupware can be used to co-ordinate an entire
product design operation - with the software providing links between
marketeers and designers, production engineers and cost-accountants. The
theory is that this will speed up the process of bringing a new product to
market and give a company a competitive edge.
This is a far cry from traditional office automation systems and has only
been made possible because of changes in the technology infrastructure.
The emergence of 'intelligent' buildings, which are wired up for networks,
coupled with advanced workstations which can handle different types of data,
has created the physical environment to make modern groupware possible.
Advances in software have also contributed to the infrastructure.
Graphical user interfaces such as Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows
have made it easier for users to access and manipulate information on a
personal computer. Improved networking and communications software, based on
accepted 'open systems' standards, has let different types of computers
'talk' to each other.
Innovative approaches to the design of computer systems - often referred to
as the 'architecture' - have also helped. The client/server approach - where
the system is separated into components which either use or offer services
encapsulated in a 'black box' - lends itself to groupware applications. The
increasingly-popular object-oriented design approach - which builds on the
client/server model - also offers an excellent foundation for groupware.
Modern software environments can also provide mechanisms to link data across
programs and databases. Microsoft Windows, for example, includes a feature
called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). This enables up-to-date data from one
source to be connected to another. So a word processing document can include
a reference to a spreadsheet and, through DDE, ensure that it is kept
up-to-date. Any changes in the spreadsheet will be reflected in the document
automatically.
But groupware applications can go much further. They can also control the
flow of work through a company or a project.
Practical examples include, say, the fulfilment of an insurance policy or a
loan application. Both tasks are subject to procedures which have been laid
down by the company, involve a number of staff and require different levels
of authorisation.
A full groupware package, like FCMC's Staffware or Lotus Notes, can be used
to devise the rules to control the flow of the documentation through a
system and ensure that all of the procedures are correctly executed. The
groupware package can channel the documentation to the right person at the
right time and prompt staff to carry out further action.
Most documents produced in business spend more time in people's 'in' trays,
awaiting approval, than they spend actually being worked on, observes David
Carew-Jones of Uniplex, based in the UK, and one of the world's leading
vendors of Unix-based office systems.
The electronic mail capabilities of Uniplex will distribute complex compound
documents anywhere in the world, instantly, to any number of people for
approval, notification and editing - 'the result is a faster turn-round for
the creation of documents which require input or approval of more than one
person,' says Mr Carew-Jones.
Groupware means a fundamental change in the use of information technology in
business and creates a different corporate culture which is less geared to
the individual and more directed at the enterprise as a whole. It follows
that such systems emphasise co-operation in place of competition.
The depth of this change means that groupware must be introduced into an
organisation very carefully. There are two approaches, according to Michael
Skok of ESP: 'You can use groupware for specific projects or you can use it
for the whole enterprise. But we recommend starting with simple tasks and
evolving slowly. If you go too far - say with an enterprise-wide system - it
is too much of a revolution.'
The project approach, says Michael Skok, is the way that most companies will
take their first steps into groupware: 'Project teams probably already have
natural ways of working which mean sharing data and resources. Groups of
about six to eight people seem to work well.'
John Matthews of Infact notes that the state of most companies' technology
infrastructure will dictate the project-oriented approach anyway: 'It is
going to be limited to a single department at the moment because most of the
products are based on a single technology - such as Unix or OS/2. If you
want to get into groupware which cuts across departments, you will usually
have to deal with more than one technology,' he explains.
'There is also likely to be some resistance because of the control aspects
of groupware. We have looked at systems in Germany and Scandinavia, where
the use of groupware is more advanced, and found evidence of this.'
Like all technological progressions, the introduction of groupware into an
organisation must carry the users with it. They must be able to see the
benefits to themselves and to their companies so that they will be
encouraged to make it work.
After a decade of fragmentation caused by the spread of personal computing
throughout industry and commerce, groupware offers the promise of truly
integrated systems which combine the benefits of personal productivity and
improvements in corporate efficiency.
Groupware could be the basis of a revolution in the use of information
technology which is as significant as the one caused by personal computers.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (29): Price quotations with -
Case Study / Cambridge Lee, Commodity Company just three keystrokes /
Installation success after initial cost shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL

<TEXT>
EVEN IF a specific cost figure is quoted for a project, unexpected price
increases can occur.
If you are lucky, these will surface early on, before too much work has been
done. If not, you may find yourself with a partially written system, and a
bill for its completion well in excess of your original budget, writes
Michael Powell.
Cambridge Lee, of West Byfleet, is an importer and distributor of
commodities, such as non-ferrous metals and copper tubing. It uses the
Systems Union SunAccount package on its Novell networked machines.
The company needed a quotations system to tie in with the SunAccount system,
which was already in use. A software supplier which had quoted Pounds 25,000
for the project was chosen. However, after four days' work, the quote was
increased to Pounds 100,000. Although this was reduced in negotiation with
the supplier's sales department, the figure was still more than Pounds
50,000, so the supplier was abandoned.
Finance director David Mulholland had dealt with the replacement software
house, Sapphire, in Europe - 'they had done a very good job. They quoted
Pounds 20,000 for this project. A couple of subsequent additions cost
another Pounds 4,000.'
The development language proposed was DataEase, a relational database
product, which, according to its suppliers, DataEase UK, enjoys the biggest
market share in the UK, with 250,000 users, and is used by 80 per cent of
top companies. DataEase UK and Sapphire were de-merged at the end of 1991,
Sapphire retaining its position as an authorised consultancy for DataEase.
Cambridge Lee's business involves a lot of telephone sales. Every contact
entails quotation and negotiation of price.
'The system brings up a quotation in three keystrokes,' says Mr Mulholland.
'This data is saved and the customer's history updated. If the quotation is
accepted, it becomes a booking.'
At this point, the customer will specify the actual quantities and make-up
of the order. This information is passed to Cambridge Lee's transport
manager, who arranges transport instructions by modem link. The final data
is then exported to the Sun Accounts system, where invoices are generated.
The development of the DataEase system took 55 man-days and is described by
Mr Mulholland as 'quite sophisticated . . .it involves quotations
management, automatic pricing, and movements.'
One of the company's staff who is familiar with DataEase adds reports to the
system but does not make major changes. The system is stable, so there is
little need for further help from its supplier. Although Cambridge Lee has a
maintenance contract with Sapphire (at a rate of 10 per cent of contract
value), David Mulholland sees little need for support.
'The person who wrote the system was our support, but after the first few
weeks there was little need to ask Sapphire for any kind of advice. Their
hotline people aren't familiar with our system, so they can't always help
anyway if we do have a problem.'
The outcome for Cambridge Lee has been a successful system. However, had the
company not been warned very early on of the proposed cost over-run, it
could have been much less fortunate. Many companies have found themselves
backed into a corner, unable to avoid increased charges for the completion
of vital systems, or to go elsewhere for a lower price.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (27): Improved care for industry
members - Case Study / British Paper and Board / When faced with the task of
updating its data-handling methods, the paper industry's trade group decided
on a system already used by other similar associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL

<TEXT>
NOT ALL bespoke developments are enormous, involving huge investments in
software, hardware and personnel. More modest projects can still yield
important benefits for their users.
The British Paper and Board Federation is a trade body which was established
more than 100 years ago to represent the interests of paper and board
manufacturers throughout the UK. It provides members with advice on
industrial relations, health and safety, and energy, lobbies the Government,
provides training, and produces industry statistics.
It used a Xionics personal computer running under the CP/M operating system
for its membership data, and wanted to upgrade this. Systems manager Eric
Kilby says: 'Our existing system was fairly old and no longer capable of
handling our work load.' The organisation decided a Unix-based system was
needed, offering full office automation.
British Paper and Board was open-minded in its choice, looking at five
possible systems over two years. The favoured hardware was an IBM RS/6000 or
a Wyse 7000 machine.
Mr Kilby had come across the software house, Care Business Solutions, at an
exhibition some years before the choice was made, and he remembered that
Care specialised in software dealing with trade associations. The federation
had already decided to use the Uniplex office automation package, because it
is considered an industry standard, well-known to many users. Any software
chosen would need to interact with that.
Care proposed a system based on the Empress database management system to
hold the federation's mailing data, and provide an information system.
Care developed a system for the Wyse 7000 computer which could be run under
Uniplex, appearing to the user as part of that product and called from its
menus. The system holds around 2,000 names and addresses (including 650
Members of Parliament) and is an adaptation of Care's standard set of
modules for trade associations.
The federation has no in-house development department, but Mr Kilby, who has
a background in statistics and economics, has been trained in Empress and
will do further development if necessary. Meanwhile, support continues to
come from Care, with regular contact each week. If any problems arise, they
can be corrected via a modem link between the two organisations.
At present the federation uses the Paradox product on personal computers for
local database needs and for producing reports, but users will be converted
to Empress and the centralised package in due course - 'all information is
held by individuals, using Paradox, but has common data. We can improve our
efficiency and information gathering by centralising it,' Mr Kilby argues.
Other allied bodies for which the federation produces figures, including the
Recycling Information Centre and the Pulp and Paper Information Centre, have
access to the federation's membership information.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (26): A business-led approach to
performance improvement - Case Study / Welsh Water / The best way forward,
the company's IT managers decided, was to look at what information was
needed by individuals in order to do their jobs effectively
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEFORE privatisation, Welsh Water was working at improving its
information systems strategy. An approach, known as IBIS (Independent
Business Information System) was developed as early as 1984 to provide an
overall development framework, writes Michael Powell.
Welsh Water has published a brochure describing IBIS. Its mission is to
promote and facilitate improvements in Welsh Water's performance by the
introduction of integrated business information systems - 'we wanted an
overall framework to define how we do systems in Welsh Water,' says group
information technology manager, Jeff Maynard.
'Our basic principle was that it should be business-led, not technology-led.
We assembled a group of forward-looking IT managers to look at what
information is needed to run sections, and we found that there were some
good developments, in pockets throughout the organisation.' The group
decided to look not at IT, but at what people needed to be able to do their
jobs.
The resulting systems, developed over the past six years, comprise around 25
modules, which integrate together, consisting of both package and bespoke
software - 'the initiative has taken us through privatisation,' says Mr
Maynard. 'Senior managers are business-focused and driven, and the IT
department now produces the goods they require. You can't extract
information systems from the rest of the organisation: the key to all our
systems is that the information being reported is consistent right through
the company. We've developed quite a bit of software over the last few
years, and we must make it available to line managers - to help them through
the maze of data.'
The company uses traditional organisation and methods approaches to look at
business processes and make them relevant to business managers. For
instance, if a customer needs a new connection, it must access and update
information all along the line, such as the physical position of the mains,
the allocation of staff, the withdrawal of items from stock, and billing the
customer.
One system developed by the company is the geographical information system
(GIS). This was developed on Intergraph workstations, using that company's
toolkit. This enables software to be built, tailored to the customer's
needs, in which rules are set up to define such things as the size and
fittings needed to make a connection. It interfaces with customer-billing,
service, telemetry and general financial systems.
'We have several thousand kilometres of mains and sewers, so data-capture is
significant,' says Mr Maynard.
Working with digitised Ordnance Survey maps, the company records the
position of its pipework.
Against this must be recorded reports of the condition of mains, and the
materials from which they are built (many of the services are more than 100
years old), and the points of connection.
'This can help to improve our understanding of the way the whole network
links together,' he says.
Welsh Water's approach to development is to ensure that all systems come
under a common integrated umbrella. One of the main aims of this integration
is to ensure that a piece of data needs only to be entered at one point in
the overall system. Bespoke systems are developed where necessary alongside
packages - 'glued together' as necessary to make a consistent whole.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (28): Golfers tee up for computer
guidance - Case Study / Bettagolf/LSI / An ambitious golf products company
hopes it has hit a hole-in-one with a software package to help record and
analyse shots.
</DATE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL

<TEXT>
GOLF CAN BE a lifetime obsession: its devotees spend many hours playing and
analysing their game, endeavouring to improve their performance. Bettagolf
Products provides tools for golfers, enabling them to record, during the
game, which clubs they used, and where, the weather conditions and the shape
and contours of the greens. The results help them to analyse and improve
their game.
These products come in the form of booklets: the Scorecard, the Analyser and
the Greenmachine, which are sold through Professional Golfers Association
(PGA) outlets. Bettagolf's managing director, Alan Wooley, reckons that
there are around 2,000 people using the system, since the company's launch
in November 1991, with each booklet selling for Pounds 5.99.
Golf is a very popular among businessmen, and a lubricant to the oils of
commerce in many parts of the world. In Japan, for example, it is reckoned
that 23m people play. A version of the system running on a PC should,
therefore, attract a lot of interest when it goes on the market shortly.
Development of the software (called Pro-Am Plus) was undertaken by Logical
Systems International (LSI), a software house specialising in development of
database developments - 'we looked at two other houses,' says Alan Wooley,
'but LSI's professionalism and reputation swung it.'
The product had to be able to run on industry standard PCs, and the Foxpro
database package was chosen as the development tool. This allows complete
systems to be developed very easily, using screen-based tools. LSI offered a
fixed price contract, and produced a project plan for the development -
'some software houses promise the earth but don't deliver. LSI kept us fully
informed and all our targets were met. They are a very good professional
outfit,' says Mr Wooley. 'Some extras were added to the product as we went
along, at no extra charge.' The project lasted for around four months: LSI
also wrote product manuals.
Bettagolf has no in-house development resources. It plans to use LSI to
perform any enhancements or maintenance to the product which may be needed
at time and materials rates. Pro-Am Plus is designed to be simple to use,
suitable even for those who have not operated a computer before. On-line
help facilities are available, even though these were not originally
specified.
'To say it is user friendly is an understatement' says Mr Wooley. 'It tells
you what you are doing at the bottom of the screen all the time.'
The software is a commodity item which will sell at Pounds 24.99. At that
price the product must be usable without reference to its supplier, and must
have rock solid reliability.
The use of an outside company for the development of such a system may be
thought to be somewhat dangerous. If problems arise, it may cost a lot of
money to have them resolved.
It would be impractical, however, for a start-up company like Bettagolf to
employ the number of people needed for such a development - the team peaked
at six people. As long as the developer is competent, using an outside
consultant makes a lot of sense.
The product is now reaching the market. Only time will tell how successful
it is; Alan Wooley, however, is confident - 'we wanted it to be as simple to
use as the manual system, and LSI did that for us.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (23): Excellent management -
Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'EIGHT software houses - they must be insane.' That was my first response to
hearing about Lloyds Bank. However, I was very impressed by how well Peter
Dailey had made it work. The project ran to time and to budget.
By managing the external resources so well, Lloyds has retained complete
control of all the important facets. The IT staff are familiar both with the
components and the inter-relationships.
The system has become an enabling technology. Although it started as a
secure funds transfer mechanism, it can be extended to a wide range of
transactions. The bank finds itself with a potential electronic mail system,
an electronic data interchange network, and so on. The inherent security is
a distinct advantage over the traditional solutions in these areas.
The key points from this case study are:
Excellent management. What could have been a nightmare has been a great
success.
Awareness that developing a technology can both meet a particular need and
provide a base for future services.
Recognition that the job is not finished when the customer receives the
software. Support, training and an upgrade strategy are all vital for
success.

THE LLOYDSLINK system uses personal computers in customers' offices linked
to the central switching system, the Logica Transaction Director, based on
fault-tolerant computers from Tandem.
The central hardware consists of three processors which work together and
back each other up. Lloyds further ensures fault tolerance by having a
duplicate stand-by system at another site.
The central system handles messages and links to other services such as the
Chaps clearing system.
LloydsLink facilities available to customers through their personal
computers include balance reporting; statement reporting, with details of
sterling and foreign currency transactions; transfers between Lloyds
accounts; and initiation of sterling payments through the national Chaps or
Bacs services, or through Lloyds, including salary payments to individuals.
Links from the switching system to the external NDC bank network service
enable customers to look at their accounts held in other banks.
Lloyds has not revealed the total cost.
Almost 70 per cent of expenditure has been on equipment and software
developed externally. At the peak, there were 150 people on the project,
including two dozen from Lloyds.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (20): Meeting corporate desktop
banking demands - Case Study / Lloyds Bank / Lloyds Bank seemed to be asking
for trouble when it contracted as many as eight companies to work on a new
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK used eight companies when it developed its LloydsLink service to
enable corporate customers to conduct banking business through their own
personal computers. This surprised even the software companies themselves,
which were well used to collaborating with others on big projects.
The multi-million-pound LloydsLink project was born in 1989. During the
1980s, corporate banking and treasury, one of six business units, had been
offering balance and statement information to corporate customers through a
computer bureau, ADP. Banks supplied data on computer tapes to the bureau
and customers could link to its system to retrieve information.
When ADP withdrew the service Lloyds installed ACI's Base24 system to offer
the information facilities directly to customers itself.
That was in 1988, just as the idea of corporate banking through desk-top
workstations was starting to take off. Indeed, the number of Lloyds
customers using the ACI system more than doubled - and now they were also
asking for extra services, especially payment facilities.
In 1989 a team was put together consisting of some of the corporate banking
and treasury unit's computing staff and people from electronic services
marketing. They looked at what customers were demanding and designed the
proposed LloydsLink system. It was to be based on a central switching
system, which would handle messages from customers and run payments
software; customers would use their own personal computers running software
and security facilities supplied by Lloyds.
'We decided an established package was the best way forward for the switch,
because of our very aggressive timescales,' says Mr Peter Dailey, head of
corporate banking systems. 'This is a fiercely competitive market and we
wanted to have the system ready in 12 to 18 months.'
The switching system was to be based on a fault-tolerant computer which
could keep running even if a fault occurred. Mr Dailey says this, and top
security, were the two starting points for the project, because of the
high-value transactions that the service would be handling.
The two main suppliers of fault-tolerant computers are US companies, Tandem
and Stratus, so Lloyds asked them for lists of systems companies which
specialised in their machines.
'We came up with 12 possible suppliers of switching systems, from two-man
outfits upwards,' says Mr Dailey. 'The small suppliers might have reliable
products, but we weren't sure of their long-term resilience as companies.'
The shortlist of three companies with working systems consisted of Logica,
Data Sciences (then part of Thorn EMI) and a smaller software house, CBC.
'We did exhaustive testing of the three products, because this was going to
be the core of the whole system,' Mr Dailey says. 'It was a close thing but
we chose Logica, even though it wasn't the cheapest. The Logica Transaction
Director was well-established and we had already had a long relationship
with the company, which provides Chaps systems to all the major banks. We
knew it had experience in this field.'
Logica also won a contract to develop some of the electronic funds transfer
software running on the switching computer. Mr Dailey estimates that Logica
did 60 per cent of the total work.
There were consolation prizes for CBC and especially Data Sciences. CBC was
given the job of developing software to manage the passing of data to
customers for cash management: the balance and statement reporting
facilities. Data Sciences got the contract to develop all the software for
the customer end of the service.
In addition, Admiral was chosen to work with Logica on the electronic funds
transfer software, largely because it was familiar with a database
management system which had recently been launched by Tandem, manufacturer
of the computer at the heart of the switching system.
Racal was picked to provide certain security features on the switch and
Thyron Drives for its smartcard products: smartcards are the size of credit
cards but can contain microprocessors and can store programs and data. They
are typically used in fields ranging from banking to medical care to
identify the holders and store information about them.
US company AT&amp;T Istel was selected as the network services supplier, partly
because it had handled networking for the original ADP cash management
service.
Finally BIS, originally a big UK computing services company but now part of
US telecommunications specialist Nynex, was contracted to do some quality
assurance.
'We sent out one tender document outlining the entire system and asked
companies to show us their skills in the various areas,' Peter Dailey says.
'Some companies bid for everything; others offered skills in particular
fields. Logica, for example, did not bid for the personal computer work.'
Lloyds' corporate banking systems unit acted as prime contractor. 'It was
unusual for Lloyds to project-manage such a big job,' says Mr Dailey.
Even Logica was surprised at the arrangement - 'we get projects with two or
three sub-contractors but this was unusual,' says manager Mr Peter Manly.
Mr Dailey continues: 'We knew Logica could have managed the whole project
and we might have saved ourselves some heartache and got going quicker if
we'd given the entire contract to one company. But we wanted to take over
and run the system ourselves at the end, so we needed to be close to the
development work and understand the system.'
Mr Manly at Logica says his company would have preferred the commercial
benefit of having the whole project, but he admits: 'In reality, we all
perform better if we have competition. Commercial pressures kept us on our
toes.'
Lloyds appointed project managers to the various areas of work and they
worked closely with the contractors' project managers. 'We broke the project
into application areas, so we managed application development rather than
software houses,' Mr Dailey says.
This arrangement helped Lloyds to get parts of the service running quite
quickly. 'We were under pressure to get services out to defend and win
market share,' Mr Dailey says. 'We therefore broke it up into chunks, which
were delivered in April and in the autumn, instead of taking the black-box
approach, where you don't see anything until the entire job is finished.'
The contractors worked mainly on their own premises but there was regular
contact with Lloyds, usually at least once a day.
'Good communication was vital These were mainly big software companies, so
we knew they were quite capable of managing projects, and that they used
proper methodologies. This meant there was no need for us to chase them
around at that level. We had to rely on the companies' goodwill to work
together and they did so,' Mr Dailey says.
Mr Manly agrees: 'There was a lot of enthusiasm and esprit de corps at the
working level, with people working late nights and at weekends.'
The contractors did their own testing and quality assurance on their work
and Lloyds oversaw the integration testing, making sure the various pieces
of software worked together. Mr Dailey says the bank benefited from having
its own project managers deeply involved from the start.
The other benefit of that involvement, seen from the start, is that the
corporate banking systems team has been able to take over system
maintenance. 'We've built up our in-house team of programmers and analysts
who work for the project managers,' Mr Dailey says.
There is also a support operation for customers. Customers can generally set
up the system themselves on their own personal computers using a package of
instructions and program discs from Lloyds, depending on the combination of
facilities and levels of security they require. 'The software is complex but
what the customer sees is useable and designed to be foolproof,' Mr Dailey
says. Customers can telephone a helpdesk if they hit problems.
Demand for the services is reflected in the fact that the number of
LloydsLink customers is almost four times the number that used the original
ADP service, and they are already asking for extra services, including
electronic data interchange to exchange orders and invoices with other
Lloyds customers. Lloyds expects to move into this market by the end of the
year, posing competition to established electronic data interchange
specialists with a business message service which is virtually 100 per cent
secure.
'People have not tended to see orders as secure messages and are used to
using the post - but the trend towards just-in-time manufacturing means
ordering must be reliable or there is the risk of goods not arriving,' Mr
Dailey says.
As far as return on investment is concerned, Mr Dailey points out that the
switching system opens up opportunities for Lloyds to add extra services.
'For example, we hadn't even thought of electronic data interchange when we
started in 1989,' he says.
And he adds, 'We can't be without this sort of system these days. It would
be like asking people to bank with us if we didn't have self-service
automated teller machines or chequebooks. We see the switch now as a basic
part of our infrastructure and something we can build on for the future.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (21): New system pays off - Case
Study / Sea Fish Industry Authority/CPS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST effective measurement of the usefulness of a system development
must be whether it works, and provides valuable information to its users, at
a reasonable cost, writes Michael Powell.
The Fisheries Act 1981 charged the Sea Fish Industry Authority with the task
of collecting a levy on all fish purchased and imported into the UK. This
levy, amounting to Pounds 6m in 1991, is used for research, training,
conservation, marketing, fish farm development and other activities which
promote and serve the interests of the sea fish industry.
In 1990, an ICL software house subsidiary, CPS, developed a computer-based
levy control system to handle all the accounting procedures, to allow
inquiries to be made on information held in the system, and to produce
analyses and reports, using the Ingres relational database management
system. It runs on an ICL DRS30 workstation system. This replaced an earlier
system, written in Cobol to run on older technology ICL DRS-20 kit.
The authority uses Multisoft Premier for its accounting needs. According to
Gordon McLean, computer services manager: 'We used to spend a lot of time
bespoking standard packages, but now we try to bend procedures to the
package, not the package to the procedures.'
The decision to use Ingres was tactical, says Mr McLean - 'we knew we could
get a PC version, for development, and then port the result on to Unix.'
From a request for tender, four suppliers offered completely different
solutions. ICL was chosen, with Ingres. Ingres' SQL (structured query
language) was used as the development language, although two small routines
were written in the C programming language - 'it's a stand-alone system with
no interfaces to other systems at the moment,' says Mr McLean. The
development cost well under Pounds 40,000.
The authority initially had the right to return to the authors if it had any
problems. However, the system is now considered to be stable, so no further
support contract was taken - 'we've only added the odd report here or there,
so there's no need to pay a lot for support' says Mr McLean. 'However, the
system was developed using version five of Ingres, and the latest version,
number six, is an advance on five. Implementing the system on this new
version is not a trivial job. ICL is currently working on that.'
He is reluctant to update to version six, feeling it is best to leave well
alone - 'we've had very few problems . . . apart from an odd hiccup if
there's a hardware fault. It's a successful system for us - giving us more
than we had before.'
On that measure, this has been an effective bespoke development.

Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL

<TEXT>
TRUST is the key to a good relationship. Once RAC Enterprises (RACE) had
selected its systems supplier, it entrusted the project to Travellog.
This trust continues. Travellog keeps a copy of RACE's software on its own
machine, and has a modem link to RACE's machine. This arrangement ensures
that RACE can receive instant fixes in case of problems. Version control is
maintained, according to Travellog's Andrew Osborne, to ensure that the two
companies' systems remain in step.
Another form of trust is the reliance which RACE has on its machine. RACE
performs an automatically scheduled back up to tape of its data each night,
after its Dover office closes at 11pm. If the machine were to break down -
and it has been very reliable so far - the company could temporarily revert
to manual systems, using the pre-printed forms employed before the machine
arrived. No preventive maintenance contract is in force - such is the
general reliability of such machines these days. An uninterrupted power
supply is installed, to ensure smooth close-down if there is a power cut.
RACE publishes a brochure describing its system, in which it makes a great
deal of the system's usability. The conventional IT-oriented view of
usability is that there should be uncluttered screens, lots of help
messages, probably a graphical user interface (GUI), with colour and fast
response times. RACE's system scores on the first and last points. However,
it does not offer help messages, use a GUI or colours.
This bucking of the conventional wisdom makes a comment on that wisdom. This
system requires that its users are trained in its use. They must know their
product, because they must be able fluently to answer their callers. Help
messages would mainly be of use to untrained users, so are superfluous.
The company uses OS/2 PCs as terminals in its main office, to allow users to
link both to its own system and to its parent's mainframe membership
computer. These PCs are capable of both colour and graphics. However,
graphics would add nothing to a system like this, which is menu driven, and
aiming for fast response times. Colour might be useful better to highlight
parts of the screen - Andrew Osborne admitted that the system was capable of
supporting colour displays.
RACE's trust in its suppliers has so far paid off. Its system has met its
objectives, appears stable and has contributed to company growth.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (18): Travel booking system -
Technology Profile
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The booking system runs on a Pounds 50,000 IBM RS/6000 computer under IBM's
AIX version of the Unix operating system.
There are 30 IBM PS/2 personal computers at the Croydon office linked to the
machine and two terminals in Dover, which handle last-minute bookings.
The PS/2s are connected via a local area network which also links to the
RAC's central IBM 3090 mainframe computer in Milton Keynes. This is to allow
reservations staff to check RAC membership numbers in case of doubt, for
example where claims are being made for special discounts.
The system leads the reservations person through the booking and selling
process, for example moving from the reservations screens to the insurance
screen and immediately filling in the caller's personal details in the
relevant places on the new screen.
A move from one screen to another is done at the touch of a single key.
System response is instantaneous. The only time callers become aware of a
slight delay is when the system dials out to a ferry operator's computer.
The travel services unit also has a Pounds 110,000 automatic call
distribution system from STS, now used as standard across the RAC. It has 30
outside lines and 24 internal stations.
Calls can be directed to individuals or groups, with or without delays. The
RAC says the system produces comprehensive management information.
The total project, including equipment, cost Pounds 600,000.
Half the total went to Travellog, although this included the cost of the
RS/6000 and the personal computers.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (15): New-found confidence - Case
Study / RAC Enterprises' Booking Operation / The RAC went for bespoke work
on a software package - and the supplier ended up advising on everything
from furniture to staff recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BESPOKE system contract based on an existing software package was the
approach adopted by the RAC's holidays and continental travel services unit
when it set up its central booking operation.
This approach was felt to be best mainly because of the time constraints:
the RAC had six months to get the system running before the next big holiday
booking season started in January 1991.
The RAC has offered ferry and travel services for many years from its 17
local administration centres. The operation is part of RAC Enterprises,
which includes information, vehicle inspection, hotel inspection and other
services.
'Customers would post bookings to the local centre or phone or visit,
although the centres are generally not in the high street, so they are not
in the most accessible places,' says Miss Fiona Holdsworth, general manager
of travel and information services.
'We felt that a central system would make for a smoother operation and
improve customer service. It would help with staff training and management.
There would be one Freefone number from anywhere in the country, which would
help customers and also enable us to promote the service nationally.'
Under the old system booking forms were filled in by hand, ferries were
booked by telephone or through a viewdata system and the forms were sent to
the RAC's IBM mainframe computer centre at Milton Keynes, where the
information was keyed into a basic accounting system. It could be a
fortnight before a postal booking got a response.
The new system was going to handle bookings on-line, while the customer was
on the telephone, so fast communications and processing were important. It
was therefore decided after discussion between RAC Enterprises, based in
Croydon, in south London, and the Milton Keynes computing centre, that a
local self-contained system would be the best approach for what is a largely
autonomous business.
In addition, the computing centre was already committed to major development
of the membership database system and could not have taken on another big
project. RAC Enterprises' time constraints also weighed against developing
the system from scratch.
Evaluation of the need and the options was done by a working group
consisting of RAC Enterprises' finance director, Mr Niall Addison; the
administration manager for the RAC Enterprises' European services, Mr Frank
Cleghorn; the then reservations manager; plus RAC Enterprises' own systems
manager, Mr Jeremy Lewis. Mr Lewis is the only computing specialist at the
Croydon office: he advises RAC Enterprises and liaises with the Milton
Keynes computing centre.
RAC Enterprises only found four software packages which even came close to
meeting its need. The contract went to Travellog Systems for three main
reasons, Frank Cleghorn says - 'they had a system running at the Caravan
Club, which has a similar business to our own. They had a major grasp of the
ferry industry and the complexities of timetabling, pricing, promotional
offers and so on. This knowledge was vital, because there had to be a short
learning curve, given our timescale. Thirdly, they were fairly well advanced
with the Unicorn electronic data interchange protocol which links
reservation systems with ferry companies' systems.'
Travellog's knowledge of the ferry holidays business led the RAC to contract
the company to manage the whole project, not only providing the reservations
system but also overseeing installation of an automatic call distribution
system, drawing up furniture selection criteria and handling staff
recruitment. This was despite concern about Travellog's size.
'There was a question mark over Travellog's size and we discussed this at
some length and visited their premises and met the staff,' Mr Cleghorn says.
'They're not a large company - but this was also a plus: we got very close
to people of all levels, from the chairman to the people on the job from
day-to-day. We had an excellent relationship: we saw everything they were
doing and could get some quick fixes when necessary.'
He adds: 'I'm convinced that we got a lot more development done than we
might have with a big company, because we could contact anyone in Travellog
and they all knew all about us.'
This involvement of all levels of Travellog staff is reflected in the offer
by the company's chairman, Mr David Stern, to chair the project management
team, which also included the RAC managers from the initial evaluation
group, plus a telecommunications specialist and a hardware specialist from
corporate systems, the Travellog project leader, and outside suppliers, such
as British Telecom and the provider of the Pounds 110,000 automatic call
distribution system, 'David Stern has big project management experience, but
we did feel he might be biased if Travellog failed to meet a target,' Mr
Cleghorn says. 'But Travellog certainly did not escape his whip when
necessary.'
A lot of time was spent on the system specification, at Travellog's
insistence - 'we feel it is essential to get a black-and-white
specification,' says Travellog director Andrew Osborne. 'That way the
customer knows what he's getting and we know precisely what we're doing. We
always put a lot of emphasis on this stage and make the customer sign it off
formally.'
Mr Cleghorn at the RAC says: 'We, too, spent a long time on the
specification, distributing it to users, finance people and marketing
people. We knew what we wanted - in particular that the on-line system
should be driven by our sales approach. So, for example, a ferry booking is
usually sold first, but the system then flows into breakdown assistance and
insurance screens, to encourage add-on sales.'
Mr Osborne at Travellog says the system eventually delivered is probably
around 80 per cent standard core software used at other customers and 20 per
cent bespoke. The core software is mainly parts of the system invisible to
the user but controlling the whole process, while the 20 per cent is mainly
associated with the screen displays presented to the users and tailored to
the RAC's needs.
There was also bespoke work on the insurance processing, because RAC
Enterprises handles this differently from other Travellog customers.
Travellog originally sold its systems on minicomputers from US manufacturer
Prime, using Pick, in effect an operating system with a built-in database
management system. 'We have always used a fourth-generation programming
language, because it gives the flexibility we need for customising systems,'
Mr Osborne says. 'Pick has a very flexible database: for example, there is
no pre-definition of the sizes or numbers of data records.'
However, the RAC has a strong IBM policy at both mainframe and personal
computer level.
'Corporate systems said they would prefer us to go IBM - and the central
3090 installation certainly gives us muscle in getting support and service,'
says Mr Cleghorn. Travellog therefore picked IBM's RS/6000 system,
well-known for its speed. Mr Osborne says it has outstanding price
performance and Mr Cleghorn describes it simply as an amazing machine. The
system's response to an RAC user's instruction is virtually instantaneous
and well inside the four seconds specified by the RAC.
However, the RS/6000 runs under IBM's AIX version of the Unix operating
system, so Travellog had to convert its core software to run with Unix. For
this, it found a software product called Universe from US company, Vmark.
This, in effect, runs Pick under Unix. Mr Osborne says the entire system was
transferred to Unix in just two or three days using Universe.
The RAC system was Travellog's first experience of the RS/6000. Since then
it has used the machine in six other contracts.
Once the project was under way the tight deadlines meant the management team
had to meet at least weekly - 'we couldn't afford to put anything off,' says
Frank Cleghorn.
'While we were driving the system development along, we were planning the
office layout, choosing furniture and drawing up staff recruitment criteria.
All this was running in parallel.'
The RAC relied heavily on Travellog in all these activities, because of its
experience with other companies. The office was to be semi-open plan to
encourage an open, friendly and team atmosphere, with low, sound absorbing
screens to provide a degree of privacy. Cables and power points were to be
hidden to ensure tidiness and efficiency. And furniture had to be
ergonomically designed. Several chair and desk combinations were tested by
users before the final choice was made.
In addition, the RAC called on Travellog's experience to determine the
number of staff who would be needed to handle the predicted business. Frank
Cleghorn says they had to have good keyboard skills and a good telephone
manner and be fairly extrovert - 'they shouldn't be afraid of asking a
customer if he would like insurance or something else on top of the ferry
booking he had phoned up for.'
He adds that most people can become reservation agents on the system after
two weeks' training.
The RAC has found that development can become never-ending - 'it wasn't long
after we went live that managers realised just what we had and wanted more
management information from it, even though we had asked them before
implementation what reports they wanted,' Mr Cleghorn says. 'This extra
development started as soon as the system was installed. It's difficult to
sign something off completely when you've never had it before.'
Fiona Holdsworth adds: 'You have to make sure, nonetheless, that it's
information that will be used and that you're not just producing some extra
report because someone thought it might be useful to see this or that moving
average.'
The system has proved its worth by helping RAC Enterprises to beat its
budget forecasts by 15 per cent in the first four months of 1992.
But its success is also reflected in the fact that it is being taken into
other areas - 'our success on the continental travel side has given us the
confidence to use the system in these other services,' says Fiona
Holdsworth.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (11): Honeymoons can be wonderful
 -Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>

   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON a honeymoon, partners think they know each other perfectly and are
usually blissfully happy.
Talking to Hambros and CHP together, it seemed like they had just got
married. Hambros had had eyes only for CHP in their selection process and
never strayed even to look at the prices that others might charge. The
middle of a large development is often like this. Everyone is nice to each
other. Delivery dates look miles away and any slippage can be easily allowed
for.
Whether it remains so pleasant is a matter of time. I suspect that things
will be slightly more strained in six to 12 months.
If it succeeds, it is a win-win deal. Hambros gets a cheaper system and CHP
gets a product ready to sell to others. This sort of partnership can work
extremely well as long as both parties feel they are being treated properly.
I feel it is too early to really judge this site. Gantt charts look
impressive, but everything works on paper.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (10): Aiming for all round
benefits - Case Study / Hambros Leasing/CHP Consulting / New, easier-to-use
system will provide better information and cost-savings, too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN HAMBROS Leasing started work on a new administration system, it decided
straightaway that it could save money if the system could later be sold as a
package to other leasing specialists.
That decision is set to boost the system developer, a small, young software
company called CHP Consulting, by giving it its first entry into the
software products business.
Hambros Leasing, a subsidiary of Hambros Bank, describes itself as a
medium-sized operation handling medium-sized business, typically funding
capital investments of Pounds 1m and above. It also manages other companies'
leasing portfolios. Its income was Pounds 106.8m last year, and it has 36
staff at its headquarters opposite the Tower of London.
Hambros Leasing started life in 1983 with a Wang VS/100 business
minicomputer running the Leasepac software package from Andersen Consulting.
'In the early days, the leasing business was driven by tax allowances and
leasing companies offered very much a standard product,' says Mr Tony
Curtin, a director of Hambros Leasing, 'but when that all changed with the
1984 Finance Act, we had to become more flexible to write and retain
business.'
Leasepac had been written in 1980, when the old rules applied - 'no
transaction is the same as any other these days,' Mr Curtin says. 'This
means we spend a lot of time doing things manually and trying to get round
the system so it can cope with what we are doing. This has been happening
more and more: staff have been spending late nights doing things they
shouldn't have to do, because of the system. Andersen have been in
constantly to upgrade our system.'
Andrew Page was the man doing much of that upgrade work for Andersen. In
1990 he left the company to become the 'P' in CHP Consulting, which was set
up in May that year with two other financial computing specialists from
Andersen: Justin Cooper and Ian Hargrave. The company now has 10 staff and
had a turnover last year of Pounds 410,000. It concentrates on consultancy
and systems in the leasing and asset finance business.
IN October 1990, Hambros Leasing decided the time had come to get a new
administration and treasury system. The treasury function was being handled
by a combination of a box of cards and the Lotus spreadsheet package running
on personal computers outside the administration system.
'We wanted improved ease-of-use and better information, but we had to have
real cost-savings as well,' says Mr Curtin says. 'That did not necessarily
mean through job cuts, but rather by expanding our existing business and
moving into new areas with the same number of people.
'In addition, on the treasury side we didn't think we were getting enough
efficiency from our funding. This is a very competitive business: almost 30
per cent of all new capital expenditure in the UK is leased, but all the
clearing banks, most merchant banks, and many equipment and other asset
suppliers offer leasing services, so we need to look at opportunities to cut
funding costs.
'Another consideration was that Wang was in fairly deep trouble, so we
wanted to replace the computer.'
Hambros Leasing's knowledge of Andrew Page's work while he was at Andersen
led the company to call in CHP to look at the options for the way ahead.
'In the past computing had been considered in isolation, largely because of
the inflexibility of the package,' Mr Page says. 'There was no
consideration, for example, of integrating the automation of all areas to
get maximum benefit from the overall system. So our study looked at the
total business, the bigger picture.'
CHP says there were four or five packages available but these were mostly
either old or reworked from old systems.
In January 1991, Hambros Bank's central information technology steering
committee decided to commission CHP to design a new bespoke system for an
IBM AS/400 business minicomputer - 'we didn't consider any other bespoke
software companies,' says Mr Curtin. 'We knew that CHP understood the
business, which was important.
'We also knew we would get high-level people, whereas with a big company we
might have high-level people at the very top but they might devolve the real
responsibility to others who might not know our business and could get into
problems.'
A key issue was the possibility of the software developer turning the system
into a package which could be sold to others - 'this was always in our mind,
right from the start in October 1990,' Mr Curtin says. 'The costs of bespoke
system development would be too great unless you were one of the very
biggest players. We agreed terms with CHP which were substantially lower
than if we had gone for a one-off development.'
CHP says it was happy with the arrangement - 'we saw there was a market need
because the business has changed so much since 1984,' says Mr Cooper.
CHP's small size was also something of an issue: at the peak of development
eight of its 10 staff were working on this one project.
'Concern about CHP's size is always there - but we knew from the cash flow
we'd be giving them that they'd keep going,' Mr Curtin says, half jokingly.
'They're big enough now to carry on even if one of the partners was run over
by a bus.'
Mr Page at CHP says, 'We'd been going for eight months when we got the
design contract, so we'd showed we could survive. We have eight clients.
Leasing is a very close-knit community and that worked to our advantage,
because Hambros knew our other clients.'
His fellow director, Ian Hargrave, adds, 'This is our biggest contract. We
haven't got all our eggs in one basket, but quite a lot of them. We're
investing in getting it right, because in effect we're investing in our own
future.'
Hambros Bank has a computing centre at Brentwood, Essex, with a Unisys
mainframe. It has 90 computing staff, including 16 based at the London
headquarters.
'Using them wasn't an option,' Mr Curtin says. 'They are dedicated to the
banking side and have no special knowledge of the leasing business. In
addition, gearing up for the project and then gearing down, would have
created problems.'
The computing department is involved to an extent, however: systems group
manager David Nisbett is in the project steering group. The new system has
to feed information to the central group exposure system and has to fit in
to the bank's overall information technology strategy.
That strategy, oddly at first glance, led CHP to propose the IBM AS/400 for
the leasing system.
'We chose the AS/400 because we are familiar with it, it's very friendly for
development because of its built-in relational database system, there are
some well-established CASE (computer-aided systems engineering) tools
available and a lot of appli cations software packages, notably nominal
ledger products,' says Mr Hargrave.
Hambros Bank is looking towards open systems, normally associated with the
Unix operating system - which is not supported by the IBM AS/400.
'The bank has talked about its commitment to open systems to improve
information transfer but it's also pragmatic and wants bespoke work done
quickly,' says Mr Cooper. 'The AS/400 is good for quick development and has
good connectivity with other systems. With Unix you have to bolt on the
software development tools.
'The benefit of Unix is that you can transfer software from one Unix machine
to another, but this is a one-off development for just one area of the bank,
so portability isn't a factor.'
As well as handling system development, CHP has helped select a new nominal
ledger package, which will be linked in. CHP helped draw up the selection
criteria and identified around 50 possible packages for the AS/400.
'We chose the JBA package because it was one of the few which can handle
different year ends,' says Mr David Shindler, an assistant director in
charge of administrative staff at Hambros Leasing. 'Hambros companies have
different year-ends, but they also have to report for the group year-end.
Price was a factor: it was similar to that of others, but it covered an
unlimited number of users.'
CHP interviewed Hambros staff on their way of working, from taking client
instructions over a telephone to posting items to the general ledger. The
interviews were written up and shown to staff for further comment. From this
process, CHP produced a system description and then a design, which was
approved in August 1991. The AS/400 was delivered in October.
All the development work is being done at Hambros Leasing by a CHP team
sitting in the open-plan general office; development work is done on
personal computers linked to the AS/400 by a local area network. CHP is
using the Lansa computer-aided systems engineering products from Aspect. The
JBA nominal ledger package has been set up, the opening balances are being
keyed in and the system was due to go live in June for the current financial
year. The treasury system is being tested by CHP and Hambros and was also
scheduled to go live in June.
The main leasing and asset finance administration package is scheduled for
testing in July. The target for live operation is next February. Testing of
the integration of the different parts of the overall system is due to
continue until August. Mr Curtin has overall responsibility for the project:
'I was chosen because I had minor information technology experience,' he
jokes. 'I trained as an actuary and that's very computer-based these days,
so I'm used to computing.'
Mr Hargrave of CHP is the project manager. Under him at present are Mr
Cooper, who is the database administrator and technical designer for the
project; two people working on the general ledger; three more, including
Andrew Page, on the treasury system; and two on the main asset finance
system, all from CHP.
Mr Hargrave says CHP is balancing bespoke work against package development.
'We make sure that as much as possible can be driven by parameters,' he
says. 'When we come to package it up, we will take out certain special
things which Hambros has requested and put in other things that might be
needed.'
Mr Cooper adds: 'Between the three of us we have 25 years' experience of 40
banking and leasing companies, so we feel we know what the market wants.'
There is also a user team of David Shindler, plus assistant financial
controller Miss Maureen O'Connor and administrative staff supervisor Mr
Michael Hoffman, who spend 80 per cent and 50 per cent of their time
respectively on development and testing - 'this is affecting the rest of the
11 administrative staff, who have to work harder,' says Mr Shindler. 'The
extra work is balanced by their interest in the new system: they work in the
office alongside CHP, so they're aware it's going on . . . initially, there
was concern about possible job losses but we tell people that the system
means they will be able to work more quickly and take on more, as our
business grows.'
Part of that business growth is expected to come from taking on other
companies' leasing business, running what Tony Curtin calls a facilities
management service, including computer processing of all the administration,
and offering services such as chasing arrears.
And, as Hambros had in mind from the start the cost benefits of getting CHP
to develop its system as a package, so, too, it was thinking about future
business expansion. For although the main system will not go live until next
year, Mr Curtin says: 'We got an AS/400 which is much bigger than we need,
partly with facilities management in mind.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (7): Vallourec, the French steel
maker - Company Snapshot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vallourec had a turnover of FFr7,480m in 1990 and FFr8,380m in 1989.
The company's net profit was FFr403m in 1990 and FFr639m in 1989.
Business activities: the tube-making operation, Vallourec Industries, is the
biggest subsidiary.
It consists of the Saint-Saulve plant, which makes steel and tubes, plus
three specialist plants which prepare the tubes for customers in the
automotive, construction, chemicals, oil and gas, mechanical engineering and
power generation industries.
Saint-Saulve produces 300 grades of steel and tubes of 15 different
diameters.
Independent steel specialists say the plant is tidy and well organised and
its continuous rotary casting method of manufacturing seamless tubes,
involving vertical, rotating moulds, is unusual and innovative, putting it
among world leaders in this field.
World scale: Saint-Saulve is seventh in the world in terms of tube
production capacity (by comparison, British Steel is seventeenth).
The plant runs 24 hours a day, 330 days a year.
Production has grown from 150,000 tons to 480,000 tons since the plant
opened in 1975.
The three tube finishing plants need 600,000 tons, the balance being bought
from outside Vallourec.
Following the installation of the new monitoring system, Saint-Saulve aims
to reach 600,000 tons a year in 1993.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (9): Four hundred sensors monitor
production - System Profile
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are 400 sensors continuously monitoring 10,000 variables in the steel
and tube-making process at Vallourec's Saint-Saulve plant, linked to a
controller supplied by French company, April.
This machine and an automated furnace controller are connected to three
communications processors from the US company, DEC.
These processors are linked in turn through an Ethernet local area network
to three DEC Microvax computers, which control the production process,
analyse the data and send information over the Ethernet network to operators
equipped with Sun Microsystems workstations.
If one Microvax goes out of action, the other two automatically take over
the workload.
At worst, one machine can handle the entire workload, although response
times at the operator workstations would be slower.
Also attached to the network is a fourth Microvax which controls the
database of 96 hours' worth of production data.
Finally, there are links from the overall system through one of the network
processors to a Concurrent Computer minicomputer running business systems
such as order processing.
The system gives steel plant operators information about the production
process and alerts them if a variable such as temperature goes outside
specified limits.
If that happens, it consults a table to find which associated variables it
should analyse to determine what might be wrong and suggests corrective
action to the operators.
If they do not acknowledge the alarm, then the system tries again - and, on
the third alarm, it will automatically take the corrective action itself.
All the data relating to 96 hours' production is captured to give a
management view of how manufacturing is progressing and to help pinpoint
possible problem areas.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (6): Big savings for steel maker
 -Case Study / Vallourec / Software boosts quality control and production
flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS ALMOST inevitable that French steel maker Vallourec would choose Cap
Sesa to develop its process monitoring and quality control system, writes
John Kavanagh. After all, when invited to bid, it showed that the requested
system was far bigger than Vallourec needed and proceeded to cut the
contract-cost by 75 per cent by producing a much simpler system requirement.
This then formed the basis of a new invitation to tender.
The system was needed at Vallourec's plant in Saint-Saulve, near
Valenciennes, in northern France. The company is one of the world leaders in
making seamless steel tubes. Four moulds sit side by side and the plant can
produce tubes of four different diameters at the same time.
The tubes go to three other Vallourec plants, which prepare them for use in
industries ranging from car manufacturing to oil exploration.
Vallourec's need for close production monitoring and flexible operating is
shown by the fact that the Saint-Saulve plant makes 300 grades of steel from
scrap and turns the steel into tubes in any of 15 diameters.
The plant was opened in 1975 with the aim of producing 150,000 tons of steel
a year. Improvements such as boosting the power of the furnace have
increased that to 480,000 tons. But the company also wanted to improve the
productivity of the pipe making.
'One problem, for example, is that speed can affect quality,' says the
Saint-Saulve plant manager, Mr Pierre Boussard. 'Quality is important in a
competitive market: it would be impossible today to sell the steel we were
making even 10 years ago.
'However, with our large number of possible combinations of grades and tube
diameters, operators cannot ensure quality and adapt all the parameters,
such as temperature and speed, easily and quickly. So it was absolutely
necessary to improve process supervision with an automated system.'
Vallourec called in consultants to help specify the system. This was costed
at between FFr22m and FFr33m by companies which were invited to bid.
Enter Cap Sesa. The company is the French operation of the French-owned
group Cap Gemini Sogeti, the biggest computing services group in Europe and
the fourth biggest in the world after US companies EDS, IBM and Computer
Sciences.
'We felt there were superfluous elements in the system requirement,' says
Cap Sesa project manager Mr Xavier Roy.
'For example, it said process data would have to be held for a year; we said
it would only need to be held for four days, enough to cover production over
a bank holiday weekend so that it could be examined by the relevant people
when they returned to work. In addition, the original plan was to develop a
totally integrated system which included not only supervision and quality
control but also business activities, such as sales order processing. We
pointed out that Saint-Saulve already had business systems and all it needed
was a link from those into the new system.'
The new requirement went to eight systems companies, large and small: their
bids ranged from FFr4m to FFr8m somewhat less than the FFr22-33m demanded by
the original plan. Cap Sesa had in effect cut the value of the contract for
all the bidders, including itself. But Mr Roy says, 'The supplier's job
should not be to get the biggest contract but to look at the customer's real
needs and aims and make a suitable proposal.'
Vallourec gave Cap Sesa what it calls a token FFr50,000 for its work but the
real reward came in the form of the main contract. Cap Sesa found itself on
a shortlist with computer industry leader IBM and Syseca, part of the French
engineering giant, Thomson.
IBM, which put in one of the most expensive bids, was then eliminated and
Vallourec opened detailed negotiations with Cap Sesa and Syseca. The
contract went to Cap Sesa, which costed its bid at FFr7m, by no means the
lowest and certainly more expensive than Syseca's. In addition, although Cap
Sesa says it knows the steel industry and has 50 people in this field in
northern France alone, it had not led a project of this kind before. It was
also the first time that the company had worked on a fixed-price contract
involving networked equipment and software: its previous fixed-price
experience was in software development alone. Vallourec says it chose Cap
Sesa because of its use of Fast Tools, a set of so-called computer-aided
systems engineering (CASE) products which helps develop systems quickly.
However, as one project insider puts it, 'Cap Sesa would probably have won
anyway because of the work it did on reviewing the requirement.'
This was the first time Cap Sesa had used the Fast Tools products, developed
by Netherlands software company, HCS, for this kind of technical system
project. Cap Sesa's satisfaction with Fast Tools has led its Cap Gemini
Sogeti parent company to take on the product range for world-wide use.
The Saint-Saulve team used the Merise systems development and project
management method during the selection process. A formal method imposes
discipline on the way a project is run and this enabled the team to evaluate
and compare the different offerings in a standard way against the same 20
criteria, according to Mr Herve Bouchez, the Vallourec project manager. He
is a computing specialist who works in the Saint-Saulve plant's own
computing section. This has four staff running largely commercial systems,
such as order processing, on a local minicomputer from US supplier
Concurrent Computer (formerly Perkin Elmer).
One option the Saint-Saulve works did not look at was to use Vallourec's own
central computing department, which has 100 specialists and a mainframe
computer from French supplier, Bull, at a centre near the plant.
'Eight years ago they tried to help on a technical system project but could
not match our need, partly because they only work a five-day week and could
not give us maintenance support over the weekend,' says plant manager Pierre
Boussard. 'We have a good relationship with the computing centre on
commercial systems but our earlier experience meant we did not consider them
this time.'
Mr Bouchez and his three-man internal project team started work in January
1990. The final shortlist of suppliers was drawn up in June. During the
summer, Vallourec negotiated with the shortlisted companies and meanwhile
determined which factors would need to be monitored.
The result was that 400 sensors would be needed to monitor 10,000 variables
relating to temperature, rotation speed, molten steel levels, cooling rate
and so on. The system had to show operators these variables virtually
instantaneously within two seconds.
And if the variables strayed outside specified levels the system had to
alert the operators and suggest corrective action, basing its suggestion on
an analysis of other related variables and a list of possible faults
associated with the combination of all this data. An operator has to
acknowledge the alarm: if he fails to respond to the third warning the
system automatically takes appropriate action and makes the necessary
adjustments to the production process, such as increasing the cooling rate,
or cutting the speed.
Given the demands for speed of response by the system, Mr Roy and his Cap
Sesa team found Microvax computers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),
the second biggest US computer manufacturer, to be the most suitable. In 99
per cent of cases, the system response is 1.2 secs. and in the other one per
cent it is up to 1.5 secs. The operator workstations are from Sun
Microsystems. They were chosen for their graphics facilities and their
price.
The basic network was delivered in January 1991 and the monitoring system
was ready for testing by April. Workstations were built and staff tried them
out and made suggestions which were acted on. Design of the colour screens
with their graphic and tabulated information was done largely by the very
operators who would be using them.
By August, the equipment and workstations were all ready and the bulk
production data was keyed in over the next six weeks or so. The system was
formally accepted in September, 1991 two months ahead of target date.
Mr Boussard, says the main benefit of the system has been the improved
consistency of quality: 'Previously, it was all a bit like cooking: each
shift would produce slightly different results. We now have precise data on
the history of each tube. We know precisely which alarms have been set off
for each tube and why. We know precisely which tubes are likely to be faulty
and we can localise a defect to a 50cm length. We can react much more
quickly to problems, so there is less waste.
'We expect to be able to cut bar inspection time by 30 per cent and to have
fewer production stoppages, fewer defects and improved output of tubes for
despatch. All these improvements mean the plant can now look to increase
production from 480,000 tons to 600,000 tons next year, enough to meet all
the needs of the three tube finishing plants, which currently buy some tubes
from outside Vallourec.
In addition, the information and suggested corrective action provided by the
system allow the whole process to be run by less experienced people.
'You normally need 10 years' experience for continuous casting but with this
system people can learn much more quickly and can do it with one year's
experience,' says Mr Boussard.
Cap Sesa retains the copyright to the software, as is usual in software
development contracts. It hopes to use at least some of the software in
other projects and is already adapting parts of it for an oil platform
system for Elf. In addition, Cap Sesa is promoting the total system to other
steelworks with the help of Vallourec under a separate, confidential,
commercial arrangement.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (5): Time for a bespoke comeback
 -Analysis / Bespoke systems are set for a revival - thanks to software
packages, which eclipsed them in the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BESPOKE SYSTEMS are enjoying something of a comeback, albeit in a slightly
different form.
During the 1980s, the idea of getting software developed precisely to one's
needs fell from favour as users switched to the growing number of standard
packages becoming available for everything from general accounting to
specialised applications, such as hospital bed management.
Bespoke development is expensive and takes time, whereas a package can go
live relatively quickly and more cheaply. In addition, package developers
now use so-called fourth-generation languages, which make program adaptation
easier, for example to meet an individual user's demand for extra management
reports. There are also parameter options, which allow users to tweak a
package to fit their year-ends, product codes and other unique
characteristics.
Oddly, the basic idea of a modern package as adaptable software, which can
be used again and again in different circumstances, is contributing in a
major way to the revival of bespoke systems, according to leading computing
services companies.
'There are probably no more than a dozen big pure bespoke development
projects in the UK at present but what we are likely to see is growth in the
integration of existing software with some bespoke work,' says Mr Keith
Gathergood, managing director of Anglo-French company, Sema Group Systems.
'Systems integration, using existing software kernels, is becoming a very
common form of bespoke development.'
This is certainly confirmed by some of the companies studied for this issue
of Software At Work. RAC and Lloyds Bank have opted for bespoke systems
based on existing software, combining faster development with the prospect
of getting precisely the systems they wanted. And software developed for a
steelworks by Cap Sesa is now being used in a totally different bespoke
system.
Sometimes kernel software is bought in from another company. Sema is
building a Pounds 13m control system for a British Nuclear Fuels
manufacturing plant and is buying the data acquisition system from a
specialist in that field.
'No-one would build such a data acquisition system from scratch any more,'
Mr Gathergood says. 'It's better for us to use our skills to develop the
interfaces and the application systems which the customer's staff will use.
We might be able to use this interface software in some future contract.' A
typical bespoke system project these days is made up equally of existing
software, bespoke software and services such as training and support.
The impact of fourth-generation languages on the packages business in the
late 1980s could also be repeated in the bespoke software market in the
1990s. 'Software development tools now make it more efficient and quite
cheap to build a bespoke system, for example by enhancing existing software.
We can see organisations building bespoke systems in this way rather than
buying software products,' Mr Gathergood says.
Customers are told when kernel software is being used, but they are not
concerned: 'The user doesn't see the components, only the total system, and
as long as it works the way he wants, he is not bothered.
'Indeed, many users take comfort from the fact that the systems company is
reusing existing software. The customer knows he's getting proven software
and that he's not alone in using it.
'In addition, in a bespoke project, customers like to have something to
touch as soon as possible rather than just receive a monthly progress
report. With re-usable software there is something tangible available very
quickly.'
THE revival of bespoke systems in this form has been boosted by two other
developments. First, subsidiary companies and even individual departments
are becoming more autonomous partly as a result of advances in
telecommunications and computer technology, which have allowed offices to
install their own local computers.
'Computing used to be controlled by the computing department but these days
major systems procurements are being driven by user departments. Most of our
contracts are for systems in their own right, so we have no contact with the
IT department, apart from when we have to interface the system with a
corporate management information system,' according to Mr Gathergood.
The second factor has been the trend to wards fixed-price contracts, which
theoretically means user departments can go into a bespoke development
contract knowing what they are getting and at what cost. This has become
such an issue that the Computing Services Association, which represents 80
per cent of the UK computing services industry by turnover, has put together
a briefing document for member companies and their clients.
THERE are mixed views on whether these two developments mean bespoke
contracts are an extension to the traditional computing department or a
threat to it. In many of the case studies reported in this issue the option
of using the computing department was considered but rejected, generally by
agreement. The computing people were already overloaded, or the application
was very technical or specialised. But growing use of systems companies by
user departments also reflects a general shift of power away from the
central computing unit.
This has been picked up by computer manufacturers, some of which stress that
less than half their turnover now comes from equipment sales. Indeed, the
likes of IBM, ICL, Unisys and others have joined the Computing Services
Association in recent years.
Mr Gathergood plays down the role of computer manufacturers, as might be
expected. 'Their whole culture is geared towards selling hardware and
getting into systems integration is alien to them,True systems houses have
no allegiance to any manufacturer and have the user's interests at heart.'
This view, however, is contradicted by Philip Crawford, UK director of the
systems operation at computer supplier Bull HN Information Systems.
'Historically the hardware manufacturers were seen as box shifters - and
some still are. Even three years ago my group was probably seen as a means
to the end of selling hardware. We've now won our independence - but it's
been hard-fought internally. The emergence of open systems has made a
difference. Services now have to stand on their own: my profit and loss
excludes our own hardware.'
Mr Crawford also points out that his team now develops software packages to
run on competitors' equipment, for example in local government, where IBM
and ICL are strong.
In bespoke systems contracts the company includes other computers where
necessary: two current tenders it is bidding for stipulate IBM or
Hewlett-Packard machines. In addition the company includes rival equipment
in its bids if it feels the other machines are more appropriate. 'Otherwise,
we might gain a computer sale in the short term, but in the long term I am
more interested in a good customer reference,' Mr Crawford says.
'Potential customers initially believe we are not independent and I
understand that. We have to work to prove our independence but what does
independence mean? Given freedom of choice, any systems house will naturally
go to the equipment it knows best.'
With the expected regeneration of the bespoke-cum-systems integration
market, issues like that could soon be back in debate.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (4): Packages versus bespoke
systems - Software Debate / Alan Cane explains why bespoke systems still
have an important role in business operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE software projects involve a level of complexity which is invariably
difficult to manage. It is all too easy to lose sight of the original
business objectives which led to the decision to initiate a new software
development.
That danger is multiplied several times over when the work extends in time,
and headcount rises. Kit Grindley of the London School of Economics quotes a
typical complaint in his book Managing IT at Board Level*: 'As a programming
manager, you need to rewrite Parkinson's Law. Programming work expands to
fill the capacity of the computer enhancement you were foolish enough to
mention, this year's budget plus any of next year's you can bring forward,
and the user's patience to bursting.'
People and ideas change. The longer a software development is in gestation,
the greater the chance that the original purpose for which the software was
designed will have altered - or disappeared. The original champions of the
project may have changed jobs, lost their enthusiasm or simply moved on to
the next opportunity.
These are some of the cultural - as opposed to practical - reasons why
packaged software has increasingly replaced bespoke software in large as
well as small organisations.
The practical reasons are well understood. Packages sold in volume cost a
fraction of a bespoke development. They can be installed in a fraction of
the time needed for a bespoke system. And they bring a sense of discipline
to many organisations in that the company's business processes have to be
adapted to the package, rather than the other way about. All of this
explains why consultants such as Mr Alan Braithwaite, a partner in Logistics
Consulting Partners argues: 'The days of developing custom software have
almost gone'.
Yet as this issue of Software at Work illustrates, there is still a place
for bespoke programming although at a much reduced level than hitherto, (see
next page).
Mr Braithwaite, whose company specialises in the management of materials -
storage, handling and transportation - is chiefly concerned by the
complexity of large projects, especially where a multinational company, that
is, one with separate operations in a number of different countries, is
attempting to become an international operation sharing business processes
and systems across all its activities. One of the great barriers to
integrating separate operations internationally, he points out, is the
difficulty of matching dissimilar systems with separate ways of, for
example, describing data or managing interfaces.
The striking success of SAP, a German software house which has developed a
highly integrated software package to support manufacturing, distribution
and financial management, illustrates the point.
It is used by a number of the world's largest companies including ICI, Esso,
Mobil and British Rail in the UK. Of the 100 largest industrial corporations
in West Germany, 70 are SAP users. ICI, in fact, has decided to standardise
on SAP software worldwide. It has established global remits for the key
components of information technology. These include data languages and
codes, integrated applications for core business functions and computer
hardware. SAP fits the requirement of ICI and other global players by
providing a single data repository, consistent data definitions, one-time
data input and real-time operation across all critical business functions.
SAP represents, therefore, the best of breed in large integrated packages.
Touche Ross, the management consultants, surveyed SAP users and found only
17 per cent of customers unhappy with the package while 67 per cent would
choose SAP again.
But the effort to implement SAP was substantial, Touche Ross found. Typical
users devoted 21 man-months to the selection of the package and of the order
of ten times as much to implementation. This was a consequence of the
complexity of the package and the fact that most users were moving to SAP
from a bespoke system.
The greatest potential benefit from a bespoke system is that it should match
the customer's requirements exactly, unlike a package which is always a
square peg in a round hole (for the purposes of this argument, ignore
personal computer packages. Personal computer users have traded low cost for
the right to demand what they want from a package.)
THE benefits of performing according to specification are of little value,
however, if the system is delivered too late to take advantage of the market
opportunity.
There is a strong case, therefore, for installing a package and trimming it
around the edges until it fits. Mr Braithwaite argues that because no single
package will ever give the user exactly what he or she wants, it makes good
sense to buy more than one and take the best bits from each, again using
bespoke software techniques to provide the glue between the various
elements.
There are hidden advantages in this approach. A wholly integrated package,
because of its complexity and comprehensive nature, may camouflage business
processes ripe for rejuvenation.
The essence of improving efficiency and therefore competitiveness is to
overhaul the processes which determine the way the business operates.
Without business process redesign, computerisation simply automates a legacy
of inefficiency.
Bespoke software work at the interfaces may show up inefficiencies inherent
in traditional practices and point the way forward to better methods.

Readers who do not have a technological background may find useful the
following explanations of some of the technical computing terms used in this
issue of Software at Work:
Fourth-generation language or 4GL is the name applied to software products
for writing programs relatively quickly. Typically a 4GL program
instruction, often in an English-like form, is translated by the computer
into several lines of a traditional (third-generation) language such as
Cobol.
Computer-aided systems engineering (CASE) is the latest attempt to improve
the speed and quality of system development. A CASE product set might
include: a method for analysing users' needs; a database, (called a
repository), holding program, report and screen specifications, plus project
management information; products for analysing and restructuring existing
programs for possible re-use in a new system (also known as re-engineering);
a fourth-generation language; and a database management system.
Unix is an operating system: the software that manages the internal working
of the computer, organising the main memory, running applications programs,
and handling security and other functions.
Earlier, different manufacturers had their own operating systems, which tied
users to their machines, but there is now a move towards enabling users to
move applications software from one computer to another.
nix is emerging as a standard operating system, running on different
computers, which allows users to transfer software in this way.
Fault-tolerant systems enable application programs to keep running even if
part of the overall system develops a fault.
There are two main specialist suppliers of fault-tolerant computers:
Tandem links two or more computers which can each run different programs but
constantly check that the others are working; if one fails the others take
over.
Stratus, which sells its products directly and through other manufacturers,
including IBM, has a different approach: two processors handle the same
programs and constantly compare results.
Some traditional manufacturers, notably NCR, have launched fault-tolerant
systems and others offer the possibility of running their computers together
to provide fault-tolerant processing.
Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the exchange of business documents,
such as orders and invoices, electronically between traders' computers,
usually through telecommunications services provided by computer bureaux,
which direct incoming calls to the requested recipient.
EDI speeds up the whole process and cuts human intervention and error. It is
currently an area of fast growth.

FT  07 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures gave up Friday's gains as dealers focused instead on the
lack of further news of a cut in UK base rates, writes Joel Kibazo.
After brief strength at the session's opening, the sell off of September got
underway and the contract fell to 2,491 by 10.15am, down 15 from its
opening, and sending the underlying cash market lower. BZW and County
NatWest were reported to have been the two leading institutions on the
offer, with others choosing to remain on the sidelines. However, weakness in
the gilts and sterling markets, caused by a lack of news on interest rates,
led to further falls.
Wall Street's performance had little effect on the downward trend in the
contract and September closed at 2,490, down 42 on Friday's close and around
5 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25.
Traded options also saw a fall in activity and turnover reached only 25,476,
against Friday's total of 31,570 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 10,247
contracts and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 2,717 contracts.
Land Securities was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 1,138
lots. Most of the business was concentrated in the October 390 calls. This
was followed by GEC at 1,057 lots and by Hillsdown at 963 lots.

FT  07 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pessimism as rate hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate optimism melted away like summer snow on the London stock
market yesterday, leaving share prices to crumble in the face of the flow of
bad news on the economic and corporate fronts.
With sterling floundering following Italy's move to higher interest rates,
and initial reports from the G7 summit offering little confidence for
expansion of world economies, shares quickly turned lower.
Gloomy views of the domestic economy were fuelled by news that consumer
credit continued to fall in May, while disclosure of a rise in new car sales
last month did little to rally confidence.
At worst, the FT-SE Index was more than 34 points off, although it recovered
slightly by the close. London shied away from the fall of 6.75 on the Dow in
early trading, which indicated that the US market continued to find little
solace in last week's cut in the Federal discount rate.
The FT-SE index ended the day at 2,469 exactly, a loss of 28.1. The market
is still hanging uncomfortably inside the gain of 152 points achieved on
April 10, after the re-election of Mr John Major's Conservative government.
On April 9, polling day, the Footsie closed at 2,436.4; last night, traders
were looking apprehensively at the gap of only 32.6 points left before the
market slumps into its pre-election territory.
Worries regarding corporate activity were emphasised by the failure of Forte
to clinch the sale of its contract catering divisions, announced after the
market closed on Friday.
Union Discount, the UK bill discount and finance house, passed its interim
dividend after announcing a Pounds 15m half-year loss. Asda, the supermarket
group, announced a Pounds 365m loss and elsewhere among consumer issues,
brewery stocks weakened.
But once again, much of the interest was focused around the stock index
futures sector, where several UK securities houses were sellers of the
September contract on the FT-SE Index.
The stock market looked thoroughly demoralised and the only favourable trend
was the absence of selling pressure or, indeed, of investment activity of
any description.
Trading volume was extremely thin; Seaq volume was still below 100m shares
at 11.00am. By the end of the day, volume had reached only 274.8m shares -
'Christmas Eve business', said one trader - compared with 429.9m on Friday.
Daily turnover remained well below Pounds 1bn last week and yesterday was
clearly no better.
Wall Street-orientated stocks, like Rank Organisation, Reuters and Reed
International, took punishment. One of the weakest spots in the market was
ICI, as brokers warned that the company is a victim of the slowdown in world
economies and the share price is held back by awareness that a US house
holds a large stake which it needs to sell in the market.
Among the international blue chips, only BP, still smarting from its recent
misfortunes, managed to hold steady, encouraged by support from investors
taking the view that the downturn has been overdone.

FT  07 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: ICI falls to year's low point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRIS PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS giant ICI, often viewed as the barometer of British corporate
performance, fell to its lowest level this year as sellers re-appeared. The
setback of 35 to 1139p brought it to within easy reach of the range last
seen immediately following the stock market crash of October 1987.
Yesterday's slide was prompted by rumour rather than fact, or, as one dealer
put it: 'There are any number of excuses but no stories.'
The excuse with most substance was the announcement, late last week, that
ICI had agreed a 5.1 per cent pay settlement. This was in line with the
group's big German rivals but there had been some anticipation in the market
that, at a time when margins are being squeezed, it might be lower.
The second excuse related to Goldman Sachs' reputed 10m share stake in ICI,
reportedly bought from Hanson for Pounds 14 a share. There was comment that
Goldman might abandon any hope of getting its money back and may be about to
cut its losses, leaving the market awash with ICI stock.
Finally, some commentators pointed to the failure of Spanish chemical group
Ercros to reschedule Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.12bn) of debt. However, Ercros
is heavily involved in fertilisers, a sector which ICI largely moved out of
last year, and the trading environment of the two companies appears very
different.
Forte setback
A series of downgrades in Forte yesterday followed the hotel group's
decision to pull out of negotiations to sell its catering division,
including the Gardner Merchant subsidiary, which it announced after the
market closed on Friday. The shares fell 6 to 178p in heavy trading of 6m.
Profit forecasts for this year have been pruned by around a fifth to between
Pounds 86m to Pounds 100m, with the company's broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew at
the bottom of the range. While most of the blame was on the dire state of
the UK hotel market, the collapse of negotiations prompted talk of Forte's
growing 'credibility problem' amongst investors.
Meanwhile, the latest names to be linked with Gardner Merchant include KKR,
the New York buy-out specialists, who may try and revive a buy-out with the
Gardner management, and French outside caterers Sodexho - although such a
move would leave Forte with a rump of catering businesses it did not want.
Compass Group, which returned from suspension following the collapse of the
talks, tumbled 46 to 443p.
Asda nervous
Poor results from Asda were expected and the shares remained steady, shading
a halfpenny to 29 1/2 p in below-average volume of 7.5m. Analysts held out
some hope that the group, now under new management, could recover market
share - although tough trading conditions and strong competition meant that
they remained cautious on the stock.
Mr Ian McDougall at Nomura said; 'Asda needs to reposition itself and return
to a more value-for-money approach. But it is up against stiff opposition in
a difficult market. Patience will be needed.'
Glaxo rally
A sharp fall in the price of Glaxo was halted in the afternoon after one US
house was said to have stressed its positive stance on the stock.
Glaxo fell 24 in early trading as dealers hit companies that trade heavily
in New York. The shares recovered to close only 13 off at 649p, with
marketmakers saying that Dr Jonathan Gelles of Wertheim Schroder had issued
a buy note. Dr Gelles was in London for meetings and unavailable for
comment.
Un. Discount fall
Troubled discount house Union Discount almost halved, eventually closing a
net 51 lower at 64p, after the group signalled that it expected to record a
loss of as much as Pounds 15m for the six months to the end of June and that
the interim dividend would be omitted.
Other discount house shares were marked down sharply in the wake of the
Union Discount news.
More downgrades of Burmah Castrol were said to be in the pipeline with the
shares closing a further 7 off at 576p.
Merchant banks, already suffering from the extremely low activity in the
stock market and the dearth of takeover bids and other corporate activity,
were upset by the poor performance of Union Discount's money broking
operation.
SG Warburg, regarded by many as the leading trader in gilts, money markets
and equities in the UK, dropped 5 more to 490p. Kleinwort Benson, another
big trader in UK markets, retreated 23 to 259p, although turnover was a
paltry 275,000 shares. Schroders dropped 23 to 1085p and Hambros 4 to 243p.
Wellcome picked up 6 to 883p as the global book on the share flotation
opened yesterday. Wellcome Trust, which owns around 75 per cent of the
shares, is set to float some 330m of them and analysts are beginning to talk
about a price of between 750p and 800p for the issue. There was also
speculation that the shares were squeezed up as some bears closed their
positions. Meanwhile, Japanese investors are said to be holding fire on
whether or not to invest in the flotation until they see how much interest
there is.
Solid results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle helped the stock stand out in a weak
drinks sector. The shares gained 3 to 463p.
In a weak leisure sector beset by recovery worries, Ladbroke stood out as
Smith New Court recommended buying as concerns over its property interests
had been overdone. The shares edged up a penny to 203p. Elsewhere Rank
Organisation tumbled 20 to 623p ahead of results on Thursday, while a BZW
downgrade hit Thorn EMI, off 17 at 773p.
Container group Tiphook tumbled after it reported figures below analysts'
expectations. The shares fell 54 to 333p after it revealed full-year profits
up Pounds 16m at Pounds 86.4m.
Profit taking and general market sentiment caused a slide in BM Group. The
shares gave up 24 to 121p.
Engineering and industrial manufacturing company TT Group eased 7 to 215p
after it proposed a merger with AB Electronic Products Group in which it had
bought a 6.35 per cent stake. Shares in AB responded by jumping 12 to 90p.

FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Hopes and realities in interest rate
effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE hope of lower interest rates helped Tokyo make a 5.4 per cent gain on
the FT-Actuaries World Indices last week, while the reality of cheaper
credit prompted a round of profit-taking on Wall Street, leaving the US
index only 2.1 per cent higher on the week.
Tokyo's recovery helped the world index rise by 1.9 per cent in local
currency terms; without the Japanese contribution the index would have shown
a gain of 0.8 per cent.
The prospect of lower interest rates in Europe remains muted, however,
following Denmark's 'No' to the Maastricht Treaty in early June.
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, believes that
Germany's overshooting of its M3 target has effectively ruled out a cut in
German interest rates this year. 'This effectively constrains action in
other centres which need easing more,' he says.
Last Sunday the Bank of Italy was obliged to raise its discount rate to
defend the lira, which had fallen steeply the previous week on devaluation
fears. The weak currency and bond markets deepened the depression in the
stock market, which dropped 4.1 per cent last week to its lowest level since
February 1988.
Kleinwort Benson believes the market has over-reacted to a spate of bad news
and that the underexposure of both domestic and foreign investors, as well
as the low trading volume, suggest that it is worth being contrarian on a 12
to 18-month view. 'We believe that it's worth picking up some of the stock
currently being oversold,' the broker says in its latest report.
Mexico provided the second-best performance of the week, recovering 4.7 per
cent after its recent fall. Latin American Securities says the market
reacted positively to the postponement of the Banacci share offer, and to
news that the US and Mexico had reached a preliminary agreement to
liberalise their trade in financial services.

FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains
in sharply reduced volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices failed to sustain mid-afternoon gains and the Nikkei average
closed marginally lower in sharply reduced trading, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index fell 60.71 to 16,657.07 after a low of 16,624.75 and a high of
16,852.17. Dealers' purchases of speculative theme stocks pushed the Nikkei
higher in the afternoon, but it declined as the buying failed to spark
interest among institutional investors.
Volume fell to 150m shares from 337m. Declines led advances by 530 to 397
with 171 unchanged, and the Topix index lost 6.01 to 1,287.54, its first
decline in five days. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.44 to
1,009.36.
Institutions remained lethargic, citing the Munich summit and a possible cut
in the discount rate as reasons for their inactivity.
'There seems to be some movement behind the scenes towards an imminent cut
in the official discount rate,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life.
However, Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, analyst at Nikko Research Institute, said
further monetary easing would not push prices higher. 'A lot of investors
are sceptical, since the past four cuts in the discount rate have not helped
the market,' he said.
Speculative theme stocks were traded actively by dealers trying to increase
trading volume. Two environment-friendly stocks, Taiyo Fishery and Nippon
Formula Feed, rose Y29 to Y520 and Y15 to Y755 respectively after they
announced plans to breed blue fin tuna.
Toyama Chemical and Green Cross lost initial gains. Investors had bought the
stocks on reports that the companies are jointly developing an anti-Aids
drug. Toyama fell Y14 to Y751 and Green Cross lost Y30 to Y1,040.
Fujitsu declined Y27 to Y606 on reports that the company might suffer an 80
per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y5bn for the first six months to
September.
Brokerage houses were weak, with Nomura Securities down Y20 to Y1,290 and
Nikko Securities losing Y30 to Y561. Investors were discouraged by Nomura's
plans to reduce its staff by 2,000 over the next five years.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 124.83 to 19,567.41 in volume of 7m shares.
Roundup
APART from Hong Kong, where trading was extremely lively, turnover in the
region was thin. Bombay remained inactive as a brokers' boycott entered its
fifth week.
HONG KONG hit an afternoon wave of profit-taking and registered its third
consecutive loss in extremely active trading, the Hang Seng Index sinking
37.08 to 6,024.77 as turnover rose HKDollars 2bn to HKDollars 6.1bn.
Property shares turned in the biggest losses after last week's HKDollars
3.2bn private placing by Sun Hung Kai. Late selling was fuelled by rumours
of covered warrants being issued for Dairy Farm International.
SEOUL dropped to a four-year low in thin trading, the composite index
falling 9.69 to 535.72 on rumours of small company business failures and on
declining deposits with brokerage houses.
Turnover fell to Won108.7bn from Friday's Won138.2bn. An estimated Won10bn
was withdrawn from brokerage house deposits of Won1,200bn.
NEW ZEALAND climbed on falling domestic interest rates, the NZSE-40 index
putting on 17.18 to 1,559.07 in turnover down from NZDollars 22.7m to
NZDollars 21.9m.
Fletcher Challenge, seen as a particular beneficiary of falling interest
rates because of its relatively high dividend yield, gained 5 cents to
NZDollars 3.53 in volume of 867,000 shares.
MANILA rose in light dealings as bargain-hunting lifted selected stocks.
Philippine National Bank gained 2.50 pesos to 330 as the composite index
ended 19.17 higher at 1,496.33.
AUSTRALIA went extremely quiet, turnover dwindling from ADollars 183m to
ADollars 118m as the All Ordinaries index rose just 0.4 to 1,663.6.
Brokers said the market was quiet in anticipation of a domestic easing of
monetary policy as early as today. Equity raisings were also blamed for the
thin business, as funds are being kept aside for such contingencies.
SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR moved little, the Straits Times Industrial index
easing 3.59 to 1,480.51, and the KLSE composite index closing just 0.33
lower at 595.75.
Volume at the SES was estimated at around 24m shares, one of the lightest
trading days this year. An early firmness based on gains in Singapore
Airlines (SIA) stock gave way in mid-morning as profit-taking in
index-linked stocks overwhelmed the 40-cent SIA rise.
BANGKOK's SET index fell 7.24 to 731.62 on turnover of Bt2.7bn. Turnover has
not fallen below Bt3bn since June 10, just before Anand Panyarachun was
re-named prime minister.
DHAKA fell ahead of a 48-hour industrial strike due to start today. The
all-share index fell 4.09 to 382.4 in turnover of Tk3.48m after Tk2.18m.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money market ended slightly firmer yesterday as
traders realised that the Bank of England would not be repeating Friday's
decision to trim its dealing rates for longer dated bills.
There was initial speculation in the market that the Bank would reduce the
rates at which it deals in Bands 3 and 4 by  1/32 per cent, gradually
signalling a base rate cut. The authorities had used a similar ploy in May
to signal the  1/2 per cent cut to 10 per cent.
However, the Bank did not invite any offers for longer dated bills
yesterday, dealing only in Bands 1 and 2 at the established rate of 9 7/8
per cent, and carrying out repurchase agreements (repos) also at the
established rate of 9 15/16 per cent.
At least one discount house trader suggested that the Bank had originally
set out to signal a cut in rates on Friday, and that it still intends to do
so in the not-too-distant future. 'I find it hard to believe that Friday's
operation was purely technical,' he said. 'It came the day after the Fed's
half per cent cut, which made the Bank of England's cut all the more price
sensitive.'
If this interpretation is correct, two factors may have forced the Bank to
stay its hand. One was the Bank of Italy's decision at the weekend to raise
its discount rate by a full percentage point to 13 per cent. The other would
have been sterling's weak position at the bottom of the EMS grid.
Rates therefore ended the day firmer across the board. 3-month money closed
at 9 15/16 per cent from 9 13/16 per cent on Friday night and 6-month money
was up at 9 7/8 per cent from 9 13/16 per cent. One trader suggested that
the clearing banks deliberately wanted to keep money tight yesterday, having
issued a lot of money into the market on Friday on expectation of a base
rate cut.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn. In the morning, it
purchased Pounds 34m of Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 200m in repos for
resale on 29 July. The Bank then purchased another Pounds 349m in repos. In
the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 198m of Band 1 bank bills and
Pounds 199m in Band 2. It provided late assistance of Pounds 45m.
Sterling futures dipped sharply as news filtered through that the Bank was
not signalling a rate cut. After opening at 90.34, the September contract
dipped to a low of 90.24, closing at 90.25.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips in wake of rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR again slipped on the foreign exchanges yesterday, undermined by
last week's half a percentage point cut in US interest rates and uncertainty
over the US economy, writes James Blitz.
On a day with no important indicators emerging from the US, the tone of
dollar trading was set by last Thursday's cut in US interest rates. Many
dealers wonder whether the US is entering a triple dip recession after the
fourth consecutive month of declining housing starts and rising
unemployment. The dollar ended the day at DM1.5130 down from a previous
close of DM1.5170.
There is every reason to think that the dollar could now test its low of
DM1.4405, last seen in February 1991. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Yamaichi International in London, believes that dollar depreciation could
even be part of the US authorities' strategy, aimed at boosting export
growth.
He said that the room for manoeuvre in US fiscal policy is now limited by
the Dollars 400bn budget deficit, while monetary policy is also hampered by
the fact that interest rates are at their lowest point for 29 years. 'The
only other instrument the US authorities have to hand is exchange rates,' he
says.
The D-Mark remained strong in European trading, despite suggestions that
Germany will come under heavy pressure at this week's G7 meeting in Munich
to reduce interest rates. Mr Nicholar Brady, the US Treasury Secretary,
recently said that he would welcome a cut in German and Japanese rates and
that Germany's recent moves on fiscal policy make this a more likely
prospect.
However, dealers remained sceptical that Germany will yield, and the D-Mark
ended up against the French Franc at DM29.68 per 100 Francs from a previous
close of DM29.70. It was helped by continuing turmoil created by the French
lorry drivers' dispute. Sterling suffered more, dropping half a pfennig to
DM2.8900. The lira fared better, supported by the latest rise in Italian
interest rates. It closed at L756.10 to the D-Mark from a close on Friday
night of L757.50.
Sterling's already weak position was further undermined after the Bank of
Portugal gave a clear signal yesterday that Portuguese interest rates will
start to fall. The Bank cut the remuneration rate on bank's obligatory
deposits with the central bank from 15.375 per cent to 14.5 per cent.
Because the Portuguese escudo is the strongest currency in the European
Monetary System's grid, its reduction in rates will lower the effective
floor to which sterling, the weakest currency, can fall before central banks
must intervene.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond sales depressed 'but
outlook brightening'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIAMOND SALES remained severely depressed in the first half of this year but
the outlook was brightening and the industry had its stock levels and bank
borrowing under firm control. That was the message yesterday from the
Central Selling Organisation through which De Beers of South Africa controls
80 per cent of world rough (uncut) diamond trade.
The CSO's sales dropped 14 per cent in the half-year compared with the same
months of 1991 to USDollars 1.787bn. Sales were nearly 28 per cent below the
peak of Dollars 2.477bn seen in the first half of 1990 and at their lowest
since the first six months of 1987.
In volume terms the fall was much steeper because there were price increases
in March 1989 (15.5 per cent) and 1990 (5.5 per cent). Also the first half
of last year was badly affected by the Gulf war, which cut sales to Israel,
and by the Indian cutting houses being unable to pay for diamonds because of
that country's temporary foreign exchange crisis.
The first-half fall was in line with a forecast made by Mr Julian Ogilvie
Thompson, De Beers' chairman, in April when he predicted a 15 per cent drop.
The CSO said yesterday Mr Ogilvie Thompson still expected second-half sales
to be better than the Dollars 1.843bn achieved in July-December 1991.
Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg financial services group,
suggested that the CSO sales 'look surprisingly good, given the state of the
world economy'.
The CSO said it restricted sales to clients in the early part of 1992 to
stabilise the market. There were now 'encouraging' signs in the US retail
diamond jewellery market but Japan was looking weaker. Each market accounts
for about 30 per cent of diamond jewellery retail sales. European jewellery
sales were unchanged.
Recovery might be slowed, however, by the impact on market sentiment of
smuggling from Angola. The CSO estimated that the unofficial flow of rough
diamonds from Angola was running at an annual Dollars 400m. Most were ending
up in Antwerp where the CSO was doing its best to mop them up to add to its
steadily-increasing stockpile.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investors lose interest in
Brazil's mining prospects - Bill Hinchberger reports a sharp drop in
spending on the quest for mineral deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN investment in mineral research and prospecting may reach only
Dollars 40m this year, one-third of what was spent in 1988, according to Mr
Arthur Schultz Junior, head of the research department of the Companhia de
Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais, a state-owned prospecting company.
Given an average lead time of about eight years until exploitation, Brazil
could be faced with a severe drop in mineral output by the beginning of the
next century if the trend is not reversed. 'High potential and low
production' is the obvious result, in the words of Mr Samuel A. Hanan,
director-vice president of Paranapanema, the world's largest tin exporter
and Brazil's largest private mining company.
Three factors are blamed for the depressed investment climate: the extended
domestic economic downturn, depressed international prices for most minerals
in recent years, and a clause in the country's 1988 constitution that
prohibits foreign capital from holding majority interest in mining
operations in most cases.
Mr Schultz's prediction is an extrapolation of data from two recent CPRM
studies on investment in the Brazilian mining sector. They show that in
1990, the last year for which firm figures are available, Dollars 46.2m was
spent to discover mineral deposits in Brazil. In Canada, a country of
comparable size and mining potential, some Dollars 1bn is invested annually,
about Dollars 100 per sq km. In Brazil, just Dollars 5.40 is spent per sq
km.
Private domestic companies reduced their investment in mining research from
Dollars 53.4m in 1988 to Dollars 19.6m in 1990. State-controlled companies
accounted for Dollars 30.8m in 1988 and Dollars 24.4m two years later.
Over the same period, investment by multinational companies fell even more
dramatically, from Dollars 37.5m to Dollars 2.2m. Many foreign companies are
waiting to see if constitutional changes backed by President Fernando Collor
de Mello will be approved by parliament. An amendment that would eliminate
ownership restrictions for foreigners was offered as part of the president's
1991 package of constitutional reforms but congress has taken no action on
that proposal. Foreign mining interests and administration officials now
seem to be looking forward to the mandated 1993 revision of the
constitution.
The foreign ownership clause is like 'swimming against the tide of history,'
says Mr Schultz, who adds that Brazilian companies have a limited investment
capacity and cannot develop the country's vast mineral resources alone.
Under the current constitution, foreigners may maintain majority control of
a mining company in Brazil if they undertake 'industrial' activities.
Enabling legislation that would define what qualifies as industrialisation
is still lacking and lawyers are not sure if it means mere enhancement or
more elaborate processing.
Bucking the downward trend in foreign mining investment is RTZ's subsidiary,
RTZ Mineracao Brasil. Already the majority partner in a gold mining joint
venture, RTZ is studying two additional projects. One is a nickel mine at
Fortaleza das Minas, in Minas Gerais state. It is also negotiating a
proposed joint venture with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled
company, to exploit the Salobo copper deposit in the Carajas region of the
Amazon. The company's budget for exploration and prospecting this year is
Dollars 6m, says Mr Apolinar Guzman, managing director and chief executive
officer.
Besides lobbying for its proposed constitutional amendment, the Collor
administration is taking other measures to stimulate investment in mining.
One is approval by the Securities Commission of equity funds for mining
firms listed on the country's stock exchanges. The scheme, based on Canada's
'floater shares' programme, is expected to raise Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m,
says Mr Elmer Prata Salomao, director of the National Department of Mineral
Production (DNPM). 'It will guarantee that shares in companies that are
prospecting have liquidity.'
The second initiative is to pool information and resources at the federal
and state levels and share them with companies that hold mining permits in
relevant regions. The first such effort will be in the Rio das Velhas region
in Minas Gerais state, the site of a potential gold deposit, says Mr
Salomao.
He adds that his department has prepared a deregulation package for the
mining sector that is expected to be presented to parliament shortly.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Mad cow disease' hits UK
cattle sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 26 countries including the US, Japan, Russia and Austria are now
refusing to import British cattle because of concerns over 'mad cow' disease
or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the government has admitted.
Responding to a parliamentary written question from Mr David Clark, shadow
agriculture minister, Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, also
revealed that 19 countries were declining to accept British boneless beef.
The agriculture minister said Britain planned to press these countries to
accept conditions recently set out by the Office Internationale des
Epizooties - a worldwide veterinary organisation - so that 'trade in these
products may resume'.
He said the OIE general assembly recently gave its unanimous endorsement to
advice that trade with the UK in the above products was safe 'subject to
certain conditions'. Many of the countries which had instituted import bans
were OIE members.

London COCOA prices pulled back from earlier two-month highs. Dealers said
the market was active but unable to sustain an early advance above Pounds
600 a tonne for the September contract, relinquishing some of the gains to
profit taking and technical selling. The market now needs a period of
technical consolidation. There was also a lack of manufacturer interest
which, if maintained, leaves the market vulnerable to origin selling,
dealers said. New York arabica COFFEE futures were sharply down at midday
amid speculation that producers who did not sell before last month's ICO
meeting would soon return to the market. Most base metals were easing at the
close on the LME after Comex COPPER quickly lost its post-holiday gains,
undermining prices in London. Traders said that as a large part of the
recent rise in base metals had been due to expectations of a recovery in the
US economy, the performance of the Comex copper contract was being watched
closely by traders in all metals. GOLD and PLATINUM pushed higher in modest
trade on the London bullion market with an upbeat, but cautious resumption
of US trading after Friday's holiday.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal prices continue downwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COAL prices are continuing to fall steadily as the return of South
Africa to the market adds to existing oversupply.
South African coal is now selling at about Dollars 26 a tonne and can be
delivered to Europe at less than Dollars 32 a tonne. Only a few months ago
many European buyers made contracts for coal at this level, free on board at
South Africa's Richards Bay terminal.
South Africa's return to markets in France, Denmark and the US is only part
of the problem in the severely over-supplied market. In addition to millions
of tonnes of uncontracted South African coal looking for buyers, the former
Soviet Union has been pushing coal through export terminals in the Baltic
and the Black Sea. Some traders have been forced to ship coal from these
ports because of congestion, even though no buyers have been found. As a
result Russian coal can be delivered into the UK for Dollars 37 a tonne,
compared with Dollars 45 at the start of this year.
If anything, the situation is likely to worsen with the rapid expansion of
Indonesian exports now beginning to get into its stride and, from next
month, the start of big ship (Capesize) loading at a second Colombian port
in Santa Marta from one of Colombia's private coal exporters, Prodeco.
The international market for steam coal is continuing to expand rapidly  - a
path it has been on since the mid-1970s. Last year, when 195.3m tonnes was
traded, over I5m tonnes was added to export volumes. By the end of this
decade this is expected to have risen to well in excess of 320m tonnes. The
trouble is that new mine development and, perhaps more importantly,
expansion of output, at existing mines through better equipment and more
flexible work practices, have proved more than a match for the pace of
expanding demand.
The great brake on excess production in years gone by has been strikes, with
major disruptions in Australia, Poland and the US having kept price
collapses at bay. Years of industrial peace, have banished this to the past.
It is a reflection of the inability of the industry to keep itself in
balance that reports of a likely major strike in the US early next year is
being treated as the solitary ray of hope.
Such hope may prove unfounded, however. A major shut-out at one of Canada's
major coking coal pits (Westar), coupled with a strike at another (Fording),
combined with a roof-fall halting production at New South Wales' Kembla Coal
and Coke, have failed to lift coking coal prices as much as 1 cent.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Hanson launches Pounds 400m issue to
pay off bank debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN active session in the Eurobond market yesterday was dominated by issues
in sterling, dollars and Canadian dollars.
In the sterling sector, Hanson, the UK conglomerate, launched a Pounds 400m
issue of 10 per cent bonds due 2006, which could set the scene for further
UK corporate financing.
The proceeds of the issue, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, will be used
to repay existing bank debt.
Few UK companies have tapped the sterling market as many still expect yields
to fall further. 'UK companies tend to take the view that a 10 per cent
coupon at 10 years or longer is expensive,' one banker said.
But expectations of substantially lower rates in the near-term have dimmed
since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty. While most analysts
still believe that there is room for a further decrease in yields after the
French referendum in September, there is a new element of risk - failure to
ratify the Maastricht treaty - which could send funding costs in the
sterling market rocketing. However, despite yield spreads over gilts at
historically tight levels, most companies are likely to continue to wait for
lower rates.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson said the financing costs appeared
'reasonable. The deal (was offered) at only a fractionally higher cost than
our short-term bank debt.' However, the size of Hanson's balance sheet, with
a market capitalisation of Pounds 10bn and gross debt of Pounds 9.5bn, makes
its strategic approach rather different from other companies.
The Pounds 400m deal was fungible with an illiquid Pounds 100m issue, of
which Pounds 50m was repurchased by Hanson in 1990. Although a number of UK
institutions complained at the reopening of a deal which had previously been
partly repurchased, they were not deterred from buying paper. However, the
large size of the deal means that it is expected to take some time to place,
despite surprisingly strong interest from overseas investors, who do not
normally buy long-dated Eurosterling bonds.
A Pounds 200m 10-year deal for the Province of Ontario, priced to yield 27
basis points above the comparable gilt yield, was considered on the
expensive side. The most notable aspect of the deal was that it formed part
of a back-to-back swap with a CDollars 450m 10-year deal for the European
Investment Bank. Given the current poor availability of opportunities, the
swap allowed both borrowers access to a fresh investor base while meeting
their precise funding requirements. The EIB took fixed-rate sterling and the
Province of Ontario fixed-rate Canadian dollars.
Dealers said that the EIB's CDollars 450m deal, priced to yield 15 basis
points over the 10-year government bond yield, was well received. Both the
swap and the deals were arranged by Salomon Brothers. Also in the Canadian
dollar sector, the Tokyo Electric Power Company launched a CDollars 500m
five-year deal, via Goldman Sachs. The deal was considered attractively
priced to yield 48 basis points above the five-year Canadian government bond
yield, and met strong demand.
In the dollar sector, Canada's Export Development Corporation launched a
Dollars 300m seven-year deal and International Telecommunications Satellite,
an agency owned by 124 member-countries, launched a Dollars 200m 10-year
deal, both arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston. Intelsat's debut offering
in the Eurobond market was particularly well received, with the yield spread
tightening to 37 basis points from 40 basis points at launch. Expectations
that the tide is about to turn for the dollar, combined with last week's
rate cut, are underpinning the dollar sector.
If the bullish tone holds, the World Bank is expected to launch its Dollars
1.5bn global bond offering tomorrow for pricing on Thursday. The deal,
arranged by Merrill Lynch and IBJ, is expected to have a five year maturity.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Activity in bond market to
continue, OECD report says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pace of activity in the international bond markets is not expected to
ease in the second half of the year after a record first six months,
according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's
latest Financial Market Trends report, published yesterday.
'The issue calendar remains hefty . . . benefiting from borrowers' needs to
proceed with the refinancing of maturing debt, which is likely to exceed
Dollars 190bn for the year as a whole,' the report states.
The OECD expects modest economic recovery combined with further decreasing
inflation to allow for 'some downward adjustment of long-term interest
rates,' which will help underpin business activity in the international
markets.
In the wake of turbulent market conditions caused by the Danish rejection of
the Maastricht Treaty, the OECD points to 'some re-orientation of flows
across market compartments' rather than any contraction in the overall
availability of investible funds.
However, while the OECD believes that an overall advance in borrowing
volumes of 5 to 7 per cent, in line with the underlying trend since the late
1980s, is 'attainable,' the decline in syndicated lending is unlikely to be
reversed.
'Underlying demand/supply conditions support a further, though perhaps not
spectacular, growth in securities business while banks' heavy emphasis on
risk containment should limit severely the scope for recovery of syndicated
lending,' the report says.
The OECD report also points to a further expansion of the Euro-note market,
where outstandings now exceed Dollars 160bn. '(Its) strong growth has been
accompanied by a remarkable broadening of the investor base and a
significant strengthening of infrastructure.' The market no longer compares
unfavourably with the corresponding market in the US, according to the
report.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chilean private pensions act as
a magnet - Leslie Crawford reports on the way foreign fund management groups
are moving in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S experiment with private pension funds is proving a strong attraction
to foreign investment.
Three European groups are entering the business this year: Banco Santander
of Spain and L'Union des Assurances de Paris and Les Mutuelles du Mans
Assurance of France.
They will be joining Bankers Trust, Aetna and American Insurance, all of
which set up their own Chilean companies, known as Administradoras de Fondos
de Pensiones (AFPs), in the mid-1980s.
The newcomers have two main reasons for establishing themselves. Managing
pension funds is profitable: Chile's 14 AFPs enjoyed a 48 per cent return on
assets last year. The newcomers also are gaining a Latin American base in
readiness for business elsewhere on the continent.
Mexico, Peru and Argentina are presently drafting legislation to replace or
complement their state systems with private retirement schemes; other
countries may soon follow suit.
Governments across Latin America are finally admitting that they can no
longer provide adequate pensions, after decades in which state pension funds
were plundered to finance government spending or plug budget deficits.
Social security reform could open up a market of hundreds of millions of
savers.
The reforms are being modelled after the Chilean system. This requires all
workers to save a minimum of 10 per cent of their earnings with an AFP of
their choice.
The AFPs now manage Dollars 12bn worth of funds, the equivalent of about
one-third of Chile's GDP.
The new system is still accruing faster than it is paying out in pensions.
AFPs are growing at around Dollars 200m a month and as a result have become
the nation's largest institutional investors.
In short, they are the engine fuelling the development of Chile's capital
markets.
Banco Santander's AFP starts up this month with an initial capital of
Dollars 12m. It has a target of 55,000 customers in the next three years.
L'Union des Assurances de Paris has side-stepped the problem of starting
from scratch by buying into AFP Libertador, which is partly owned by the
Swiss Schmidheiny group.
Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurance, which already owns an insurance company in
Chile, has not yet decided whether it wants to start its own AFP or buy into
an existing pension management company.
Chile's Superintendency of AFPs has also given the green light to four new
domestic pension funds.  Significantly, they are being set up by trade
unions, in this case in the banking, baking, electricity and petrol
distribution industries.  Chile's copper mining supervisors already own an
AFP. Chilean trade unions see AFPs as a new way of influencing company
decisions.
The seven new AFPs entering the market this year are expected to unleash a
fierce battle for customers in what is already a highly competitive
business. The law allows Chileans to switch AFPs up to four times a year,
and over 450,000 people, 10 per cent of the workforce, do so each year. This
freedom of choice is the bedrock of the Chilean system, despite the fact
that it creates an administrative nightmare for pension management
companies.
Mr Julio Bustamante, the AFP superintendent, believes that there is ample
room for the new AFPs. 'Our main challenge is how to win over 700,000
people, mainly self-employed or migrant workers, who have no pension cover,'
he says.
The responsibility for finding new investment horizons for the system also
falls on Mr Bustamante's shoulders. His main problem is that the Dollars
12bn-worth of assets now handled by AFPs totally outweighs their investment
options in Chile.
Provida, the largest AFP owned by Bankers Trust, with 1.2m savers and funds
worth Dollars 2.3bn, complains that there are not enough companies on
Santiago's small bourse to invest in.
Last month, Mr Bustamante authorised AFPs to invest up to 1.5 per cent of
their portfolios abroad, after a heated public debate on whether Chile could
afford to export its national savings. The superintendent also authorised
AFPs to take part in project finance. This, he hopes, will reduce Chile's
dependence on foreign credit for investments in public works,
telecommunications, hydroelectric dams and the mining industry.
So far the response of AFPs has been lukewarm. Their main demand is to be
allowed to broaden the equity content of their portfolios. Under present
law, AFPs cannot own more than 7 per cent of a company, and equities cannot
account for more than 30 per cent of overall portfolios. Mr Bustamante
believes it would be unwise to expand these ratios.
'I am challenging the AFPs,' Mr Bustamante says. 'They will have to hire
international brokers to invest abroad, and create project finance
departments to study new investments in Chile.

TURKEY'S privatisation programme is being relaunched with the sale of 11
state cement companies representing around 18 per cent of Turkish cement
production.
Bids, which have to be in by July 24, are expected to raise between Dollars
350m and Dollars 400m. Both Turkish and foreign groups are understood to be
lining up offers.
Societe Ciments Francais, which is now part-owned by Italcementi of Italy,
and Lafarge Coppee are understood to be among foreign groups keen to bid.
Holderbank of Switzerland, Blue Circle of the UK and Loma Negra, the
Argentine privately-owned company, are also expected to make an offer,
together with Sabanci, Turkey's leading industrial group, and Oyak, the
armed forces pension fund.
The two Turkish groups together already control 30 per cent of the Turkish
cement market.
Turkish cement sales on the domestic market are around 24m tonnes a year, or
about the same size as France and Spain. Exports are less than 1m tonnes.
The market is growing by 3 to 5 per cent annually, in spite of a slowdown in
the economy.
The Turkish plants up for sale are at Adiyaman, Askale, Bartin, Corum,
Denizli, Gaziantep, Iskenderum, Ladik Sivas, Sanliurfa and Trabzon.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: New receivers appointed at IBH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewery, came into clearer
focus yesterday with the appointment of receivers to the group's leading
shareholder, International Brewing Holdings (IBH).
The appointment means two sets of receivers have now been appointed to IBH,
which is controlled by Mr John Elliott, Foster's former managing director.
IBH owns 38 per cent of Foster's.
Last night's appointment by Wardley Australia as agent for a consortium of
creditor banks known as the Vextin syndicate, takes precedence over
receivers earlier appointed by Broken Hill Proprietary, which is also a
leading IBH creditor.
BHP has been negotiating to buy out Vextin's ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890m)
debt exposure to IBH since appointing its own IBH receivers on June 2. But a
number of complex disagreements have apparently arisen.
Vextin's hand may also have been forced by last week's court action by
another group with IBH exposure, the National Mutual Life Association, to
have the BHP receivers removed.
A Wardley spokesman said last night it would have been normal for Vextin, as
IBH's first mortgagee, to appoint a receiver as soon as BHP made its
appointment.
'The syndicate initially delayed taking this step to allow discussions to
continue. The legal and commercial complexities involved, however, mean the
discussions have taken longer than expected.
'This, in turn, has created a period of uncertainty which doesn't serve the
interests of any of the parties involved and the syndicate felt it should
draw that period to a close,' Wardley said.
Vextin's receiver yesterday moved to squash speculation that his appointment
could lead to a quick sale of IBH's stake in Foster's.
BHP had earlier said there would be no fire sale of the shares and the
company was prepared to purchase and hold them, if necessary, until a
suitable buyer could be found.
Asia Pacific Breweries has acquired an interest in Austotel Trust Australia,
which owns a chain of pubs in Australia, Reuter reports from Singapore.
The deal was completed through a joint venture equally owned by Asia
Breweries and New Zealand's Brierly Investments.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nachi-Fujikoshi reverses
forecast to Y2bn loss

NACHI-FUJIKOSHI, a leading Japanese maker of bearings and cutting tools,
yesterday forecast a pre-tax loss of Y2bn (Dollars 16m) for the year ended
November 1992, reversing a previously forecast profit of Y2bn because of
slower demand from the car industry and losses on securities holdings.
The company has revised its sales forecast from Y160bn to Y141bn, against
Y167bn last year, and expects that sales for the first half to the end of
May will total Y71.2bn, compared with Y84.3bn for the same period last year.
Like most other Japanese suppliers of machine tools and components,
Nachi-Fujikoshi has been under pressure from the deeper-than-expected
downturn and the slower-than-expected recovery in sectors such as the car
industry.
But, as with many other companies, Nachi-Fujikoshi has been unable to turn
to the stock market for help, as it has in the past.
Instead of cashing in unrealised gains on its stock holdings, Nachi is
expected to report an appraisal loss of Y5.7bn for the first half.
The loss on stock holdings is cited as the main cause of a Y6.5bn after-tax
loss forecast for the six months, though the company hopes that it will
break even over the year.
However, Nachi-Fujikoshi indicated that the second-half improvement would
come from the sale of securities and land holdings, which presumes a
recovery in the weak stock and property markets.

BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyre and sports goods company, has forecast a 27
per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y27bn (Dollars 216m) for the six months
to June 1992, reflecting the downturn in the domestic car industry.
The company also revised downwards its forecast for full-year profits from
Y73bn to Y70bn as it and most other manufacturers are accepting that the
hoped-for recovery of the Japanese economy is likely to be delayed until at
least late in the year.
Sales for the first half are expected to total Y340bn, down from an earlier
estimate of Y355bn and from the Y348bn reported last year, with sales of car
and truck tyres falling in line with production cutbacks by Japanese
manufacturers.
Domestic demand for sports goods, in particular, golf clubs and tennis
equipment, has slowed, and export earnings have been bruised by the recent
appreciation of the yen.
The company has profited from the shift towards studless tyres for winter
driving and expects that production of this model will increase later this
year. But the most serious problem remains the weak domestic demand for new
cars, which has also hurt demand for its rubber components for the motor
industry.
Until June, new car registrations had fallen in Japan for 13 consecutive
months, and parts suppliers are hoping that a 0.5 per cent increase last
month is an indication that demand will strengthen in coming months.
But signs are that recovery will be slow and most Japanese companies are
likely to be forced to announce downward profit revisions, as predictions
had been founded on expectations of a quick recovery.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, yesterday said the economy was
still in an 'adjustment phase', suggesting that even the generally
optimistic central bank was reassessing its forecasts for an upturn.

provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH banks face another round of high provisions this year because of the
precarious state of the property market, according to the Association
Francaise des Banques.
Mr Dominique Chatillon, chairman of the AFB, warned the French banks in a
paper published yesterday that the provisions made for 1991 were
'insufficient' and that they were likely to have to make further substantial
write-offs this year.
The main problems, said Mr Chatillon, were the high rate of business
failures - a situation that some observers suspect could be aggravated by
the disruption caused by the current lorry drivers' dispute - and the weak
state of the property sec-tor.
France's property market, particularly in Paris, has been weak for the past
two years. Mr Chatillon said there were signs of a 'very slight improvement'
in the residential sector, but commercial property was still in the
doldrums.
The French banks are significant investors in the property sector and a
number of them, notably Paribas, the investment banking group, were forced
to make large provisions on property losses last year.
The weak state of the property market is also expected to affect French
insurance groups which have significant property holdings.
At the same time, the banks are under pressure because of the competitive
state of the domestic banking market, where margins are coming under
pressure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber's second-quarter net income is expected to be at the
high end of analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 1.40 per share,
according to Mr Stanley Gault, the group's chief executive, Reuter reports
from Ohio.
Mr Gault added that the US group stood a good chance of posting record sales
for the quarter and first half.
'We are going to be in that range, and hopefully we are going to be at the
upper end of it,' he said in an interview.
'The people who have been in the lower range of the estimates will be
surprised.'
As for sales, he said: 'We're very hopeful we will be able to announce
record sales for the quarter. And if that is true, and that looks positive,
that would enable us to have recorded record sales for the first half of the
year,' he said.
The group's previous second-quarter sales record was Dollars 2.87bn in 1990.
It also set a first-half sales record in that year of Dollars 5.56bn.
In last year's second quarter, net income amounted Dollars 22.5m or Dollars
0.38 a share on sales of Dollars 2.79bn.
Mr Gault said he expected the gains to continue. 'We are having an excellent
year,' he added.
Asset sales and improved sales of replacement tyres were the reasons for the
strong quarter.
He said consumers had begun buying replacement tyres after having delayed
replacing tyres during the recession. 'We're seeing the release of this pent
up demand,' Mr Gault maintained.
Goodyear will announce its 1992 second-quarter results on July 26.
Mr Gault also said Goodyear was holding most of a 2.5 to 5.0 per cent price
increase it announced in May.
'We think a pretty good portion of that will stick,' he declared.
He also said there was a good chance that Goodyear would seek another price
hike.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: US Prudential arranges Dollars
1bn Euro MTN programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Funding Corporation, the finance subsidiary of Prudential
Insurance of America, has established a Dollars 1bn multi-currency
Euro-medium-term note programme in an effort to expand its institutional
investor base in Europe.
The programme, arranged by Merrill Lynch International, will be used as an
alternative to the Eurobond market, where the Prudential, the largest US
insurance company, has been a regular borrower.
However, the fast-growing Euro-medium-term note market 'provides greater
flexibility,' said Mr Martin Pfinsgraff, managing director of the Prudential
corporate finance group.
'We (will be) able to access smaller windows.'
Prudential, the largest US insurance company, has also increased the size of
its existing Euro-commercial paper programme from Dollars 500m to Dollars
1bn.
There is less than Dollars 300m outstanding on the programme.
Last year, the company raised Dollars 700m in the Eurobond market, mainly in
Canadian dollars, subsequently swapping the proceeds into floating-rate US
dollars; but swap opportunities have been on the wane, and the company has
raised only Dollars 250m in the Eurobond market so far this year.
Overall, Prudential plans to raise around Dollars 700m this year, split
between the Eurobond and Euro-medium-term note markets. The Euromarket is an
attractive source of funding for Prudential, because, as a mutual company,
it is not registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and so
cannot tap the US corporate bond market.
Last year, the company raised about Dollars 400m in the US MTN (medium-term
note) market, but its main source of funds is the US domestic commercial
paper market, where it is the ninth-largest issuer, with Dollars 6.6 to
Dollars 7.5bn outstanding.
'We are aiming to reduce (short-term borrowing) as a percentage of our total
debt,' said Mr Pfinsgraff.
The goal is a ratio of one third long-term versus two-thirds short-term
debt; the company currently has around 23 per cent long-term debt.
However, the shift does not require any reduction in the total amount of
short-term debt, as the company's overall funding needs are increasing.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Mexican bank privatisations
raise Dollars 12.9bn
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has privatised its eighteenth and last bank by
selling 66.3 per cent of the shares in Banco del Centro for 869,381m pesos
(Dollars 279m).
The bank privatisations will have raised 38,665bn pesos (Dollars 12.9bn)
when all payments are made, far more than the government and independent
analysts expected.
The average bank was sold for 3.068 times book value and 14.75 historic
earnings. In the US and Europe, banks are typically sold for 2.2 times book
value and 14 times historic earnings, according to the Mexican Finance
Ministry.
The government sold 70.7 per cent of Banamex, the largest bank by assets,
for 9,706bn pesos; 56 per cent of Bancomer, the second largest, for 8,559bn
pesos; and 51 per cent of Serfin for 2,827bn pesos The most expensive bank
relative to earnings was Banorie, which went for a multiple of 23.7.
The bank sales appear to have been free of the corruption and string-pulling
that have plagued many developing-country privatisations.
However, questions were raised when the winning bidder for Banco Somex
pulled out, after his investors, whom he refused to name, balked at the
price he was to pay. The bank was immediately awarded to the second highest
bidder.
The privatisations have also been criticised for concentrating wealth and
power in the hands of a few rich Mexicans.
Several Mexican businessmen hold key interests and directorships in a series
of banks to add to their already extensive industrial holdings. Rather than
sell off shares in the banks through large public offerings, as El Salvador
is doing, the Mexican government chose to auction off the banks to
investment groups.
These investor groups were usually headed by owners of brokerages. The
banks's owners have for the most part formed financial groups, housing their
banks, brokerages, and other financial companies under one roof in the
belief that this would give them competitive advantages.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Strategy for Next generation of
workstations - Alan Cane assesses the challenge facing the US computer
group's new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Peter van Cuylenburg harbours any lingering resentment about being
passed over for the top job at Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications
company, he hides it well.
His enthusiasm for his new company, Next Computer, the innovative computer
venture established by Apple Computers' founder, Mr Steve Jobs, borders on
the evangelical.
In March he took on the newly-created post of president and chief operating
officer, sharing the 'office of the president' with the mercurial and
abrasive Mr Jobs.
That the ambitious Mr van Cuylenburg, highly regarded as chief executive of
C&amp;W subsidiary Mercury Communications should have left the company after Mr
James Ross was appointed to the position that he clearly craved was
understandable. But the move to Next, a three-year-old, privately-held
workstation manufacturer that has failed to make much of a mark in the
computer business, was a surprise to many.
He then emphasised the uniqueness of the opportunity: 'Once in a lifetime',
he described it. That view has seemingly been reinforced by his first three
months at Next's Redwood City, California, headquarters.
Now he says it is odds-on that Next will be a billion dollar company within
three years, that an initial public offering planned for 1993 will be a
success, and the company will make a lasting impression on the business
environment: 'It is not a question of whether Next will be a success, but
how much of a success.'
Others have still to share his optimism. Mr Jobs started Next after he left
Apple following disagreements over corporate policy with the chief
executive, Mr John Scully.
His aim was to develop an innovative workstation, a high-performance
personal computer, packed with the latest technology including high-quality
stereophonic sound, optical disk storage and laser printer.
Prospective purchasers were discouraged, however, by high prices - Dollars
10,000 a unit to corporate customers - and a shortage of software and
non-standard features. Sales have been tiny.
Last year the company turned over Dollars 127m, up from Dollars 30m in 1990,
and 'cash-flow is still negative', according to Mr van Cuylenburg.
But lessons have been learned. New, low-cost models were developed, software
houses, such as Lotus Development Corporation, were encouraged to develop
programs for the new machines, and versions of Next's operating software
written to run on other group's computers.
The company has influential backers. Canon, the Japanese company, famous for
cameras and laser printers, is a shareholder. So is Mr H. Ross Perot, the
potential US presidential candidate.
Mr van Cuylenburg says his role has been to bring professional management
and marketing skills to an organisation that has lacked both.
In his first three months he rewrote the business plan, slimmed down the
management and helped to secure a Dollars 55m credit line from Canon.
Together with a further Dollars 10m credit line from Mr Jobs, the company's
largest shareholder, Next is now fully-funded and Mr van Cuylenburg says:
'These credit lines provide more than we require to fund our anticipated
growth, yet give us the flexibility to use as little additional funding as
possible.'
Mr van Cuylenburg and Mr Jobs work in tandem, Mr van Cuylenburg providing
the day-to-day management of the business, matching growth to cash-flow and
so on. Mr Jobs takes the role of visionary, planning Next's product strategy
for the mid-1990s and beyond.
None of this, however, explains Mr van Cuylenburg's excitement at sharing in
the Next story. He believes the company is at the forefront of a revolution
in the way in which software is developed for business applications.
The emphasis today on re-engineering business processes and on improving
service industry productivity means high-quality software has to be
generated more rapidly, he says.
Next is a leader in a novel method of programming called object-orientation,
which turns conventional programming methods on their heads but which offers
the possibility of building high-quality software quickly and cheaply.
Essentially, it involves the creation of software modules which can be
stored and re-used.
The Next machines and programming software area based on object-orientated
principles. Mr van Cuylenburg believes object-orientated techniques can be
used to 'glue' together low-cost packaged software - word processors,
spreadsheets and the like - to create electronic desktops tailored to
individual customers needs.
He points to the example of large brokerage houses - some of them Next's
customers - where dealers combine a range of different information, from
computer files to video, to give them a single picture of the financial
world.
Next is focusing on three such markets, financial services, health care and
legal services, in its bid to spread the message about object-orientation
through the workstation market.
The leader in the workstation market, however, Sun Microsystems, has
revenues of more than Dollars 3bn, and major players include IBM and Hewlett
Packard.
There are, therefore, tough hurdles to be surmounted before Mr van
Cuylenburg will know if his new orientation will satisfy his career
objectives.

FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Italian groups float idea of
sell-offs - Haig Simonian looks at Eni's decision to sell shares in
subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S big state holding groups, strapped for cash owing to tighter
government funding and heavy investment needs, are devoting more thought
than ever to privatisation as a way of raising money.
Eni, the public-sector energy and chemicals group, has already declared
plans to sell off initial tranches of Agip and Snam, its big oil and natural
gas subsidiaries, before the end of this year. In time, the stakes sold
could exceed the 50 per cent barrier which has so far limited every big
Italian public-sector company's contact with the stock market.
The income provided could be vital in meeting the voracious financial
appetites of both Eni and IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company. For
Eni, exploiting the Karachaganak oilfield in Kazakhstan, for which Agip won
joint rights with British Gas last week, will involve a forecast investment
for the two partners of Dollars 6bn over the next decade alone.
In the past two years, opportunities for self-financing have been
constrained by tougher conditions in many markets, which have curbed
profits. In the case of the Eni group, Agip and Snam remain highly
profitable, with net earnings of L1,101bn (Dollars 959m) and L635bn last
year. However, its EniChem chemicals subsidiary reported a 1991 loss of
L742bn after minority interests, up almost ninefold from the previous year.
Meanwhile, raising further debt has become less attractive on account of the
state groups' already very high borrowing levels and vertiginous financing
costs. With direct funding from the government ever tighter, the stock
market has appeared increasingly alluring.
However, privatisation remains highly contentious for a number of reasons.
Many politicians are still reluctant to part company with assets which have,
over the years, provided a source of jobs and patronage for the country's
leading parties.
The issue of control has also been crucial at corporate level, with managers
fearful of losing control over parts of their groups.
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, says he is confident that listing Agip
and Snam will not endanger either Eni's ultimate control of its
subsidiaries, nor put them at risk of takeover, even after the majority of
the capital is quoted.
Agip's size means its capitalisation would be very high, making a potential
takeover exceedingly expensive, he says. Moreover, the likely diffusion of
its shares among thousands of investors means Eni, which would probably
retain around 40 per cent of the equity, would be by far the biggest single
shareholder. Ultimate control could also be ensured by using a 'golden
share' as is the case in the UK, he argues.
Mr Cagliari admits that plans to quote Agip and Snam, which had sales of
L10,957bn and L11,479bn respectively last year, have been partly
overshadowed by conflicting priorities with the government over whether Eni
itself or the subsidiaries should be floated.
A final decision will be taken at cabinet level, and could trigger a heated
political battle between members of the governing coalition. Last month,
preliminary measures were approved for the transformation of Eni into a
joint stock company as a first step towards a possible part-privatisation.
One compromise would be to privatise both Eni and some of its subsidiaries,
a structure that will be seen later this year when IRI's Finmeccanica
engineering holding company is floated. While Mr Cagliari agrees the model
of quoting both a holding company and its subsidiaries is unattractive to
Anglo-Saxon investors, he argues that it is more acceptable in continental
Europe.
Floating Eni would be much more time-consuming than listing Agip and Snam,
particularly as regards information requirements for foreign stock markets,
he warns. While an Eni flotation was perfectly possible, it would require
'much more work'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HACHETTE, the heavily- indebted French media group, has reached agreement to
sell its landmark building on the Boulevard Saint Germain in Paris to the
Immopar group for FFr500m (Dollars 98m).
The Saint Germain building has been up for sale for some months as part of
Hachette's attempts to raise capital and reduce its debts.
The group last year sold its Nouvelles Messageries building in central Paris
for FFr2.78bn and has since sold a number of subsidiaries including some
French and Spanish printing businesses.
Hachette has been burdened by heavy debts - of around FFr8bn at the end of
last year - since a period of active acquisitions in the late 1980s. Its
main deals were the purchases of Grolier encyclopedias and Diamandis
magazines for a total of FFr1.16bn in the US.
The group was also hit earlier this year by the collapse of La Cinq, the
French television station of which is was the controlling shareholder with
25 per cent of the equity.
The losses on La Cinq, which cost Hachette FFr1.79bn last year alone,
contributed to a net loss of FFr1.93bn on sales of FFr30.41bn in 1991.
Last week, Hachette announced that it had reached an agreement on
compensation for La Cinq's creditors. The company is pressing ahead with its
proposed merger with Matra, the defence electronics group chaired by Mr
Jean-Luc Lagardere, the flamboyant French businessman who also heads
Hachette.
Mr Lagardere is concluding negotiations with Northern Telecom, the Canadian
telecommunications group which last week emerged as a 20 per cent
shareholder in Matra's telecommunications division, to take a 5 per cent to
8 per cent stake in his new merged company. The merger is expected to be
completed by the end of this year.

second-quarter deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PITTSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING US steelmakers continued to reduce their losses in the second
quarter of the year, though recent difficulty in winning even modest price
increases indicates their troubles could linger, AP-DJ reports from
Pittsburg.
After failed attempts to increase prices by up to 5 per cent, steelmakers
are having trouble enforcing smaller increases. Mr Peter Marcus, an industry
analyst with PaineWebber, says the increase has 'failed', adding: 'There's
not going to be any price increase in the third quarter.'
One major producer said that while the increase has held, at least
partially, for its hot-rolled steel, increases for the pricier cold-rolled
steel would have to wait until August or later, and coated steel price hikes
would not stick at all. Because of the fragmented nature of the steel
industry, buyers have been able to keep prices down despite an increase in
shipments in the second quarter of about 5 per cent from the first quarter
and 7 per cent from a year ago.
As a result, major integrated steelmakers - with the possible exceptions of
USX, US Steel and NKK's National Steel - will again record losses. Barring a
flight of imports from the market because of recent trade lawsuits, or a
strike at LTV, which has asked the bankruptcy court for permission to reject
its labour contract, analysts expect most steelmakers to remain in the red
for the third quarter and not to see profits until the fourth quarter or
first quarter of 1993.
If there's any good news among integrated steel producers, it's that
National Steel, which has outperformed rivals in the downturn, should record
a modest profit, and that the giant US Steel component of USX, may return to
profitability. Analysts on average expect US Steel to earn a nickel a share,
according to First Call, though most include a pension credit in their
estimates.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Predators who are fearful of the 'black
holes' of recession - Andrew Taylor on the reasons behind the lack of merger
activity in the hard-hit construction industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN businesses have been struggling to keep their heads above water as much
as UK construction companies you would expect to find predators circling,
eager to snap up their weakened rivals and consolidate their position in the
market.
Yet it is hard to identify the potential sharks in a sea where so many
companies have been sunk by one of the worst recessions the industry has
experienced.
The truth is that very few have the strength or the will to pursue
acquisitions or even strategic shareholdings as a prelude to a possible bid.
Forecasts published last week by the National Economic Development Office
revealed that housebuilding and property development remain deeply in
recession while UK contracting output is expected to decline by a further
6.5 per cent this year following a 9 per cent fall last year.
Large companies such as Costain, Taylor Woodrow, Tarmac and Wimpey, which in
previous generations might have been considered predators, are instead
selling off peripheral businesses in a bid to raise cash to reduce their
large borrowings.
Costain has been accused of selling off part of the crown jewels following
its decision to float off part of its profitable Australian coal mining
interests.
Wimpey has sold its offshore engineering and waste management businesses
which it had hoped would cushion it against cyclical falls in the
construction market.
These sales, however, are small by comparison with the much larger
rationalisation which many in the industry believe must take place if there
is not to be an increase in company failures.
The UK construction sector is highly fragmented with an estimated 200,000
companies generating a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 40bn.
Although the vast majority are small firms employing less than ten people,
there are still a great number of large and medium sized public companies
whose shares are widely owned and easily accessible on the stock market.
Shares of contractors have plummeted since the late 1980s, making them even
more vulnerable to a possible takeover. Costain's share price of 41p
compares with a peak of 223p early last year while Tarmac, the name most
linked with a possible bid, has fallen from a 1991 peak of 283p to 93 1/2 p.
Taylor Woodrow shares have fallen from 289p to 85p.
Despite all of this mergers, whether hostile or agreed, have been thin on
the ground.
The reason can be found in the depth of the recession which Mr Joe Dwyer,
chief executive of Wimpey, describes as 'the worst for more than 50 years.'
Groups able to finance a hostile bid are fearful that there may be further
disasters hidden away in the balance sheets of badly-performing companies.
There is much talk of the danger of 'black holes' waiting to suck in
successful predators.
Continental European companies which bought stakes in British companies in
the late 1980s at the height of the market either have had their fingers
burned or have turned their investment attention eastwards to former
communist controlled countries such as eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland.
The biggest takeover to hit the sector during the recession came from
Redland, Europe's biggest roof tile manufacture which earlier this year
acquired rival UK brickmaker, aggregates and tile manufacturer, Steetley,
after a contested bid worth more than Pounds 600m.
Most mergers have been agreed. These have included Tilbury Group, which last
year joined forces with fellow contractor and developer RM Douglas; Hanson,
the large UK and US industrial conglomerate which rescued the financially
troubled Beazer group for Pounds 351m; while Raine Industries this year paid
Pounds 28.5m to acquire Walter Lawrence, a housebuilder and contractor.
But even agreed bids can produce problems. Trafalgar House, the
construction, property, shipping and hotels group has so far declined to
make a second payment of Pounds 54m to shareholders of Davy Corporation
which it acquired last year. The second tranche is dependent upon Trafalgar
receiving payment for the Emerald Producer oil production platform which
cost Davy its independence.
Some moves have been costly. Taylor Woodrow and Raine both incurred losses
on stakes bought in YJ Lovell, the contractor and property developer which
earlier this year was forced to renegotiate its financial arrangements with
its banks after breaching its loan covenants.
Hochtief, the West German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in Rush &amp;
Tompkins in the 1980s only to see the British construction and property
company go into receivership in 1990.
It cannot be through lack of interest that purchases have dried up. Only a
few years ago, when UK construction share prices were at their peak,
contractors were queueing up to make hostile bids and acquire strategic
shareholdings.
Before YJ Lovell fell on hard times, it mounted an abortive bid for Higgs &amp;
Hill. Lilley Group similarly failed to win control of Tilbury. Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O) briefly acquired a strategic
stake in Taylor Woodrow. Trafalgar House similarly bought and sold a stake
in Costain.
Beazer before its rescue by Hanson was one of Britain's most acquisitive
construction groups until it made one purchase too many and bought the
Koppers aggregates business in the US.
The outlook for orders and the parlous financial state of many of the
companies in the industry suggest that failures will increase unless an
orderly rationalisation takes place. Contractors which currently are winning
at neutral or loss-making margins will feel the pain even worse when
building material and labour costs start to rise.
Merger activity therefore is expected to rise during the next 18 months. The
question is who has got the cash and the will to make acquisitions. It will
take a steady nerve and confidence that there will eventually be light at
the end of of the tunnel.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: East Midlands Electricity chairman receives
102% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN HARRIS, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, the regional
electricity company privatised two years ago, was awarded a 102 per cent pay
increase last year.
The rise, disclosed in the annual report published yesterday, lifted Mr
Harris's remuneration from Pounds 114,476 to Pounds 230,969 for the year to
March 1992. The increase is likely to reawaken the row over salaries in the
privatised electricity industry.
Prof Basil Weedeon, chairman of the East Midlands Electricity Consumers
Committee, said: 'I am sure that the general public will be greatly
concerned by such a massive pay increase at a time of recession.'
The chairmen and chief executives of the 12 regional electricity companies
were castigated by Labour politicians at this time last year, when they
increased their salaries by as much as 200 per cent. Most were earning
between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between
Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later.
Mr Harris, himself, received an 84 per cent increase in the year ending
March 1991.
The latest round of salary increases have been less sharp and the
controversy less acute, although there has been public criticism of some
salary levels.
Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern Electric, and said to be the best paid
regional company chairman, is one example. His current Pounds 220,000
pay-packet is now 253 per cent higher than before privatisation.
Most electricity company chairmen are now earning over Pounds 200,000, and
can earn anywhere between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 200,000 more from share
bonus schemes.
However some companies, like Norweb, froze top salaries this year.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring gives appetising boost to AG
Barr profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company with brands including Irn-Bru
and Tizer, reaped the benefits of the 1991 restructuring of its production
and distribution arrangements, as profits more than doubled in the half-year
to April 25.
At the pre-tax level, they rose from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 2.64m, though Mr
Robin Barr, chairman, said that last time's total was depressed.
The profits advance was struck on turnover only 3 per cent ahead at Pounds
42.4m (Pounds 41.1m) and after interest payable slightly down at Pounds
624,000 (Pounds 713,000). Mr Barr said that debt was cut from Pounds 12m to
Pounds 8.5m at the end of the half.
Mr Barr said that sales of the company's brands, which account for a little
more than 75 per cent of total output, rose 5 per cent in the half.
This was helped, especially in the case of Irn-Bru, by advertising. He said
he wanted to increase awareness and sales further in the south of England.
In Scotland Irn-Bru already outsells Pepsi.
However sales of own-label products, mostly gained in the acquisition of
Mandora St Clements from Mansfield Brewery,were down 3 per cent.
The reduction in the cost base was mostly achieved by the closure last year
of the Evesham factory, which the company has estimated would save about
Pounds 1.5m a year. About 120 jobs were lost.
As a result Mr Barr reckons that current levels of profitability are
sustainable, especially if the important holiday months of July and August
have fine weather.
Earnings leapt to 9.09p (4.37p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.75p
(1.0833), a rise of 62 per cent.

<TEXT>
Platignum, a maker of writing instruments, stationery and furniture,
returned profits of Pounds 405,000 pre-tax for the year to end-March on
turnover of Pounds 17.13m.
That compared with previous losses of Pounds 1.34m, which included
exceptional provisions of Pounds 578,000, on turnover of Pounds 20.78m.
The directors said demand was weak in all businesses but that action on
improving margins and reducing overheads achieved a better underlying
performance.
Extraordinary costs of Pounds 739,000 (Pounds 150,000) left the year-end
loss at Pounds 335,000 (Pounds 1.42m). Earnings worked through at 0.2p
(losses 0.63p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAEJAN HOLDINGS, the property investment group, reported a marginal decline
in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 16.2m, for the year to
end-March.
Gross income grew by Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 24.3m and comprised: rent and
other charges receivable, after outgoings, totalling Pounds 15.3m (Pounds
14.2m); surplus on sales of properties amounting to Pounds 8.82m (Pounds
8.49m); and other income of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 68,000).
The tax charge fell slightly to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds 6.2m) and minorities
were reduced to Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 35,000).
The company said its portfolio had been professionally valued as at March 31
and the resultant Pounds 25.9m fall in the value of its investment
properties had been incorporated into the 1991 accounts. The net asset value
per share based on the balance sheet figures at that date was Pounds 11.44.
A valuation of the group's trading properties indicated an excess over book
value of Pounds 59.2m. Had this figure been incorporated into the accounts
the net asset value per share would have been Pounds 15.07, the company
added.
A final dividend of 13p (16p) is proposed making a 25p (24p) total.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Minorco and Outokumpu up Ivernia stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two big mining groups, Minorco and Outokumpu, are to increase their
interests in Ivernia West, the junior Irish exploration company which owns
48 per cent of Europe's second-largest known zinc-lead deposit, at Lisheen,
County Tipperary.
Ivernia is to raise IPounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.15m), before expenses, by a
conditional placing of 11.6m shares at I39p each compared with an unchanged
closing price yesterday of I37p.
Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa, is to subscribe for enough shares to take its present 16.9 per
cent stake to 24.5 per cent while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish
resources group, will raise its shareholding slightly from 24.3 per cent to
24.5 per cent.
Last week the three companies revealed they had agreed to bid jointly for
the 52.5 per cent of Lisheen recently put up for auction by Chevron,
third-largest of the US oil groups.
The balance of the Ivernia shares have been conditionally placed by Riada
Corporate Finance and James Capel. Proceeds will be mainly spent at Lisheen
where Ivernia expects to contribute IPounds 3.75m during the coming year.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood cuts jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLED Waterford Wedgwood group, is planning to cut the workforce at
its loss-making Waterford plant in Ireland by a further 25 per cent in an
effort to bring the group back to profitability, it was revealed in Dublin
yesterday.
Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of the Waterford Crystal arm of the
business, in a bleak message to union leaders last week said that 550
redundancies will be required at the Waterford plant, or else they must face
the possibility of its closure.
Company executives are remaining tight-lipped over the redundancy plans,
acknowledging only that Mr Galvin met with union leaders last Thursday 'to
give them a full update on the situation in the company', but more details
will apparently be released later this week.
Union officials said yesterday they intend to fight any further redundancies
and are seeking urgent talks with the government to either mount a rescue
package or to nationalise the company. It is unlikely the government will
consider either option, given its own budgetary constraints.
The company implemented a IPounds 51m redundancy package in 1987, shedding
1,200 jobs and a further 250 jobs have gone through a voluntary redundancy
scheme in the past 18 months.
The slump in demand caused by the Gulf war and the ongoing recession in the
US and UK, has forced the company onto short-time working for the past 18
months, but this has been insufficient to bring it back into profitability
and an announcement of further rationalisation measures was considered
imminent.
A company spokesman said yesterday however 'we are not considering
compulsory redundancies at this stage'.
The Waterford crystal arm made a IPounds 1.2m pre-tax loss in 1991 on
turnover of IPounds 73m. An extraordinary item of IPounds 5.3m, for
'initiatives taking place in late 1991 and 1992 to reduce manufacturing
costs', plus interest costs and tax charges, resulted in an overall group
loss of IPounds 5.2m for the year.
The extraordinary item relates primarily to voluntary redundancy payments,
but if the additional 550 jobs are to go in the course of 1992, it is
thought likely that further provisions will be necessary.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: EFM new Japan trust raises half of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH FUND Managers yesterday announced that the launch of its new Japan
investment trust had raised Pounds 10m.
This was much lower than the original target of Pounds 20m, but the company
said that it was still satisfied with the launch, organised by James Capel,
because it had found that many investors were still nervous about the
Japanese market.
Mr Iain Watt, managing director of EFM, said: 'I'm just delighted that we've
got the trust away. I don't think there's been a trust launched before when
the market has looked such good value.'
He also took heart from the fact that the combined price of shares and
warrants, which started trading on Friday, was at a premium of about 3 per
cent to the trust's net asset value. EFM attributed this to interest in the
shares from private investors, which had been reported by several private
client stockbrokers.
However, the bulk of the placement was made with institutions, which
accounted for about 70 per cent of the shares.
Mr Watt said: 'The question now is where does Japan go from here? In the
longer term I'm quite confident, and I think this was a good opportunity to
buy.'
Yesterday the price of ordinary shares dropped a penny to 96p while the
warrants rose a penny to 33p.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Called to book over equity accounting -
Oceana faces review of its accounts over treatment of Etam profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounting standards watchdog,
is to review the annual report of Oceana, the South African-controlled
investment company, following complaints about treatment of profits derived
from Etam, the fashion retailer for which it bid unsuccessfully last year.
Etam wrote to the panel in May this year following a public announcement by
Oceana that it would be using equity accounting on its shareholding rather
than simply including the income from Etam dividends.
The complaint has been criticised by Oceana, and is seen by some as part of
the continued bitterness displayed by Etam directors over the bid launched
in June last year, which raised Oceana's shareholding from 24 per cent to
34.4 per cent.
But it also raises wider questions over the use by companies of equity
accounting, which is supposed to be permitted only where a shareholder
exerts 'significant influence' over the company in which it has a holding.
Etam argues that Oceana has no such power, with no board members or
co-operation agreements. All it can do it block special resolutions which
require a 75 per cent majority at the annual general meeting.
The rules for equity accounting allow Oceana to include in its own profits
the proportion of Etam's profits that its stake represents. In other words,
it can include include 34.4 per cent of Etam's profits of Pounds 7.1m for
the year to February 1.
According to estimates prepared by accountants Robson Rhodes, advisers to
Etam, that would raise Oceana's profits for the year by Pounds 2.56m to
Pounds 3.45m, compared with Pounds 2.76m if it simply took the dividend
income of Pounds 1.47m on its stake as an investment.
However, Oceana yesterday dismissed the estimates and other objections. Mr
Michael Lewis, a director, said the company's accounts - which are to be
distributed to shareholders this Wednesday - fully disclosed the effects of
equity accounting, which he said had the full support of its professional
advisers and presented 'a more conservative set of results'.
He said the accounts would show that profits would have been Pounds 580,000
less if it had not used equity accounting. They would also show goodwill
written off on the Etam share purchases of Pounds 17m and unrealised gains
of Pounds 9.8m on the acquisition - figures which could have been used to
increase the size of the company's net assets.
He said that as the largest shareholder he also believed Oceana did have a
significant influence on Etam.
'We feel quite strongly that Etam's opinion is not relevant to the
preparation of Oceana's accounts,' said Mr Lewis. 'We really question Etam's
motives. The issue does not contribute to their business. They should
concentrate on where the company is going.'
But Mr Keith Miles, Etam's finance director, said: 'It's a bit rich after
Oceana attacked our strategy. It infers that our excellent results were
something to do with their policies.'
The Financial Reporting Review Panel - one member of which is Mr John
Roques, senior partner of Touche Ross, Oceana's auditor - has told Etam that
it will examine Oceana's accounts once they are published.
In practice, it is unlikely to reprimand a company which appears to be
complying with existing regulations. But there are other examples of
controversy over the influence of a failed bidder and whether they should be
entitled to use equity accounting, including Lilley, the Scottish
construction company which bid for Tilbury, a rival construction group, in
1989.
As a result, it comes as no surprise that the Accounting Standards Board has
pledged to review equity accounting later this year.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: North American plastics activities boost
Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from the North American plastics operations helped
Evode, the chemicals and plastics group, increase pre-tax profits by 26.5
per cent for the six months to March 28.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.78p, which Mr Andrew Simon,
chairman, said was a sign of confidence for the future. It was covered by
fully diluted earnings per share of 1.9p (1.3p).
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.8m on increased sales of
Pounds 141.9m (Pounds 137.8m), after eliminating the effects of divestments.
There was a still a retained loss of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.7m) after paying
the preference and ordinary dividends.
Operating profits from plastics, based mainly in North America, were up from
Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 4.5m.
Adhesives reported increased operating profits of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.2m)
as overseas companies mitigated the reduced industrial demand in the UK.
Industrial Coating fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 200,000 because of a
reduction in demand for architectural and industrial power coatings in the
UK.
Mr Simon said most European markets remained depressed. There was no
tangible evidence in the UK to suggest that the recession may be coming to
an end.
The group deferred Pounds 400,000 of income from the pension fund in case
the year's surplus was not as big as originally anticipated.
COMMENT
Evode shows how hard it can be to rebuild a balance sheet stretched by
borrowings to fuel acquisitions. The recent sale of its shoe components
business, bought as part of its protracted bid battle for Chamberlain Phipps
in 1989, for Pounds 11.9m will help to reduce debt. But when the Pounds 23m
of preference shares are subtracted from equity and added to borrowings -
which is arguably where they should be - it does not look as significant as
it might against gearing of close to 200 per cent. The group is doing all it
can to eliminate costs - it made savings of Dollars 3m in the US - and has
reduced spending to a minimum. For the half year capital expenditure is
running at Pounds 1.8m compared to Pounds 9.4m for the end of the last
financial year. With forecast earnings of Pounds 8.5m the shares - up 4p to
close at 63p - are on a prospective multiple of 17.4. The 20 per cent
premium to the market is only justified if the group produces significantly
better full year results in 1993.

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tiphook loses 57p as 23% rise fails to
impress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Tiphook, the freight container and trailer leasing group, fell 57p
to 330p yesterday, despite a proposed 25 per cent dividend increase, after
the results were below market expectations.
Pre-tax profits increased 23 per cent to Pounds 86.4m (Pounds 70.4m) in the
year to April 30. Analysts had expected nearer to Pounds 100m and cut
forecasts for this year by about Pounds 10m to Pounds 95m.
Mr Robert Montague, executive chairman, said the company weathered recession
in the UK and other large markets well. Turnover increased 6.4 per cent to
Pounds 322.4m, helped by a larger fleet and 11 per cent rental rate
increases for trailers.
Containers lifted profits before exceptionals to Pounds 85.3m (Pounds
70.9m). The container fleet, the second largest in the world, saw
utilisation rates hold steady at 88 per cent. The fleet was expanded 18 per
cent to 510,000 twenty foot equivalent units.
The trailer division reported unchanged profits before exceptionals of
Pounds 5.7m, despite a 6 per cent increase in turnover. There was a Pounds
2m charge against operating profits for rationalising the company's European
network.
Tiphook's rail wagon division turned from a Pounds 500,000 loss to a Pounds
200,000 profit, although utilisation remained under 70 per cent.
There were exceptional costs of Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 5.7m) on disposals and
expenses for listing the shares in New York and Hong Kong. Last year's
extraordinary items were restated as exceptionals resulting in a
re-adjustment of last year's pre-tax profits from Pounds 76.1m to Pounds
70.4m.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 57.3m). Last year's Pounds 150m
preference share issue, used to pay off borrowings, led to a preference
dividend payment of Pounds 12.3m.
Capital expenditure increased to Pounds 226.6m (Pounds 198.6m) with net
borrowings rising to Pounds 832m (Pounds 735m). Depreciation increased 17.9
per cent to Pounds 64.6m. Debt to equity stood at 2.8 times (2.9),
reflecting an increase in shareholders funds to Pounds 296m (Pounds 251m).
Mr Rodger Braidwood, group finance director, said capital expenditure this
year would fall to Pounds 80m and net borrowings would be reduced for the
first time in the company's history.
The tax charge doubled to Pounds 10.6m, due to increased advance corporation
tax. Tiphook pays no corporation tax due to capital allowances.
Earnings per share fell to 57.1p (59.9p). A final dividend of 12.9p is
proposed, raising the total to 17.3p (13.8p).

FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: WIC to cut interests in regional brewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHITBREAD Investment Company, an investment trust 49.9 per cent-owned by
Whitbread, yesterday said it was reducing its shareholdings in other brewers
to below 15 per cent.
However, Mr Robin Farrington, WIC's chairman, told shareholders at the
annual general meeting that it would, where possible, try not to sell stakes
to potential hostile bidders.
Its decision to reduce its holdings in regional brewers - to comply with the
government's beer orders - triggered the Pounds 101.3m hostile bid from
Greene King, the south of England's largest regional brewer, for Morland,
its Oxfordshire-based rival. WIC was Morland's biggest shareholder with a
43.4 per cent holding. It is selling a 28.5 per cent stake to Greene King
for Pounds 27.23m cash and has agreed to accept the offer for its remaining
14.9 per cent if there is no higher bidder.
Greene King's bid received a boost from Barclays de Zoete Wedd research
yesterday which recommended acceptance of the offer, describing it as
'generous'.
Speculation has surrounded the future of Marston, in which WIC holds 31.5
per cent. Mr Farrington said WIC wanted to divest part of its shareholding
in a manner which was 'preferably recommended by the board concerned'. WIC
also holds 20.7 per cent of the Boddington group and 14.9 per cent of
Devenish. In addition, Whitbread plc holds 5.9 per cent of Marston and 5.6
per cent of Boddington, which holds 20 per cent of Devenish.
If the shareholdings had remained unchanged, Whitbread would have had to
free another 1,000 pubs. The government is forcing all brewers owning more
than 2,000 pubs to release the tie on half of those outlets in excess of
that number by December. If a brewer has a 15 per cent holding in a rival
then those pubs are also included in the total.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Scottish &amp; Newcastle rises to Pounds 221m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, the brewing, pubs and leisure group, benefited from
the turmoil in the beer market and increased pre-tax profits from Pounds
216.8m to Pounds 221.1m in the 53 weeks ended May 3. The shares rose 3p to
463p.
Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive, said the brewing side increased market
share, although volumes were down 0.6 per cent against a market fall of 5
per cent. S&amp;N had yet to see 'any sustained signs of economic recovery', he
said.
Mr Stewart said there were 'a lot of changes going on in the market, which
have been exacerbated by the (government's) beer orders'. The beer orders
forced brewers with more than 2,000 pubs to sell outlets but S&amp;N, with
around 1,900 pubs, was not affected.
Group sales rose 8 per cent to Pounds 1.49bn, and operating profits rose 5.7
per cent to Pounds 239.1m. Operating profits from the beer division
increased 3 per cent to Pounds 99m, in spite of a rise in bad debts from
Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 12.6m. Mr Stewart said that excluding the debts the
division's margins were maintained.
The retail side increased profits 3 per cent to Pounds 57m, helped by the
inclusion of 30 pubs acquired last October.
Profits from selling some pubs dipped from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 8.5m. Mr
Stewart was confident the value of the group's properties exceeded book
value.
Leisure, which includes the Center Parcs and Pontin's holiday locations,
raised profits 14 per cent to Pounds 74.6m, mainly because of strong growth
at Center Parcs which achieved 95 per cent occupancy rates.
Another Center Parc location was under construction in France.
Investment income rose to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.9m) but interest payable
also increased to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 13.3m) - Pounds 7m of the rise came
from the purchase of the minority of Center Parcs last year.
Tax rate fell from 32 per cent to 29 per cent, a trend which Mr Stewart
hoped would continue. Earnings per share rose to 36.4p (34.1p), and a final
dividend of 10.59p gives a total of 16.1p (15p).
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 154m and led to a small increase in net
debt to Pounds 307.3m (Pounds 296m), equal to 23.1 per cent of shareholders
funds.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bears have long had it in for Tiphook, but the claws must have been
specially sharpened for yesterday's full year figures. What other company
could have hoisted the year's dividend by a quarter - rather better than the
best expectations - and then watched its shares fall 15 per cent?
Tiphook, it has to be said, provided a certain amount of ammunition for the
sceptics. Stated pre-tax profits of Pounds 86.4m were Pounds 10m below the
most optimistic forecasts, though the disappointment was rather less for
those prepared to strip out exceptionals. Tiphook's reporting is now more
open, but the market may have been the more miffed that best hopes were
missed given the scope for using the Sea Container provisions set up two
years ago. The outlook for the containers division, moreover, suddenly looks
rather less certain. No doubt Tiphook can do better in future than last
year's 2.8 per cent return on capital employed in trailers - if not it
should get out of the business - but a 34 per cent return from containers
hardly seems sustainable. At best the activity will pause for breath, at
worst it may be going ex-growth.
But the balance sheet is hardly stretched, given the nature of the business,
while the big dip in capital spending this year will do wonders for gearing.
The shares hardly deserve the ignominy of a 5.2 times forward earnings
multiple, or a prospective yield as high as 8.5 per cent.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: S&amp;N
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be as much a matter of luck as judgement, but Scottish &amp; Newcastle is
well positioned in the beer market. Its strength in Scotland and the north
of England leaves it less affected by the recession than southern brewers
like Whitbread. It has had fewer problems than most in complying with
Government mandated changes in the brewing industry. A strong position in
the free trade and emphasis on premium brands confined its volume fall to 1
per cent in 1991-92, compared with an overall market drop of 5 per cent.
Still, S&amp;N has barely outperformed the sector over the past year. Part of
the reason may be that a strong performance - annual operating profits grew
by 6 per cent - was already in the price. A historic multiple of nearly 13
puts S&amp;N on a higher rating than either Bass or Whitbread. Then again, S&amp;N
arguably lacks the critical mass to enjoy a secure position in the big
league, while Bass can probably still wring more margin from efficiency
gains.
If the drinking population has become more discerning with age, it is also
drinking less. That sets a limit on the benefits S&amp;N can reap from a
consumer switch to premium brands. Without the leisure division, operating
profits would have grown by a mere 3 per cent. But its Center Parcs are both
expensive to develop and vulnerable to any slowdown in northern Europe
prompted by the German monetary squeeze. The trouble with S&amp;N is that it
falls between two stools. It is not quite a growth stock, but it is not a
cyclical one either.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The steadiness of the Asda share price yesterday in the face of write-offs
totalling Pounds 452m is a tribute to the market's faith in the new chief
executive. In other respects, shareholders have plenty to complain about.
The Pounds 350m they stumped up in rights money has been more than cancelled
out, leaving asset value lower than a year ago. The dividend promise at the
time of the issue has been kept, but only for the year in question. This
year the payment will be cut by perhaps a third, with no guarantee of full
restoration in 1993-94.
It is hard to escape the sense that Asda is still living close to the wire.
Net tangible asset value after the write-downs exceeded the limit set by
Asda's banking covenants by only Pounds 30m or so. Interest cover was under
2.2 times, the covenanted limit being 2.0. This year the pressure should
ease, if only because of the Pounds 73m of cash from the MFI flotation and
the fact that the rights issue money will be in for the full year. But the
projection of cash neutrality for the year must be viewed in the context of
murderously competitive expansion from such as Sainsbury and Tesco, which
Asda reckons will cost it some Pounds 250m in sales.
Assuming pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m this year against last year's
pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 86m - the improvement being due wholly to
lower interest charges and loss elimination at Allied Maples - the multiple
at yesterday's 29.5p is over 10 and the yield perhaps 6.3 per cent. Given
that next year is going to be tough as well, that scarcely seems enough to
compensate for the risks.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling in a bind
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with disappointed expectations in financial markets is that the
mood can simply end up worse. Thus, the FT-SE not only ended up 7 points
lower yesterday than it was before Friday's misplaced excitement on base
rates. Equally worrying was the exceptionally low volume. The authorities'
limited room for manoeuvre must now be crystal clear. There is little scope
for rate cuts while Maastricht doubts persist and Germany refuses to relax
its policy. Even after the Bundesbank does eventually act, the UK may be
more constrained than many now suppose.
The differential between UK base rates and the German Lombard rate has
already narrowed by a full percentage point since December. It may need to
widen again once Germany does start to cut. The UK could use that
opportunity to move to narrow bands within the ERM, though it could still
scarcely cut rates faster than the Bundesbank. There is little evidence to
suggest a lower Lombard rate soon, or that German relaxation will be
aggressive when it comes. Expectations for the UK economy, which have
already been lowered for 1992, need to be reduced for 1993 too.
The temptation is to assume that the UK government cannot wait much longer
for recovery. It would need an excuse, though, like the collapse of
Maastricht or an Italian realignment, to justify devaluation. Italy's rate
increase over the weekend suggests the latter is unlikely in the short run,
but forward markets are discounting a lira devaluation in little more than
three months. While such uncertainties are in the air, pressure on sterling
could unsettle the gilts market as well.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Britain and Ireland signal new deal on Ulster's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE widest-ranging talks for 70 years on Northern Ireland's political future
opened in London yesterday with the UK and Irish governments expressing a
willingness to rework the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the UK and Irish prime ministers,
sought to give the talks their fullest support with a joint statement
offering Unionists, in particular, the prize of a 'more broadly based
agreement or structure, if this can be arrived at through direct discussion
and negotiation'.
They said 'an opportunity now exists for open, constructive and far-reaching
dialogue both on the issues which divide the two main traditions in Ireland
and on those which unite them. All of us share a common commitment to the
values of constitutional politics and a total rejection of violence as a
means of achieving political progress'.
Neither man was present at the talks. The UK delegation was headed by Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and the Irish team by Mr John
Wilson, deputy prime minister.
The talks, which will resume today, lasted three hours and were held amid
tight security at Lancaster House under the independent chairmanship of Sir
Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia.
They brought all shades of Unionist parties face to face with Irish
ministers for the first time since partition in the 1920s.
The Rev Ian Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, the two Unionist leaders, are
anxious for a replacement of the 1985 Agreement, which they believe gives
too great a role to Dublin in the affairs of Northern Ireland. They also
want an end to Ireland's constitutional claim on the north.
The Irish and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party put more
emphasis on greater co-operation between Northern Ireland and the south.
Dublin argues that if Ireland's constitution is up for negotiation, so too
should the UK legislation which led to partition. Irish ministers say their
country's constitution has to reflect a strong 'aspiration' to unification.
The meeting formed the start of the second 'strand' of a talks process which
began in April. Unionists only agreed to the transition following assurances
from Sir Patrick that it would be on the basis of a sketchy agreement
reached in 'strand one' on devolution in the province.
Some Unionist MPs hope that Sir Patrick will legislate for a devolved
assembly even if the talks collapse, in spite of an agreement by the
participants that 'nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed'.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Hong Kong airport talks stall over financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese government has ensured Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new
governor, an early trial of wills by failing to agree with Britain on terms
for financing the colony's multi-billion dollar airport.
High-level Anglo-Chinese talks in Beijing broke up yesterday without
reaching agreement, just three days before Mr Patten arrives in the colony.
Although the airport is not due for completion until the colony is handed
over to China in June 1997, Hong Kong government officials believe the
further delays in the financing will make that deadline impossible.
Tenders for levelling and extending the island on which the airport is to be
built have already closed but the authorities are unable to award the
contract until China approves the financing terms for the whole project.
The failure of the talks - agreed by the prime ministers of the two
countries at the Earth Summit last month in Rio de Janeiro - heightened
suspicion in Hong Kong of a linkage by the Chinese of the airport's funding
with political developments in the colony and a desire to see how Mr Patten,
who arrives on Thursday, conducts himself.
The two sides have decided on further talks, possibly next week, by members
of the joint Anglo-Chinese airport committee.
In Beijing, Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, was given a letter from Mr
John Major, the prime minister, urging China to approve the financing
without delay.
China's concerns are believed to centre on the escalating costs of the
HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.9bn)airport and related projects and the
financial guarantees the Hong Kong government has given the two main public
authorities responsible for construction of the projects.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr ALAN MACKIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My Europhilia has been badly dented by finding Pounds 21.36 debited
from a Pounds 180 cheque cashed on a French bank. To soften the blow my
local bank informed me it had foregone its usual handling fee because it
thought the charge was excessive.
This kind of charge is not unusual, I am told. Apparently, there is
virtually no recourse as the French bank debits its costs at source while my
local branch is inhibited from making further enquiries by a Pounds 7 head
office charge for every telex sent.
Nice work if you can get it, one might say. Perhaps our beleaguered
financial services industry may still have something to offer Europe in
transparency and competition.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: British view of German rethink on EFA fighter
'idiosyncratic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E H CLAUSSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your leader 'Credibility test for Bonn' (June 2).
Sometimes the British are a funny lot. When Harold Wilson, the former UK
prime minister, negated Edward Heath's signature under the agreement of
entry into the EC, he was hailed as a great politician. When Margaret
Thatcher - swinging her handbag and screaming 'I want my money back' -
negated Wilson's signature under the revised entry treaty, it was three
cheers for the Iron Lady. Opting out of two essential parts of the
Maastricht accord is considered a political success for John Major in
defending British sovereignty (the latter, only possible with the pivotal
assistance of Helmut Kohl).
Now the Germans have decided to opt out of the production phase of the EFA
project, an option covered in the existing contractual agreement. What is
that for the FT (and for the British defence minister)? It is a test of
Bonn's credibility 'as a reliable partner of the west'. Ha]
The Germans give military (drastically changed environment) and political
reasons for their change of mind. The latter, particularly, reflects a
considerable change of the electorate's mood. In a democracy that is
important - see Denmark and Maastricht.
Of course, if, as you say, the German 'nein turns out to be definite', it
will have political consequences, as had Wilson and Thatcher's requests for
renegotiation and Major's opt-out. But that is the purpose of the exercise.
When the British do it, for their reasons, it is fine; but when others do
it, for their own reasons, it casts doubts on their credibility. That seems,
with respect, a rather idiosyncratic British pragmatism or sense of reality.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: US hard currency plan for former Soviet Union
recalls Keynes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs STEVE H HANKE and PHIL GRAMM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan's article, 'Case for Russian 'dollars'' (June 22),
affirms that the rouble is dysfunctional. To remedy Russia's currency
malady, Mr Brittan recommends that all currencies should be allowed freely
to circulate in Russia, and that 'there may be a case for western
governments providing hard currencies not just as a stabilisation fund or
for governments to use in buying imports, but directly in loans to local
business to put into the circulation'.
Following Mr Brittan's general line of argument for legalised
'dollarisation' in the former Soviet Union (FSU), we have developed detailed
proposals for establishing currency boards in the FSU. The boards would
issue 'hard' roubles backed 100 per cent by hard currency reserves; boards
would not accept deposits and their sole function would be to exchange hard
roubles for reserve currency at a fixed rate on demand.
Currency boards that issued hard, competing roubles would have two features
that would make them more attractive than simple dollarisation: boards would
earn seignorage because their liabilities (hard roubles) would not pay
interest while their assets would earn interest, and local pride would not
be challenged because hard roubles would circulate in the FSU.
To facilitate the implementation of our proposals, the US Senate passed an
amendment to the Freedom Support Act on July 1 1992. That amendment states
that 'the Congress expresses its support for the United States
participation, in sums up to Dollars 3,000,000,000 in a currency
stabilisation fund or funds for the independent states of the former Soviet
Union, which may be used for the establishment and/or support of currency
boards in those cases where the president determines that a currency board
would be more likely to achieve success in promoting a stable, convertible
currency and sustained economic growth'.
When presidents Bush and Yeltsin meet in Munich this week, we trust that
currency boards will be on their agenda, and that both leaders will recall
that the only fully convertible rouble this century was issued by a currency
board designed by none other than John Maynard Keynes.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Learning from BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Credit and Commerce International, dead a year ago, lives on in
the new rules for international banking supervision issued by the central
bankers' Basle Committee.
You would never guess it, however. BCCI is not mentioned at any point. The
text merely murmurs, in a reassuring sort of way, that 'following recent
dev-elopments' the committee has reviewed the way international banking
supervision is co-ordinated.
Would the new rules have prevented those 'recent developments' from taking
place? In other words, if central bankers had been operating to these rules
all along, would BCCI have been allowed to get away with it for so long? At
the heart of the new rules is the requirement that all international banking
groups should be supervised by a home-country authority that is up to the
job. On the face of it, that goes some way towards eliminating the anomaly
that allowed BCCI to be supervised in Luxembourg, a country not equipped to
supervise a big international bank. It also rules out the ad-hoc replacement
supervisory regime for BCCI that was cobbled together when Luxembourg needed
help.
This device, a 'college of supervisors', brought together all bank
regulatory agencies from countries where BCCI had significant operations. It
suffered from a fatal flaw: no one supervisor carried the can. As a result,
with responsibility divided, BCCI was allowed to continue in operation for
too long.
Primary responsibility
Under the new rules, supervisors are free to set up colleges or any other
information-sharing arrangements, but the primary responsibility rests with
a single home-country supervisor, whose permission will be needed before a
banking group can expand abroad. Host-country supervisors will in turn have
to grant permission for entry; and before doing so they must satisfy
themselves about the home-country supervisor.
In theory, that sounds fine. In practice, though, it will pose many
problems. It is easy enough for a host country to turn down the branch of a
bank based in some offshore island only detectable with a microscope; it is
far harder to turn down a bank based in a respectable developed country like
Luxembourg. Indeed, the EC's Second Banking Directive explicitly rules out
such discrimination between member countries of the Community.
Demanding task
There is a passing nod to the EC's single banking passport in the new Basle
rules, but in truth the two sets of principles work a little at
cross-purposes: as Basle is urging banking supervisors to discriminate more
finely between home countries, Brussels is requiring equal treatment for all
EC members. Brussels has a demanding task ahead of it in ensuring that
standards of banking supervision throughout the EC are uniformly high.
BCCI crept up on the world banking community, without anybody really
noticing; and once it was established, nobody wanted to close it down, for
fear of damaging depositors. The same problem underlies the new rules. They
may work well in preventing an unsuitable new entrant to international
banking; but the chances are that the next potential scandal-ridden bank is
already operating. There is no 'grandfather' clause in the new rules, but in
practice each banking supervisor will decide how quickly to apply them
retrospectively. That is unlikely to be a speedy process.
The new rules are a sensible additional protection for depositors. But the
problems they leave unresolved demonstrate that there is no substitute for
caution about where you deposit your money.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Time for an awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a future time the Labour party will awaken from its narcoleptic
trance. It may happen this autumn. We will then see whether what is being
made ready to stalk the land is an ageing and impotent Frankenstein's
monster, something out of a comic book of historic horrors, or a strangely
revitalised young princeling . . . hang on a moment. It is Mr John Smith we
are talking about here. Forget the young princeling. Let us settle for
middle-aged Edinburgh lawyer.
The Smith part of the fairy story is due to come true on Saturday week. The
ancient machinery of the Labour leadership election process will creak and
bubble in a laboratory somewhere in London. The trade union bosses will
incant their chosen name. The constituency parties and members of
parliaments will each contribute a limb or two. A bolt of electricity will
crackle, and there, twitching into life, we will see the Smith-led Labour
party.
What it may well find, as it sits up and consciousness slowly returns, is a
Conservative government in trouble. We can imagine the scene as MPs come
back to Westminster from their summer holidays. The recession is still on,
with no sign of any corner to turn. Drastic measures, such as devaluation or
leaving the exchange rate mechanism, are still not contemplated. The Tory
backbench rebellion against ratification of the Maastricht treaty continues,
fed by the unease over the economy. The French vote 'yes' to Maastricht
(this is a fairy story, remember) and the other 10 members of the European
Community look to Britain to ratify, in order to put pressure on the Danes.
Suddenly the Labour party matters, even if only slightly. What it proposes
to do if the bill is returned to the Commons becomes an element in the
government's calculations. Mr Smith begins to enjoy himself hugely: not only
is the party alive, it is kicking.
It is also, as Mr Smith acknowledged at the weekend, divided over
Maastricht. That weakens Labour as a potential anti-Maastricht force. Yet,
skilfully led, the opposition could make passage of the treaty legislation
even more uncomfortable than it might otherwise be. Labour's backbenchers
would surely unite over obstructive tactics designed to embarrass the
Conservatives, although they would be divided on a strategic vote on the
principle of the thing. With luck, Labour could have more influence over
events in the House of Commons than at any time since 1979. Such
considerations could lead to the postponement of the re-introduction of the
bill from late autumn 1992 to anybody's guess in 1993.
In short, not everyone is ready to write Labour off as an effective
opposition, even though to my mind its long-run future is in doubt. The
Conservatives take Mr Smith's troops seriously. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the
financial secretary to the Treasury and a rising ministerial star, told a
Tory Reform Group meeting on Saturday that he did not believe that Labour
was unelectable. It would be 'hopelessly complacent' to assume that it was.
The government had been re-elected on sufferance; it had not received
anything resembling a resounding vote of confidence for its record since
1987. It needed to earn the electorate's support. Mr Dorrell then went on to
explain how Mr John Major's policies would achieve that.
There are other ways of making the point. Labour scored a miserable 34 per
cent of the vote on April 9, but this was an improvement on 1987 (31 per
cent) and 1983 (28 per cent). Its performance in seats won was likewise on a
rising curve. Consider also the Conservative central office's index of
negatives. In 1987 five reasons for not voting Labour were confirmed by Tory
research. The party was disunited. It could not be trusted on defence. It
was dominated by the left. Unions had too much influence. Finally, Mr Neil
Kinnock could not be accepted as prime minister. By 1992 the first four
negatives had been eliminated (union influence was not a particularly
salient factor this time), but a new one was added by the Conservatives.
Labour was made to be seen as a high-tax party. However badly the Tories had
performed, Labour would make matters worse.
Now that Mr Kinnock has gone only the high-tax label remains. Mr Smith has
already begun to detach it from his sleeve. Meanwhile the government will
surely reduce income tax, even at the cost of further indirect taxes. In
that way it can make the distinction between itself and the opposition
clear. Labour will have to look for positive reasons for being elected.
It will be bombarded with suggestions, such as the one in a Fabian pamphlet*
due to be published on Friday. The author, Mr David Lipsey, proposes a
change of name, to New Democrats. I would agree that 'Labour' suggests to
many people 'don't vote for me' but what about 'John Smith's party?' It is
too soon to say. The creature is still in the lab, waiting for the switch to
be pulled and the lightning to strike.

was suicide.
Firm Friends, the ITV drama series about two women who team up to go into
catering (and about Special Branch, and race relations - a subject on which
it manages to be genuinely funny - and crooked property dealing) is proving
highly entertaining (9.00 ITV). So is the BBC1 drama series Boys From The

FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: An Ideal Husband
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the comment 'Only people who look dull ever go into the House of
Commons, and only the dull ever succeed there.' Oscar Wilde was not writing
political commentary 1992 style but comedy 1895 style.
The week Lady Thatcher took her seat in the Lords, Wilde's An Ideal Husband
at The Royal Exchange, Manchester, claimed that joining the Upper House
signalled that one has ended one's political ambitions.
James Maxwell's fine production touches the wit and the wisdom in Wilde. An
Ideal Husband has the usual Wilde serve-and-volley wit with sporadic passing
shots. The epigrams are delivered with point, and the deeper rhythms of this
highly moral play emerge clearly.
An Ideal Husband balances public virtue and private vice. Politics means
realpolitik: 'Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own
weapons, and what this century regards is wealth.'
Sir Robert Chiltern, the Dorian Gray of the financial markets, has based his
spotless political career on trading information for money in Suez Canal
shares.
Twenty years on, a blackmailer (Mrs Cheveley) threatens to expose him unless
he trades his influence for his reputation by manipulating a Commons
Commission on Argentinian waterways.
Chiltern, the ideal husband, stands to lose his wife's respect: by
dishonestly fixing the Commission, or by having his duplicitous past
revealed.
The acting, particularly from Robert Glenister (Lord Goring, 'the idlest man
in London') as Chiltern's worldly and dandyish friend, draws on the moral
scope in Wilde's text. Chiltern and his wife (Tom Chadbon and Emily Morgan)
resist the machinations of Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Cheveley and emerge with
moral as well as social dignity; but they uncover the woe that is in
marriage.
As Lord Goring's father says: 'Dammit, Sir, it's your duty to get married,
you can't always be living for pleasure.'
Wilde's advice is to marry a tolerant partner. For he knew that life can be
neither understood nor lived without charity. This serious play lightly
figured, delivers a fine lesson showing how truth is rarely pure and never
simple.

FT  07 JUL 92 / People: Scholes Group settles on Baxter from FKI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Baxter, who ran FKI's electrical products group until last week, has
been appointed chief executive of Scholes Group, the Wilmslow-based
electricals group which lost both its chairman and chief executive designate
in March.
The appointment of Baxter, 42, follows growing concern among some
institutional investors about the management vacuum at the top of a group
which has been hit hard by the recession in the construction industry and
cut its dividend last year.
Earlier this year Scholes had tried to solve its management succession
problems by recruiting Barrie Lawson as chief executive designate. But he
did not survive a three-month settling-in period. Shortly afterwards, Reg
Harrington, the chairman and chief executive, died. As a result Bill Riches,
Scholes' 55-year-old finance director, took on the chief executive's job
temporarily, but he said yesterday that the intention had always been to
recruit a permanent replacement from outside. Unlike Lawson, Baxter is not
subject to a three-month trial.
Baxter brings considerable big business experience to Scholes. After spells
at GEC Alsthom and Babcock Inter-national, he has been in charge of 22
factories and a 7,500 workforce at FKI. By contrast, Scholes has seven
factories and employs 1,700. However, he will be running his own show.
His decision to quit FKI follows the arrival of a new chief executive who
had reorganised the FKI businesses around product lines with the result that
Baxter could not be offerred a job of the same status as running FKI's
entire UK electrical businesses.
As part of the reshuffle, Riches becomes executive chairman replacing
Richard Morgan, a former BICC finance director, who had been doing the job
following Harrington's death. Morgan, who was appointed a non-executive
director in November 1990, remains on the board. Philip Acton, Scholes'
34-year-old financial controller, joins the board as finance director.
*****
Geoff Unwin, executive chairman of Hoskyns, the UK company bought by Cap
Gemini Sogeti two years ago, has been appointed one of three presidents of
the French-based parent, a signal honour for an Englishman in a company
which relishes both its Frenchness and its position as leader of the
European computing services industry.
Unwin's fellow presidents are Michel Jalabert, one of CGS's longest serving
executives, and Jacques Arnould, formerly chief executive of Sesa, another
CGS acquisition.
Unwin will be responsible for CGS's regional business across all its
regional com-panies. He will remain chairman of Hoskyns but Tony Fisher and
Tony Robinson, joint managing directors, will become group vice presidents
in charge of the UK and Ireland.
Unwin says CGS's challenge is to integrate its operations more closely in
contrast to the loose federal structure which has operated to date.

Maude, who was previously Financial Secretary of the Treasury, has a lot in

Norman says Maude has a 'sharp intelligence and a sardonic sense of humour -
which will come in useful at Asda'.
The company, which is struggling to turn itself round after a painful few
years, has also appointed David O'Brien (above right) as a non-exec-utive
director. O'Brien, a former managing director of Rank Xerox (UK), is
currently chief executive of the Bradford-based National and Provincial
Building Society, which will go down well in Asda's Yorkshire homelands.
Frank Knight, a former deputy chief executive of United Biscuits, who joined
the Asda board as a non-executive director last September has been elevated
to the post of deputy chairman.
Patrick Gillam, Asda's chairman, said it had always been his intention to
strengthen the non-executive representation on the board. He said all the
new appointments would contribute to the company's development. 'Nobody
comes on the board because they are a mate of mine,' he said somewhat
defensively at yesterday's press conference.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Fines on fur co-operative reduced -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fines imposed by the European Commission on the Danish fur breeders'
co-operative for breach of EC competition rules were reduced by 40 per cent
by the Court of First Instance last week.
The fines originally fixed by the Commission at Ecu500,000 were cut on
appeal to Ecu300,000 (Pounds 200,000).
Danish fur breeders were appealing against a 1988 Commission decision
condemning certain aspects of the statutes and agreements of the
co-operative on the ground that they restricted competition in the sale of
furs in Denmark. The Commission's investigation had been prompted by a
complaint by Hudson Bay, the UK fur trader.
The CFI partially annulled the Commission's decision after a detailed review
of the evidence and legal analysis relied on by the Commission.
The Court said the Commission had failed to refer to any evidence for its
finding that the co-operative was involved in concerted practices in
connection with a non-competition clause in the statutes giving exclusive
sales rights to the co-operative's auctions. And the reasoning relied on for
the Commission's finding that the agreements with animal skinners amounted
to exclusive supply obligations was defective.
However the CFI rejected arguments that special allowances should be made
for co-operatives under the EC competition rules. It also ruled that the
special rules on competition in agriculture could not be extended to
products such as furs which were not listed as agricultural products under
the Treaty of Rome.
The Danish fur breeders were supported in these arguments by the Danish and
Belgian governments which failed in their attempt to extend the protection
from the full force of the competition rules enjoyed by agricultural
co-operatives to the fur breeders.
Case T-61/89, Dansk Pelsdyravlerforening v Commission, CFI 2 CH, 2 July
1992.
Judicial review of Commission state aid suspension decisions
In two important state aid cases last week the European Court of Justice
(ECJ) clarified the admissibility of appeals by member countries against
Commission decisions to initiate proceedings for infringement of EC state
aid rules.
Giving its decision on a preliminary issue raised by the Commission, the ECJ
ruled that applications by Italy and Spain, for judicial review of
Commission decisions to start proceedings against state aid granted by them,
were admissible.
The Court said that as a result of the procedures deliberately chosen by the
Commission, the decisions to start infringement proceedings against Spain
and Italy had the legal effect of suspending aid which had already been
granted.
In the first case Spain had notified the Commission, at the Commission's
instigation, of certain planned aid to a group of private electrical
equipment manufacturers.
However, the Commission did not initiate any proceedings within two months
of the notification. In accordance with previous ECJ decisions, this meant
the Spanish aid was no longer subject to the normal rules on automatic
suspension applicable to 'new' aid, but fell to be dealt with as an
'existing' aid.
As a result, when the Commission decided to initiate proceedings against
Spain and ordered the aid to be suspended, the ECJ ruled that the Commission
had deliberately chosen to adopt a suspension measure which would only apply
automatically if the new aid procedure applied.
The effect of the Commission's decision therefore was that aid already
granted had to be suspended. Moreover any ultimate decision by the
Commission that the aid was in fact compatible with the common market could
not retrospectively legitimise any breach of the suspension decision.
In the second case, the Commission authorised a general aid scheme for the
Mezzogiorno notified by Italy in 1986 under a decision adopted in 1988. In
1990, the Italian authorities in the Mezzogiorno made an individual grant of
aid under the general scheme to Italgrani, a Neapolitan cereal processing
company. In 1991, a competitor, Casillo Grani, complained to the Commission.
The Commission took the preliminary view that the Italgrani aid was
incompatible with the common market and fell outside the scope of the
authorised general scheme either because of the amount involved or because
conditions governing aid to the agricultural sector had been infringed.
In a letter notifying Italy of the initiation of proceedings for
infringement of the EC state aid rules, the Commission referred to Italy's
obligation to suspend the aid under the rules applicable to new aids.
The ECJ again held that the Commission had deliberately chosen to adopt a
procedure normally applicable to new aids in a situation where it could have
applied the procedure applicable to existing aids which does not involve
suspension.
In reaching its decisions in these cases, the Court confirmed the different
procedural powers enjoyed by the Commission under the EC state aid rules
which vary depending on whether aids are categorised as 'existing' or 'new'
aids.
One relevant difference is that it is the 'new' aids procedure alone which
automatically involves suspension of aid on initiation of infringement
proceedings by the Commission.
The Court will decide if the Commission has incorrectly categorised the aids
in these cases at a later stage.
Case C-312/90, Spain v Commission and Case C-47/91, Italy v Commission, ECJ
FC, 30 June 1992.
Shipping competition case settled
Last Friday, Sealink Stena withdrew its appeal against the Commission's
interim measures decision relating to sailing schedules between Ireland and
England.
Following a settlement in which Sealink agreed to modify its timetable in a
manner acceptable to B &amp; I, B &amp; I withdrew its complaint and the Commission
agreed to discontinue its investigation.
Peas processing regime aids
In a technical agricultural case, the ECJ interpreted rules on payment of
processing aids in connection with special measures designed to encourage
pea cultivation for use in animal and human foodstuffs.
Under this system, aid is paid to the first purchaser of the products
provided the producer receives a minimum price from the purchaser which is
fixed each month.
The ECJ interpreted the rules, however, to allow the first purchaser to
receive the aid when the purchaser has paid in advance a sum equivalent to
the minimum price even though the minimum price itself was not paid to the
producer.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Technology: Batman to launch new film sound from Dolby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE HOMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When America's latest box office release, Batman Returns, opens in the UK
next week (July 8) Batman will have a new trick up his sleeve. He'll be
talking in digital.
Batman Returns is the first film to use what may well become the de facto
digital soundtrack standard. Alas, the Empire Leicester Square in London is
the only cinema outside the US equipped with the necessary equipment. Only
the select few will hear the technology in all its glory.
Dolby, best known for its hi-fi noise reduction systems, has been working on
film sound for more than 20 years and on digital sound since the mid-1980s.
Getting quality stereo sound into cinemas is a problem. Stereo only really
works over a tiny triangular area between two speakers, known as the 'hot
spot'. To overcome this problem, a centre speaker and sometimes additional
speakers are placed at the front of the cinema, as well as speakers at the
rear.
The best sound is produced with 70mm film, but this costs up to five times
more than standard 35mm. The larger film size uses magnetic material glued
on to the already exposed film print, with the sound then recorded on six
tracks. As the film is quite stiff, the tape heads have to push against the
film surface and quickly wear out.
Dolby wanted to improve the sound on 35mm film to digital quality. It also
wanted to leave the conventional optical analogue soundtrack intact, so film
distributors would not need separate prints for digital and analogue
cinemas.
That dual inventory approach has dogged other attempts to introduce digital
cinema sound. Dolby overcame the problem by squeezing the digital
information into the spaces between the film sprocket holes.
Using hundreds of small black squares between the holes, Dolby achieved a
data rate of 320 Kbits/second - still low compared to the 1,400 Kbits/second
of stereo CD.
However, using sophisticated digital recording and compression techniques to
reduce the information recorded, the system produces quality, noise free
recordings with a greater range and better frequency response than any other
cinema sound system.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Technology: Valley's creative culture still alive -
Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Silicon Valley: An Economy at Risk' paints a gloomy picture of the future
of California's famed high technology enclave. The report is designed as a
'wake up call' for the region's industrialists; a warning that there are
problems to be resolved if Silicon Valley is to maintain its leadership
role.
The 'diagnostic report', prepared by the Center for Economic Competitiveness
at SRI International, a technology consultancy, and sponsored by local
businesses, outlines the 'warning signs' that Silicon Valley's economy is
heading for decline. These include slower employment growth, a decline in
venture capital financing, slowing growth in pre-competitive research and
development spending and a shortage of skilled workers, as well as the
rising cost of adhering to regulations, high housing prices, traffic
congestion and a 'perceived decline in the quality of life'.
Over the past 10 years there have been several predictions of the demise of
Silicon Valley. Yet the region remains the pre-eminent center of high
technology entrepreneurship and innovation.
It is tempting, then , to dismiss this latest report as just another
doomsday scenario and to blame its pessimism upon the fact that it was
prepared during the recession from which Silicon Valley is already beginning
to recover.
Indeed, several of the 'problems' assigned to Silicon Valley in the report
are common to all high technology regions in the US. The drop in venture
capital investing is not peculiar to Silicon Valley.
Neither is it alone in suffering the effects of economic recession.
The most worrying issue raised by the report is the apparent failure of
Silicon Valley to keep pace with the national US rate of employment growth
over the period 1984-1991, according to data from the Center for the
Continuing Study of the California Economy.
However, this snapshot of a cyclical economy includes a period of sharp
decline in 1991. Measured over the period 1983-1990, employment growth in
Silicon Valley outperformed that in the US as a whole. Assessing the
economic performance of Silicon Valley is further complicated by the fact
that the region's boundaries are ill defined and constantly changing.
However, some important issues are raised by the 'Economy at Risk' report.
Silicon Valley is now suffering the effects of its dynamic growth, including
traffic congestion and high housing costs. The latter, in particular, makes
it more difficult for companies to attract and retain employees.
Although bright young engineers still flock to Silicon Valley, many decide
to leave the area when they want to buy a house. This has led to a 'missing
generation' of mid-career professionals that is a growing problem for
established companies.
The regulatory environment in California is another widespread concern among
Silicon Valley business leaders. Environmental, planning and employment
regulations have become a serious burden, they complain.
'Joint Venture: Silicon Valley', a consortium formed to address the
problems, presents three 'possible futures'. The region could become a
'high-tech Manhattan, of corporate headquarters and administrative
functions, with little research or manufacturing,' it warns. More likely,
the 'Virtual Valley' in which the Silicon will remain a research and
development hub for global companies with a limited amount of high
value-added manufacturing, plus marketing and administration.
What the report's authors urge, however, is a joint initiative between the
private and public sectors to transform Silicon Valley into an 'American
Technopolis; a dynamic community that supports technology enterprises and
retains value-added manufacturing, employment and wealth'.
The danger is that in an attempt to improve upon the original, they may
stifle Silicon Valley's creative culture. The valley has its problems, but
it has spawned more new ventures and more important new technologies than
any other place on earth. It ain't broke and it doesn't need fixing.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS will face cross-party pressure today to spell out the limits on
plans to delegate some Civil Service management functions.
In this afternoon's Lords debate on the bill to allow the management of
Whitehall departments, the government faces a move led by Lord Cledwyn,
opposition leader in the Lords, and supported by Lord Allen of Abbeydale, a
former top civil servant, to set out more clearly the way in which
responsibility for Civil Service duties can be handed over to an undefined
group of 'Crown servants'.
Ministers insist the bill is intended simply to enable personnel decisions
to be decentralised - for example to the executive agencies set up under the
Next Steps initiative. Civil service unions are concerned, however, that
contracting out civil service functions could lead to many tasks currently
done by Whitehall professionals such as lawyers, engineers and accountants
being transferred to the private sector.
The main aim of amendments to the legislation is to confine the management
functions to matters relating specifically to pay and conditions.
The amendments also define those to whom ministers may delegate the duties
as other ministers, civil servants or holders of statutory offices.
The government has already had to fend off considerable unease from peers
when the bill was first discussed more than three weeks ago.
Earl Howe, the government spokesman, was unable to satisfy peers that the
move was not a matter of paving the way for widespread privatisation of the
Civil Service, and Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, promised to
discuss the handling of the bill.
The need for those discussions has delayed the progress of the bill, which
will not finish its passage through the Lords until the autumn.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Number of adults gaining jobs after ET drops again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABILITY of adults to gain employment after retraining on the
government's main training programme has continued to deteriorate according
to figures published yesterday.
Thirty per cent of trainees gained employment after leaving Employment
Training (ET) in the 12 months to July last year compared with 35 per cent
in the previous year according to an analysis of unpublished government
figures by the Unemployment Unit, an independent research organisation.
The scheme, administered in England and Wales by Training and Enterprise
Councils, (Tecs) has been widely criticised as underfunded and ill targeted.
The government is considering wide reform of the scheme and the Department
of Employment is discussing with the Treasury new flexibilities in the way
Tecs train unemployed adults.
Tecs want to improve the quality of training even if this reduces the number
of recruits. They believe ET as presently constituted is concerned more with
reducing the number of people on unemployment registers than with providing
people with quality training.
According to the survey the number of trainees gaining qualifications
improved from 22 per cent in the year to June 1990 to 30 per cent in the
latest period measured by the survey, a period when Tecs took over the
scheme. The Unemployment Unit said that while job entry rates could be
explained partly by the weakness of regional employment conditions
qualification rates reflected only the competence of Tecs and providers of
training in placing trainees on to courses designed to lead to vocational
qualifications.
Mr Paul Convert of the Unemployment Unit said: 'ET is an underfunded and
unloved scheme. It was designed at the tail end of the 1980s boom to get
people into work by giving them worthwhile vocational qualifications. These
latest figures show that it is doing neither.'

aged five to 12, to raise their awareness and understanding of their bodies,
society and the technology around them.
Its location is unusual too: not in London but on reclaimed land near the
centre of Halifax, the Pennine town that five years ago became the setting
for the Calderdale Partnership - the first experimental Business Leadership
Team formed by Business in the Community (BIC), which encourages
private-sector involvement in the community.
Mrs Vivien Duffield, daughter of the late Sir Charles Clore and the driving
force - and prime funder - behind Eureka], originally intended to site her
'hands-on' educational museum in the capital. Prince Charles, president of
BIC, suggested she should take a look at Halifax, which has a population of
8.5m within 90 minutes' drive.
Eureka] is the biggest coup for the Calderdale Partnership, which has been
instrumental in raising Pounds 2.5m of private sponsorship towards the
project. The Clore and Vivien Duffield Foundations have invested Pounds 7m
and the government Pounds 250,000.
Income from admissions - which are intended to reach 500,000 annually within
three years - will be supplemented by developing an adjacent disused
Victorian railway station, probably for speciality retailing.
Prince Charles, who launched the Halifax 'one town partnership' in 1987,
will open Eureka] tomorrow. It will open to the public on Thursday.
But even with a rich benefactor, strong support from high-profile
businessmen and the patronage of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the
project hit problems at planning stage.
Sceptical local politicians, whose council has since leased Eureka] its 12.5
acre site for just Pounds 370,000, pressed for more power over the scheme.
Mrs Duffield, who chairs Eureka], refused. 'If it's a private museum it
remains private,' she insists. She won and Calderdale council, now again
hung, is supporting a project which, it feels, will enhance Halifax's local
pride.
Eureka] is a milestone for the partnership, says one of its most committed
supporters, Mr Ernest Hall, who has regenerated Halifax's Victorian Dean
Clough mill complex. Recently, the partnership has suffered something of a
hiatus as leading private-sector members have become involved in a variety
of education, arts and community activities.
Prince Charles's visit to Halifax this week, his fifth since he launched the
partnership in 1987, is far from the end of the story, says Mr Hall,
Eureka]'s deputy chairman. 'This is the end of the first phase. But it feels
very much the beginning of something.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Post Office watchdog urges speed up on reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Post Office Users' National Council, the industry's official watchdog,
yesterday accused the government of backtracking over its plans to reform
the Post Office.
Before the last election the government's Citizen's Charter contained
proposals to establish mandatory service standards and introduce more
competition by reducing the Post Office's monopoly on letters costing less
than Pounds 1.
The Queen's Speech in May contained no reference to proposals for the Post
Office and Mr Tom Corrigan, Pounc chairman, says in the council's report:
'For the second time in barely six months the possibility of legally-backed
reforms had been shelved.'
Mr Corrigan argues that there should be no loss of momentum in putting
Charter principles for better service into practice. In particular he does
not want to see any stepping back from making the achievement of delivery
performance standards mandatory.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday said it remained committed to
reforming the Post Office. It added that while it hopes to bring forward
legislation in the next Parliament this would depend on whether other issues
took priority.
Mr Corrigan wants the government to end the uncertainty surrounding its
proposals to reduce the letter monopoly and on the creation of a new postal
services regulator.
The users council is concerned at the closure of 200, mainly rural, Post
Offices in the past year and called for better consultation with local
people. Mr Corrigan says: 'We recognise there must be commercial realism but
that must be balanced with social needs.'
The Post Office said the views of local people were always taken into
account before an office was closed.
The users council also argues that increases in letter delivery prices last
September, up 2p for first class to 24p and 1p for second class to 18p,
should have been deferred for months because of the Royal Mail's Pounds 266m
pre-tax profits for the year to March 29.
Prices have been frozen until the end of the year but Mr Corrigan, says it
is 'unreasonable' that users had to pay more to finance the
'under-achievement' of Parcelforce, the PO's parcels arm. This made a loss
of Pounds 24m, before tax and exceptional items, compared with a Pounds 75m
loss in 1990-91.

A JUDICIAL commission yesterday sharply rebuked the South African government
for ignoring its recommendations and jeopardising efforts to curb political
violence.
In a blunt warning to President F W de Klerk, Judge Richard Goldstone, who
heads the official commission of inquiry into township violence, made clear
that the government's authority could be undermined if it failed to tackle
the issue.
He listed proposals which had either not been followed up by the government,
or had been inadequately implemented: 'To ignore its (the commission)
recommendations can only be calculated to diminish if not destroy the
credibility and effectiveness not only of the commission but also of the
government.'
Judge Goldstone read his statement at the preliminary hearing into last
month's Boipatong massacre in which 42 people died.
He stressed that the Commission had received 'no evidence . . . which in any
way justifies allegations of any direct complicity in or planning of current
violence' by President de Klerk, his ministers, or 'any highly placed
officer' in the security forces.
In the absence of such evidence, such allegations 'are unwise, unfair and
dangerous,' the judge continued, in what seemed an implicit refence to
accusations made by Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader
and other political leaders.
But he went to deliver a forthright attack on the government's response to
the commission's work.
He noted that a government 'must be able to demonstrate that it has full
control of its security forces' if it is to command support. Whether or not
members of the former counter-insurgency unit called Koevoet, now part of
the police force, were involved in the violence, 'the very existence of such
a group in South Africa in 1992 is calculated to cause yet further
distrust.'
Examples of commission recommendations that had been ignored included
fencing and monitoring hostels, source of much township tensions, and ending
deployment of 32 battalion, which has a reputation for brutality, in black
townships.
Recommendations banning carrying of arms in public had been 'partially but
inadequately implemented', he said.
Six thousand striking workers at Toyota's Durban plant were dismissed
yesterday.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Jakarta reforms a blow to donors

A LONG-AWAITED package of economic deregulation unveiled yesterday by the
Indonesian government failed to effect many of the changes requested by
donors. The donors meet on July 16 in Paris to pledge financial aid to the
country.
Steel imports are to be liberalised but reform in other sectors was
conspicuously absent. Donors, including the World Bank, had argued for
restrictions on the import of wheat, sugar and cement to be modified and for
market forces, not the government, to set domestic prices.
'The time is not ripe for deregulation (in wheat, sugar and cement),' said
Mr Radius Prawiro, senior economics minister. State and politically
well-connected private companies enjoy virtual monopolies over the three
sectors.
Donors are still expected to pledge about Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 2.5bn) to
Indonesia for the year ahead but are likely to seek government reassurance
that the pace of economic reform will be enhanced. They will find cheer in
export figures for the first four months of the year which, excluding oil
and gas, show a 24 per cent rise over 1991 to Dollars 6.5bn.
The new rules governing steel imports allow companies to import directly,
instead of having to seek the approval of the state-owned Krakatau Steel
company. Krakatau, with a 2.5m tonne a year capacity, dominates the sector
and, bankers say, is subsidised by government.
However, the company only operates at about 70 per cent capacity and the
change in regulations should ease supply constraints and cut the price of
steel in the domestic market.
The deregulation package also replaces non-tariff barriers with tariffs on
more than 200 products ranging from batik material to mineral water.

JORDAN's parliament has authorised political parties for the first time
since they were banned by King Hussein 36 years ago.
The law passed late on Sunday represents a further move to democratise
Jordan's political system under the Hashemite monarchy, in a process
launched by King Hussein in 1989.
The new law states that parties must have at least 50 founding members and
can be open to anyone over 18 years of age. All parties must agree to work
within Jordan's constitution.
The law was backed by 43 of the 52 members of Jordan's lower house present
for the vote. The king's turn-about over political parties reflects his
hopes of containing opponents of the peace talks with Israel and of
undercutting the influence of Jordan's Moslem Brotherhood.
The Brotherhood emerged as the most influential organised group in the 1989
elections, the first for more than two decades, winning a third of Jordan's
parliament's 80 seats.
The king is trying to weaken the hold of Islamic groups on political life by
offering secular political movements a chance to organise for the next round
of elections, due later this year.
The government also hopes that a potential coalition of liberal, leftist and
nationalist groups could help absorb a popular outcry if the peace process
led to a compromise unacceptable to Palestinian and Jordanian nationalists.
King Hussein is thus reversing a pattern he started himself in 1957 when he
forged a de facto alliance with the conservative Moslem Brotherhood to
counter his radical Arab and Palestinian rivals. As a result the Brotherhood
was tolerated, while other parties were forced to go underground.
The government and secular politicians have recently concluded that allowing
political parties could help prevent the sort of turmoil threatening
Algeria.
'We do not want to be forced to sacrifice democracy to prevent the Islamists
from taking over,' said one Jordanian official, referring to the Algerian
authorities' decision to annul general elections last January in the face of
a certain victory for the Islamic Salvation Front.
The law stipulates that parties may not receive funding from abroad.
