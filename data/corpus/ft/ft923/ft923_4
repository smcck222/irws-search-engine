FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lower copper prices affect Antofagasta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Antofagasta Holdings, which has interests in mining, banking, transportation
and water supply in Chile, announced a 7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 8.9m in the half year to June 30.
The results were affected by lower copper prices, the company said, although
prices in the second half had improved. The group's other activities
maintained their contribution.
Turnover rose to Pounds 31.8m (Pounds 27.9m). Earnings came through at 22.1p
(25p) per share and the interim dividend is unchanged at 6p.
Its ultimate holding company is Dolberg Finance Corporation, incorporated in
Liechtenstein.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth margins squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lambert Howarth Group, the footwear manufacturer and importer, reported
pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 1.26m for the first half of
1992.
Against a background of a difficult UK market, sales rose by 9 per cent to
Pounds 24.9m. But margins have been hit due to cancellations on UK orders in
the Burnley factory, and quality problems on production using imported
uppers, said Mr Roger Rowland, chairman. These combined to produce a
considerable loss of margin in the second quarter.
He was confident that the production problem had been largely overcome and
although conditions remained tough, the order book was strong.
The interim dividend is raised from 4p to 4.25p, payable from earnings of
15.8p (18.6p).

Baillie Gifford Technology announced a fall in net asset value per share
from 11.5p to 7.3p, as a result of a write-down in the value of its
investment in Intelligent Environments, a software company.
The trust is winding itself down by selling off its holdings and
redistributing the proceeds to investors. Intelligent Environments is one of
the few remaining assets.
Net losses for the six months to August 31 were Pounds 16,859 (profits of
Pounds 36,220), equivalent to 0.15p (earnings of 0.33p) per share. No
interim dividend is declared.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Appleyard helped by exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLEYARD Group, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, reported pre-tax
profits ahead 16 per cent in the six months to June 30.
The outcome of Pounds 1.75m compared with Pounds 1.51m in the first half of
last year and was only marginally short of the depressed Pounds 1.81m
achieved in the whole of 1991.
However, the latest figure was struck after an exceptional profit of Pounds
1.37m relating to the disposal of freehold property in Leeds, and interest
charges reduced to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.65m).
Turnover fell to Pounds 158.1m (Pounds 218.9m).
Mr Mike Williamson, chairman, said the new car market during the period was
4 per cent below last year, but the group had improved overall margins.
Contract hire and leasing lifted profits by 15 per cent and the commercial
vehicle side performed 'extremely well' in a weaker market.
Referring to sales in August, Mr Williamson said overall volumes were
largely unchanged with the notable exception of Audi/VW where national
volumes were down 23 per cent on August 1991.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.6p, uncovered by earnings of 2.2p
(2.1p) per share.

FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Havelock Pounds 3m funding to secure future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVELOCK EUROPA, the lossmaking shopfitting company, is seeking to secure
its future by a Pounds 2.97m placing and open offer and the building of a
trading alliance with SAS Holdings, a private building systems supplier.
At the same time, the Fife-based company announced a reduced interim pre-tax
loss of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.18m). Sir Lewis Robertson, the company doctor
who became chairman when a new management was installed in 1989, also said
he was retiring at the end of the year.
Havelock is placing 10m shares at 31p, of which SAS is taking up to 1m, or
3.84 per cent of the increased equity. The open offer is on a 5-for-8 basis
at the same price. The new shares will make up 38.46 per cent of the
enlarged capital. The shares closed 1p lower at 35p.
The money is needed for a restructuring necessitated by difficult trading
conditions which have seen business in the group's traditional market fall
by a third between 1989 and 1991, with a further decline expected in the
present year.
The programme will cut the cost base by Pounds 3.5m with asset write-offs
and redundancy costs of Pounds 800,000 for which provision will be made in
the second half.
In the six months to June 30 turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 16m (Pounds
17.5m). The pre-tax figure was helped by lower exceptional costs of Pounds
61,000 (Pounds 490,000).
There was no tax charge against a credit last time of Pounds 740,000 leaving
losses per share higher at 10p (9p). The interim dividend is passed as there
are no distributable reserves.
On his departure Sir Lewis said that much had been achieved since he arrived
and that the company was now firmly established. That allowed him time to
spend on his other commitments. He will be replaced by Mr Norman Lessels, an
existing board member.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Ford warns of loss in European
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, has warned that its European operations will collapse
back into loss this year as it is forced to cut production in order to
reduce stock levels in the face of weakening sales.
The company has informed the US Securities and Exchange Commission that
over-optimistic dealer orders in Europe, which encouraged Ford to increase
production in the first half of the year, had exceeded retail sales.
It warned that European production would have to be cut in order 'to balance
dealer inventories with retail demand, which will result in a loss for the
year.'
The warning is a severe setback for Ford of Europe, which had struggled back
into profit in the first half of 1992 following last year's record loss.
In the first half of this year, Ford of Europe recovered to a net profit of
Dollars 108m, after plunging into a net loss for the whole of last year of
Dollars 1.079bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of
Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
Ford said that the improvement in its earnings in the first and second
quarters had come from increases in its dealer inventories.
Without a recovery, inventory adjustments in Europe would limit further
improvements in total group earnings 'resulting in losses for the year in
markets outside the US.'
Further redundancies and production cuts were announced by Ford for its UK
plants yesterday, but Mr Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, said
last night that 'there will be additional restructuring on a pan-European
basis.'
Mr Halstead said Ford of Europe had reduced its vehicle sales forecast for
Europe by 132,000 in the last six months, of which 80,000 was accounted for
by the UK.
'There is not a plant that has not reduced its workforce in the last six
months across Europe,' Mr Halstead said.

controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems, the US workstations group, is alleged to have been
'covertly funding' an anti-trust lawsuit against the Open Software
Foundation, an industry group whose members include International Business
Machines, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
The lawsuit, filed in April 1991 by Addamax, a small Illinois software
company, alleges the industry group acted as an 'illegal cartel'.
OSF had previously rejected Addamax's submission of security software for
inclusion as a component of its OSF/1 computer operating system. This system
is designed to establish an 'industry standard' version of Unix, the widely
used AT&amp;T operating system.
Sun Microsystems confirmed it had 'provided financial assistance to Addamax
in the form of a loan guarantee to help fund expenses associated with the
lawsuit'. According to OSF, Sun provided Addamax with a Dollars 7.5m loan
guarantee.
OSF said: 'This lawsuit was not the simple effort of a small, independent
software vendor. Rather, Sun has been involved from the outset, and only by
recent court order, which was opposed by Addamax, was Sun's financial
backing of the suit revealed.'
But Sun said it agreed to help Addamax because the company was a Sun
supplier and 'appears to be raising serious issues of importance to the
industry'.
The disclosure of Sun's involvement in the anti-trust suit revives tensions
between OSF and its rival, Unix International, in the open systems software
arena. Sun is a founding member of Unix International, as is AT&amp;T. OSF was
formed out of concern that Sun and AT&amp;T, who agreed to work together on a
standard version of the Unix system, might design the software to give Sun a
competitive advantage.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Marzotto reports first-half
tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARZOTTO, Italy's biggest clothing group which last year bought control of
Germany's Hugo Boss, reported a steep decline in consolidated net profits
after minority interests to L9.3bn (Dollars 7.3m) in the first half of this
year from L20.3bn last year.
The decline was most marked at parent company level, where operating
earnings fell by 25 per cent to L28.7bn. After a L52.9bn write down on its
Hugo Boss stake, the parent company reported a L31.2bn six-month loss.
However, the group forecast full-year earnings should be in line with the
net L39.8bn made in 1991, in spite of the growing recession in Italy and the
slowdown in many foreign markets.
The group expected sales to reach around L2,000bn this year, confirming its
position as one of Europe's leading textile and clothing manufacturers.
Meanwhile, net group debt should fall, on an adjusted basis, through the
continuing policy of using cash flow to reduce borrowings.
The drop in earnings comes in spite of the first-time contribution from Hugo
Boss, which pushed Marzotto's group sales up by 42 per cent to L951.8bn in
the six months. The bulk of the surge in turnover came on the clothing side,
where the inclusion of Boss spurred a 118.2 per cent rise to L584.8bn.
Buying Boss also sharply reduced the group's dependence on the Italian
market, with the majority of sales coming from outside Italy. While domestic
turnover fell by 6.4 per cent to L437.1bn, foreign sales jumped by 153.2 per
cent to L514.7bn.
Marzotto minimised the impact of profits fall by noting that earnings in the
first half of 1991 had been boosted by L9.6bn in extraordinary items. By
contrast, non-recurring items had caused a L800,000m loss in the first half
of this year.

FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fiat pre-tax profits slide to
L655bn at halfway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday reported a further
steep setback in profits with a fall to L655bn (Dollars 525.68m) pre-tax in
the first half of this year from L1,455bn in the same period of 1991.
The decline, on a 2.2 per cent acquisition-driven sales rise to L30.142bn,
reflects the group's continuing dilemma of heavy investment and research
spending at a time of falling demand and shrinking profit margins.
The weak earnings performance came in spite of the L860bn extraordinary gain
from the sale of Fiat's remaining stake in Alcatel Italia, the
telecommunications equipment company. Excluding the one-off gain, the
group's ratio of pre-tax earnings to sales fell to 2.2 per cent from 4.9 per
cent at the interim stage last year and 3 per cent for 1991 as a whole.
There has been a sharp swing in Fiat's net financial position over the past
12 months, with a deficit of L2,510bn comparing with a surplus of L431bn.
This stems mostly from this year's payment of almost L550bn in dividends and
the assumption of heavy additional burdens after the purchase of Ford New
Holland, which manufactures farming equipment, by Fiat's construction
equipment subsidiary. The company has pumped around L1,000bn in new working
capital into Ford New Holland.
Fiat said it expected to close the year in profit, in spite of the
deterioration in earnings. The core cars business was still breaking even,
according to an official. However, the company revealed the margin on its
industrial activities, principally cars, was now down to 0.3 per cent of
sales, equivalent to just L78bn.
With Fiat warning of virtual economic stagnation in Italy and the possible
impact on consumption of the government's deficit-cutting measures - which
will raise taxes and cut benefits - earnings will remain under pressure.
Italy remains Fiat's key market for vehicles, and its share of sales is
still falling. In the first half, its market share reached 44.4 per cent,
against 47.5 per cent at end-June 1991.
The outlook for the full year is not encouraging. Fiat gave no indication
about its plans for the dividend, cut by 38 per cent for ordinary shares
last year. Failing further asset sales, the prospect for earnings and the
dividend seem poor.

FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities draw strength from
bond prices
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
BUOYED by an upturn in bond prices, US stock markets registered modest gains
in fairly active trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.18 up at 3,287.87, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.03 to 418.47 and the Nasdaq composite put
on 2.97 to 585.93. NYSE turnover totalled 188m shares.
The market drew all its strength from bond prices. The steep fall in bonds,
which had pushed long-term yields up sharply, had prompted talk that the
Treasury market was heading for a sustained bear phase. Yesterday's recovery
in bond prices (the 30-year issue was up about 1/2 point in early afternoon
trading) helped allay fears of rising interest rates.
Ironically, the improvement in bond prices was a reaction to bad economic
news: the latest weekly jobless claims figures showed a much bigger rise in
the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance than had been
expected. The increase may have been inflated by job losses related to
Hurricane Andrew, but this was offset by the fact that the reporting period
was shorter than usual due to the Labor Day break.
Car manufacturers remained in the limelight. Chrysler firmed Dollars 3/8 to
Dollars 22 3/4 in busy trading after stating that it had reached a tentative
agreement with unions which should avert a strike by drivers and
technicians.
General Motors, down sharply earlier in the week on analysts' downgrades,
rallied Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 , but Ford, which had performed
relatively well this week, eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 .
The Dow was weighted down by a poor performance from pharmaceuticals group
Merck, which dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 1/2 in 3.3m shares traded
after early figures for prescriptions of Merck's prostate drug Proscar came
in below expectations.
Unisys rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 9 1/8 after the computer group declared
a Dollars 1.40625 a share dividend on its series 'A' cumulative convertible
preferred stock, payable October 15.
On the Nasdaq market, Athena Neurosciences moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 8 5/8 after saying results of new studies had backed its plan to
develop tests and therapeutic drugs for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease.
Checkers Drive-In added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 22 on news that it will open
60 stores in and around Philadelphia in the next two years.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed in subdued dealings as the market remained wary
about a possible key rate increase by the Bank of Canada to defend the
Canadian dollar.
The TSE 300 index gained 6.2 at 3,410.6, but declines led advances by 263 to
252. Volume came to 27.3m shares.

FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Caricom sets up investment fund -
Companies in the region stand to benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean Community (Caricom) governments are considering proposals from
Crown Agents Assets Management, of the UK, and two Jamaican finance houses,
for the management of a Dollars 50m investment fund for the region.
The British company, which manages investment funds and aid finance
programmes in developing countries, is in competition with the ICWI Group, a
financial services conglomerate, and the Trafalgar Development Bank, which
has proposed itself as the lead partner in a consortium with foreign finance
houses.
The three companies' proposals are being reviewed by a committee of regional
central bankers and economists. They are expected to inform the community's
heads of government of their decision next February.
Although it is seeking one fund, the community will allow more than one if
companies provide adequate proposals on raising the capital and in meeting
other conditions.
The community's members are the English-speaking countries of the region,
including Belize in Central America, the Bahamas, and Guyana in South
America. It has a cumulative market of 5.5m people and is attempting to
create a customs union and a common market by 1994.
The community expects the fund to invest in equities in all member
countries, with a portfolio which will cover listed and unlisted stocks,
including unquoted companies wanting funds for expansion and likely to be
listed on the stock market. Only three of the countries - Jamaica, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Barbados - have stock markets, while the Guyana government
is planning one. The fund will also invest in countries without a local
stock market, including the smaller islands of the eastern Caribbean.
When it is established, the Caribbean investment fund will undertake equity
investments in sectors such as export and domestic agriculture, tourism,
construction, utilities, financial services and real estate development, but
with more attention to those undertakings involved in exporting.
The fund will include ordinary shares, as well as warrants for up to 10 per
cent of the capital, and these will be listed on an international stock
exchange. Its shares will be placed mainly with institutional investors in
developed countries which have a special interest in the Caribbean. Some
placings will also be done in the Caribbean.
Capital for the fund will be raised through private placings with
institutional investors which, the Community governments hope, will ensure
quick procurement and an early start. The Community feels that since the
investments will take some time, all the capital does not have to be
attracted at the start once there is an assurance of an ability to raise the
full amount over two years.
The fund will be particularly beneficial to the many companies in the region
which have become highly geared and want to change their debt/ equity
structure. Many have been dependent traditionally on loans for their
expansion, and have had only moderate success in attracting equity capital.
The new fund will have many opportunities for investing in regional
enterprises, with the governments of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and
Guyana divesting themselves of several companies, and inviting foreign and
local private sector participation.
The fund will be particularly beneficial to the many companies in the region

FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Accelerated downtrend for
German carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIXED day for bourses saw Swiss shares easier in spite of a rate cut,
Spain still unhappy about measures to protect the peseta, and more pain for
German carmakers as investors broke off their recent love affair, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's carmakers accelerated their downtrend, BMW losing DM29 to DM485
for a fall of 12.1 per cent on the week so far, Daimler by DM30.30 to
DM597.70 for 8.2 per cent and Volkswagen by DM11.50 to DM295 for a four-day
fall of 8.1 per cent.
The DAX index fell 26.89, or 1.7 per cent on the day to 1,530.94. Paribas
Capital Markets said that Deutsche Bank was reported to be downgrading BMW
and Daimler by around 5 per cent and VW by 10-15 per cent; Dresdner said
that it was recalculating its figures to incorporate exchange rate problems;
and, in London, James Capel put out a sell note on BMW.
Turnover rose from DM4.9bn to DM5.1bn. Banks, again, held up much better
than average. Deutsche Bank closed at DM656, down DM5.50 on the day and on
the week. Even more interest rate-sensitive, Bayernhypo and Bayernverein
rose another DM1 and DM1.50 to DM394 and DM411 respectively, up DM7 and DM4
on the past four days.
MADRID fell to its lowest level since December 1986 as foreign investors
sold heavily following the reintroduction of currency controls on Wednesday.
The general index lost 7.07 or 3.4 per cent to 198.15 while the Ibex was 3.8
per cent weaker. Turnover swelled to some Pta17bn.
Analysts agreed that there was a massive capital outflow as foreign
institutions sold positions and traders were anticipating another choppy day
today.
PARIS stabilised as pressure on the franc eased slightly after several days
of turbulence. The CAC-40 index closed just 0.57 ahead at 1,829.50 after a
day's high of 1,853.17.
Among the session's movers Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez lost FFr21 or 3.9 per
cent to FFr510 after warning that second half earnings would be affected by
weakness in the property sector. Lafarge Coppee gained FFr10 to FFr289 on
better-than-expected figures while Michelin improved FFr5.50 to FFr201.50
following a meeting with analysts.
Saint-Louis closed down FFr55 or 4.7 per cent at FFr1,095 on a fall in first
half earnings published after Wednesday's close.
MILAN fell victim to anxiety about interest rates, and a 2.58 rise to 367.12
in the Comit index was replaced by a 1.3 per cent drop, in lira terms, in
the Italian component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index in the London
afternoon.
Sip, after Wednesday's 14 per cent increase in first half gross profits,
fell L12.1 to L969.4 on worries that it could be hit by political wrangling
over the future of the telecommunications sector, and the proposed 0.75 per
cent tax on corporate net assets.
Fiat fixed L43 higher at L3,621, but retreated to L3,565 on the kerb ahead
of more than halved pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992. Cir, Mr
Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, tumbled L47.5, or 5 per cent to L904.3
on worries about the outlook for Olivetti, its main unit, which fixed L25
lower at L1,715 and fell to L1,680 on the kerb.
AMSTERDAM ended flat as a predicted further interest rate cut by the central
bank failed to materialise. The CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at
113.1.
Nedlloyd finished down Fl 1.20 at Fl 35.50 with news coming during the
session that Mr Torstein Hagen had won a court ruling enabling him to take
his seat on the board of the transport group.
A negative analysts' meeting left DSM down Fl 2.70 at Fl 24.60 while news of
improved prospects for Philips' CD-I system lifted the shares 40 cents to Fl
24.60.
VIENNA eased slightly as the impetus from Wednesday's cut in the money
market intervention rate faded. The ATX index ended down 7.94 at 828.11.
Vienna Airport went against the trend, rising Sch42 to Sch498 after
reporting a 56 per cent increase in first half net profits.
STOCKHOLM scored a 16.8 per cent rise in the banks and finance index,
encouraged by a government pledge to build a safety net under the country's
shaky financial system.
S-E-Banken, which faces a SKr1bn loan exposure to the troubled bank holding
group, Gota, was the day's winner, the restricted A rising SKr2 to SKr12.5.
Handelsbanken B rose SKr3 to SKr26.
However, other shares were mixed to lower and the Affarsvalden General index
eased 0.30 to 708.90. Professionals noted, meanwhile, that the banks and
finance index had fallen by more than 70 per cent this year before
yesterday's recovery.

FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises as higher
yen prompts interest rate hopes

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURGE in the yen to a record high against the dollar raised hopes of
lower interest rates, and shares advanced on active buying by investment
trusts and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 327.23 at 18,609.95, having opened at the day's
low of 18,325.64 and reaching a high of 18,701.95 in the afternoon.
Volume increased to 370m shares from 288m, although institutional investors
said they were in no hurry to trade in large lots. Rises outnumbered falls
by 703 to 303, with 139 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 15.02 to 1,381.18, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index firmed 1.90 to 1,107.23.
The yen appreciated to Y119.83 against the dollar in the morning session as
the currency turmoil in Europe prompted Japanese investors to liquidate
European currency holdings. It closed at Y120.25 on position adjustments.
Hopes of an imminent discount rate cut by the Bank of Japan also sparked a
rally on the government bond market, where the yield on the No 145 10-year
benchmark bond fell 11 basis points to 4.79 per cent.
Potential beneficiaries of a higher yen and lower interest rates rallied,
while exporters lost ground. Steels and shipbuilders were higher.
Among leading exporters, Hitachi lost Y13 to Y759 and Matsushita Electric
Industrial Y60 to Y1,140. Toyota Motor receded Y20 to Y1,420 and Honda Motor
fell Y80 to Y1,320.
A firm resource-related sector had Nippon Oil Y30 ahead at Y690 and Showa
Shell Sekiyu up Y60 at Y1,370. Electric power companies gained ground, Tokyo
Electric Power appreciating Y80 to Y2,800.
Individuals and dealers continued to trade speculative stocks. Mitsui Mining
&amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y60 to Y523,
reflecting reports of a gold mine discovery in southern Japan. Sumitomo
Metal Mining moved ahead Y22 to Y764.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 218.21 to 19,822.90 in volume of 40m shares.
Roundup
THE region's markets were mixed yesterday.
BANGKOK saw some profit-taking following a sharp rally over the past week as
investors reacted positively to the formation of the new government. The SET
index shed 7.76 to 863.61, while turnover soared to Bt20.5bn, only the
second day that daily turnover has exceeded Bt20bn.
Bangkok Land and Krisda Mahanakorn retreated Bt4 and Bt14 respectively to
Bt146 and Bt230.
AUSTRALIA recovered from early falls to end the day slightly higher on heavy
Japanese buying of futures contracts. After declining 10 points initially,
the All Ordinaries index closed a net 2.2 up at 1,507.2. Turnover was
ADollars 212m.
Westpac slipped 9 cents to ADollars 2.91 after announcing that its ADollars
1.2bn rights issue had closed with a 72 per cent shortfall. News Corp was up
22 cents at ADollars 24.20 following a forecast of record earnings for
1992/93.
HONG KONG saw overseas selling as uncertainty about the future of the
Colony's new airport soured sentiment. The Hang Seng index regained some
ground in late trading to finish 53.91 down at 5,658.73, having earlier
registered a 90-point fall. Turnover expanded to HKDollars 1.96bn from
Wednesday's HKDollars 1.65bn.
MANILA saw dull trading and the composite index eased 1.13 to 1,386.42.
Turnover jumped to 307.2m pesos from the previous day's 184m pesos.
SEOUL's early gains were eroded as political worries persisted. The
composite index was finally off 1.00 at 523.35 in turnover of Won210.45bn.
Some analysts said Daewoo Group shares were vulnerable and led other leading
stocks down.
BOMBAY fell sharply on fears that today's meeting between brokers and
officials of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) could lead to
a confrontation. The BSE index closed 51.79 lower at 3,246.96.
Bourse chiefs are expected to oppose SEBI moves, which include changing the
composition of exchange boards to a 60 per cent portion of outside nominees
and reducing settlement periods.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco seeks tax cuts to
secure Trail smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMINCO, the Canadian base metals producer, has warned that the viability of
its troubled Trail lead and zinc smelter in south-east British Columbia
hinges on a willingness by the provincial government to provide tax and
other cost-cutting concessions.
The BC authorities have so far rejected various recommendations made earlier
this year by a 'jobs protection commissioner', notably a proposal for an
CDollars 8.5m (Dollars 6.9m) a year reduction in water licence fees levied
on Trail.
Cominco has a reputation as a tough negotiator willing to carry out its
threats. It has said that, without a cut in the water tax, it may not go
ahead with plans to overhaul the lead smelter at Trail, which was taken out
of service shortly after it began operations in late 1989.
A Cominco spokesman added yesterday that the future of the lead smelter
could not be separated from the rest of the complex, which is the world's
largest producer of refined non-ferrous metals. He said that 'we're not
planning on shutting down Trail operations, but under the current tax
regime, it's going to be very difficult to operate Trail. The ball is back
in the government's court.'
Cominco is also seeking a cut in municipal property taxes, rail tariffs and
environmental clean-up charges.
Trail, which last year produced 242,000 tonnes of refined zinc, or about 5
per cent of western world production, and 87,000 tonnes of lead (nearly 2
per cent of western world output) has racked up operating losses of CDollars
98m over the past two years.
According to estimates published by the government, the cost of rebuilding
the lead smelter will run as high as CDollars 200m. Other parts of the Trail
operation require capital spending of up to CDollars 325m over the next five
years.
An official in the province's economic development department said yesterday
that 'we're going to do everything we can' to ensure that Trail remains
open.
But the government is concerned that a cut in water rentals might be
perceived as an unfair subsidy by Canada's trading partners, resulting in
countervailing duties such as those recently imposed by the US against
Canadian softwood timber and magnesium exports.
As an alternative, the province has proposed a 'commercial arrangement',
under which it would buy a portion of the power generated by hydro-electric
dams owned by Cominco. Proceeds from the sale of this power would be used to
help finance future capital investment at Trail.
Mr Robert Hallbauer, Cominco's chief executive, has been at the forefront of
recent criticism of the investment climate for mining companies in Canada.
He warned in his last annual report to shareholders that unless the
authorities address the industry's concerns: 'Canadian companies will
accelerate the already significant investment in exploration and mine
development in other countries.'

ZINC moved into backwardation again on the LME in an otherwise routine
trading day for the base metals. Dealers said cash zinc closed Dollars 9.50
ahead of three-month metal, compared with a discount of Dollars 5 on
Wednesday. Although fears of an October squeeze have faded, the market will
remain susceptible to pockets of technical tightness. COPPER closed steady.
Chinese buying in the morning aided sentiment, and dips towards Dollars
2,380 for three-month metal are likely to encounter support. After the
close, news emerged that Peru's Tintaya copper mine unions have voted to
strike by 1 October. Three-month TIN prices continued to drift downwards
towards the Dollars 6,500 a tonne chart objective. London COCOA remained
under pressure from talk of Ivorian selling. 'With the calmer tone in the
currency markets we're finding the cocoa fundamentals are playing their part
again,' one dealer said. New York COTTON futures were sharply lower at
midday. One analyst said the bears continued to be in charge. 'The fact that
there is excess cotton in mainland China, and the uncertainty as to what
they are going to do with it, is hanging heavily over the world market.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee falls despite ICO
optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COFFEE markets fell back yesterday after rising this week as optimism
emerged over progress at talks on a new international coffee agreement.
Sentiment was dampened by remarks made in Washington by Mr Lewis Preston,
president of the World Bank. He told the Reuters news agency that he was
sceptical that an agreement would succeed in reviving the coffee market,
which had suffered a sharp decline in prices mainly because of a fundamental
imbalance between supply and demand.
In London the November robusta coffee contract closed at Dollars 797 a
tonne, down Dollars 16 on the day, as profit taking emerged. Earlier this
week the contract touched a recent high of Dollars 826 a tonne. In late
trading in New York yesterday the nearby contract was down 0.70 at 56.10
cents a lb. At these levels, coffee prices are about half what they were
when the international coffee agreement collapsed in July 1989.
Delegates at the International Coffee Organisation headquarters in London
this week appear to have made some headway with their negotiations. They
have agreed on the definition of 'universal quota', under which exporting
members will send their coffee to all destinations 'without distinction
between importing member and non-member countries'.
There also seems to be an admission by producers that they will have to bear
most of the burden of regulating an export quota system.
However, traders and analysts have yet to be convinced that further progress
will be made before the talks end next Friday. 'What's coming out of the ICO
is very positive, but it's still very difficult to see how they can come up
with an agreement. They are making progress, but there are still huge
stumbling blocks,' said one trader yesterday.

<TEXT>
WOOL production in New Zealand is expected to fall by at least 7 per cent
this season to 205,420 clean tonnes, the New Zealand Wool Board said, Reuter
reports from Wellington.
'The expected fall will result mainly from poor seasonal conditions, which
are expected to reduce wool production per head by 5.2 per cent,' the board
said in a statement. A fall in sheep numbers will also contribute to the
drop.
Shorn wool is expected to be down by 5.2 per cent, while slipe wool will be
down by 17.3 per cent. The statistics were calculated by the board's
economic service which said they may be on the high side.
'The way things have been lately, with the atrocious winter conditions and
stock losses, plus a slow wet start to spring, I believe we may see an even
greater fall in wool production,' board chief executive Grant Sinclair said.
'Supplies of wool at auction could be very tight during the season,' he
said.
Production falls are expected to be the greater in the South Island, with a
9.7 per cent drop, compared with a 3.5 per cent drop in the North Island.
The wool season runs from July 1 to June 30.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat sales renew anger at
subsidy wars - David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, examines the reaction to
the widening of the EEP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United States trade officials have justified President Bush's decision to
dump 29m tonnes of subsidised wheat on world markets in the coming year as
'a crucial tool' in forcing the European Community to the bargaining table
in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation.
If there is a grain of truth in this, then that is about the limit of it.
Cynics will argue that the planned sale, announced during an election
campaign rally for mid-western farmers at the start of the month, has more
to do with winning votes than squeezing the EC.
In any case the real victims are likely to be wheat exporters in Canada,
Australia and the developing world, where governments cannot afford to join
the US and the EC in their profligate export subsidy regimes.
The US and EC subsidy regimes, which cost them Dollars 34.7bn and Dollars
83.6bn respectively in 1991, have made them the world's leading farm
exporters - but at terrible cost to their competitors. World commodity
prices fell for the third consecutive year in 1991, to hit an all-time low,
as high levels of production from subsidised EC and US farmers created
surpluses that have had to be dumped on world markets.
Out of total wheat exports of 103m tonnes in 1991-92, the US accounted for
33.5m and the EC for 23.5m - most sold at world prices 25 per cent below the
price guaranteed to farmers at home.
Throughout this week, Mr John Kerin, Australia's Trade minister, is in
Washington lambasting US officials over what Australians see as US perfidy
on wheat exports. His government has already drafted a note to the Council
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva calling for
collective action against the US. It has been signed by Canada, Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela.
In recent weeks, angry Australian newspapers have branded the US as 'public
enemy number one' - an honour historically reserved for the EC, whose farm
dumping policies in recent years have played a lead role in depressing world
wheat prices, and forcing non-subsidised exporters to seek new and marginal
markets.
The US administration has so far been unrepentant about the subsidised wheat
offer, which provides for subsidies of up to Dollars 1bn in the fiscal year
to July 1993. The programme is an extension of the Export Enhancement
Programme (EEP), which has been in place since 1985. It adds a total of 28
new target markets to those already receiving EEP grain. These range from
Pakistan and South Africa to Brazil and South Korea.
Mr Stephen Censky, acting administrator of the US Department of
Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, accepts the non-subsidising
wheat exporters are likely to get hurt in the crossfire between the EC and
the US: 'Any time countries are competing against subsidised prices on the
world market, that is going to have a price lowering effect,' he said in
Canberra last week. 'We try to limit that, but there is a negative effect on
world prices.'
The US insists that it will try to limit damage by targeting EC markets, by
limiting the size of sales in any one market, and by winning assurances from
purchasers that they will not reduce imports from non-subsidised suppliers
such as Australia, Canada or Argentina.
In Australia, these claims have been greeted with derision, however. After
four major infringements by the US into Kuwait, Yemen, China and Pakistan -
all important markets for Australian wheat where the EC is a marginal or
non-existent exporter - Canberra now feels it was duped by the US into
previously reserving blame for the EC.
Australian wheat export earnings have fallen from a peak of ADollars 2.56bn
(Dollars 1.85bn) in 1989 to ADollars 1.58bn last year - a decline aggravated
by drought in eastern Australia.
In Canada, the world's leading wheat exporter after the US and the EC,
damage has taken the form of lower prices and heavier spending on promotion.
The recent expansion of the EEP brings 95 per cent of Canada's markets
within the ambit of US subsidies.
As income from wheat sales has fallen, so the Canadian Wheat Board, which
oversees all of the country's wheat exports, has reported a deficit for
1990/91 of CDollars 673m (Dollars 547m) - only the third shortfall in its
49-year history.
Canadians also pour scorn on US claims that the extended EEP is targeted at
EC markets. For example it includes Brazil and South Korea, which have
become significant markets for Canadian wheat, but which buy little grain
from the EC.
The Canadian Wheat Board has been forced to probe painstakingly for new
markets that are unaffected by the subsidy war - aided by the fact that the
quality of their wheat is second to none. As a result, they have edged their
way into markets such as Japan, the UK, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Argentina, among the world's lowest-cost farming nations, has lost three key
export markets through the subsidies war, the government claims. The CIS,
China and Egypt all used to import wheat from Argentina, but today import
none, according to first half trade export figures from the agriculture
department.
Mr Alieto Guadagni, international economic relations secretary, said farm
subsidies now cost Argentina Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.5bn a year in lost
export revenues. The impact of subsidies on Argentina's exports is clear:
wheat exports peaked in 1983 at 10.2m tonnes, with record revenues of
Dollars 1.47bn. By 1988 they had fallen to 3.7m tonnes, worth Dollars 361m.
Exports now hover at around half the 1983 level, with revenues running at
one-third of the 1983 record. Argentina forecasts exports of 5.7m tonnes in
the current 1991-92 harvest, up 21 per cent on the previous year. However,
it projects exports of just 5m tonnes in 1992-93.
By targeting Brazil, Argentina's biggest wheat market, accounting for about
a quarter of exports, for 500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat under the EEP
initiative, the US is expected to dent export prices by at least 10 per
cent, according to Argentina's agriculture department. This would lead to a
loss of Dollars 45m in export revenue.
The agriculture department is also sceptical about US claims that its cheap
exports are aimed at damaging the EC. Buenos Aires says the EC has not
targeted Brazil, which has already bought 1.3m tonnes of Argentine wheat in
1991-92.
Furthermore, the new EEP programme aims to sell 3.1m tonnes of subsidised
wheat to Bangladesh, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela -
six countries which together imported 1.6m tonnes of wheat from Argentina in
1991-92. Although Argentina's Menem administration has stabilised the
economy through market-based policies and is privatising infrastructure,
farmers complain that low international prices plus high production costs
and punitive interest rates are driving many of them into bankruptcy.
The government says there are 200,000 small family farms that are no longer
viable units and face the threat of being bought out by larger, more
capital-intensive farmers - a plight faced by small farmers in many other
developing countries as a result of depressed commodity prices.
Unhappily, these countries have found themselves as impotent in the face of
US and EC wheat dumping as Australia, which, apart from 'strong protests',
has murmured implausibly about reviews of air traffic rights and closure of
US naval bases in Australia.
Nor is the completion of the Uruguay Round likely to bring relief: cuts in
EC farm subsidies appear unlikely to have any significant impact on world
prices for many years to come, and in the meanwhile the US is likely to be
unrelenting in its tit-for-tat subsidy war. As always, when elephants fight,
it is the grass that gets crushed.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica aims to boost alumina
output by 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the weak state of the aluminium market, bauxite refiners in
Jamaica are expanding their refining capacity to lift the island's alumina
output by about 50 per cent by 1997.
The industry is using all its current installed refining capacity of 3m
tonnes a year, and according to Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the
Jamaica Bauxite Institute, growth will be constrained until the plants are
expanded.
Alumina Partners of Jamaica, the island's largest refiner, will lift
capacity from the current 1.2m tonnes a year to 1.5m tonnes by the middle of
next year. Mr Davis said a second phase of expansion will see an increase to
2m tonnes a year.
The company, owned by Kaiser Aluminum of the United States and Hydro
Aluminum of Norway, is spending Dollars 180m on the first phase of the
program.
Jamalco, a refinery jointly owned by the Jamaican government and the
Aluminum Company of America, is boosting capacity from 800,000 tonnes a year
to 1m tonnes at a cost of Dollars 60m, Mr Davis said. The plant's rated
capacity will later be increased to 1.5m tonnes a year.
Two refineries owned by Alcan of Canada are also being upgraded to lift
total alumina output by 200,000 tonnes a year to 1.2m tonnes.
Industry sources say the companies are not deterred by the weak state of the
aluminium market. 'This is a market which has always been cyclic and will
rebound,' said an industry spokesman. 'The hope is that the added capacity
will be in place when there is an increase in demand.'
The state of the market, however, is depressing the earnings from the
industry for Jamaica, the world's third largest producer of bauxite ore
after Australia and New Guinea.
Mr Davis says the island's earnings from the industry this year will be
about Dollars 625m. Earnings have declined steadily from Dollars 700m in
1991 and Dollars 725 in 1992 as aluminium prices have fallen.
The Bauxite Institute is projecting Jamaica's mine and refinery output for
this year at the same levels as 1991 - 11.5m tonnes of bauxite and 3m tonnes
of alumina.

Products

<TEXT>
TWO rival bids were last night submitted for Sealord Products, New Zealand's
largest deep sea fishing company, which was put up for sale by Carter Holt
Harvey (CHH), the forestry group.
One bid was from a New Zealand government backed Maori-led consortium which
includes Brierley Investments, the investment group. The other was from
Ashlar, a consortium led by Royal Greenland, a Danish state-owned fishing
company.
Both bids are unconditional, following due diligence procedures. CHH, which
is selling Sealord to reduce debt, said the bids had been received by its
5pm deadline.
Earlier yesterday Maori representatives signed a deal under which the
government will lend them NZDollars 150m (USDollars 80.79m) to buy a half
share in Sealord.
The Ashlar consortium includes Ord Minnett, of Australian banking group
Westpac, and Polar Products, a New Zealand fishing company.
Ashlar said Royal Greenland's interest in the consortium was not more than
24.9 per cent, but would not disclose the size of the other members' stakes
or name all its partners. It had not ruled out the prospect of some Maori
investment in the consortium to represent tribal fisheries claims.
Ashlar said it would also look at selling a portion of Sealord through a
public share flotation, once Royal Greenland and Polar Products had improved
its efficiency.
CHH said it would make a prompt decision after reviewing the rival bids.

<TEXT>
GIO Australia, the recently-floated Australian insurance company, has beaten
its prospectus forecasts by unveiling a 23 per cent rise in net profits to
ADollars 117.0m (USDollars 84.59m) for the 12 months to June, up from
ADollars 95.0m a year earlier.
The company, formerly controlled by the government of New South Wales, beat
its flotation forecast of net profits by ADollars 12m.
The directors have declared a 14 cents-a-share interim dividend in line with
the prospectus. Turnover rose to ADollars 1.42bn from ADollars 1.39bn.
Mr Bill Jocelyn, managing director, said the improved result was due to a
stronger-than-expected performance from New South Wales compulsory third
party car insurance. Together with strong investment returns, this offset
flat results elsewhere.
'Although the insurance business is running well at this stage, low interest
rates and subdued investment conditions will make it very difficult to match
the 1992 result next year,' he said.
'The year ahead will be one of consolidation for the group and there are no
plans at the moment for us to consider other acquisitions.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Weakened pound keeps Walker from bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE falling pound has saved Mr George Walker from bankruptcy.
The former chairman of the leisure group Brent Walker yesterday narrowly won
the approval of his creditors for an alternative plan to repay a small
amount of the Pounds 180m he owes.
His escape was achieved because UK insolvency procedures in effect allow
creditors one vote for each pound they are owed.
Mr Walker won because some of his debts were in foreign currency, which
translated into more pounds after sterling's recent devaluation.
At a meeting in London yesterday, creditors representing Pounds 136m of the
Pounds 180m total debt - just over the 75 per cent required - voted in
favour of his alternative to the bankruptcy petition filed by TSB Bank. The
vote had been postponed two weeks ago.
Some Pounds 30m of the vote in favour was held in foreign currency by
offshore trusts associated with Mr Walker and his family.
The sterling value of the debt held by these trusts has increased by roughly
Pounds 4m since the pound began its slide.
Creditors who voted against his voluntary arrangement have one month to
appeal. Some appeared to be unhappy yesterday that claims by trusts
associated with the Walker family had been allowed to vote.
Mr Walker has agreed to give creditors half his after-tax income for the
next three years, his 1.5m shares in Brent Walker, his stakes in two private
companies, two properties and a one-sixth share of an apartment in
Switzerland.
He has also pledged any proceeds of a legal claim in France and from his
action against Brent Walker for unfair dismissal.
Mr Michael Coleman, of Harkavy's, Mr Walker's solicitors, said he expected
creditors would receive about Pounds 15m under the arrangement.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Ford UK and Rolls-Royce announce 2,500 job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, JOHN GRIFFITHS and CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH carmakers added to the government's economic woes yesterday with the
announcement of a further 2,500 redundancies.
Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, announced plans to cut 1,487 hourly paid
jobs at its British car assembly and engine plants and forecast that its
European operations would make a loss for the year, after struggling back
into profit in the first half of 1992.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the heavily lossmaking luxury car subsidiary of
Vickers, the engineering group, is cutting 950 jobs, or nearly a third of
the workforce, at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire.
The latest round of redundancies at Rolls-Royce, which should be completed
during December, will have reduced its UK workforce by 57 per cent, from
4,850 at the end of 1990 to 2,100. The company said compulsory redundancies
appeared inevitable.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday that 70,000
jobs had been lost in the British motor industry, including vehicle makers,
dealers and component suppliers, by spring of this year since the start of
the recession.
Yesterday's job cuts 'show that our worst fears have been realised', Mr
Geoffrey Pelling, general manager of the SMMT said last night.
The latest job cuts come as Honda and Toyota, the Japanese carmakers, are
poised to open their first European car assembly plants, both located in the
UK, and as Nissan is doubling its annual UK car production capacity to
300,000.
Ford warned that it was planning further action to reduce production and cut
jobs throughout its European operations because of weakening demand, not
only in the UK but also in Spain, France and Italy.
In the UK around another 60 salaried jobs are expected to be shed.
The company is cutting daily production volumes at its Dagenham and Halewood
car assembly plants by 17 and 23 per cent respectively in addition to
measures for three- and four-day working weeks already announced to run to
the end of October.
Ford's UK workforce had fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 39,500
by late last year. It is expected to have shrunk to less than 34,900 by the
end of 1992.
The job cuts at Ford and Rolls-Royce follow other big reductions announced
recently by Jaguar, Aston Martin and Group Lotus and the loss of more than
500 jobs at AWD, the UK truckmaker which went into receivership in the
summer.
Unions reacted angrily last night to the fact that compulsory redundancies
appear inevitable at Ford for the first time.
The company offered a tough alternative package, including a six-month delay
in pay increases, in return for making the redundancies purely voluntary.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU electrical and
engineering union, said: 'Ford workers are paying the price for the
government's criminal economic incompetence.'
The Ford package called for a six-month deferment of the 5 per cent wage
rise due in November, a reduction in lay-off pay from 100 per cent of the
basic wage to 60 per cent from November 1 to the end of 1994, and a delay in
increased funding of non-work related employee training.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said:
'They have had a proud boast for 25 years or so that nobody has been
compulsorily laid off. This comes on the back of huge efficiency gains by
the British car workers.'

FT  25 SEP 92 / Major puts ERM membership on indefinite hold: Smith calls
Tory leader the 'devalued prime minister of a devalued government'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR put British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism
on indefinite hold yesterday in the face of a bruising onslaught at
Westminster on the disin-tegration of his economic strategy.
Speaking just hours before Mr David Mellor's departure from the cabinet
delivered a further blow to his embattled government, Mr Major said: 'I do
not believe that we shall be able to go back into the mechanism soon, or
into the same mechanism we left.'
A commanding parliamentary debut as Labour leader by Mr John Smith in the
emergency debate served notice on Mr Major that he faces a challenging time
in the Commons chamber over the next few years.
In a wounding attack Mr Smith declared Mr Major was now 'the devalued prime
minister of a devalued government'.
Mr Major's comments, confirming that domestic economic recovery is now the
government's first priority, brought an immediate surge in equity prices on
London's financial markets. The FT-SE 100 index closed up 40.7 at 2621.2.
The prime minister's speech followed a long debate at a full meeting of the
cabinet about the direction of economic and European policy.
An increasingly hawkish Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted that the
cabinet drop its previous formula that the pound would be put back into the
system 'as soon as conditions allow', in favour of the demands for reform of
the ERM set out later by Mr Major.
Pro-European ministers such as Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, wanted a firmer
commitment to re-entry. But they acknowledged that the recent turmoil in the
ERM had strengthened the chancellor's position.
Senior ministers said that Mr Major's phrasing meant Britain would probably
remain out of the system for at least six months and quite possibly for a
year or more.
Mr Lamont confirmed that view in a combative speech in which he launched a
sharp attack on Professor Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the
Bundesbank.
Using phrases that will exacerbate the rift between the British and German
authorities, but which won him loud applause from his own backbenches, Mr
Lamont blamed the Bundesbank for the final speculative attack on sterling.
The subsequent judgment offered by MPs on the most difficult speech of Mr
Major's career was that it was a brave performance in which he had held the
line.
Mr Lamont meanwhile had defused speculation about his immediate future.
But to the fury of Mr Major's Euro-sceptics, the prime minister reaffirmed
his commitment to ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In what the
pro-European cabinet ministers claimed as an important victory, the prime
minister declared there was no future for Britain as a 'sour, isolated
country off the mainland of Europe'.
The prime minister sought to negotiate the treacherous fault-lines in his
party over Europe by emphasising the setting of a new condition for
implementation of the agreement on European union.
Referring to next month's emergency summit of EC leaders, Mr Major said that
the Community would have to give substance to the notion enshrined in
Maastricht of subsidiarity - the devolution of decision-making to national
governments.
Under constant sniping from Tory Euro-sceptics, he emphasised his continuing
support for Maastricht, arguing that a British prime minister could not sign
an international treaty and then disown it.
Last night prominent Euro-sceptics claimed the signatures of more than 50
Tory MPs for a Commons motion declaring that the government should re-assert
national control of economic policy by keeping the pound permanently outside
the ERM. Half-a-dozen of them abstained in last night's vote to reinforce
the protest.
Mr Major did not spell out in detail the reforms of the exchange rate system
that the government would be seeking. But Mr Lamont emphasised the need for
a sustained fall in German interest rates.
Other proposed changes focus both on technical matters of intervention and
on the fundamental issue of sharing responsibility for changes in monetary
policy between strong and weak currency governments.
In an effort to reassure financial markets, Mr Major emphasised the
government's determination to stick to its public spending targets.
Mr Lamont will tell cabinet colleagues later today that meeting the Pounds
244.5bn target for next year will involve cuts in sensitive budgets across
Whitehall.
The cabinet committee charged with sharing out the resources will consider
plans for cash reductions in the health service budget, a squeeze on
discretionary benefits and large cuts in Whitehall's capital spending
programmes.

FT  25 SEP 92 / Mellor resigns after backbench support evaporates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Mellor resigned as national heritage secretary last night after
accepting finally that a summer-long onslaught by tabloid newspapers, and,
more recently, pressure from Conservative MPs, made it impossible for him to
remain in his job.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, accepted Mr Mellor's decision as
executive officers of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee met to
consider demanding Mr Mellor's resignation because of the damage he was
causing the government.
The announcement came less than 24 hours after Mr Mellor launched a
last-ditch attempt to salvage his career in a series of television
interviews in which he protested that he had been caught in 'a trial of
strength between the tabloids and the prime minister'.
But Mr Mellor had said he would step down if his remaining in the government
became an embarrassment to colleagues. As MPs returned to Westminster for
the emergency debate on the economy, it was clear his support on the Tory
backbenches was slipping away, with the 1922 executive preparing to act as
executioners. Sir Marcus Fox, 1922 Committee chairman, rang Mr Mellor
yesterday morning.
Mr Major, who invested much political capital in remaining loyal to Mr
Mellor during the summer, accepted the resignation with 'deep regret'. But
it appears he made little attempt to dissuade Mr Mellor.
The toppling of Mr Mellor - the first cabinet resignation apart from
reshuffles since Mr Major became prime minister - added to the air of
political crisis surrounding the government.
Mr Mellor was a close friend of Mr Major, and fellow football supporter, as
well as being responsible for a department created by the prime minister
after the general election. A successor is expected to be announced shortly.
Speculation last night centred on Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to
the Treasury, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, or Baroness
Blatch, education minister.
Mr Mellor telephoned Downing Street before 9am yesterday, saying he was
minded to resign. He met Mr Major before cabinet in the morning and spoke
again on the telephone afterwards. Mr Mellor also met Sir Norman Fowler,
Conservative party chairman, before handing his resignation letter to Mr
Major as the prime minister left the Commons after his speech on the
economy. Mr Mellor will make a Commons statement today.
In his letter, Mr Mellor said he had 'concluded that it is too much to
expect of my colleagues in government and in parliament to have to put up
with a constant barrage of stories about me in certain tabloid newspapers'.
On allegations that he had acted improperly in accepting a paid holiday in
1990 from Mrs Mona Bauwens, daughter of a Palestine Liberation Organisation
member, Mr Mellor wrote that he was glad Mr Major had 'been able to make
clear that . . . I have acted within the guidance on the conduct of
ministers'.
He also thanked Mr Major for deciding his 'folly' in becoming embroiled in
an affair revealed in July, 'did not warrant leaving the government'.
His resignation brought expressions of regret from prominent members of the
arts world.
'It is a thousand pities that his tenure as secretary of state for a
brand-new department, which was so full of promise, has been cut short in
such tragic circumstances,' said Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council.
Mr Peter Jonas, general director of English National Opera, said: 'It is a
tragedy for the arts, for the country and the most unfair and cruel thing to
have happened to a man who was potentially the best secretary of state we
could ever have had.'
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's national heritage spokesman who pressed the prime
minister over Mr Mellor's conduct, said it 'has become increasingly clear
that Mr Mellor was in breach of rules regarding ministerial conduct and that
has prevented him from carrying out his duties'.
But Mr Gould added that, 'in many ways today is a sad day for Britain's
cultural life'.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: Matters of doubt as results hit the deck
 -Worries over accountancy exam standards and the 'Friday night scramble'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS OF bleary-eyed trainee accountants woke up last Saturday knowing
whether or not they had passed their exams before opening the results letter
lying on the doormat.
While their immediate concern was celebration or commiseration, their
experience raises one of several wider questions over the existing exam
process.
The timing of the publication of results was one issue for the more than
4,000 people who sat the PE2 final professional exams for the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in July.
Most important was the result. In line with a relatively consistent trend in
the past few years, the pass rate among the 4,063 candidates was 52 per
cent, with 15 per cent referred because they failed one of the four papers.
This did not go unnoticed by Mr David Hunt, chairman of the institute's
education and training directorate. 'While the best-qualified candidates
acquitted themselves very well, the overall pass rate remains modest and we
should like to see it improve,' he said in a statement accompanying the
results.
Intriguingly, the pass rate is substantially lower than in some other
professional institutes, such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Scotland. More 80 per cent of candidates for its exams passed last time.
That might raise questions over the marking policies used. But Mr Phil
Armitage, director of education and training at the English institute,
insists standards are fixed, so it is the pass rate alone that varies.
Mr Graham Hambly, editor of Pass, a monthly magazine for trainee
accountants, says he is surprised by Mr Hunt's remarks about the need for
improvement, given that the trend has been relatively static - and was
higher this year than many others in the recent past. 'People have very
short memories,' he says.
While the institute lays stress on the number of students who ultimately
pass after a number of attempts - which is much higher than half - he
focuses attention on the frustrations for those who fail in the interim.
He says a survey by his magazine showed that 92 per cent of students wanted
a 'marking service', such as that offered by other professional institutes.
Rather than simply receiving a slip telling students that they have failed a
paper, the service would, for a fee, go through the answers and explain
where candidates had erred.
Meanwhile, there is concern from students and a number of training managers
in leading accountancy firms over the way the results are published.
Under the current arrangement, the institute sends out letters to every
applicant on Friday, and at the same time distributes copies of the complete
list of results to interested organisations.
Results appear in the Saturday edition of the Times, alongside job
advertisements for those who pass, and resit offers from training firms for
those who fail. Theoretically, every student will have already received
their results by post at the same time on Saturday morning.
In practice, a rather different ritual has built up. Hundreds of trainees
gather at main railway stations in London late on Friday to buy copies of
the newspaper's first edition, which arrives before midnight and contains
lists of all who passed or have been referred for retakes.
Many students do not want to risk their friends finding out first - or even
calling them with the results before they have found out for themselves. As
a result, they join the Friday night crowds.
Waiting for the results has taken on an extra urgency in the past two years,
as accountancy firms cut costs in the recession and the threat of dismissal
without a second chance looms for those who do not pass.
Mr Hambly says: 'Students have waited eight weeks. They want the results as
soon as possible. But I don't think this system works. It's all a bit
tacky.'
Mr Mark Dawson, national examination training manager at Price Waterhouse,
says: 'There are people with champagne next to those in tears. It is a
pretty disastrous affair, and so tense. It makes you wonder whether, if the
people from the institute went along, they might change their minds.'
He says that, after his results came out a few years ago, he went to
Victoria station himself. His girlfriend got a paper first and found he had
passed. She threw herself into his arms and said: 'Congratulations, Mark,
you've passed.'
Unfortunately, the station was so packed that she threw herself into the
arms of someone standing near him by mistake - who also happened to be
called Mark, but who had not passed.
The process discriminates against those who live outside London and cannot
obtain first editions of the paper. It has also caused tensions when
typesetting errors have either omitted or placed wrongly the names of those
who have passed.
Mr Phil Armitage says the present arrangement began in 1988, when a postal
strike threatened to delay results sent by mail. Since then, he says staff
have found there are far fewer complaints about using the newspaper to
publish the results than before, when postal delays caused widespread
anguish.
Price Waterhouse has no official view on the process by which results are
circulated, although in common with other firms and several recruitment
organisations, it provides a results hotline.
Mr Dawson said he and several other training managers had approached the
Times to ask the newspaper to provide a telephone hotline so students do not
have to take part in a Friday evening scramble.
He also said he would like to see publication of results delayed until
Sunday, so students have the chance to receive individual results before
they are made public.
Most students who have passed want their results to appear in a newspaper,
but want the chance to learn the results first in private.
That is the more sedate approach taken by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in Scotland, which distributes its exam results to several
Scottish newspapers for publication on a Sunday, after individual results
should have arrived by post. 'It is very deliberate,' says Mr Ian Marrian,
deputy secretary. 'We want students to get the information first.'
Timing may hardly be the most important concern for students - or their
employers. But another of Mr Hunt's comments certainly is. He raised worries
that the PE2 papers in which students performed most disappointly were those
requiring practical experience.
That corresponds with the trend spotted by recruiters that salaries and
demand among employers for management accountants has been far more buoyant
than for the chartereds. In spite of recent efforts at reform, it raises a
far wider question over the relevance of the existing chartered accountancy
qualification.

Daily News
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CREDITORS have dropped their objections to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman's bid to
buy the Daily News, leaving only one union standing between him and
ownership of the New York tabloid, AP-DJ reports.
At a US bankruptcy court hearing on his offer he also won the right to
compensation in case the sale falls through - a further indication of the
strength of his bid.
Under a sale agreement presented by the Daily News, Mr Zuckerman - who owns
US News and World Report magazine - would pay Dollars 36.3m for the paper,
including Dollars 18.25m to its creditors. That would give them 13 cents to
17 cents on the dollar for their claims against the Daily News - far less
than a competing offer from the Whitman Group that would provide more than
33 cents on the dollar.
But Mr Zuckerman's offer is considered more viable as he has deals with
eight of the paper's nine unions. Their co-operation is essential in any
deal to sell the paper.
He has yet to reach a deal with the Newspaper Guild. Its president Mr Barry
Lipton said Mr Zuckerman was the most likely candidate to own the paper but
said: 'It can't really finish unless we're on board. Zuckerman is going to
need to come to an acceptable conclusion with us.'

successfully

<TEXT>
CASTLE Peak Power Company (Capco), a joint venture between Exxon, the US oil
group, and China Light and Power, the Hong Kong utility controlled by the
Kadoorie family, yesterday said it has successfully concluded a USDollars
133.5m private placement of debt whose maturity spans Hong Kong's reversion
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Some supra-national borrowers, such as the Asian Development Bank and the
World Bank, have raised debt which matures beyond 1997, as has the Mass
Transit Railway Corporation, a Hong Kong government-owned corporation. But
Capco is the first private sector company to tap US debt markets for funds
which mature after the change-over.
Details of the transaction, which was arranged by Salomon Brothers, are
sketchy. As it was a private placement the borrower does not have to
disclose any information.
However, it is understood that Salomon engaged Standard and Poor's to
conduct a private assessment of Capco. Standard and Poor's awarded it an A
rating.
The debt, which was placed during the third week of August, attracted a
yield of around 125 to 135 basis points above prevailing 10-year US
Treasuries. Two tranches, of roughly equal amounts, were issued for 10 years
and 15 years.
Capco originally sought USDollars 100m, but investor interest was such that
the issue was increased by 30 per cent. Mr David Hudson, a director of
Salomon in Hong Kong, said: 'The popularity of the issue points to a
favourable opinion of the long-term prospects of Hong Kong and bodes well
for other Hong Kong issuers interested in tapping the international capital
markets for long-term debt.'
Mr Leonard Rubin, executive director of Exxon Energy, said the response of
investors showed that they share a positive view of Capco's prospects in the
long term.

on turnover advance but raises dividend

<TEXT>
Correction (published 25th September 1992) appended to this article.
ANGLOVAAL, one of South Africa's large mining houses, has unveiled a near 3
per cent fall in net attributable earnings to R277.7m (Dollars 97m) for the
year to June, from R285.1m the year before, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
This was despite a 6 per cent advance in turnover to R8.21bn from R7.74bn.
Earnings per share emerged 19 per cent lower at 67 cents, against 82.7
cents. However, the directors are proposing a 9 per cent increase in the
annual dividend of 100 cents per share, including a final payout of 67
cents, up from 92 cents for the previous 12 months.
The directors say earnings growth in the 1992-93 financial year will be a
big challenge in view of the recession, lower mineral and metal prices and
inflationary pressures.
They are planning for capital expenditure of more than R1.4bn over the next
three years for expansion and asset replacement, most relating to Anglovaal
Industries, the group's industrial subsidiary and largest contributor to
earnings in year-end results.
The directors also warned that unless there was a meaningful improvement in
the rand gold price in the near-term, further retrenchments at industry and
group level were likely to occur as marginal mines struggle to survive.
Trans-Natal Coal, the South African coal mining group, may cut capital
expenditure because it does not expect to maintain earnings in the year to
June 1993, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said in his annual report that although some
of Trans-Natal's exports were already sold and the revenues covered at
favourable prices and exchange rates, it would not be able to maintain its
current earnings in 1992-933.
'Accordingly, consideration is being given to deferring construction of the
washing facility at Koornfontein, so that total capital expenditure for the
year will not exceed R200m,' he said.
Attributable income rose to a record level of R143.6m in the last financial
year from a previous R138.1m.
World market prospects for the current year were much less favourable, he
said. The company was still negotiating a possible acquisition in Australia.
CORRECTION
EARNINGS per share of Anglovaal fell by 3 per cent to 464 cents in the year
to June, from 478 cents. The figures were incorrectly reported in
yesterday's FT.

BFr213m

RECTICEL, the Belgian manufacturer of polyurethane foam which is 60 per cent
owned by Societe General de Belgique, was forced to write off BFr213m
(Dollars 6.9m) in the first half of 1992 because of lingering environmental
problems at companies which have since been sold.
The company, which changed its name from Gechem in June, lost BFr285m after
tax and extraordinary items, compared with losses of BFr767m in the first
half of 1991 when it was still consolidating 100 per cent of its US
subsidiary.
However, Recticel Europe, now the main operating unit of the group,
increased its net profit from BFr351m to BFr362m in the six months to June
30, on turnover of BFr15bn (BFr14.8bn).
The group said yesterday that recent restructuring at Recticel Europe -
including the closure of 16 plants - had helped offset some of the effects
of the poor economic climate.
Mr Luc Vansteenkiste, the group's chief executive, refused to provide more
details of the environmental problems. But he said there would be no
additional provisions in the second half.
Last week, Recticel announced plans to end its ill-fated expansion in the US
foam market by selling most of its remaining stake in Foamex LP, its US
subsidiary. The company said yesterday it hoped to break even in the full
year, if extraordinary losses were excluded.
Group net profits at Cobepa, Belgium's third-largest holding company,
slipped from BFr3.44bn to BFr2.71bn in the first half of 1992. The company,
67 per cent owned by Paribas of France, said that useful comparison of the
two halves was difficult because the final result depended on when gains
were realised on investments. Unrealised gains increased from BFr8.9bn at
the end of last year to BFr9.79bn in June 1992.

AIR CANADA, now working on a merger with Canadian Airlines International,

Montreal.
The agreement, effective from April 3 1993, will allow Air Canada better
access to European, African, Mid-East and Asian markets via Paris, while Air
France will improve its access to North America through Montreal and
Toronto. Scheduling, customer and frequent-flyer services and freight will
be co-ordinated.
Air Canada signed a similar deal in August with United Airlines. That
link-up, effective on October 25, will improve service and cut connection
time at the airlines' hubs in North America, Europe, Latin America and the
Pacific.
Air France plans to absorb its Union des Transports Aeriens (UTA) unit. No
financial deal would be involved, Reuter reports from Paris.
Air France said UTA aircraft would bear Air France colours. It said the move
would improve the airlines' ability to face the crisis in the industry.

first-half increases

<TEXT>
TWO of the leading players in the French food industry, Eridiana Beghin-Say
and Saint-Louis, yesterday lightened the gloom in the French corporate
sector by announcing healthy increases in net profits for the first half of
the year.
Saint-Louis, with extensive interests in sugar and paper, saw net profits
rise by 30 per cent from FFr356m (Dollars 69.8m) in the first half of 1991
to FFr462m in the same period this year.
This increase includes the benefit of Saint-Louis' investment in Perrier,
the mineral water company which was the butt of a recent bid battle between
Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy. Saint-Louis, which
sided with the Agnellis during the bid, took a stake in Perrier only to sell
it at a profit to Nestle.
Saint-Louis' sales rose from FFr5.32bn to FFr18.16bn and operating profits
from FFr365m to FFr719m because of the decision to consolidate its 39 per
cent stake in the Arjo Wiggins Appleton paper group.
Eridiana, also a significant player in sugar representing the restructured
food interests of Ferruzzi of Italy, saw net profits rise from FFr464m to
FFr572m in the first six months of 1992. It sees a 'similar rate of growth'
for the full year.
Operating profits rose 24 per cent to FFr1.67bn and sales by 22 per cent to
FFr24.1bn, reflecting the contribution of recent acquisitions such as
Ducros, the spice company.

Former colleagues describe him as a highly-regarded man with a strong
character. He was a powerful leader who developed many good ideas and drove
them through to completion.
Born in 1926, Emerson took his articles in 1942 at Barton Mayhew, an
accountancy firm which ultimately merged to become part of Ernst &amp; Young.
He joined Unilever as a systems auditor in the early 1950s, and moved on to
Beecham and then PA, the management consultants. During the late 1960s and
early 1970s he all but created the management consultancy division at Arthur
Young, the accountancy firm which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, and became
the division's first partner.
He went on to join Barclays Bank, and then in 1976 became the first head of
finance at the Stock Exchange before retiring ten years later.

Michael Dowdall, is to become chairman of Geest, the UK foods company, in
May next year when Leonard van Geest, son of the founder, retires. In the

Dowdall spent most of his working life at Unilever where he was primarily
responsible for the worldwide detergent sector. According to one analyst,
'he is good solid reliable chap, with excellent European contacts, who has
been around for a long time.' Indeed, David Sugden, Geest's chief executive,
says Dowdall is expected to help Geest expand its European network.
Dowdall, 62, is also a non-executive of BPB Industries; chairman of Eemland

FT  24 SEP 92 / People: Hankinson plugs RHM's gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Hankinson, Rank Hovis McDougall's new finance director, has probably
seen the insides of more British com-panies than the average finance chief.
When he takes up his new job on October 5, he will have been finance
director of six very different companies over the past 13 years.
The arrival of Hankinson, 53, who quit as Lucas's finance director in March
following a boardroom reshuffle, will plug an important gap in RHM's slim
top management team.
Bob Rogerson, who had been RHM's finance director for 15 years, retired a
year ago and Paul Coker, the deputy managing director, took on his
responsibilities. Following Tim Howden's move to head Albert Fisher's
European operations at the end of March, Coker had to take on his
responsibilities as managing director as well as head the finance side. The
increase in Coker's burden has come at a particularly difficult time for RHM
 -its shares have fallen by two thirds over the past couple of years - and
there has been concern in some quarters of the City that the company was not
doing enough to foster its relations with big investors.
Hankinson, like Coker and Rogerson before him, is a chartered accountant.
After reading law at Cambridge, he spent 11 years with Arthur Andersen
before moving into commerce. In 1972 he joined Midland Bank Finance
Corporation and a couple of years later moved first to Thomas Cook as group
controller and then George Wimpey. In 1979, he was appointed group finance
director of The Guthrie Corporation, and after that he went on to be finance
director of Wilkinson Sword (1982-83), Chloride (1983-86), Rover (1986-89)
and Lucas Industries (1989-92).
*****
Lord Hanson's son, Robert, has been appointed to the board of the
Anglo-American conglomerate at the age of 32. After seven years with N M
Rothschild, Hanson junior moved across to his father's company, as assistant
to the two vice-chairmen, in 1990. Also promoted on to the board is Graham
Dransfield (left), 41, Hanson's senior solicitor for the past four years.
Dransfield replaces Alan Hagdrup, 60, who relinquishes his executive
director responsibilities. Hagdrup, on the board since 1974, will continue
to work on legal matters full-time for the next year, with plans to stay on
part-time for an indefinite period thereafter.

present a caring image

Boots chemist shops yesterday stocked their shelves with a home cholesterol
testing kit which the company hopes will help reduce the alarmingly high
incidence of heart disease in the UK - as well as making money for
shareholders. The simple kit, which requires shoppers to prick their thumbs
and test their blood using a simple meter, delivers accurate results in 20
minutes. It costs Pounds 7.99.
The launch at the Ritz Hotel in London is part of a Caring for Your Heart
campaign aimed at helping to meet the government's target of reducing deaths
from coronary heart disease by 40 per cent by the end of the decade. Boots
is also issuing leaflets on diet and lifestyle changes and has set up a free
telephone enquiry line for those needing further information.
Peter Shotter, general manager of Boots' healthcare business, says:
'Awareness of cholesterol levels is about 9 to 13 per cent in the UK,
compared with 70 per cent in the US. But about 150,000 people are killed by
coronary heart disease each year. Cholesterol is a key factor.'
Although Boots hopes that the kit will record strong sales in its own right,
the product's launch symbolises a shift of marketing emphasis that has taken
place within Boots in recent years.
The company, long famed for its pharmaceutical services, has rediscovered
that there are significant market opportunities in its own backyard -
especially at a time when the government is trying to shift the burden of
healthcare provision towards individual responsibility and preventative
medicine.
'The company's strategy in the 1970s and 1980s was to expand substantially
its merchandise offering. But I would say there is now a greater focus again
on the core healthcare business,' Shotter says. 'It is partly a recognition
that this is what we are best at doing but also that there is enormous
market potential.'
Extensive market research suggested that the public had great trust in
Boots' 'men in white coats'. The company believes it can do more to exploit
that commercial strength by moving into related healthcare areas.
Boots recruits just under one-third of all pharmacy graduates in the UK and
almost all the company's 1,078 store managers are qualified pharmacists.
The company is currently experimenting with offering a wide range of health
screening services, such as cholesterol, blood, pregnancy and urine testing,
together with full medicals at two stores at Bromley and Lincoln. 'It is
early days and we are just scratching the surface at the moment,' Shotter
says.
But a graphic example of the lucrative business opportunities lying at the
periphery of the NHS is provided by Boots' move into the nursing homes' drug
supply market in recent years. The company now supplies the pharmaceutical
needs of 80,000 patients at 3,600 homes.
It is a sign of the evolution of business attitudes at Boots that Shotter
was recruited from outside the company following a marketing career with
such fast moving consumer goods giants as Procter &amp; Gamble and PepsiCo.
'There has been an injection of new ideas by deliberately going out into the
marketplace and bringing in people with different experiences,' he says.
The concept of turning Boots' stores into a chain of mini-healthcare centres
is clearly attractive for potential patients and hard-pressed health service
managers, but as yet it remains an unproven prospect.
But Gordon Hourston, managing director of Boots the Chemist, stresses that
while there are great potential opportunities in developing its primary
healthcare business, he first has to be convinced that it would be in the
best interests of shareholders.
Boots is a commercial enterprise; profits generated from the provision of
healthcare services will have to be every bit as productive as the returns
from selling soaps or photographic film.

THE Scottish National Party yesterday used its annual conference at Perth to
tell the government: 'We told you so.'
Ms Fiona Hyslop, one of the party's Treasury team, said that when sterling
entered the European exchange rate mechanism two years ago, the SNP said its
value had been set too high and would destabilise the ERM.
Speaking in an emergency resolution condemning the government's economic
policy, she accused the Conservatives of having no economic policy. 'It is
important that economic policy should be done by design, not by accident,'
she added. She said the SNP was the only party that had consistently called
for devaluation in the past few months.
Delegates passed a resolution calling for a separate Scottish exchequer and
minister of finance at the Scottish Office to operate a separate economic
policy for Scotland. The emergency resolution also condemned the Labour
party for giving 'wholehearted support' to government policies.
Mr Iain Lawson, SNP industrial spokesman, blamed the Scots themselves for
their economic difficulties. He accused Scots of having a 'Bugs Bunny
mentality'.
'Whenever anybody dangles the carrot of an easy option in front of the
Scots, we go chasing for that carrot,' he explained. He blamed Scots for
having lost control of Scotland's natural resources.
Mr Lawson said opponents had mocked arguments that a Scottish pound would be
more secure than sterling and that Scotland's export-led economy had no
balance of payments deficit.
'We have managed to lose our oil, our gas, our steel industry, our mining
industry,' he said. 'Anything of any value in our country has been
systematically ripped out and moved south.'
Delegates also passed a resolution calling for a reform of pension law to
prevent a repetition of the Maxwell pensions scandal.
It proposed changes including prohibiting employers borrowing from
occupational pension funds, providing for employee and independent
representation on pension boards, and obliging employers to obtain the
consent of employees before taking contributions 'holidays'.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Forum proposes solution to treaty
impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROUTE around the legal and political obstacles now blocking ratification
of the Maastricht treaty by European Community member states has been drawn
up by an influential London think-tank.
The independent European Policy Forum, which has close links with the
British Conservative party leadership, claims to have won considerable
support from the UK foreign office and Treasury.
Mr Graham Mather, EPF director, said yesterday he believed the plan will
form the basis of proposals to be submitted by the EC's British presidency
for debate at next month's emergency heads of government summit.
Described as a protocol, it spells out a 12-clause treaty annex, couched in
legal language, that would strengthen the Council of Ministers' ability to
limit the policymaking powers of the European Commission.
Its intention is to add teeth to the treaty's wording on subsidiarity - the
principle that power should be devolved to the lowest appropriate level -
without requiring any tampering with the main treaty text.
The EPF says its proposal aims to review the Commission's ability to
initiate policy or pursue its own agenda and, instead, stresses its function
as a civil service to the Council, supplying it with policy options. But the
core of the plan centres on putting the onus on the Commission to justify
its policy proposals as appropriate for Community-wide, as opposed to
national action.
Among its proposals are requirements that:
The Commission explain at the outset of any policy development why an
initiative should be dealt with at Community level, before tabling
proposals;
If its arguments are opposed by states controlling more than 20 per cent of
the Council's votes, the Commission's proposal would drop;
Proposals for legislation must be initiated by the Council, not the
Commission; and
A strengthened Council secretariat be developed with strategic planning
functions.
The EPF plan is understood to be the first published text, couched in the
appropriate legal language, on how to press ahead with the Maastricht treaty
in a way that might convince the Danes and other Euro-sceptics to agree
ratification.
In the wake of the narrow Yes vote in the French referendum, President
Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed that some action must
be taken to reassure their electorates that curbs are being placed on the
Brussels bureaucrats.
However, it is far from certain whether the proposals would go far enough to
satisfy opponents of the Maastricht treaty within the British Conservative
party.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway seeks to sweeten its
energy policy - Moves to counter the interest in emerging oil and gas
sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway is considering important energy policy changes to maintain the
interest of foreign oil companies which have shown signs of turning their
attention to emerging oil and gas sectors such as Vietnam, Angola and China.
Although the government argues that operating in Norway is predictable, and
risks are identified and manageable, it admits that its energy policy is
outdated and needs to become more streamlined.
Even Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says the next phase of its
development will aim at turning the company's vision of becoming a global
business into reality.
Two years ago Statoil teamed up with British Petroleum (BP) to form a
so-called strategic alliance covering exploration and production outside the
North Sea, co-operation in gas marketing and collaboration in research and
development.
Since then, Statoil and BP have pursued opportunities in the CIS, Vietnam,
China, Nigeria, Congo and Angola. The pair also linked up with Norsk Hydro
and established a British gas company called Alliance Gas. 'Our vision is
that Statoil should develop into a leading international oil company.
Statoil's position in Norwegian waters gives both the company and the nation
a unique base for international activity,' explained Mr Harald Norvik,
Statoil president and chief executive.
After more than two decades, Norway has become the fourth biggest exporter
of oil in the word. Soon, oil production will reach 2.5m barrels a day while
gas production, now at about 26bn cubic metres (bcm) a year, will rise
sharply to between 60bcm and 65bcm a year during the next decade.
According to proven reserves' estimates, Norway can remain an oil producer
for another 20 years while gas production at current levels can continue for
a century.
But foreign oil companies have increasingly become circumspect about
Norway's energy policy and were outraged when carbon taxes on emissions from
oil and gas platforms were introduced two years ago.
Mr Finn Kristensen, Norway's energy minister, has reacted to criticism by
removing the so-called carried interest obligation under which foreign oil
companies had to carry the burden of the state's exploration costs.
'To increase effectiveness further, I am prepared to consider evaluating
other changes in the licensing terms,' said Mr Kristensen. 'A more flexible
system - working in both directions - for state participation would in my
opinion be better than the present system.'
Mr Kristensen has not, however, clarified whether he is prepared to scrap or
amend the long standing sliding scale agreement, which allows the state to
increase its stake in oil and gas fields once a development plan has been
approved.
The Norwegian state has in the past taken a 50 per cent stake in licences
during the exploration phase, but this stake can rise under the licence
terms to a share of about 65 to 75 per cent during the development phase.
Statoil's president agrees with foreign oil companies that the sliding scale
was appropriate when Norway was a young nation. 'I would not be surprised if
the government removed it . . . it probably carries too high a price tag in
today's overall commercial picture,' Mr Norvik said.
In the country's 13th licensing round the energy ministry awarded acreage to
smaller groups of oil companies, giving them bigger individual shares of
licences. This was well-received by the industry which had grown
dissatisfied with sharing small slices of licences with numerous companies.
Norway recently announced 50 new blocks in the 14th licensing round and oil
companies have until the turn of the year to submit applications for acreage
with awards being made in the second or third quarter of 1993.
Mr Norvik argues that it is more important than ever that Norway remain
attractive for exploration and production in a world where competition is
increasing. 'We must ensure that the leading international oil companies
stay with us . . . I see no conflict between Norway's desire for a strong
national industry and international companies having access to the Norwegian
continental shelf,' he said.
But in the 14th round, foreign oil companies will be expected to show a keen
interest in acreage, a start in boosting gas reserves so that increased
demand for gas from the continent can be met.
Foreign oil companies, however, have been dissatisfied with the way the
state has organised gas sales. This has been done through the
Gassforhandlingsutvalg (GFU) - gas negotiating committee - which is a sales
team comprised of Norwegian companies Statoil, Saga Petroleum and Norsk
Hydro.
The three companies negotiate gas sales contracts with potential buyers, on
behalf of the owners of gas fields. Foreign oil companies have sought to be
included in the gas marketing/sales strategy of GFU, but the state has
always argued that Norwegian companies are better placed then foreign oil
companies to serve the country's economic interests.
But Mr Kristensen says GFU was established to maintain an efficient
exploitation of gas resources and that future policy should continue to be
based on co-ordination. 'However, I am not dogmatic about maintaining the
present organisational frame,' he said.
Norway's gas reserves currently cover about 12 per cent of west European
demand, or one-third of European Community demand from non-EC gas producers.
However, there seems to be no immediate danger of a mass exodus by foreign
oil companies in hot pursuit of greater opportunities in emerging oil and
gas nations.
Statoil estimates that about NKr205bn (Dollars 34bn) will be invested over
the next five years to cover Norwegian oil and gas development projects that
have already been approved by the parliament.
The company warns, however, that with oil prices at Dollars 20 a barrel and
no real belief in sharp increases - and with the current weakness of the
dollar - there is little to encourage large major capital expenditures to
develop new oil fields.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY commodity markets fight for
fresh trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A DRIVE to boost trading volume, the New York commodities markets have
launched or won approval for trading a spate of new contracts this autumn.
Many attempt to engage more international traders or address differences in
US regional markets. But the success of new futures products is anything but
certain. A rough industry standard is that only about one in four contracts
makes it.
The New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange's effort to start a
Euro-Differential Coffee futures last year came to an end earlier this
month. The coffee market has been trading at all-time lows, and the product
 -launched in April 1991 - just did not catch on. The exchange puts the
failure down to 'bad timing'.
Last week the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) launched its new Gulf
Coast unleaded gasoline contract. This is the second new big contract, after
sour crude, launched by Nymex this year.
Nymex believes that the contract will capture more Midwest and Southwest
users who must hedge. The exchange's New York Harbor delivery contract had
not proved as useful to these users, given that cash prices in the Gulf
Coast area differ from those of the Northeast.
Regional differences in environmental legislation could also add some allure
to the Gulf contract, given that the two blends will reflect regional
standards.
The Nymex New York Harbor delivery contract for unleaded gas has in any case
seen increased volume this year. For the period of January to August, 4.7m
contracts were traded, up from 3.6m for the same period last year.
The New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), which is increasingly competing
with Nymex by creating similar contracts, is perhaps the most eager of the
exchanges to boost trading volume. Primarily a precious metals market,
Comex's futures trading volume this year, for January through August, is
down to 7.7m contracts compared to 8.8m for the same period last year,
according to figures from the Futures Industry Association.
Comex will launch futures based on the Eurotop 100 Index, under an agreement
with the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, on October 26. It hopes the
contract will have some interplay with the American Stock Exchange, which
will launch cash options on the the Eurotop 100 the same day.
Cutting closer into Nymex's territory, Comex has won approval from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to trade jet fuel futures. These are
expected to begin trading during the first quarter of 1993. The jet fuel
contract will be for physical delivery on the Gulf Coast.
The New York Cotton Exchange is also moving ahead with the launch of its new
World Cotton futures contract on October 1. The exchange is trying to
address the world cotton market, where prices can diverge from those of the
US.
Its existing contract is for US cotton only. The new contract, which will be
cash settled, is based on Cotlook's daily survey of raw cotton from 13
countries. The daily average is made up from the five cheapest quotes.

</HEADLINE>

Sterling devaluation raised imported wool costs overnight but in Australian
cents the market remained steady last week and into this week. The AWC
market indicator was only very slightly lower at 532 cents a kg. on
September 23, compared with 542 a week before. Business in the UK did not
improve significantly ahead of last week's enforced departure from the ERM
constraints, and buyers now remain very wary. The accompanying sterling
depreciation against the US and Australian dollar is keeping prices rising
but there are stocks which some are willing to use to keep price rises in
check.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for smelters queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HUGE expansion of existing copper smelting capacity planned for the next
few years calls into question the need for new smelters, suggests the Metals
&amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group.
Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at MMRS, says the organisation has identified
'well over 500,000 extra annual tonnes' of planned capacity. This compares
with western world copper production of about 8.7m tonnes last year.
MMRS's comments come at a time when the spot market treatment charges for
copper concentrates (an intermediate material) have been easing from a very
high level caused by a temporary shortage of smelting capacity.
They also come shortly after the partners in the proposed Rayong copper
smelter project in Thailand finished a 'road show' seeking finance for the
Dollars 480.3m venture.
Partners in the project are Padaeng of Thailand (51 per cent); three
Japanese organisations - Mitsubishi Materials (13 per cent); Mitsubishi
Corporation and Mitsui (7.5 per cent each) - MIM of Australia (12 per cent)
and the Switzerland-based Marc Rich trading organisation (9 per cent). They
want the international banking community to provide Dollars 333m in ten-year
loans.
Traders suggest that western smelter charges for treating copper
concentrates, which once ranged between 10 cents and 20 cents a lb, jumped
to 35 cents earlier this year but have fallen considerably because spare
capacity was found in the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Zambia.
For example, the Palabora copper mine in South Africa has been sending
concentrates to Zambia and that country has also been treating concentrates
sent by Marc Rich from Indonesia. Rich and Euromin, a trading house with
offices in Stockholm and Moscow, have been having concentrates toll-smelted
in the CIS where smelters in the Urals and Kazakhstan not only have excess
capacity but are also eager to earn foreign currency.
Mr Briggs of MMRS says that the upsurge in expansion of existing smelter
capacity has been prompted by the need for smelters to be adapted to meet
ever-tightening environmental regulations. It is cost-effective to increase
capacity when this is done, he points out.
MMRS also believes that the annual growth in concentrates production will be
only 'sedate', in spite of the large increase in mine capacity expected in
the next decade, because more than half the copper will be obtained by
solvent-extraction-electro winning technology which disposes with the
smelting process.

CUBA, which in 1991-92 produced its lowest sugar crop in a decade, faces an
even more difficult harvest in 1992-93, according to Mr Juan Herrera, the
Cuban sugar minister, Reuter reports from Havana.
The Cuban domestic news agency AIN said Mr Herrera told Cuba's official
workers' trade union that 'in the coming harvest there will be even greater
difficulties'.
Cuba produced 7m tonnes of sugar in the 1991-92 harvest, which was plagued
by shortages of oil, lubricants, spare parts, herbicides, pesticides and
fertilisers. Mr Herrera said a fall in the number of available sugar cane
harvesting machines would mean an increase in cane cutting by manual workers
next season.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nine-month zinc squeeze fades
in heavy trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG-RUNNING squeeze that has supported zinc prices on the London Metal
Exchange and prompted some consumers to complain that the market was out of
touch with reality is fading fast.
However, traders and analysts are divided about whether the squeeze, which
has been a feature of the market since the early days of this year, is over.
In heavy trading the LME's zinc market yesterday moved back into contango,
where metal for immediate delivery is at a discount to material for delivery
in three months. Zinc for immediate delivery closed at Dollars 1,320.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 31.50, while three-month zinc was down Dollars 14 at
Dollars 1,325.50.
Early in September three-month zinc reached Dollars 1,398 a tonne, its
highest level for 22 months. 'It would take a massive investment (by those
behind the squeeze) to get the market up there again,' suggested Ms Lesley
Campbell, trader at Rudolf Wolff, the metal and commodities broker. She
pointed out that 'a return to reality' was permeating all the LME's metal
markets.
However, Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals,
part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said that, while there was some panic
selling of zinc yesterday, the squeeze might well reappear before the
year-end.
'Uncertainty and nervousness now prevail in the market - which might be to
some people's benefit. There could be more fun and games before the year is
out,' he said.
Traders suggested that a small number of zinc producers and one trader,
reported to control between them about 1m tonnes of annual refined zinc
output or about 15 to 20 per cent of the western world total, have been
using options to squeeze the market.
The LME board was forced to intervene to calm the market in June by
restricting the level of daily premiums that could be demanded, and
subsequently warned that it continued to 'closely monitor' zinc trading.
Mr Graham Deller, analyst at the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services
consultancy group, pointed out that, even though refined zinc consumption
grew by 2 per cent to 3.2m tonnes in the first seven months of 1992 while
production was flat at 3.1m tonnes, stocks were at a five-year peak.
The market was likely to be oversupplied by 100,000 tonnes this year
following a supply surplus of 150,000 tonnes in 1991, he suggested. 'There
is no shortage of metal so the price should continue to fall until producers
cut back.'
Others remained cautious because new labour contracts have still to be
negotiated at two big Canadian smelters, Cominco's Trail (315,000 tonnes a
year) and Noranda's Valleyfield (230,000 tonnes).

<TEXT>
A PREFERENCE for natural resins from the international food, pharmaceutical
and cosmetic industries has boosted the export prospects for Indian shellac,
according to Mr KB Jayaswal, chairman of the Shellac Export Promotion
Council.
The value of Indian shellac exports in 1991-92 rose by 63 per cent to Rs280m
(Dollars 10m), and Mr Jayaswal believes that the 1992-93 export target of
Rs335m will be easily surpassed. But if India is to take advantage of the
growing demand for shellac, it must boost production.
Lac is secreted on trees by the lac insect. Last year, the production fell
by over 4,000 tonnes to 10,810 tonnes. Large-scale deforestation,
environmental pollution and shortage of brood-lac are blamed.
The council said the government will have to take the initiative in opening
brood-lac farms in the lac growing states and distribute brood-lac free of
charge among cultivators. The price of shellac has risen from Rs48,700 a
tonne in 1991-92 to over Rs75,000 a tonne now.

GOLD pushed to the day's highs around the Dollars 350 area in late afternoon
trade on the London bullion market on renewed fund buying on Comex as the
dollar slid to an all-time low against the yen. But producer selling
continued to cap the upside, while there was no sign of the rumoured
Bundesbank interest rate cut and the French Franc steadied against the
D-mark in the ERM. Generally low levels of industrial demand growth in the
major economies remained the main depressing factor on BASE METAL prices at
the LME. Until this changed it was unlikely consumers would do more than
satisfy immediate needs or that investors would be prepared to chase metal
prices higher, traders said. NICKEL was steady after its fall to 2 1/2 -year
lows earlier this week. But traders believed further losses were likely, and
projected a move towards Dollars 6,600 a tonne for three-month metal.
However, it was thought that around that level the major nickel producers
would be strongly considering production cuts. London's robusta COFFEE
closed with pared gains. Prices had been marked up early amid sentiment that
some progress appeared to have been made at the ICO talks on a new pact.

FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities calmer after slight
bonds recovery

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were little changed at the end of trading yesterday after
the European currency crisis, domestic polit-ical and economic concerns and
apprehension about third-quarter earnings had kept investor demand for
stocks dampened, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Tuesday's losses were linked to heavy declines in the bond market, where
concern about inflation had sparked a substantial sell-off. The fact that
bond prices were slightly better yesterday therefore helped to calm equity
markets.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off just 2.16 at 3,278.69,
having spent most of the day a few points below Tuesday's close. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.30 to 417.44, while the American SE
composite was down 1.08 at 379.91 and the Nasdaq composite 0.04 easier at
582.96. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 205.4m shares.
The background to trading, however, remained troubling. Renewed pressure on
the French franc, in spite of a jump in French interest rates, confirmed
that the European currency crisis was not over. Some analysts hope that
turmoil overseas will persuade international investors to buy US assets for
safety, but so far there has been little evidence of foreign investors
rushing into US stocks or bonds.
The domestic fundamentals, meanwhile, remain mixed, and investors are
awaiting the third-quarter reporting season with some trepidation. They are
particularly fearful that, because of slower than expected economic growth
during the summer, companies will soon be warning that their earnings will
fail to match expectations.
A case in point yesterday was Black &amp; Decker, which tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 ,
or 16 per cent, to Dollars 16 1/8 in turnover of 2.7m shares after the
company warned that net income for the third quarter would be in the range
of the meagre Dollars 12m it earned in the second quarter.
Another profits warning came from Fleming Companies, the shares declining
Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 1/4 after the wholesale food group said its earnings
would be about Dollars 3.10 a share for 1992, and not between Dollars 3.20
and Dollars 3.30 a share as originally estimated.
General Motors remained in the doghouse, falling a further Dollars 1 to
Dollars 32 on volume of 4.4m shares as more and more auto analysts drop the
stock from their recommended lists. GM's weakness spread to Chrysler, which
lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 22 3/8 , but Ford resisted the selling and edged
Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 40 1/4 .
Alexander's advanced Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 27 after announcing that it
had agreed to sell six store properties to Bradlees in a deal worth about
Dollars 82m. Bradlees was down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 13.
On the Nasdaq market, Video Lottery plummeted Dollars 10 to Dollars 14 on
turnover of 3.3m shares following news that the Gaming Commission in the
state of Victoria in Australia had voted to remove the company from its list
of approved manufacturers.
Canada
THE TORONTO market closed mixed but at its best point of the day as worries
about the weak Canadian dollar continued to plague equities. The currency
lost a further  1/2 cent against its US counterpart, making its fall so far
this week more than three cents.
The TSE 300 index finished a slight 1.6 up at 3,404.4, but falls led rises
by 308 to 262 after volume of 31m shares.
Stelco 'A' fell 30 cents to CDollars 2.55. The United Steelworkers union
said Stelco plans to lay off about 630 union workers and 150 management and
staff by the end of November.

FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela's rally fades on disappointed
hopes - Political instability and high inflation continue to dampen investor
sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's economy, which posted the highest real growth in Latin America
last year at 10.4 per cent, continues to expand vigorously in 1992 but the
Caracas equity market is lagging far behind.
In spite of occasional rallies, share prices on the Bolsa de Valores de
Caracas have been unable to recover to levels reached last February 3, the
day before a group of army officers staged the first coup attempt seen in
Venezuela since the early 1960s.
The day prior to the putsch, the Caracas Stock Exchange index set an
all-time high of 34,142, up 16.5 per cent from the end-1991 close of 29,316.
By June 30, the index was off 23 per cent from the February 3 high and down
10.2 per cent from the end of last year.
This week prices picked up slightly on Tuesday, but the general trend in
recent weeks has still been clearly downwards.
Mr Alex Dalmady, editor of InvestAnalysis Stock Guide, which examines
Venezuelan stocks, talks of disappointed hopes: 'There were great
expectations that we might have a late-year boom, but everyone anticipated
and the rally disappeared.'
He notes, however, that many price/earnings ratios have dropped to more
attractive levels in recent months. He estimates that Venezuelan industrial
shares are now trading at around 21 times earnings, while financial issues
are standing at around 18. Earlier in the year, some leading stocks were
being dealt at an average of 38 times earnings.
While the political instability following last February's military uprising
may have had a depressing effect on stock prices, it is also the case that
more new issues have been launched this year than at any time in the history
of the Caracas exchange.
The debutantes include Mavesa, a leading food processor; HL Boulton, a
family-held company that decided to sell shares to the public; and Ventane,
an industrial concern owned by Enron, of the US. Three important industrial
companies - Venprecar (part of the Sivensa steel group), Corimon and Venepal
 -launched Global Depositary Shares (GDSs). These companies were traded on
the Caracas exchange before they sold GDSs abroad.
Mr Dalmady said that while these new listings widen the Venezuelan stock
market and will strengthen it over the long term, the immediate effect of
their appearance this year is a dampening influence on any general rally in
stock prices.
Several other Venezuelan companies are planning to offer shares to the
public in the near future. The biggest is CANTV, the national
telecommunications group which was privatised late last year. A group headed
by GTE, of the US, paid Dollars 1.89bn to the Venezuelan government for 40
per cent of CANTV's shares and operating control over the company. The
government is now planning to place some of its remaining shares on the
block, perhaps in 1993.
Although Venezuela's inflation this year is expected to be as bad or worse
than last year's 31 per cent, the country's currency, the bolivar, has not
weakened to anything like the same extent. Strong government monetary
reserves and an unstated policy of avoiding any excessive drop in the
bolivar's value vis-a-vis the US dollar has kept the currency's slide thus
far this year to 11.9 per cent (at 69 bolivars per dollar).
An important unknown factor is how Venezuela's political uncertainties will
affect the stock market during the remaining months of 1992. The government
of President Carlos Andres Perez obtained two months of relief from nagging
student protests during August and September. But classes will soon resume
and it is expected that university and high school students will renew their
demonstrations against the government's free-market policies and continue to
press for the resignation of President Perez.

FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok finds support as
Australia weakens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roundup
TOKYO took the day off for a public holiday, but there was movement
elsewhere in the region yesterday.
BANGKOK thanked the bullish mood of Thais in rural areas as equities resumed
their uptrend, the SET index moving ahead 7.95 to 871.37 in volume of 245m
shares valued at Bt17.8bn, compared with 242m shares and Bt18.6bn the day
before.
Buying was active in the finance, bank and property sectors, with Bangkok
Land, the most active stock in terms of turnover value, firming Bt1 to
Bt150.00 on 11m shares traded.
A malfunction in the SET's computer, which has processed unprecedented
levels of business in the latest rally, suspended trading for about 10
minutes just before the market closed.
The finance sector index posted the day's sharpest advance, 3.1 per cent.
The property share index rose 1.5 per cent and banks were up 1.1 per cent.
Finance companies are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings,
bolstered by recent record trading volume.
SEOUL rebounded from two days of losses, brokers remarking upon the
emergence of so-called northern shares, related to trade with former or
current communist countries. The composite index finished 5.19 better at
524.35 in moderate turnover of Won193.5bn, down from Tuesday's total of
Won226.1bn. Gainers outnumbered losers 529 to 193 with 163 unchanged.
Sunkyong moved forward Won800 to Won16,100 on reports that Choi Jong-hyun,
the group's chairman, will accompany President Roh Tae-woo on Roh's visit to
China later this month, along with 30 other officials studying the
investment environment and the Chinese market.
Daewoo gained momentum on rumours that Kim Woo-joong, its chairman, will
join an economic feasibility team to North Korea later this month, but the
stock also saw selling pressure on Kim's rumoured involvement in forming an
opposition party.
AUSTRALIA closed weaker for the second consecutive day because of
uncertainty on overseas markets, Wall Street's 40-point fall on Tuesday
keeping institutional investors out and leaving the All Ordinaries index
15.8 lower at 1,505.0. Over the past two days the index has lost 26.6, or
1.7 per cent.
Turnover increased from ADollars 165m to ADollars 195m. Foster's Brewing
declined 6 cents to ADollars 1.24 in turnover of 3.8m shares as investors
remained concerned that its ADollars 1bn rights issue might not be fully
subscribed by shareholders.
MANILA fell afresh, depressed by the spate of kidnappings which has hurt the
economically influential Filipino-Chinese community, and other factors such
as the continued threat from the Mount Pinutabo volcano.
The composite index lost 8.60 to 1,387.55 following Tuesday's 14.50 retreat.
Turnover fell to 87m pesos from Tuesday's 91m pesos.

FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Short-lived Paris rally on
rates move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TURMOIL in Europe's currency markets continued yesterday with defensive
initiatives from France and Spain, and more positive moves in the strong
currency markets of Belgium and Austria, writes Our Markets Staff.
Equity investment reflected extremes of sentiment with Switzerland, once
again the fiscally safe haven, performing well and Sweden, afraid of an ERM
collapse, higher interest rates and more disasters within its own banking
sector, back in the pits again.
PARIS initially rallied after the central bank raised key interest rates,
before falling back on fears that efforts to support the franc may fail. The
CAC-40 index, which had seen a high of 1,851 during the session, retreated
to close 3.88 lower at 1,828.93. Turnover was steady at FFr2.5bn.
Basket-trading was reported to have contributed to the fall in some
defensive stocks, including L'Oreal's 4.6 per cent decline as its shares
closed down FFr46 at FFr961. Air Liquide reflected first half results issued
after Tuesday's close. The 5 per cent rise in profit was below expectations
and the stock lost FFr14 to FFr747.
Lafarge came off FFr11 to FFr279 ahead of figures, released just after the
close, which were slightly better than expected, while Credit Lyonnais lost
a further FFr22.50 on its investment certificates to FFr484.50 following
Tuesday's bad half-year results.
FRANKFURT re-ran the twin themes of interest rate cut hopes, and fears of
industrial recession. The obvious international blue chips moved both ways,
although the DAX index rose 7.49 to 1,557.83.
Banks rose on the rate talk, with the interest-sensitive Bavarians in the
van. Bayernhypo and Bayernverein both put on DM9.50, to DM393 and DM409.50
respectively, and Deutsche Bank ended DM11.50 higher at DM661.50; among
insurers, Allianz followed suit, up DM37 to DM1,824.
Carmakers and chemicals, once again, were not so ebullient. BMW continued to
lose ground in its sector, DM11.50 lower at DM514 as Volkswagen stayed flat
at DM306.50. Hoechst, recently the strongest of the big three chemicals,
fell DM1.70 to DM244.50 while BASF and Bayer came out fractionally ahead.
MADRID was uneasy at the reintroduction of currency controls and fears
persisted of a further 5 per cent peseta devaluation. The general index
closed off 2.34 at 205.22 while the Ibex was 1.6 per cent lower. Turnover
slipped to Pta12bn from Pta15bn.
Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities said that the measures taken by the
central bank yesterday might have bought a bit of time, 'but if sentiment
turns negative again there may have to be a further devaluation'. He added
that Spain's commitment to the ERM might well leave the peseta 'in the slow
lane of a two-speed Europe.'
AMSTERDAM, calm in the eye of the storm, was speculating that the central
bank may cut interest rates today, independently of any move by the
Bundesbank. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 113.1.
BRUSSELS took little notice of a cut in local interest rates and the Bel-20
index lost 2.24 to 1,112.26 in turnover of BFr691m. Delhaize put on BFr20 to
BFr1,530, helped by the stronger dollar. Clabecq rose BFr122 to BFr552,
having lost more than 50 per cent over the previous four trading days.
MILAN recovered from early lows to close with the Comit index 5.05, or 1.4
per cent lower at 364.54 after a fall of around 2 per cent in the morning.
But dealers said that the mood remained gloomy and that the price changes
were only technical corrections.
Mediobanca shed 3.5 per cent, Fiat 2.5 per cent and Sip 2.7 per cent in
heavy trading. Fiat, which is due to announce half-year results today,
rebounded on the kerb to end the day at L3,640 against an official close of
L3,578.
ZURICH rose in strong volume, its relatively high monetary and political
stability taking the SMI index up by 12.8 to 1,913.4. One dealer said that
French investors, in particular, were channelling funds into Switzerland,
attracted by lower interest rates and a rally in the bond market after UBS
cut rates on all cash bonds by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 1/2 per
cent.
Banks, the quickest to gain, topped the active list as CS Holding rose SFr20
to SFr1,930 and SBC firmed SFr5 to SFr278. Chemicals were also in demand
with Ciba-Geigy registered SFr12 higher at SFr643.
VIENNA was firmer after the Austrian National Bank cut its intervention rate
leading to speculation of further interest rate reductions. The ATX index
advanced 13.61 or 1.6 per cent to 836.05, Creditanstalt advancing Sch5 to
Sch435 in spite of warning that dividends may be cut this year.
STOCKHOLM fell sharply, and closed at the day's low. Swedish institutions
were perceived as sellers, partly due to the troubles of the domestic
financial sector and a need to create liquidity. High interest rates and a
lack of foreign interest completed the story.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 26.8, or 3.6 per cent to 709.2. All
sectors fell, but banking continued to bear the brunt of the decline,
dropping by 10.6 per cent. S-E Banken, which has claims of about SKr1bn on
Gota, which recently suspended payments to creditors, fell to a new 1992 low
of SKr9.50, down SKr2.50.

FT  24 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Unsettled again by currency factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURBULENCE in global curr-ency markets re-emerged as an unsettling factor
for UK equities yesterday. Dollar stocks fell out of favour as the US
currency faced pressure throughout Europe and turmoil among ERM currencies
dented London's newfound confidence.
On the corporate front, nerves were jolted by a heavy loss and a halved
share price at British Aerospace, until very recently an FT-SE Index
constituent and a core stock in many institutional portfolios.
Equities opened lower but were then driven ahead by early gains in the stock
index futures sector. The Footsie managed to regain the 2,600 hurdle before
the pace slackened in the futures market and share prices were left to react
to the adverse factors lurking in the background.
The stock market became badly unsettled by the latest indications of
potentially destructive pressures inside the European exchange rate
mechanism. While sterling benefited from the switch of selling pressure
towards the French franc, few equity strategists were prepared to speculate
on the longer term implications for UK stocks of a break-up in the European
currency framework. Dealers identified distinct signs of fear in the market.
The setback among dollar stocks, as the US currency challenged its low
against the yen, was increased by bearish reviews of the pharmaceutical
stock sector by a large US securities house. Some leading drug shares, which
led the market advance last week, have now lost most of the gains which
greeted sterling's departure from the ERM.
The Footsie reversed its gain to stand 18.2 down at 2,567.8 at worst, but
was helped later by a rally in the pound. With confidence in further cuts in
UK base rates still holding firm, equities recovered to leave a final
Footsie reading of 2,580.5, a net loss for the day of 5.5.
Seaq volume slipped to 735.4m shares from Tuesday's 987.9m. Tuesday's retail
volume remained high, at Pounds 2bn, reflecting block share sales.
The attention was concentrated yesterday on a handful of stocks, including
Amstrad, the computer manufacturer, which was traded heavily after the
chairman suggested he might take the company into the private sector. The
combined turnover for Amstrad and British Aerospace made up nearly 5 per
cent of the day's total of equity shares traded.
Weakness in dollar-orientated equities was offset by continued demand for
the domestic retail stocks, which would be beneficiaries from the further
cuts in UK base rates expected before Christmas. Bank shares also extended
recent gains on the view that lower interest rates will lighten their heavy
burden of bad debts. However, there was no improvement for the construction
sector, which had to weather another dividend reduction, this time from
Costain.
The good rally in share prices yesterday afternoon appeared to underline the
market's overall confidence that the investment outlook has changed for the
better and that domestic interest rates are on the way down.

FT  24 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported a dull session in the derivatives market, with turnover in
both Footsie futures and traded options returning to poor levels, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the FT-SE futures contract for December delivery opened strongly
at 2,641 and early buying reported to have come from Strauss Turnbull and
Salomon soon helped the contract advance to 2,656 by mid-morning, with early
strength in gilts also boosting sentiment.
However, this proved to be the high of the day after buying interest dried
up, leaving the contract to gently drift lower over the middle part of the
trading session.
In the afternoon, the lack of buyers coupled with the poor opening on Wall
Street saw December fall to the day's low of 2,610, although a squeeze
towards the close ensured a strong finish. December closed at 2,638, around
22 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 40.
Traded options were marked by a lack of business and turnover reached 26,889
lots, well below the markets's break-even level of 30,000 contracts. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 8,877 contracts, while among the stock options, HSBC
recorded the day's highest total at 1,280 contracts.

FT  24 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback in BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT EVEN the most pessim-istic market forecasts had predicted the scale of
losses at British Aerospace, one of the UK's leading manufacturers. The news
nearly halved the share price to a new low and trading volume rose to its
highest recorded daily total. The setback cast its shadow over other
aerospace and engineering stocks.
The company revealed a first-half deficit of Pounds 129m, down from a profit
of Pounds 86m last year, and also deferred and cut the dividend for the
first time, by 5.9p to 3p.
Dealers rushed to sell the stock, driving it down 57 to 142p within the
first hour of trading. Investors sold into any signs of a rally and at the
day's worst the shares were at 107p for a drop of 92.
A gloomy meeting with analysts brought little respite, not only raising
questions over the year-end dividend but also leading some analysts to
question the future of the company. Researchers were also concerned that BAe
has yet to announce an expected order from Saudi Arabia for Tornado
aircraft; most now fear that BAe will report losses of around Pounds 100m
for the full year but return to profit in 1993.
The afternoon brought some relief to the selling pressure as bargain hunters
chose to focus on the company's restructuring plans and the shares were
finally 86 off at 113p, a record closing low after volume of 30m shares.
Amstrad surprise
An early upsurge in Amstrad to around the 30 1/2 p mark put dealers on the
alert for a subsequent announcement that Mr Alan Sugar, founder and chairman
of the electronics concern, was about to take the troubled electronics group
private. But the price at which Mr Sugar pitched the offer, 30p a share, was
much lower than expected, and well below the 45p that was being mentioned in
the market.
After the announcement the stock fell back to close a net 3 up at 28p.
Turnover totalled 5.7m shares.
Market reaction to Mr Sugar's move was less than complimentary. 'It is a bit
cheeky to say the least,' said one electronics specialist. Mr Sugar prompted
raised eyebrows in the City in March last year when he sold a block of
42.75m shares, representing a 7.5 per cent stake in Amstrad, at 79p, only
days after a profits upgrading by James Capel, the company's broker. Mr
Sugar currently has a near 35 per cent stake in Amstrad.
In July Amstrad issued a warning that losses for the year to end-June would
be much greater than had been expected; most analysts have factored in a
projected deficit of Pounds 65m for the year.
KIO/Hays deal
The reason for sluggishness in the share price of Hays on Tuesday, in spite
of better than expected preliminary figures, became evident yesterday as the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) revealed that it has sold a block of 7.6m
shares into the market. The sale reduced its stake in the business services
group to below the 3 per cent level at which shareholdings have to be
declared.
An official statement said the KIO holding now stands at 11.85m shares, or
2.96 per cent. The 7.6m shares are believed to have been placed in the
market by Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, at 178p a share ex-dividend,
equivalent to 180 1/2 p cum the dividend, a substantial discount to the
ruling share price of around 184p.
The KIO has been steadily reducing its holding in Hays over the past year,
down from 10.3 per cent to the current level. By the close yesterday the
shares had risen 5 to 189 1/2 p.
The decision by Chemical Bank to forsake office space in Canary Wharf for
Alban Gate, in the City of London, lifted MEPC, Alban's developer. 'The
millstone has been lifted from around MEPC's neck,' commented one analyst,
following the bank's letting of 173,000 sq ft on a 25-year lease at a
rumoured Pounds 30 per sq ft. The shares closed 13 ahead at 252p after a
hefty 5.4m turnover.
At that letting price, the net savings and benefits to the group would be in
the region of Pounds 10m, enough in the market's view to protect the
dividend.
TSB eased 1 1/2 more to 126 1/2 p, with the market said to be concerned
about the bank's Hill Samuel merchant banking operation.
SG Warburg, the merchant bank, jumped 19 to 530p, still boosted by hints
that a link with one of the top-rated US money centre banks could be on the
cards.
Barratt Developments forged ahead 17, or 34 per cent, to 67p, after the
housebuilder unveiled much better than expected preliminary results.
Costain, on the other hand, slipped 2 to 27p after confirming market fears
that the interim dividend would be eliminated. Taylor Woodrow lost 3 to 62p
as one securities house bought a block of 7.8m shares at 60 1/2 p and placed
them at 60 3/4 p.
Among other housebuilders, Cala rose 6 to 45p, Crest Nicholson 9 to 43p and
Westbury 6 to 59p in a belated reaction to the cut in UK interest rates.
Pharmaceutical issues continued to suffer from profit-taking and currency
worries, with sentiment also being depressed by reported bearish comments
from Goldman Sachs. Fisons shed 5 to 183p, Glaxo 19 to 797p and Wellcome 32
to 955p.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have turned positive on the brewery sector.
Bass moved ahead 12 to 587p, Grand Metropolitan 18 to 455p and Guinness 25
to 566p.
Supermarket group Tesco retreated 10 to 214p as some brokers found
themselves long on stock following the interim statement released on
Tuesday. J. Sainsbury continued to benefit from comparison with Tesco,
climbing 4 to 460p.
In food manufacturing, Smith New Court was among those advising investors to
take profits after recent outperformance in Cadbury Schweppes, which receded
9 to 451p, and Unilever, 18 lighter at 1034p. Smith also advised switching
into Tate &amp; Lyle, 17 stronger at 357p, United Biscuits, 10 ahead at 297p,
and Northern Foods, 13 up at 270p.
Tour group Airtours advanced 10 to 223p after announcing the purchase of the
Pickfords Travel agency chain.
Paper company Bunzl added 5 at 102p, aided by an agency cross by Credit
Laing Lyonnaise of 2.5m shares at 101p.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (6): Code saves time -
Profile of Michell Bearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPORTANCE in modern manufacturing of computer-aided design and
computer-numerically controlled machining is crucial, but the link between
the two is often ignored, writes Andrew Baxter.
Essentially, turning an intricate, multi-coloured Cad design into something
that a CNC machine tool understands involves creating a file which can be
converted into a machine control tape written in CNC code.
The problem, however, has been generating CNC code swiftly and accurately
enough without increasing programming resources excessively. This is a
particular concern with small batch production, where 'one-offs' and
'two-offs' each require a new code.
Over the past three years Newcastle-based Michell Bearings, part of the
Vickers marine engineering division, has developed a solution. Michell is
one of the world's leading producers of white metal bearings for marine and
industrial applications - the white metal is a mainly tin-based metal lining
that bears the brunt of the lubrication job.
Like Hoover in vacuum cleaners, Michell has become virtually a generic term
for the 'pivoting pad' bearing patented by A. G. M. Michell in 1905. Michell
is particularly well-known for its thrust bearings used in arduous, heavy-
duty applications such as submarines or hydro-electric power stations.
Michell would still recognise the products of a company he founded in 1920,
and the commitment to pushing the frontiers of technology, but the company's
current manufacturing processes and culture would startle any early-20th
century engineer.
Over the past 10 years, many of Michell's old manual lathes and other
machine tools have been replaced by multi-function CNC machining centres.
The new machines can do the work of as many as six of their forbears, but
the dramatic reductions in machining time caused an unexpected snag.
With a large part of Michell's business devoted to small batches, the
company found it could not generate CNC code fast enough. 'Three years ago
we had 14 CNC machine tools, and for every one we saved four to eight
operators,' says Mr Stuart Clifford, director and general manager. 'But it
was costing us two programmers to support it.'
The solution, developed by Mr Ray High, Michell's production engineering
manager, has involved creating a database of the many possible
geometric/mechanical features of a bearing, allowing a programmer to
construct on screen the equivalent of a photofit picture.
As the selection of the various slots, drill holes and chamfers is inputted,
and adjustments included to suit the customer's requirements, two files are
simultaneously created: one to create Cad drawings, the other a 'sequence
file' to create a CNC code in the so-called macro format used by machine
tools.
The information is stored on disc, which is inserted into the machine tool's
CNC unit. In theory, therefore, a customer could give design instructions to
a programmer and then watch the component being machined on the shopfloor.
Michell plans to move quickly over the next year to implement the system.
Some 75-80 per cent of its products are capable of being produced this way,
says Mr High.
The potential benefits in time saved are important in an increasingly
competitive bearings market. Michell's delivery times used to average 22-24
weeks - and even then it was occasionally late - but now it has to deliver
in eight to 10 weeks. 'And these days you are not allowed to miss, so it's
essential that the new system works,' says Mr Clifford.
The stakes are high. Bearing producers are picking up more work from power
equipment suppliers that traditionally made their own bearings, and Michell
wants to continue its current progress, exploiting growth prospects in
Japan, south-east Asia and Europe.
Its sales have risen 71 per cent over five years to Pounds 12-13m, due
partly to a sharp rise in exports from 30 per cent of sales to 79 per cent
over 10 years.
Implementation of the new process is in its early stages, but has already
caused a stir. In May Michell's system was among the winners of the 1992 ECS
Machinery awards for innovation sponsored by Machinery magazine and
Engineering Computer Services.
Even the Japanese manufacturers of the two Tsugami machining centres fully
linked to the system visited Michell to see the effects of turning a machine
tool into a 'factory within a factory.'
The irrepressible Mr High, meanwhile, is not resting on his laurels, and is
already working on even faster versions of his new system.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (7): A quiet revolution
 -Profile of Dunlop Cox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST impression on any visitor to the headquarters of Dunlop Cox is the
dull thud of 400-ton presses reverberating through the building. However, Mr
Ian Beattie hopes a quieter revolution at the car seat slide manufacturer
will have a more lasting impact.
Mr Beattie, managing director of the Nottingham-based company whose
customers include Rolls-Royce, Rover, Volvo and Nissan, has overseen a
transformation in manufacturing practices and cultural attitudes which has
covered everything from information technology to the adoption of Japanese
methods to cut waste.
Along with many suppliers to the automotive industry, Dunlop Cox has had its
ups and downs, but, when it came to replacing its former computerised batch
processing system in 1990, there were special reasons for ensuring that the
company made the right decision.
A difficult move from two factories into one new plant, and an underfinanced
attempt to introduce just-in-time manufacturing, had turned the company into
a high-risk supplier by the time BTR, the international engineering group,
bought it in January 1990, says Mr Beattie.
An investment was made by BTR for additional plant, tooling and training to
allow the full potential of JIT manufacture to be realised. Further
improvements followed with the introduction of cell layouts, Kanban systems
and other Kaizen techniques.
Thus, with a very conservative base that requires reliable and timely
deliveries - at the right quality and price - any new production system had
to be capable of supporting Dunlop Cox's updated and re-arranged
manufacturing methods, rather than smother them.
Because stocks are low and manufacturing processes are balanced, production
on an hour-by-hour basis is controlled on the shopfloor using Kanban. The
computerised production control system, however, is needed to support the
interface between customers, who frequently change their schedules, the
production cells and the company's suppliers.
It was here that the selection of a comprehensive new computer system became
a problem. Dunlop Cox had outgrown its old ICL batch processing machine, and
wanted a system that could keep up with daily production of as many as
17,000 seat mechanisms and slide assemblies.
But very few system vendors, says Mr Richard Bull, production director, were
able to understand the needs of real JIT manufacturing. At any time, the
company has just 13-14 days of stock in the entire production process, and
uses a fairly simple system of manual controls to pull parts and products
through the system.
Storage of materials between the various operations such as pressing,
fabrication, painting and final assembly has been virtually eliminated, and
the company does not need to know, for example, how many parts are being
produced by a particular press - or where an individual item has reached in
the manufacturing process, as this is controlled using the Kanban system.
Dunlop Cox has now introduced a system based on a UK-built McDonnell Douglas
Series 19 superminicomputer, supporting software from Worksop-based All
Business Systems and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Matrix
package.
Matrix is an online manufacturing suite with variants available for batch,
contract, repetitive and process industry needs. At Dunlop Cox, the Pounds
400,000 system is proving its worth in a number of ways; by enabling the
immediate tracking of information in the receiving bay - previously it might
have taken three days for the system to register receipt of a component or
roll of coiled steel; by enabling real-time 'backflushing' of sales,
generating supplier schedules automatically; by allowing the creation of
sophisticated 'process routings' to replace the limited instructions
available under the old system.
Not everything has gone smoothly. Transferring existing records to the new
computer has not been easy, says McDonnell Douglas, while Mr Bull says it
took the supplier some months to work out how to get his forward calendar to
match with the system's.
Dunlop Cox is currently doubling the system's processing power but Mr John
Bryant, manufacturing engineering director, says the company already has the
backbone of what it needs. The system's ability to provide instantaneous
access of data from the manufacturing cells will help the company's
continuous improvement process and - through links with its Computervision
Cadcam system - its new product development.
The company, says Mr Beattie, is no longer a high-risk supplier - a
statement supported by its exclusive contract to supply seat slides for the
Nissan Primera and Micra assembly plant at Washington, Tyne &amp; Wear. Its new
computer system will help it stay in its customers' good books.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): Now 'customer
power' rules - Design and manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MACILWAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS INDUSTRY has suffered because it has been more interested in providing
the flashiest system than in looking after its customers,' concedes the
marketing director of one top computer-aided design and manufacturing
(Cadcam) supplier, writes Colin Macilwain.
That is a mistake it can no longer afford. With revenues falling for the
second successive year, in an industry used to double-digit growth,
suppliers are scrambling to keep customers happy and defend market share.
'Customer power now rules,' says Mr Jon Boyce, UK marketing manager of
Computervision, the Massachusetts-based company which leads the UK Cad
market.
Only five years ago, use of Cad for sophisticated three- dimensional design
of parts, though touted at trade shows, was rare in practice. Now it is
widespread in medium and large engineering companies.
At the Hall Green, Birmingham, plant of Lucas Aerospace, full
three-dimensional design and analysis is undertaken before production of the
complex aluminium alloy castings which the plant makes for aircraft fuel
systems.
Mr John McCart, who manages the factory, says: 'In the 1970s, systems were
tested in the aircraft. In the 1980s it was done on the testbed. In the
1990s it will happen on the drawing board.' To take a design from concept to
service, he says his military customers used to allow up to 10 years and
civil customers five or six years. Now that is falling from three to two
years and will be compressed still further.
Since the first use of Cad at Hall Green 10 years ago, the number of people
working in the design office has fallen from 85 to 25 - with a
largerthroughput. And the recent adaption of 3-D design and analysis has cut
development times by 40 per cent.
But new forms of computer-aided engineering now coming to the fore could
have an even more dramatic impact on design practice. The most important are
parametric design and knowledge-based engineering.
Broadly speaking, parametric design allows engineers to stretch and compress
designs virtually at will, without having to reset dimensions individually.
The technique is now offered by all major suppliers, but its use remains
restricted, since designers need to adjust their ways of working to exploit
it fully.
Knowledge-based engineering remains in its infancy, although a dozen or so
large British engineering firms are experimenting with systems from the main
specialist suppliers, ICAD and Wisdom.
While conventional Cad merely automates the designer's ability to draw
straight lines and circles, knowledge-based engineering is more ambitious.
By attempting to record and replicate the thought processes which a designer
habitually employs, it could open the way for a far higher level of
automation in the design process.
Work by Lotus Engineering at Norwich has already shown how knowledge-based
engineering can enable the speedy design of car chassis parts using a
process, called hydroforming, which was once ruled out by metal-bashers as
simply too difficult to design for.
But the more immediate obsession of many who use it has shifted from the
technology itself to the mundane task of keeping track on the data which it
generates. Most large manufacturing firms find themselves confronting a
growing mountain of design data. Responsibility for every design change
needs to be accurately allocated to somebody.
For the big suppliers, engineering data management is becoming as important
a source of income as selling new systems. The large established suppliers
all now see themselves as 'strategic partners' of their customers. As Mr
David Punter, marketing director of EDS Unigraphics, puts it: 'The
difference will be in the way the customer buys: there will be a market for
commodity Cadcam, and a market for strategic partners.'
Half-a-dozen established suppliers - EDS, IBM, Computervision, Intergraph,
Hewlett- Packard and SDRC - hoped to secure the lion's share of this
'strategic' business. But their grip is under threat from a team of
Computervision defectors, who won venture capital backing to found
Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) four years ago.
PTC reckoned a parametric system designed from scratch could better exploit
modern computer workstations and software development techniques. Last
month, it shook the Cad world by winning a Dollars 40m order from
Caterpillar, the US construction group.
Mr Andy Campbell, PTC's UK manager, claims his company will sell around
5,000 new systems worldwide this year.
However, rivals say that PTC will soon encounter the problems they face.
Meanwhile, Computervision's grip on the UK Cadcam market - where PTC has
made little impact so far - looks relatively secure.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Battle to save the French franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France and the German Bundesbank intervened heavily on the
foreign exchanges yesterday to support the French franc, after the currency
threatened to move close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European
exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The 13-year old ERM was founded on the linkage of the French franc and the
D-Mark, and the future of the system now depends on whether a devaluation of
the franc, which France would find humiliating, can be avoided.
The French central bank raised its key money market lending rate by 2.5 per
cent yesterday and then intervened continuously in the foreign exchange
markets. Several analysts suggested last night that France's foreign
exchange reserves were exhausted, but there was no official indication of
this.
The Bundesbank intervened to support a currency within its margins for the
first time since the ERM was founded. There were suggestions that Germany
has spent DM30bn in support of the franc this week, on top of the DM60bn
spent to shore up sterling and the lira. Overnight rates in the German money
market were at 0.5 per cent, down from 6 per cent on Tuesday, reflecting the
colossal quantity of D-Marks in the financial system.
By last night, the battle between the markets and the central banks seemed
evenly matched, with the French currency finishing at FFr3.4120 to the
D-Mark, against a lower limit of FFr3.4305.
Can the franc hold? France's economy is sound and, far from being a
devaluation candidate, there is a case for saying it should be revalued. If
necessary, France could play what one analyst called 'dirty tricks' to aid
the currency. It could temporarily suspend the five to 10-day lending window
in the French money market, as it did for 20 minutes last Friday.
Alternatively, it could reintroduce capital controls, as Spain did
yesterday, to make franc trading less liquid.
However, there were signs yesterday of a fundamental flow out of the French
currency by investment funds with huge currency holdings. One London based
economist said his bank had seen a German pension fund sell French francs in
large quantities.
The peseta rocketed against the D-Mark after Spain announced reimposition of
capital controls. It opened at Pta71.91 per D-Mark, closed in London at
Pta67.64 and moved from the bottom of the EMS grid to the top. Dealers said
the peseta market was now illiquid. Spot exchange was still possible, but
currency swaps were very difficult to execute.
The Irish punt remained under intense pressure, ending at DM2.6240, not far
above its floor of DM2.6190. The Portuguese escudo finished weakly at
Esc88.75 per D-Mark, compared to its floor of Esc92.33.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the sterling money market firmed yesterday after the Bank of
England forecast a very large shortage of Pounds 1.95bn at the start of its
operations.
Rates had softened markedly the day before, after the Bank announced a
reduction in base rates to 9 per cent, with three-month money closing on
Wednesday night at around 9 1/16 per cent. However, the three-month rate
ended firmer yesterday at 9 3/16 per cent on the offered side, and the
one-month offered rate remained high, at 9 1/2 per cent.
A clearing bank dealer said that the shortage reflected the huge amount of
sterling that was bought on the foreign exchanges last week, which is
estimated at about Pounds 15bn. But the Bank also announced that it would be
offering a roll-over of facilities that have been offered to the largest
banks, building societies and the gilt edged market to relieve the
unprecedented shortage pressures. The interest rate on these facilities will
be at the market rate.
Sterling futures rose early in the day after the Bundesbank and the German
government showed strong support for the French franc, which came under
intense selling pressure on the foreign exchanges. Dealers assumed that the
Bundesbank might be prepared to cut interest rates to support the franc, and
that this would facilitate another reduction in UK base rates without
undermining sterling's position any further.
However, some dealers believe that another UK base rate cut will undermine
sterling, pushing up inflation in the longer term. 'The 12 per cent
devaluation that we have seen so far puts about 3 per cent on UK inflation,'
said one dealer yesterday.
The December short sterling contract opened at 91.90, but later fell back to
finish at 91.80. Strictly speaking this assumes that three-month money at
the end of the year will be at 8.1 per cent.
In early operations the Bank purchased Pounds 70m in a repur-chase agreement
at the new rate of 8 15/16 per cent. In further operations, the Bank bought
Pounds 88m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 48m of Band 2 bank
bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 558m in a repurchase agreement.
The Bank bought Pounds 556m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 535m of Band
1 bank bills. Late assistance was Pounds 640m.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (2): New name for an
old idea - The impact of simultaneous engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN BOWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FURTHER one looks into the future, the more wayward the predictions. As
a result, UK, European and US manufacturing companies, with over-long
development times, are delivering products that no longer meet customers'
expectations when launched.
Yet, according to Computervision's 1992 manufacturing attitudes survey
(carried out by Benchmark Research) cutting the time it takes to develop
products was a key business issue for only 63 per cent of companies, with
quality and reduced costs occupying the top positions. What has yet to be
fully realised is that long development times, increased costs and poor
quality go hand in hand.
Dr Nick Barter, chief engineer at Jaguar, explains the situation: 'It takes
European car companies six years to develop a car, while the Japanese take
two years and produce more variants.' The Japanese can react far quicker to
customer demands and keep costs down by using new technologies and the
latest production techniques. 'Another advantage', says Mr Stephen Nugent of
Computervision, 'is that if you have only two years rather than six between
models, it does not matter if you get landed with a dud.'
Short product cycles also need improved quality. With a product development
cycle of two years, the Japanese cannot afford the European and US luxury of
11 months to return to normal after a car launch. In short, Japan is in the
driving seat on cost, quality and development time.
All businesses, not just automotive companies, face time pressures. For
Rolls-Royce to stay competitive it had to cut engine development time from
eight years to match Boeing's four-year airframe development. Lesser league
players than the international automotive and aerospace giants also see time
as a competitive pressure. As Mr Benjamin Taylor, joint managing director of
probe manufacturer Renishaw, explains: 'We were seeing products cost twice
what they should to develop and we still did not get it right. If we can
develop products quicker there is less of a problem if we get it wrong.'
The obvious solution is to cut the time it takes to design new products. The
question is: How?
In the past two years simultaneous (some call it concurrent) engineering has
entered the industrialists' lexicon. It is a new name for an old idea. For
many years companies have been using multi-disciplinary design and
manufacturing teams to develop products that, in theory, meet customer and
production requirements.
The difference today is the influence of the computer. While there is little
doubt that the principles of simultaneous engineering can be achieved
without computers, judicious use of technology is needed to reap all the
potential benefits.
A premise of simultaneous engineering is that putting more effort into the
concept phase of a design will reduce the number of problems experienced
later when expensive tooling, components and equipment have been ordered.
The assumption is that these potential design, manufacturing and material
problems can be identified early on. 'For many companies that is still an
act of faith,' claims Mr Peter Penhallow, consultant at AT&amp;T Istel. The risk
is that the concept design phase will be lengthened without any reduction of
manufacturing problems, cost or time to market.
Like all techniques, total quality, just-in-time and so on, badly
implemented simultaneous engineering will fail. And information on how to
implement it is scarce. There are plenty of academic papers on company
organisation and the team approach, but most of the practical savings will
come from modifying the design to manufacturing process to make it more
efficient and responsive to change.
Today, any simultaneous engineering solution involves computers.
Unfortunately, if users and vendors are honest, the impact of an isolated
technologies such as computer-aided design and manufacturing (Cadcam) on
overall development time, product cost or total quality has been negligible.
The reasons are more to do with the way these systems are used rather than
the technology. A Cad system restricted to a design department will
contribute little to simultaneous engineering.
However, computers have the potential to link the different functions -
design with manufacturing, purchasing with engineering and so on - needed to
make simultaneous engineering work. Neither organisational change or
technology alone can solve the time problem. Both must operate in harmony.
Take the example of Renishaw. It operates collocated, multi-disciplinary
development teams, but the actual time and cost savings achieved come from
the efficient use of technology.
Renishaw's main problems occurred when products moved from being specially
produced in the model shop to mass production. The solution was to eliminate
the time and cost associated with prototype model building and go direct
from design to manufactured part. By using a modified version of McDonnell
Douglas' (now EDS) CAD system, Renishaw captures all the design and
manufacturing expertise of the development teams into a CAD solid model of
the part. This information is then used to program the production machines.

computer - Production changes to meet new market conditions

COMPUTER MAKERS are taking their own medicine and finding it efficacious.
They are using their own products at every stage of the computer
manufacturing process. Indeed, without the flexibility of modern computer
databases, coupled to powerful minicomputers and workstations, the problems
of coping with today's chaotic market conditions could be crippling.
The computer market has changed greatly in the past few years. Demand for
mainframes, the workhorse of the traditional data processing business, has
flattened off with serious consequences for large computer makers who derive
most of their profits from mainframe systems.
At the same time, the market for smaller systems - personal computers,
workstations and network computers or servers - has grown enormously. Prices
have plummeted because of fierce competition and lower component costs.
In such unsettled conditions, manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are
paramount. Product cycle times are reducing sharply. According to Mr John
McClelland, director of manufacturing and development for International
Business Machines' UK subsidiary, a product that typically took two years
from initial design to launch now takes less than a year to develop.
At ICL, Mr Ian Hunt, product introduction manager, says that a new variation
on a basic personal computer model can be introduced in less than three
months.
Computer-aided design and manufacturing technology provide the lubricant for
the most modern techniques: concurrent engineering where designers,
engineers and marketing specialists work as a group on a new product.
Just-in-time parts delivery is made possible by on-line, automated
warehouses.
Design for manufacture is critical. Hewlett-Packard has designed computer
terminals that were easy to build and cut labour and overheads at one plant
by two-thirds and raw materials by half.
Computer manufacturing itself has changed markedly as proprietary designs
have begun to give way to open systems built from off-the-shelf components.
NCR, for example, now the computer manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T, builds its
entire product line, from notebook computers to mainframe systems, using
standard Intel microprocessors.
At one time, computer cabinets could be opened to display a spaghetti-like
mass of wiring (minicomputer companies have flourished in former textile
towns where experience with tangled threads translated swiftly into skills
with tangled wires). No longer, however; integration of components onto
printed circuit boards many layers thick has often done away with the need
manually to connect components together.
Computer manufacturers, indeed, are becoming chiefly assemblers. They may
design the chips in their machines but the physical parts are made in
silicon foundries - semiconductor manufacturers who will make chips in
volume to order.
ICL, for example, designs the processors used in its top of the line Series
39 large mainframes, but the silicon chips are made by Fujitsu, whose
semiconductor technology is second to none.
Computer makers still design their own printed circuit boards, but may
neither manufacture them nor insert the electronic components. Tandem, for
example, a leading manufacturer of fault-tolerant computers, sold off its
board factory last year. It no longer makes economic sense to make
components which can be produced more efficiently by a specialist
manufacturer.
The labour content of a small computer - a personal computer or workstation
 -is now typically less than 5 per cent of the overall manufacturing cost.
Assembling machines as complex as computers - whether mainframe or micro -
makes powerful demands on manufacturing logistics, however.
For large manufacturers IBM and ICL, the key is integrated engineering
software which drives the manufacturing process. At the heart of IBM's
manufacturing process, for example, is a software system called Catia
(Computer Graphics Aided Three Dimensional Interactive Application), a suite
of programs for design, analysis and manufacturing. It includes software for
three-dimensional surface and solid modelling, drafting and numerical
control programming in its extensive list of applications. Developed by
Dassault of France, Catia is not only used by IBM but also marketed by the
US company.
IBM commonly manufactures each product in at least three sites worldwide.
The sites compete with each other to set cost and quality standards. The key
to co-ordination is the integration of the engineering database. Paper has,
to a large extent, been eliminated. Engineering releases - complete
descriptions of parts - flow electronically from the data base to the
manufacturing sites.
Parts have unique identifying numbers worldwide and are recognised as they
pass along the assembly process by bar codes. The supplier side of the
manufacturing process is equally automated. Customer orders arrive
electronically. Invoices and bills are despatched by electronic document
interchange (EDI).
ICL, for example, orders silicon chips from Texas Instruments of the US and
Fujitsu of Japan through EDI messages and receives acknowledgements in a
similar fashion.
The company builds only to order; nothing is made for stock which means the
order book has to be forecast some 18 months into the future. In the present
business climate, the order book changes daily but ICL's MRP (Materials
Resource Planning) software takes the strain.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (5): 'Server' may still
have role - Decline of the Mainframe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MACILWAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS of the death of the mainframe computer may be greatly exaggerated -
but even at IBM, where a Dollars 60bn global empire has been built primarily
by selling and supporting these centralised computer systems, the decline in
the stature of the beast is readily acknowledged.
'The mainframe business isn't growing as it used to,' Mr Andrew Wightman,
head of IBM industrial marketing in the UK, concedes. 'And that's even more
true in manufacturing than it is elsewhere.'
The diminishing role of the mainframe computer has been a continuous theme
of the industry since the minicomputer offered an alternative 25 years ago.
But the decline in its stock has accelerated sharply of late with the
arrival of powerful computer workstations running on the 'open' Unix
operating system, and the bold assertion, by Sun Microsystems and others,
that almost any size of computing requirement can now be met by a
distributed network of workstations and servers.
According to Mr Wightman, the slowdown in mainframe demand from UK
manufacturing industry has been hastened by special factors - most notably,
the tendency of larger companies to devolve decision-making to their
operating units. Information technology is normally decen- tralised, too -
and so the importance of the central, corporate computer declines.
Mr Wightman is aware that anything he says in support of the mainframe may
cast him in the role of King Canute, refusing to bow to the inevitable tide
of distributed and 'open' systems. 'We are not trying to defend mainframes,'
he says cautiously. 'But in our view, the pendulum has swung too far.' He
predicts a continued role for the mainframe as a powerful 'server',
supporting networks of smaller computers.
His argument is that, despite the technical performance and the cheapness of
fully distributed computer systems, most organisations will need to retain
central control over data, and, even more problematically, over the
development and maintenance of software. So when old hands in the computer
industry hear, as they have recently, that the Post Office or the Royal Air
Force is committing its vast computer requirements to run on distributed,
Unix-based systems at a future date, they say: 'We'll believe it when we see
it.'
Few manufacturing companies, in any case, are in a position to jettison
their mainframe computers, even if they wanted to. 'I think the mainframe
computer still has a life of perhaps 10 years,' says Mr Cliff Shuker,
managing director of the Rover division of software house AT&amp;T Istel.
'But its role will change. It will become a server, holding corporate data.
And since its architecture is wrong for that role, we'll see a move to
parallel processing machines,' he adds. These mainframe computers will,
observers believe, use new, so-called 'massively parallel' hardware
technology to process thousands of simple tasks simultaneously.
Mr Shuker thinks that even as the move to distributed computing gathers
pace, the mainframe will still be needed as a central server. 'As the
concept of the server and the distributed network evolves there will be new
issues, such as how you manage software updates and security,' he says. 'But
I don't believe you'll ever service data adequately across a large network
without a big central server.'
However this need for central support cannot, Mr Shuker believes, preserve
the traditional keeper of the mainframe - the central data processing
department. 'That will become extinct,' he predicts.
Mr Tony Hoare, industrial marketing manager of UK-based but Japanese-owned
computer supplier ICL, claims that a smooth evolution of the mainframe
computer into the new, distributed environment is feasible. 'The mainframe
is still the most appropriate corporate server,' he says, 'while Unix
machines will serve as departmental servers.'
ICL is also adapting its mainframe computers to try to meet the demand for
distributed computing: they will offer the facilities of the latest personal
computers on their terminals, for example, and run programmes written for
that linchpin of open systems, the Unix operating system.
But Mr Hoare says that these developments are intended to keep existing
customers happy: mainframes are not cost-competitive, he admits, for anyone
building a corporate computer system from scratch. 'The mainframe market in
manufacturing will become much narrower,' he concedes.
Other observers are reluctant, though, to concede that the market has any
future at all. 'Our view is that distributed computing is the way to go,'
says Mr Eric Woodcock of BAeCam, the factory control business which has
developed from expertise within British Aerospace.
'Manufacturing wants its computing power as close as possible to where value
is added,' he adds. 'So distributed computing is the answer. The mainframe
was never right - it was just that there was no alternative.
'There are reasons why manufacturing firms will hang on to their mainframe
even if it is not the optimum solution - they have old data, old
applications and security requirements to think about.'
But for Mr Woodcock, recent commitments by the US Department of Defense and
the UK Ministry of Defence to rely on workstations and servers for their
computer requirements in the future were the writing on the wall. 'The
military has now accepted that these client-server systems are secure.
That's just another piece of evidence that suggests the mainframe computer
has no future in manufacturing control.'

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): Choice not so
simple - Just-in-time stock control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MCILWAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST-IN-TIME is Japanese, and its greatest attribute is its simplicity.
Computer-integrated manufacturing is American in origin, and its curse is
its complexity. And, as we all know who has been winning at manufacturing,
let's dump the computers and go for just-in-time, right? If only the choice
facing manufacturers were so simple, writes Colin Mcilwain.
The just-in-time (JIT) philosophy has gained widespread credence in Europe
over the past five years. But its emulation has often involved the intensive
use of computers - in stark contrast with its original form in Japan, where
JIT normally comprised an entirely manual set of techniques for optimising
factory efficiency. Only now are some leading Japanese manufacturers
resorting to intensive computerisation to manage the flow of work through
their factories.
Mr Ernie Stene is an industry specialist at IBM's manufacturing centre at
Warwick. Not surprisingly, he takes issue with the view that Japanese
manufacturers have benefited from their cautious approach to
computerisation.
The traditional Japanese JIT approach, based on so-called Kanban squares
painted on the factory floor, has its limitations, Mr Stene says. 'The
principle was wonderful, but the implementation of simple Kanban neglected
the need for engineering change. So we put in electronic Kanban, which was
still based on an MRP schedule.' MRP is the linchpin of most computerised
production control systems used in Europe and North America.
'There's been a lot of mouth-music in this country about JIT, but not so
much of it actually being applied,' he adds.
This impression of more words than action is reinforced by Dr Dominic McKay,
managing director of Fort Glasgow-based electronics fabricator Kinloch
Electronics. 'My feeling is there is good deal more talk than there is
implementation,' he says.
Kinloch uses MRP to schedule work in its own factory, and electronic data
interchange (EDI) to exchange information with its bigger customers. This
would not be the case at a similar plant in Japan. 'Many of them produce
only one product,' Dr McKay says. 'We have 500 different assemblies active
at any one time.'
As managing director of the Rover division of Redditch-based software house
AT&amp;T Istel, Mr Cliff Shuker is responsible for implementing computer-based
solutions to manufacturing problems at the car group, which has embraced
JIT, especially in its relations with suppliers.
'Just-in-time in the west requires greater use of computer technology,
because manufacturing is less predictable,' says Mr Shuker. 'In Japan, you
don't see much evidence of computerisation or barcoding on the shop floor:
if you ask them why they are building something, they'll say: 'That's the
plan'.'
The location of suppliers is an issue too, according to Mr Shuker. 'In
Japan, they tend to be clustered around the car plant. In the UK,
just-in-time deliveries may come via a warehouse close to the point of
consumption. So the supply pipeline is more complex.'
In the motor industry, not only are parts delivered on a just-in-time basis,
but they are often automatically paid for without recourse to invoicing.
'Rigorous, computer-controlled just-in-time brings with it the confidence to
self-bill,' says Mr Shuker.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1): Avoidable problems
 -Computers have changed the face of manufacturing in the past 20 years, but
often the wrong systems have been installed. New software developments now
provide the opportunity to avoid previous problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FACTORY of the future may fast be turning into a present-day reality,
but suppliers and customers in perhaps the most complex and diverse modern
industrial sectors are still learning lessons from the mistakes of the past.
Computers - corporate-level mainframes, computer-aided design (Cad) in the
drawing office, production control systems, manufacturing resource planning
systems and much more besides - have changed the face of manufacturing over
the past 20 years. Often, however, they have simply added to manufacturing's
problems.
Customers on both sides of the Atlantic have bought too much equipment,
believing that computer - integrated manufacturing was simply a case of
giving everyone a computer screen, bought oversophisticated equipment,
failed to understand the cultural implications of a computer investment or
simply bought the wrong system for their needs.
Suppliers bear much of the blame. Dr Matthew Barekat, managing director of
Company Doctors International, recalls a case where the supplier of software
to control a batch manufacturing system tried to convince a process
manufacturer, for which the system would have been totally unsuitable, to
purchase the system by changing it very slightly.
Episodes like this go some way to explain the very high failure rates of,
and unrealistic expectations for, computers in the manufacturing
environment. At the same time, there has also been considerable
dissatisfaction at board level about companies' computer investments,
because they have hitherto been seen by chief executives as islands of
automation that have not been linked together properly, says Mr Garreth
Evans, Computervision's UK managing director.
But attitudes are now changing, just as manufacturers themselves are trying
to simplify their production processes to address the big competitive
challenges of the 1990s.
The move towards small, simple manufacturing cells with varying levels of
automation is aimed at producing truly flexible manufacturing and sharply
reducing cycle times, and manufacturers are looking for computer systems
that support rather than smother the process.
And just as the recession is forcing chief executives to control capital
spending tightly, bosses are at last realising that they have to become
involved in the major computer decisions that might previously have been
left to separate departments.
Indeed, manufacturers have to understand the need to develop a business
strategy and then find the right computer system, rather than the other way
round, says Mr John Crampton, a director of Ingersoll Engineers.
The change in attitude coincides with some important technology developments
 -in software at least - over the past two or three years, with more to
come, that hold the key to achieving what Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market
research group, recently called 'a factory in which there is computer-based,
seamless integration of people functions, information technology, and
manufacturing processes to achieve business objectives defined by management
goals'.
That is achievable now, although too many manufacturers are held back by
their past mistakes, and by, for example, computer-aided engineering
software that cannot communicate with a business mainframe. On Tuesday,
however, the start of the three-day Computers in Manufacturing show at
Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre will show how many of the old
problems can be avoided.
Experts on the use of computers in manufacturing point to a number of
significant developments over the past two to three years. The introduction
of so-called fourth generation computer languages has done a great deal,
says Dr Barekat, to increase computers' flexibility, and offered a real
opportunity to write a new breed of software for industry.
The trend towards open systems - non-exclusive, non-proprietary standards
for computer and communication environments - also offers immense
opportunities for manufacturers to create effective interfaces between
different elements of their computer systems. 'Vendors who remain
proprietorial will go to the wall - and a good thing too,' says Mr Evans.
If applied correctly, such developments ought to go a long way to address
what is now seen almost universally as the key challenge for major western
world manufacturers in the 1990s - reducing 'time-to-market' or product
development times. The concept of 'concurrent engineering' where all
sections of a company, and often its suppliers, work in teams to develop new
products, rather than taking on each task in sequence, is rapidly gaining
acceptance.
Achieving it is partly a cultural issue - Japanese manufacturers have called
the tune on product development times without heavy reliance on technology.
The use of three-dimensional Cad, seen in the west as a prerequisite for
successful concurrent engineering, is surprisingly rare in Japan.
Western companies have traditionally found the 'people issues' surrounding
manufacturing technology hard to handle - the 'failure' of MRPII
(manufacturing resources planning), one of the vogue computerised systems of
the 1970s for providing company-wide production information, is widely
attributed to a lack of training, or of involvement of users in the initial
purchasing decision.
Hence the relatively high priority given to technology solutions. Some of
the major technology contributions to reducing time-to-market are happening
within discrete parts of the process. The use of parametrics, an
'intelligent' system which automatically adjusts a Cad design for the change
of one or more dimensions, is 'taking off' says Mr Crampton, citing a
manufacturing company which was able to output a design that previously took
three months in three to four minutes.
Increasingly, however, manufacturers are realising the need for accurate,
shared information to be available to all departments which participate in
the concurrent engineering process - and external suppliers. This puts an
added premium on company-wide engineering databases and data interchange,
the success of which will depend crucially on open systems.
Mr Keith Nichols, director of EDS Scicon's manufacturing consultancy, says
the bulk of product databases are supporting small teams, but reports
considerable progress in the UK over the past three years towards what he
calls the 'million file challenge,' an indication that the product database
is broad enough for information to be truly shared.
Another problem area, he says, is in technology links with suppliers. As big
manufacturers increasingly push design work out to subcontractors, the need
for accurate, updated information grows. 'If you freeze a supply chain now,
you would find that 50 per cent of the data is out-of-date, he says.'
This points up the need for electronic data interchange (EDI) links between
manufacturers and subcontractors, especially when large numbers of companies
are involved. AT&amp;T Istel, for example, is working on a pilot programme with
Rover which will eventually link the UK car producer with 200 suppliers via
an electronic 'mailbox'.
The recession may have turned manufacturers into more discerning customers
for computer systems, but has almost certainly increased their resolve to
address the big manufacturing issues in order to survive.
The use and importance of computers also changes significantly during a
recession, according to Ms Anthea Ballam of the consultants Ballam Malaguti
International. The information provided by computers becomes much more
valuable than in boom times when the finer points of the manufacturing
control system tend to be overlooked, she says. Meanwhile, cuts in
management layers have obliged managers to work across the boundaries of
their sphere of operation, and acquire a more integrated picture of the
whole manufacturing operation.
It is partly for these reasons, therefore, that the inevitable downturn in
spending during the recession has been significantly less than for capital
equipment as a whole. A survey by Benchmark Research, to be released for the
CIM show, says UK industry plans to spend Pounds 1.5bn on computer-based
manufacturing applications in the next 12 months, down just 4 per cent on
the previous year.
The survey, encouragingly, shows that open systems are beginning to take
off, with 22 per cent of manufacturing sites that have computers using open
systems against 15 per cent in 1991. And 84 per cent of the 1,300 sites
surveyed said the need to integrate systems was a major reason for
investment.
Suppliers will be trying to address their needs in the 1990s with products
that currently remain on the drawing-board. One emerging area, says AT&amp;T
Istel, is ERP or enterprise resource planning - a phrase coined by the
Gartner Group, the US consultancy - which will use technologies such as
artificial intelligence and relational databases to create a complete 'data
model' for all aspects of multi-company enterprises, including Europe's big
manufacturers.
At the shopfloor level, Dr Barekat has advocated the concept of 'distributed
MRP,' small-scale MRPII systems at manufacturing cell level, linked by a
plant-wide network of PCs or workstations but giving each cell
responsibility for its own scheduling. The 'passive' IT users, meanwhile -
accounts, sales and administrative departments - keep a conventional
centralised MRPII system.
One can be fairly confident that yet more acronyms will be coined over the
next few years to replace those that have fallen out of favour.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Tensions over ERM dominate activity in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
dominated activity in Europe's government bond markets again yesterday.
The French franc continued to come under heavy pressure in the foreign
exchange markets, forcing the Bank of France to raise its five-to-10-day
lending rate early in the day and to intervene heavily.
Trading in French and German government bonds was volatile because of
uncertainty about whether the French franc would remain in the ERM or
whether the Bundesbank would be forced to lower German interest rates in
order to help support the French currency.
THE French government bond market ended the day lower as concern about the
weakness of the French franc against the D-Mark prompted heavy selling by
foreign investors.
The Bank of France raised its five-to-10-day lending rate to 13 per cent
from 10.5 per cent in the morning and intervened heavily to keep the
currency off its floor of 3.4305 to the D-Mark in the ERM. The Bundesbank
also intervened to support the franc. Although it strengthened from 3.42 to
3.39 to the D-Mark, it later fell back to 3.41.
Traders believe that the recent defence of the franc may have almost
depleted the foreign currency reserves at the central bank.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent government bond due 2002 opened at 8.51 per
cent, and ended at 8.70 per cent. The yield spread over 10-year German
government bonds widened from about 110 basis points to 125 basis points.
THE plight of the French franc had repercussions on the German government
bond market, leading to speculation that the Bundesbank might cut interest
rates in order to help prop up the French currency and ease tensions within
the currency grid.
Dealers reported strong buying of short-dated bunds on the grounds that
these would gain the most from a cut in German interest rates. Trading was
volatile although the market ended little changed on the day. 'All the
trading has been currency-related . . . the big questions are whether there
will be an ERM realignment, a devaluation of the franc or a cut in German
rates and nobody knows,' said one dealer.
The bund futures contract ended at 90.94, little changed on the opening,
having traded in a range of 90.78 to 91.12.
UK government bonds rose by up to three-quarters of a point with the medium-
and long-dated issues seeing the strongest gains.
Short-dated gilts ended virtually unchanged as dealers warned that this area
of the yield curve may have been 'too optimistic' about the possibility of
further cuts in the UK base rate.
Index-linked gilts continued to rally on inflation worries, allowing the
Bank to sell a substantial portion of its latest index-linked issue. The
Bank announced a Pounds 600m tranche of 4 3/8 index-linked stock due 2004 on
Tuesday and dealers estimate between half and three-quarters of it may have
been sold yesterday. The 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2016 rose
from 121 17/32 to 122.00 by late afternoon.
Index-linked gilts have seen a strong rally since sterling was taken out of
the ERM last week because investors worry that without the discipline of the
ERM, the government will be under less pressure to keep inflation down.
During the current financial year the Bank has issued around Pounds 2.4 bn
of index-linked gilts with a further Pounds 16bn launched in the form of
fixed-income (conventional) bonds.
Among conventional gilts, the 10 per cent stock due 1994 ended unchanged at
102 7/8 to yield 8.15 per cent. At the long end, the 9 per cent gilt due
2008 rose from 98 3/16 to 98 21/32 .
THE Bank of Spain's announcement of new restrictions on capital movements
and loans to non-residents boosted the peseta and helped to lift Spanish
government bond prices initially. However, dealers reported heavy selling of
the bonds later in the day leaving the market lower on the previous close.
The introduction of restrictions on capital movements is intended to prevent
speculation in the currency and had the effect of pushing the peseta up to
the top of the ERM.
Under the new regulations, Spanish banks lending to foreigners now have to
deposit an equal sum interest-free with the Bank of Spain for a year. The
10-year bond fell from 88.20 on Tuesday to 86.30 yesterday.
US Treasury prices were mixed in light trading yesterday following Tuesday's
big declines, with uncertainty about the European markets and the outlook
for the dollar keeping many players on the sidelines.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 97
7/32 , yielding 7.478 per cent, and the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 to
yield 3.984 per cent.
There was some early selling, especially at the long end, which followed
comments from Mr David Mulford, the Treasury under-secretary, who said US
officials were not concerned by the weakness of the dollar against the
Japanese yen. His comments sent the dollar/yen cross-rate tumbling.
Prices recovered slightly on hopes that international investors would choose
US assets as a safe haven from the upheavals afflicting European markets,
but the long end lost all its gains mid-afternoon following a disappointing
auction of five-year notes.
ITALIAN government bonds drifted lower late in the day, pulled down by
profit-taking mainly in the floating rate sector.
The Italian market started on a firm note as the Bank of Italy eased at its
L6,000bn repurchase tender, where the minimum rate fell two points to 16.50
per cent.
However, concern over the outcome of today's L43,000bn auction of Treasury
bills pushed bond prices lower.
The benchmark May 2002 fixed rate bond (BTP) closed at 91.81 per cent, up
from 91.57 per cent at the previous close.

FT  24 SEP 92 / International Bonds: EIB and EBRD join new wave of borrowers
after turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development yesterday joined the latest wave of borrowers to raise money
through collared floating-rate notes, leading to warnings of oversupply in
the market for this kind of paper.
Yesterday's two triple-A rated borrowers follow in the wake of other
top-ranked issuers who came on Tuesday, led by Austria, which brought the
first sovereign issue in the sector.
Austria's Dollars 400m deal, followed by a similarly-sized offer from the
EIB yesterday - both of them brought by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - has helped to
extend what had been mainly a retail market into more of an institutional
one. The previous wave of dollar floaters had been dominated by subordinated
bank issues and names likely to be attractive to retail investors.
The EIB's Dollars 400m issue was only the bank's second borrowing exercise
since the removal of Italian withholding tax exemption, which had enabled it
to borrow at abnormally cheap levels.
Yesterday's offer bore a close resemblance to other collared floaters in
recent weeks. It has a minimum coupon of 5 per cent to attract investors who
want a pick up over current US interest rates and a maximum of 8 1/4 per
cent. The coupon is 25 basis points below Libor in between.
The all-in borrowing cost to the EIB was not disclosed, but one banker
commented that it had probably had to pay around 50 basis points more than
it would have paid before the tax change, when it could have expected to
borrow at around 70 basis points below Libor. 'They've had to change their
(borrowing) targets substantially,' this banker said.
The sudden flow of floating rate notes in the past two days, following a
subdued period in the Eurobond markets owing to the turmoil in Europe's
financial markets, threatens to give the market a serious case of
indigestion.
While issues such as those from Austria were taken up quickly, there were
reports of others being left with underwriters.
Traders pointed, for instance, to the Dollars 200m issue on Tuesday from
Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB). The maximum coupon of 8.5 per cent
was aggress-ively priced, traders said, leading to less interest than had
been seen for some of the other issues.
Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Spain's troubled Dollars 1.5bn issue, which was
priced on Tuesday after a delay of a week, settled yesterday at around its
launch spread of 55 basis points over US Treasuries.
Underwriters to the issue said that the decision to increase the spread from
the 45 basis points indicated when the bonds were first offered a week ago
had been the only realistic way of assuring that the deal would be a
success.
'There's no question of us not living up to our commitment,' one underwriter
said. In the changed circumstances of the past week, the issuer had no
choice but to accept a higher yield to ensure a successful launch, he said.

FT  24 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Treasurers face a stiff test
in controlling risks - Coping with volatility in the financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The smart guys were hedged already. It is a bad idea to buy insurance when
your house is already burning down,' - options salesman.
IF corporate treasury is concerned with the control of financial risks,
recent events in the foreign exchange and money markets are providing
company treasurers with a stiff test.
For one thing, the cost of failure increases dramatically during periods of
financial market volatility. 'At times like this you discover whether the
reporting systems are working and whether there are exposures no one
remembered to hedge,' said the treasurer of a multinational company.
Most foreign exchange exposures faced by companies are transaction
exposures, arising from trade in goods or services. However, companies which
tried to hedge exposures with currency options last week found it
prohibitively expensive.
The cost of currency options has risen sharply in line with the volatility
of the underlying foreign exchange markets. Bankers estimated that the cost
of dollar options has at least doubled in the past three months. Indeed,
options specialists at large banks last week gave up trying to price many
types of currency option.
An alternative, and immediately cheaper, strategy for hedging foreign
exchange risk is to lock into exchange rates by buying forward currency
contracts. However, many treasurers said yesterday that the direction of
exchange rates was still too uncertain to justify locking in now.
'The cash cost of buying a currency forward is certainly cheaper than taking
an option-based approach. But the opportunity cost of making the wrong
decision could be huge at the moment. We are still too unsighted to take a
clear view on exchange rates,' said the treasurer of a UK oil company.
Many companies also face translation exposures, arising when the earnings of
overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling for accounting purposes.
Whether these pure accounting exposures should be hedged is a matter of deep
debate. Companies which do hedge on translation, including SmithKline
Beecham and TI Group, hold that a predictable stream of earnings has
additional value for investors.
Last week's effective devaluation of sterling will, if sustained, actually
boost overseas earnings of UK companies on translation. Even so, uncertainty
over the level of earnings has led some companies to look again at hedging
of translation exposures.
Many companies also actively manage balance sheet assets and liabilities to
take account of foreign exchange movements. A treasurer can increase balance
sheet exposure to the dollar by borrowing in sterling - reducing the net
sterling assets of the company - and buying dollars. If the dollar
appreciates, the balance sheet will strengthen.
This kind of approach is not always popular with earnings-conscious
investors: borrowing in sterling can also lead to higher interest charges, a
cost which has to be taken through the profit and loss account. Companies
which believe the dollar has turned said yesterday there was a case for
shifting balance sheet exposures in favour of the US currency.
For outright borrowers of sterling, the question is whether to lock into
interest rates now available in the forward market or wait for further base
rate cuts.
Treasury sales teams at big UK banks report brisk trade from companies
looking to lock-in now. For example, five-year sterling was yesterday quoted
at around 8.66 per cent, as good value in the eyes of many treasurers on a
long-term view.

JUKEN NISSHO, a Japanese forestry group, is to close its timber mills in
Japan, replacing them with new facilities in New Zealand.
Over the past two years, the company has bought extensive areas of former
government-owned exotic forest in the North Island.
Yesterday, Juken Nissho said it was building two mills in the Aupouri Forest
in Northland, in the far north. These will cost NZDollars 100m (USDollars
53.68m) and will produce sawn and laminated timber, veneer and plywood.
It is also to build a mill at Masterton, in the lower North Island, and at
Gisborne, on the East Cape, in two years' time.
Corporate Investments, a New Zealand investment holding company, yesterday
announced it was selling its Allied Finance financial subsidiary for
NZDollars 8.8m.
Corporate Investments, which owns forestry interests and Montana Wines, the
country's biggest winemaker, is under intense pressure to relieve its debt.
In recent weeks it has sold most of its substantial Australian and New
Zealand tourism interests.
Allied Finance is being sold to Christchurch-based farming group Pyne Gould.
The sale brings to NZDollars 14.8m the value of assets divested since July.

<TEXT>
MAGNUM, the New Zealand liquor group, yesterday announced net losses of
NZDollars 233.36m (USDollars 125.27m) after extraordinary items for the year
to June, a sharp turnaround on the previous year's profits of NZDollars
25.24m. Sales and operating revenues were NZDollars 820.92m, down from
NZDollars 901.2m.
The extraordinary items included NZDollars 264.3m written off for heavy
losses made on the sale of non-core assets and other investments. In
particular, Magnum wrote off NZDollars 89.7m on its 50 per cent investment
in fellow liquor group Wilson Neill, which owns Tasmania's Cascade
Breweries. Magnum paid 65 cents a share, and has written them down to 6
cents, saying it may write this off as well.
Wilson Neill's share price has tumbled amid accusations of insider trading
in its shares. Yesterday they sold at 4 cents.
Other sums written off included a loss on the sale of its Countdown grocery
chain, and various Australian investments that totalled a further NZDollars
58.7m.
The group's New Zealand retail and wholesale grocery businesses were sold to
Foodland Associated of Perth for NZDollars 175.3m, NZDollars 41.6m less than
book value.
However the directors said the group, which is controlled by Brierley
Investments and Asia Pacific Breweries of Singapore, improved its forecast
profits after tax and before extraordinaries. It earned NZDollars 30.9m,
compared with the NZDollars 20m directors forecast in March.
The result was helped by a better-than-expected result from sales of hotels
owned by Austotel, the Australian hotel group, which contributed NZDollars
24.6m. The proceeds of the grocery businesses and hotel sales were applied
to debt reduction.
However, the directors said that in spite of the better-than-anticipated
result, the quality of earnings was not satisfactory. Only Corban Wines
performed well, as the group continued to face depressed trading conditions
and competitive pressures and drastically reduced margins both in Australia
and New Zealand.
The company said sales by its core New Zealand liquor operations fell 3 per
cent to NZDollars 777m, due to a drop in beer sales and higher taxes.
However, Dominion Breweries finished the year strongly and maintained its
market share.
In Australia, Magnum's investments in retail and wholesale businesses were
unsatisfactory, the directors said. Since balance date, Vintage Cellars had
been sold to Coles Myer.
The group was continuing negotiations with banks to replace debt facilities,
and was considering additional funding. A rigorous programme to restore
profitability was being continued.

JARDINE Strategic, the chief holding company of Hong Kong trading group
Jardine Matheson, yesterday unveiled a 7.9 per cent rise in net profits to
USDollars 113m for the first half to June, from Dollars 105m a year earlier,
AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
Jardine Strategic said the profits would continue to grow at a similar rate
over the rest of the year.
First-half turnover advanced 5.3 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars
2.28bn. The directors announced that the interim dividend was being
increased by 64 per cent to 5.42 US cents a share from 3.3 cents, even
though earnings per share fell by 9.5 per cent to 15.23 cents from 16.83
cents.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, attributed the rise in earnings to the strength
of the Asia-Pacific region, where most of the group's activities are
concentrated.
'Jardine Strategic's balance sheet is strong and the first-half rise in the
market value of its underlying holdings reflects investor appreciation of
the growth potential of companies operating in the region,' he said.
'Results for the full year are expected to be in line with the interim
figures and the company remains confident of its future prospects,' Mr
Keswick concluded.
Analysts expressed little surprise at the results, explaining they were
largely known once the figures for its affiliated companies' were disclosed
earlier this week.
Sun Hung Kai, a Hong Kong investment holding and securities trading company,
yesterday revealed net profits 120 per cent ahead at HKDollars 201m
(USDollars 26.00m) for the six months to June, from HKDollars 91.4m a year
earlier, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
Earnings per share were also 120 per cent higher at 33 cents, compared with
15 cents, and the directors are recommending a doubled interim dividend of
10 cents a share.
Turnover rose 53 per cent to HKDollars 464m from HKDollars 304m.

<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian trading bank, has appointed McKinsey &amp;
Company, the international corporate consultancy, to advise it on strategy.
Announcing the appointment yesterday, Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing
director, portrayed it as part of a new growth phase for the bank.
'We have the problem loan provisioning behind us, and with completion of the
ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 871.96m) rights issue on September 30, the bank's
position will have stabilised,' he said. 'We can now devote more time to
looking ahead.
'I am confident the time is right for Westpac to start looking to the
future. Westpac has made major changes to its operations and staffing levels
over the past three years. Our focus now is to identify potential sources of
future earnings growth.'
Westpac also announced that its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue, which closed
yesterday, was unlikely to have been fully subscribed. The bank will detail
the size of the shortfall before trading opens in Australia today.
CS First Boston plans to exercise its right, expressed in the underwriting
agreement, to seek tenders for subscriptions to outstanding entitlements at
the issue price of ADollars 3 a share. Any remaining shares will be taken up
by CS First Boston or sub-underwriters.
Westpac has also launched a USDollars 350m debenture offering in the United
States. Underwritten by First Boston Corporation and Merrill Lynch, the
issue is priced to yield 7.982 per cent.
AMP Society has reduced its stake in National Australia Bank to 6.95 per
cent from 8.08 per cent. AMP is Westpac's largest shareholder, with a 15 per
cent interest, and also controls just under 7 per cent of ANZ Banking Group.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USG, the parent company of US Gypsum, has reached agreement in principle
with two of its three creditor groups on a debt restructuring plan which
would involve it making a 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
Under a pre-packaged scheme, a company reaches agreement on a restructuring
with its creditors before filing for bankruptcy, minimising the time it
spends under the authority of the court.
USG's filing would only involve the parent company, with no effect on trade
creditors of its operating subsidiaries or the status of the many asbestos
health claims pending against US Gypsum.
USG, which ran into financial trouble after loading up with debt to fend off
a 1988 takeover, said it had agreed with its senior bondholders' committee
and agents of its banks on a restructuring which would reduce the face value
of its debt from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 1.6bn.
The plan would leave stockholders with just 3 per cent of the group's
equity.
Some 82 per cent of the equity would be owned by holders of 13 1/4 per cent
senior subordinated bonds, whose creditor committee has accepted the plan.
Some 15 per cent would be held by the junior creditors, who have rejected
the scheme.
The company said that if it could not reach agreement with the junior
creditors it would ask the courts to approve a plan that gave them nothing.

SULZER Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, has agreed to sell its
industrial and utility boiler activity to ABB Asea Brown Boveri and its
valves and control systems division to IMI of the UK.
No terms were disclosed, but Sulzer said the sales were part of a
restructuring.
Concentration in the thermal power generation industry led to the sale of
its boiler business to ABB, which is now one of the world's top power
generation equipment suppliers with annual sales of SFr2bn (Dollars 1.53m)
in this field. By contrast, Sulzer's annual sales in this area are only
SFr110m.
Similarly, IMI is already a world leader in a broad range of fluid power
systems, while the Sulzer business, with annual sales of SFr80m, was
specialised mainly in valves for hostile environments.
Sulzer said the businesses being sold were profitable and the new owners
intended to maintain them in their present Winterthur facilities. No
redundancies are foreseen.
IMI said the acquisition of Sulzer's Thermtec's industrial valves business
would strengthen its position in the power generation market.

FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Zucchi keeps its head down on
expansion - Haig Simonian examines the Italian textile group's strategy for
beating the downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING first-half net profits at Zucchi, Europe's leading producer of
household textiles, look set to threaten the Italian group's six-year record
of earnings and dividend growth.
Net earnings for the first six months of 1992, to be announced this month,
will probably be down by between 25 and 30 per cent on reduced sales, warns
Mr Manlio Alberto Zucchi, operations director.
However, Mr Zucchi, whose two uncles, Giordano and Manlio, are the company's
chairman and managing director respectively, hopes recovery in the second
half will be strong enough for full-year profits to dip only slightly to
L28bn-L30bn (Dollars 22.4m-Dollars 24m), against L34.9bn last year. Sales
should exceed L600bn, after climbing 5.8 per cent to L599bn in 1991.
Zucchi has grown fast since 1986, when it bought Bassetti, its bigger rival,
from the Marzotto textiles group, which took around 23 per cent of Zucchi in
return. Two years later it acquired Mascioni, a textile finishing group,
also from Marzotto, followed by Jalla in France in 1990. Last June, Zucchi
expanded again, buying the household textiles activities of Eliolona,
another Italian manufacturer.
Zucchi now controls almost 27 per cent of the highly fragmented Italian
market for household textiles such as towels, sheets and bedlinen, while in
France its share has risen to 11 per cent, thanks to Jalla.
However, like other Italian textiles producers, Zucchi has been hit by
rising domestic costs at a time of slackening demand. Preliminary figures
suggest a 10 per cent fall in Italian demand for household textiles in the
first four months of this year, and imply a bigger drop for the first half.
That could take Zucchi back to the tough early 1980s, when demand for
household textiles fell by around 30 per cent. Adding to its troubles are
restructuring plans, which, though ultimately cost-saving, will depress
profits initially. There is also the burden of digesting Eliolona and its
minority stakes in Standardtela and Standardtre, two textiles and thread
producers in which Zucchi has the majority.
Zucchi has also come under fire for last year's decision to use the
tax-saving device of buying the beneficial interest on share dividends to
boost 1991 profits by around L5.5bn to L6bn. Similar financial engineering
should lift profits by around L5bn this year.
Analysts fear the practice may be banned by the Italian tax authorities.
Stripped of such special items, Zucchi's net earnings would have fallen
slightly in 1991, Mr Zucchi admits. Adverse reactions from investors
contributed to the group's decision not to continue the practice next year.
'We'll have to find some other way to save money,' he says.
Zucchi's hopes of beating the downward market trend are based on improved
marketing and production. Buying Eliolona's household textiles activities,
which also include licences to manufacture under the Benetton name, will
expand its range and market share.
Gaining full control of Standardtela and Standardtre should help reduce
overheads by concentrating production on fewer sites. Already, almost all
the towelling sold under the Zucchi and Bassetti brands is made at a single
Zucchi plant.
The group has also just commissioned a study on the relative advantages of
manufacturing in either a low-cost European Community country such as
Portugal, eastern Europe, or a cheap-labour market - such as India or
Pakistan - to cut costs.
So far, it is not convinced of the merits. In spite of relatively high
Italian labour costs, Mr Zucchi says that manufacturing sophisticated
household textiles has become increasingly capital-intensive. Finishing and
printing textiles require sophisticated technology and know-how. 'Going
abroad is only worthwhile for some products,' he says.
On the sales side, Zucchi wants to expand in Europe. Apart from France, it
has been growing in Spain, where it now has a 2 to 3 per cent market share
and Bassetti is well-established.
'We see it (Spain) as a future market for growth. It's like Italy 25 years
ago, with no obvious dominant producers and very similar tastes,' Mr Zucchi
says. With the market highly fragmented, buying market share through
takeovers has been rejected in favour of organic growth, which might include
local production. The company also hopes to expand in Germany and recently
bought a small retail chain to test the waters in Greece.
Even the depressed UK has been considered. 'We looked at two possible
acquisitions, and decided not to go ahead,' Mr Zucchi says. While the
company was attracted by relatively cheap purchase prices and the low cost
of UK labour, it was deterred by antiquated and labour-intensive plant.
The domination of the UK market by big retailers was another disincentive.
'The market is controlled by the distribution side. Only around 20 to 25 per
cent of sales are under a manufacturer's brand name. The rest is either sold
under retailers' own labels or as unbranded imports. Manufacturers just
aren't known to the consumer,' he notes.
Astute use of brands in a sector in which trademarks are seldom prominent
has been Zucchi's strength. While Bassetti is placed slightly up-market from
Zucchi, both are familiar names in Italy.
'That has always helped us make money in circumstances where others have
failed,' says Mr Zucchi. 'Internal competition between Zucchi and Bassetti
has stimulated innovation, helping us to develop brand names in a segment of
the market where that is not usually the case.'

profits warning

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Black &amp; Decker fell sharply yesterday after the US household
equipment maker and information services company warned Wall Street not to
expect earnings growth in the third quarter.
The company blamed deterioration in European economies and other
international markets and over-capacity in the worldwide electronics
industry for its disappointing outlook.
It does not expect third-quarter earning to exceed the Dollars 12m, or 12
cents a share, earned in the second quarter of this year.
Analysts had expected Black &amp; Decker to earn at least 22 cents a share in
the third quarter, with some predictions as high as 35 cents a share. In the
1991 third quarter, the company earned 16 cents a share.
At close of trade shares in Black &amp; Decker had dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 16 1/8 .
Mr Nolan Archibald, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The high interest
rate environment, together with currency and trade issue throughout Europe,
continue to keep pressure on our consumer and commercial businesses during
the current quarter. Improvements in our US operations will not fully
compensate for lower sales and production volume in Europe.'
Black &amp; Decker recorded 1991 sales of Dollars 4.64bn, with international
sales contributing 44 per cent of the total.
Although analysts had taken the weak economic conditions in Europe and
Canada into account in their earnings projections, they had expected the
impact to be offset by the company's recent cost-cutting measures.
Earlier this year, Black and Decker completed a 20.7m stock offering which
allowed it to reduce interest expenses by retiring Dollars 465m in long-term
debt.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Vardon pays Pounds 10m for eight marine
centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
VARDON, the leisure attractions group which owns the London and York
Dungeons, has agreed to buy Sea Life Centres for Pounds 9.9m in cash and
stock, and plans a share placement, and Stock Exchange listing, to help fund
the acquisition.
Sea Life owns and operates eight marine life centres around Britain and
operates the Blackpool Centre, in which it has a 50 per cent stake with
First Leisure.
Vardon acquired the Dungeons in March for Pounds 5.6m from Kunick after Mr
David Hudd, chairman, and Mr Nickolas Irens, chief executive and former
finance director of First Leisure joined the board of Winchmore,
restructured the company and changed its name.
Yesterday the group reported interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 337,000 on
turnover of Pounds 639,000 for the 27 weeks to July 5 and an interim
dividend of 0.25p.
Vardon is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m, earnings per share of
4p, and a final dividend of 0.5p per share for the year.
Under the terms of the deal the Pounds 9.9m purchase price will be satisfied
by Pounds 2.5m cash and the issue of 16.36m Vardon shares, of which 11.9m
will be placed on behalf of the vendors at 45p per share.
The cash element of the purchase, together with about Pounds 1.3m of working
capital for the group, will be provided through the placement of a further
11m shares in Vardon at the same price.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Overseas sales behind 11% rise at Spirax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the steam equipment specialist, reported an 11 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.5m while saying there
was still no sign of any improvement in trading conditions in its world
markets.
The Cheltenham-based group, which makes 80 per cent of its steam-related
sales outside the UK, said the effect of the recent sterling devaluation was
difficult to predict, but could benefit next year's results.
The group said turnover in the six months to June 30 increased by 7 per cent
to Pounds 81.4m, including a good contribution from new products. Trading
profit increased by 4.6 per cent to to Pounds 11.3m, with margins slightly
lower at 13.8 per cent.
The pre-tax profits figure was flattered by a drop in interest payable from
Pounds 1.3m to to Pounds 798,000, although the benefit is unlikely to be as
marked in the second half.
Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said that in the group's principal
steam speciality business, the UK market remained depressed, but a wider
range of products had helped to achieve real growth in turnover and trading
profits.
In continental Europe overall volume reduced, mainly due to a drop in
capital expenditure by customers in France. However, orders from former
eastern bloc countries increased business in Germany, and helped maintain
European trading profits.
Growth in the Far East was slower than in previous years, although the
company said good growth was achieved in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and New
Zealand.
Business levels remained depressed in North America, although cost controls
maintained trading profits. In Argentina the company enjoyed a good increase
in business but economic uncertainty reduced demand at the group's Brazilian
subsidiary.
The tax charge of 42 per cent reflected the overseas contributions to
profits and for the first time included Pounds 450,000 of potentially
unrecoverable advance corporation tax.
Mr Tappin said positive cash flow was achieved while investment was
maintained at Pounds 10m. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds
25.6m), reducing gearing from 38 to 22 per cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 7.8p (7.4p) and the interim dividend is held
at 2.7p.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Huntleigh progress continues with interim
jump to Pounds 2.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRESS AT Huntleigh Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment
manufacturer, continued in the first half of 1992 with pre-tax profits
jumping from Pounds 932,000 to Pounds 2.35m, a figure almost 2 per cent
higher than the full-year outcome in 1991.
The interim dividend is more than doubled to 4p (1.75p), payable from
earnings ahead to 17.02p (7.02p) per share.
Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the board's policy was for the total dividend
to be at least 3.5 times covered.
The shares rose 38p to close at 718p.
Turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.8m), though Mr Schild said
that if the activities of the recorder division - now sold and providing an
exceptional credit of Pounds 120,000 to the results - and the load cell
joint venture were stripped out, the increase would have been 50 per cent.
Mr Julian Schild, the chairman's son and finance director, said that the
extent of the profits advance derived from growth across all the company's
markets. He described this as 'unusual' - normally some grew as others
slackened.
However, malpractice suits in the US - and increasingly in Europe - as well
the financial necessity for hospitals to minimise patients' stays, ensured
that sales of Huntleigh's pneumatic mattresses to combat bedsores continued
as the engine of growth.
In more general terms, his father ascribed Huntleigh's strength to its
'narrow' product range and large volumes which allowed stocks and overheads
to be reduced.
That strength was maintained in spite of the adverse dollar/sterling
exchange rate throughout the period, he said.
He expected currency factors to be neutral over the full 12 months.
Some 75 per cent of Huntleigh's products are sold abroad with 42 per cent in
the US alone.
Outside the UK, the company manufactures in the US, Germany and Australia
and has distribution agreements for European, Far Eastern and South American
territories.
The UK sales force has been expanded and there is a growing contract and
rental market both here and in Germany.
Huntleigh is 56 per cent controlled by the Schild family and 60 per cent by
the family and board.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins warns on second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVIS PERKINS, which describes itself as equal fourth in the builders'
merchant market, saw a near-4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, from Pounds
5.47m to Pounds 5.26m, in the first half of the year.
However, Mr Tony Travis, chairman, warned that the second half might not
match the first because of the cost of branch closures. Last year's pre-tax
total was Pounds 14m, including Pounds 5.8m of property sales. Property was
only likely to contribute Pounds 2m this year, after Pounds 720,000 (Pounds
600,000) in the first half.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 151.6m (Pounds 156.1m) and operating profit to
Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 5.02m).
Mr Travis described the results as 'pretty dull, but quite an achievement in
the present market'. The share price gained 11p to close at 144p.
The operating margin was held at 3.2 per cent, whereas the 15-year average
was between 6 and 7 per cent.
A 1 per cent decline in gross margin, from 29.5 to 28.5 per cent, was offset
by cuts in overheads.
The group employed 3,250 people at the end of June, 11 per cent down on June
last year and 1,400 fewer than three years ago. Further jobs would be shed
in the second half.
Interest payments roughly doubled to Pounds 305,000, although the group
ended the first half with some cash in hand. Mr Travis said the average
overdraft was between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m. The group has had little debt
since the all-paper merger of Travis &amp; Arnold and Sandell Perkins in 1988.
The number of branches had fallen from a peak of 169 after the merger to
about 145 by the end of this year. The group claims nearly 5 per cent of the
national builders' merchant market, but perhaps twice that in the main
regions in which it operates: London, the south and the Midlands.
Mr Travis said the 1 per cent fall in interest rates would do little to help
the group this year, although it was a step in the right direction. The
falling value of the pound might help reverse the decline in imported timber
product prices. 'As a distributor we have been living on a percentage on
products that have been falling in price for two-and-a-half years.'
Timber products accounted for 33.2 per cent of first-half sales. Building
products' share was 38.1 per cent and plumbing and heating equipment 24.2
per cent.
Bad debt charges remained high at 1.1 per cent of credit sales (80 per cent
of sales are on credit), although this was an improvement on 1.4 per cent
for 1991.
Earnings per share fell to 3.6p (3.8p). The interim dividend is maintained
at 2.5p.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Airtours pays Pounds 16m for Pickfords
chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the UK's third largest tour operator, yesterday announced it had
bought the Pickfords travel agency chain from NFC, the transport group, for
Pounds 16m.
Mr David Crossland, chairman, said owning Pickfords would improve the
distribution of his group's holidays, provide it with better market
information and strengthen its presence in the south of England.
He said that if each of Pickfords' 333 branches booked one additional
Airtours holiday a week, it would add Pounds 2m to the enlarged group's
pre-tax profits.
Airtours would pay for the purchase from its own cash resources, Mr
Crossland said.
The deal was broadly welcomed by the City, with Airtours shares rising 10p
to 223p.
'It's difficult to see any major downside,' said Mr Peter Joseph of Smith
New Court. The only reservation might be that owning a travel agency chain
with 1,700 employees would make it more difficult for Airtours to cut
capacity if the market turned down.
Pickfords Travel is the UK's third biggest travel agency chain after Lunn
Poly and Thomas Cook.
Mr Crossland said Pickfords' market share was 7.3 per cent, compared with
21.2 per cent for Lunn Poly and 8.7 per cent for Thomas Cook.
In the 48 weeks to September 5 this year, Pickfords made profits before tax,
profit-sharing and extraordinary items of Pounds 2.9m on commissions of
Pounds 51.1m generated from retail sales of Pounds 387m. It has cash
balances of about Pounds 40m and is understood to have net assets of about
Pounds 9m.
Pickfords sold its business travel division to Wagon-Lits last year,
generating an extraordinary profit of Pounds 5.5m.
Mr Crossland said the existing Pickfords management would remain in their
jobs and that Airtours did not intend to close any of the travel agency
branches.
Senior members of Airtours staff had visited all the Pickfords outlets.
The company had also had a surveyor's report done on each branch.
Mr Crossland said they appeared to be in good condition but said Pickfords
required increased investment in information technology. He did not yet know
how much this would cost.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: BSG reverses trend and advances 31%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSG International, the Birmingham-based motor components, vehicle
distribution and consumer products group, lifted pre-tax profits by 31 per
cent from Pounds 6.51m to Pounds 8.57m for the first half of 1992, reversing
the trend of the last two years.
The result was achieved on a reduced turnover of Pounds 297.4m compared with
Pounds 287.3m. Earnings per share rose from 1.92p to 2.57p, and the interim
dividend is maintained at 0.7p.
Both the profits growth and the decline in turnover followed changes in
BSG's Birmingham vehicle distribution, where it has stopped fleet sales with
an automatic buy-back guarantee and extricated itself from a high volume,
low margin business.
At the same time the group is reducing its Birmingham sites from three to
two and dropping its Iveco truck sales operation.
BSG lifted its automotive components trading profits from Pounds 3.85m to
Pounds 5.45m. They increased in the UK, where the group has started
supplying Japanese car manufacturers, in France and in Australia. There was
a small loss, however, in the US where a new mirror plant is being built in
Michigan.
Nevertheless, BSG expects US mirror turnover, on the basis of contracts
already signed, to rise from Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.3m) this year to Dollars
96m in five years time.
Trading profits and turnover were lower in the consumer products division,
which makes children's car safety seats, push chairs and nursery furniture.
This reflected the recession but was offset partly by a strong performance
in Germany.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY Holdings, the clothes and home furnishings group that sees
itself as a 'lifestyle brand' rather than a retailer, more than trebled its
pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.68m in the six months to July 25.
However, the interim dividend is passed again. Mr Jim Maxmin, who took over
as chief executive a year ago at the group which had been losing money for
three years, said: 'It's too early in the recovery cycle to consider paying
dividends.'
Most of the group's shares are in the hands of Sir Bernard Ashley, chairman,
who holds 53 per cent, and the Japanese Aeon group, which has 15 per cent.
Last year's interim figure was Pounds 528,000 on turnover of Pounds 132.2m.
The reduction in sales to Pounds 115.9m was planned, Mr Maxmin said.
'The gross margin went up in every market and product category except
garments in North America.' That part of the business had lost Pounds 1m.
North America accounts for about a third of sales and has 196 shops.
Although the retailing background was depressed, Mr Maxmin said most of the
problems were self inflicted. There had been a 'skills deficit' in the head
office in New Jersey and it had now been moved to Boston. The new management
was concentrating on basic retailing disciplines.
About 40 per cent of sales lie in the UK, where there are 175 shops. Mr
Andrew Higginson, finance director, said UK garment sales had dropped by
14.5 per cent, 'in line with the plan', but gross margins had only fallen by
2.4 per cent. 'We have been eliminating unprofitable sales.'
In the first seven weeks of the second half, sales were 15 per cent ahead of
last year.
In continental Europe, where there are 65 shops and more planned, both
garments and home furnishings improved sales and profits.
Associates - a US bed linen business and a joint venture in Japan -
contributed Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.41m). Sales at Laura Ashley Japan
advanced 20 per cent.
Operating profit from wholly owned activities rose to Pounds 499,000 (Pounds
383,000). Operating expenses were cut by Pounds 8.4m.
Interest payments came down to Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 1.42m) and net debt
fell to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 13.4m), gearing of about 7 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 0.4p (0.12p), although the tax rate stayed high
at 45 per cent. Mr Higginson said the tax paid on continental and associate
profits represented a virtual fixed charge. As profits came back from the UK
and North America, the rate would fall substantially.

Trafalgar House, the property, engineering and construction group, yesterday
replaced one of its brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities with UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, writes Roland Rudd.
BZW are financial advisers and sole brokers to Midland &amp; Scottish Resources
who have been in dispute with Trafalgar concerning the Emerald Producer
offshore rig for almost a year.
Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, said that since BZW had a
potential conflict of interest it had been agreed that the change would be
in the best interests of both parties.
Trafalgar directors claim they were told by BZW before the bid closed for
Davy that there was nothing wrong with the company.
In a separate development RTZ, the mining group, has appointed Cazenove as
joint broker.

ISA International, the Bradford-based computer consumables supplier, lifted
pre-tax profits by 28 per cent - from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.32m - in the
six months to June 30.
Mr John Parkinson, chairman, said the German and French subsidiaries

Following the Norwegian purchase and Pounds 1.1m of goodwill written off,
gearing rose from about 30 per cent to 45 per cent.
Turnover advanced 45 per cent to Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 36m). Earnings per
share emerged at 2.708p (1.942p) and the interim dividend goes up to 0.482p
(0.414p).

SR Gent, the South Yorkshire-based supplier of fashion clothing to Marks and
Spencer, staged a partial recovery in the 12 months to June 30.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled from a depressed Pounds 1.08m last time to
Pounds 2.29m reflecting benefits of the reorganisation of production
resources. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 128m.
The outcome was also helped by interest charges reduced to Pounds 2.71m
(Pounds 3.58m).
Gearing dropped from 85 per cent to 47 per cent.
The recommended final dividend is lifted to 1.25p, maintaining the total for
the year at 2p, payable from earnings of 3.4p (1.3p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Securities, the property and investment company, announced increased
losses for the six months to end-March and issued details of its proposed
restructuring.
Losses before tax increased by some Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 6.55m. After a tax
credit of Pounds 747,000, losses per share came out at 8.8p (8.1p).
Directors have proposed a financial restructuring by way of a two-year
corporate voluntary arrangement, a capital reorganisation and an offer of
new shares to shareholders to raise between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 305,000
 -partially underwritten by Mr David Pearl, chairman.
Directors said that if the reorganisation was not implemented the company
would have no alternative to going into liquidation or receivership.
Following the capital reorganisation ordinary shareholders will hold one new
share for every 35 held.
Preference holders will have two new ordinary shares for every seven
preference shares.
A forced sale now of the group's assets would, they said, result in an
overall deficit of about Pounds 13m.
As previously announced, the year end has been changed to September 30. The
accounts would, therefore, cover the 18 months to September 30 1992.

Clarke Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property company, reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 218,000 in the first half of 1992.
The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 72,000 in the same period last

Gross rental income fell from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.05m, income from

while income from sales of properties dived from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds

Mr Eric Lyall, chairman, said that business confidence had ebbed further
during the half year.
The group is heavily borrowed but as most of the interest is capped any rate
reduction would help the group.
There is no interim dividend (0.33p).

<TEXT>
Dencora, the property investment and development and housebuilding group,
saw profits drop to just Pounds 20,000 pre-tax in the six months to June 30.
The outcome, which reflected a reduced rent roll and depressed house sales,
compared with Pounds 210,000 last time.
Net interest charges amounted to Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 2.66m), none of which
was capitalised. In the last full year, interest totalled Pounds 9.5m, with
Pounds 3.3m capitalised and Pounds 6.2m charged to the profit and loss
account.
Borrowings at the period end were Pounds 59m, down from Pounds 74m in
December.
Fully diluted earnings per share dipped to 0.5p (0.9p); the company does not
pay interim dividends.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Britannia deficit up to Pounds 155,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A reduced contribution from its construction activities led Britannia Group
to report an increased deficit in the six months to June 30 and to pass its
interim dividend.
The Cheltenham-based construction and housing company saw turnover jump from
Pounds 9.17m to Pounds 15.8m partly reflecting the sale of an industrial
park and improved housing sales.
Net interest charges, however, rose to Pounds 211,000 (Pounds 134,000) and
the pre-tax deficit increased from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 155,000.
Mr Chris Powell, chairman, said: 'Market conditions are extremely difficult
with both margins and volumes being heavily squeezed . . . we believe that
it would be foolish to chase construction turnover and forgo profits.'
He was more encouraging on prospects for the housing side, particularly in
the medium and long term.
'The dramatic events of recent days have, we believe, improved the prospects
for a housing recovery,' he stated.
The company sold 38 units from five sites in the first half of the year;
from July 1 to date another 26 have been sold.
Losses per share were 0.9p. The interim dividend is omitted (1p) as was last
year's final.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors ahead to Pounds 1.13m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dagenham Motors, the Ford and Iveco dealer, lifted interim profits by 11 per
cent 'despite extremely adverse trading conditions' according to Mr David
Philip, chairman.
Profits for the first half of 1992 totalled Pounds 1.13m pre-tax, up from a
comparable Pounds 1.01m. Turnover improved from Pounds 61.2m to Pounds 75.6m
with the new dealerships at Enfield and Stevenage contributing Pounds 13m of
the rise.
The two outlets were the main factor behind a 20 per cent increase in
vehicle sales. They should cover their funding costs and make a contribution
to profits in the second half, Mr Philip said.
The interim dividend is held at 1.75p, payable from earnings ahead from 4p
to 4.4p per share.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: JMD plans change of direction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JMD Group, the greeting cards maker and novelty products merchandiser,
yesterday accompanied its interim results with a capital reorganisation, a
move into computer and video games retailing and a change of name.
Mr Bev Ripley and Mr Terry Norris, formerly chairman and managing director
of Cityvision are to join the board as executive chairman and managing
director respectively.
The USM-quoted group reported pre-tax losses more than doubled in the six
months to end-June, from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 150,000.
Turnover increased from Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 1.26m. Losses per share
emerged at 0.19p (0.09p).
The group plans to raise some Pounds 3.9m, net of expenses, by way of a
placing and open offer of up to 32.2m new 5p shares and a subscription for a
further 2.6m shares.
Under the reorganisation, shareholders will receive one consolidated
ordinary share for every five existing shares held. The open offer entitles
qualifying shareholders to 25 new shares for every 12 consolidated ordinary
shares at 12 1/2 p apiece.
It is proposed to change the name of the company to Rhino Group.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURE TRUST, the financial services group, recorded a 9.8 per cent jump in
interim pre-tax profits despite the impact of the recession.
Profits in the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 3.13m).
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 16.1p (14.5p) and the interim
dividend is increased to 4p (3.5p).
The company, which specialises in household budget management, experienced
an increase in its bad debt ratio from 1 to 1.25 per cent. It also saw a
reduction in its interest income, due to falling base rates, and there was
no growth in the number of customers using its budgeting service because of
the poor state of the economy.
These factors were more than offset, however, by selling new products,
including loans to the existing customer base and by the growth of
commission income resulting from the acquisition of OBC Insurance
Consultants. Arbuthnot Fund Managers made a small profit.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Kohl and Mitterrand aim to ease fears over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand want next month's
European Community summit to issue a special statement designed to soothe
popular fears that economic and political union will rob people of their
national identity.
The German and French leaders, who discussed the idea of an 'interpretive
declaration' on the Maastricht treaty in Paris on Tuesday, are expected to
press other EC leaders for support.
Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl agreed at their meeting that the lesson of the
narrow Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht was that the European
Community had become remote from ordinary people, an Elysee official said.
The aim over the next few weeks should be to discuss how Community
decision-making could be made more transparent and more democratic, he
added.
The summit, scheduled for October 16 in London, should then brief the
Commission to prepare firm proposals which could be taken up at the next
summit in Edinburgh during December. France was keen that they should
complement the report on subsidiarity called for by Mr John Major.
According to news agency reports from France, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime
minister, said decisions must be brought closer to the people. The
subsidiarity principle - maximum devolution of decision-making - must be
'fully realised', the reports said.
Renegotiation of Maastricht was not discussed on Tuesday. Both leaders, the
principal champions of European union, remained firm in their commitment to
the treaties on monetary and political union even if they took longer than
expected to be ratified by EC members.
Although there was some disparity between French and German versions of the
precise contents of the Paris meeting, it was clear that both leaders felt
the need for an initiative to bolster popular confidence in economic and
political union, which has been weakened by the Danish referendum No and the
narrowness of the Yes vote in France.
According to an opinion poll published yesterday, more than 70 per cent of
Germans want to keep the D-Mark in preference to a single European currency,
and only 32 per cent support the Maastricht treaties as they stand.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Banks reject Canary Wharf plan: Creditors may have to
provide Pounds 170m for Jubilee line extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to the troubled Canary Wharf development have rejected proposals for
taking over control of the east London property project from a group of US
investors which includes Mr Larry Tisch, the billionaire investor and Mr
Lewis Ranieri, the investment banker.
The proposal had been seen by some bankers as the only promising prospect of
progressing the development. The banks' decision appears to end hopes of
them securing outside capital for a vital private sector contribution to the
costs of extending the Jubilee Underground line, which is crucial to Canary
Wharf's prospects.
The project's bankers will now have to decide in the next few days whether
they themselves will provide the Pounds 170m needed.
According to bankers gathered in Washington for the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund, Canary Wharf's 11 leading bank creditors voted
by 7 to 4 to reject the proposal, which had been handled through Smith
Barney, the New York investment bank.
The group was formed by Mr Paul Reichmann, founder of the east London
development. A spokesman for Mr Reichmann last night put a brave face on the
decision, saying: 'There have been a series of discussions and the group is
hopeful that these discussions can continue'.
Lloyds Bank, the UK clearer, led opposition to the consortium proposal,
which was championed mainly by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Some banks opposed the bid because it would have left Mr Reichmann with an
equity interest in the project, and they blame him for their losses on loans
to the project.
The group, which was proposing to inject between Pounds 235m and Pounds 350m
into Canary Wharf, would have provided the first tranches of a private
sector contribution to the Jubilee costs. The UK government insists the
Jubilee extension to Canary Wharf and other parts of east London will not be
built unless it receives a firm commitment on a private sector contribution
by the end of the month.
The extension is seen as essential to attract tenants and save the banks
from huge losses on the Pounds 576m they lent to Canary Wharf. The banks are
considering proposing to the government that if it rented space at Canary
Wharf, the banks would refinance the buildings let to the government and
pass the funds back as a Jubilee contribution.
The administrators to the project, three partners of accountancy firm Ernst
&amp; Young appointed in May under UK insolvency legislation, want to put a
proposal to the government in the next few days.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Decline of the shop steward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOP STEWARD could soon be consigned, like the strike, to the museum of
industrial relations history.
According to the semi-official 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey,
published yesterday, only 38 per cent of UK workplaces now have a shop
steward - or senior staff representative - down from 54 per cent in 1984.
The survey, which has taken two years to be processed, is the most
authoritative analysis of UK industrial relations, based on 5,000 interviews
with managers and employee representatives.
The decline of the shop steward is seen as part of a broader decline in
union influence which the survey attributes to changes in the law and the
nature of the workplace. It reveals a reluctance among staff to take on the
role, with a growing number of uncontested elections for stewards.
In the larger workplaces surveyed - those with more than 25 employees -
companies' recognition of unions for collective bargaining had slipped to 53
per cent by 1990, down from 66 per cent in 1984. However, this is put down
to the closure of unionised plants rather than to derecognition.
The survey's authors see no other system of industrial relations arising in
the growing non-union sector, although 45 per cent of workplaces have
introduced new employee involvement initiatives since 1984. There is also
little evidence of the growth in 'non-standard' employment although
part-time work has risen from 16 per cent to 18 per cent between 1984 and
1990.
Where collective bargaining still exists, the survey finds little evidence
of a trend towards plant-level bargaining, except in the private
manufacturing sector. Nor is there evidence that unions are placing training
and equal opportunities on the agenda.
Although union power has been reduced it has not been wiped out and the
nature of collective bargaining is comparatively unchanged where it exists.
The number of non-redundancy dismissals has risen from nine per 1,000 in
1984 to 15 per 1,000 in 1990 but employees in unionised workplaces are two
and a half times less likely to be dismissed. They are also less likely to
be low paid - defined as paid less than Pounds 3.28 an hour - with 32 per
cent of non-union companies having low-paid employees compared with 19 per
cent of unionised.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As they might say at Tottenham, the boy's done good. Having sold a 7.5 per
cent stake in Amstrad for 79p per share - putting roughly one-third of the
Pounds 34m proceeds into gaining control of the North London football club -
Mr Alan Sugar announced yesterday that he may be ready to bid 30p per share
for the outstanding 65 per cent of the personal computer company which he
does not already own.
Taking Amstrad private - and completely away from the public gaze - may be a
good idea at this particularly awkward stage in the group's chequered
history. Ordinary shareholders, though, are entitled to feel deeply
frustrated. If latest estimates that the balance sheet contains 19p of net
cash per share are correct, Mr Sugar is picking up Amstrad's existing
products, its distribution network and any ideas in the pipeline for just
11p. There is obviously no prospect of a counter bidder. It goes to show
that it is not only continental minorities that get stuffed.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Barratt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from Barratt Developments would seem incomplete these days without a
confident assertion from Sir Lawrie that the UK housing market is on the
turn. Figures of the kind which so impressed the market yesterday, though,
have recently been anything but routine.
Barratt's apparently gravity-defying performance - the Pounds 117m
turnaround at the pre-tax level includes an astonishing 50-70 per cent jump
in UK operating profits, according to outside estimates - owes much to last
year's thumping write-off in the value of its land bank.
The achievement is a good deal more than cosmetic, though. Everything points
to a classic tightening up of financial controls and a substantial squeeze
in working capital. The number of unsold houses has fallen from 900 to 500,
those held in part exchange now total 800 against 1100 at the start of the
year.
While not belittling Sir Lawrie's determination - or indeed challenging his
strategy - the most difficult bit may be yet to come. It does not require
much of an act of faith to see margins of 10 per cent by 1993-94, but
without an unduly bullish view of the housing market it is hard to see where
the growth comes thereafter. That said, even after yesterday's jump in the
price the market is a bit uncharitable in valuing the shares on a forward
multiple less than half that of some of the sector's quality players.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a great irony in the troubles facing the French franc. If anything,
the fundamentals suggest it ought to be a candidate for revaluation against
the D-Mark rather than vice versa. France has a tighter fiscal policy, and
its inflation record has been consistently better. Consumer price inflation
is only 2.7 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in Germany. Still the
franc's position remains precarious. Yesterday's rise in short-term interest
rates backed up by intervention and the outspoken verbal support of the
Bundesbank brought only partial relief. As Britain found last week, the
weight of capital flows rapidly becomes too great to resist when the market
loses faith in a given currency.
The political will to hold the line is undeniable, but it looks increasingly
as though the markets will exact a price in the form of a significant German
interest rate reduction. That would incidentally open the way to further
rate cuts in Britain. It might bring some relief to Spain, which has
alienated foreign investors in its government bond market through the
reimposition of exchange controls. Most important, it would be a gesture of
recognition by the apolitical Bundesbank that Europe's aspiration towards
integration has conferred on it a political role.
That may be hard for the bank to square with its legal obligation to target
domestic price stability. It could argue that the appreciation of the D-Mark
against sterling, the lira and the peseta already imply some offsetting
deflationary effect. The point is that it has little time time left to
wrestle with its conscience. The crunch is probably only days away.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: BAe in need of defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who hoped that British Aerospace's interim results would dispel
uncertainty about the company must be sorely disappointed. For all the
management's insistence that it has grasped the nettle, thorny issues
remain; the sharpest being actually signing the Taiwanese jet deal, progress
on the Saudi Al Yamamah contract, the survival of the European Fighter
Aircraft and the future cost of producing its turboprop airliners. Given all
that, valuing the shares is extremely difficult. Fund managers must be
secretly relieved that BAe is now small enough to ignore in their portfolio
weightings.
In the absence of an earnings stream, yield valuations are the conventional
prop. But BAe's dividend outlook is still unclear. The company surely
intends the proposed 3p interim dividend as a stable base for dividend
growth, and if a similar final payment is made, yesterday's close of 113p
would put the shares on a yield around 7 per cent. However, even that
payment must depend on the success in the Taiwan deal and the generation of
retained profits elsewhere.
Asset valuations are also uncertain. If the company was broken up in current
economic conditions even BAe's prime assets like Rover and some of
Arlington's sites would be very difficult to move at anything other than
fire sale prices. With a weak market worldwide the longer term reliability
of defence profits may also be in doubt. And the cancellation of the EFA
would deprive the company not only of much needed work for its Wharton plant
later in the decade, but also of a platform for several of its missile
systems.
Denied solid valuation criteria, shareholders must now form a view on the
management. Has the team provided for the thick end of the problems, as it
claims, and can it unlock the value of BAe's assets without treading on more
land mines; or will BAe remain accident prone? Mr John Cahill's record at
BTR suggests investors should have confidence. But defence is a singular
business and there are other managers further down the line used to the bad
old ways. A turnaround will depend on his ability to convert or replace
them.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Out of the flying pan and into the fire: BAe's long-awaited
restructuring plan has shaken rather than restored confidence in the company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Cahill, British Aerospace's chairman, clearly felt misunderstood
yesterday when his company's shares fell out of the sky.
His long-awaited announcement of a sweeping restructuring programme at BAe
to stop the financial haemorrhaging at Britain's biggest manufacturing
company was supposed to restore some confidence. The reality, however, was
starkly different.
The City of London was unimpressed by the package and remains unconvinced
that Mr Cahill and his top management team have found the key to secure the
company's future.
Mr Cahill, however, put on a brave face. He said he had bought his shares in
the company at 357p. 'I'm going to hang on and buy some more,' he added, as
the share price fell 43 per cent to close yesterday at 113p.
The shares have been in free fall since BAe became engulfed in a management
crisis and launched a controversial Pounds 432m rights issue a year ago. Mr
Cahill was brought in as chairman last May to oversee a new strategy for the
group and its activities, which range from defence and commercial aircraft
to Rover cars and property.
But the steps announced by Mr Cahill yesterday - including a Pounds 750m
write-off for the restructuring costs of the company's loss-making regional
jet business; the closure of the Hatfield aircraft manufacturing plant; the
loss of another 3,000 jobs; a preliminary agreement to form a regional jet
joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace; and the concentration of turbopropeller
aircraft production at Prestwick in Scotland - failed to lift the
question-marks still hanging over the future of BAe.
Put simply, the fundamental problems facing BAe have not changed in the past
12 months. If anything, they have become worse, judging by the pre-tax loss
of Pounds 129m the company reported for the first six months of this year
compared with a profit of Pounds 86m in the first half of last year.
The recession and defence spending cuts have put all of the company's
business activities under increasing pressure. Defence continues to be the
main profit centre with Pounds 296m profits in the first half on sales of
Pounds 2bn. But the question is whether this profitability can be maintained
in the longer term in a declining market.
BAe hopes to win another big order for military aircraft from Saudi Arabia
soon to help underpin its defence business. But it also faces growing doubts
over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft in which it is the main UK
partner. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, suggested yesterday that BAe
could 'go it alone' on EFA if the Germans and the other European partners in
the project, Italy and Spain, pulled out. However, many in the industry
believe any future combat aircraft project is unlikely to fly without
international collaboration.
In contrast to the profitable defence business, BAe's commercial aircraft
activities have become a financial black hole. 'For every one pound made by
the military division, the civil aircraft division loses 96p,' the company
says. The commercial aircraft operations lost Pounds 286m in the first half
of this year compared with a loss of Pounds 32m the previous year.
The losses have largely come from BAe's regional and commuter aircraft
activities. Although it lost Pounds 4m on its activities in the European
Airbus programme in the first half, BAe sees its 20 per cent participation
in Airbus as one of its most promising long-term assets now that Airbus has
captured 30 per cent of the market for large airliners.
Mr Cahill's first big move has been to tackle BAe's regional airline
activities. The company considered many options, including shutting down the
entire regional aircraft operations, maintaining the status quo, or seeking
a joint venture partner.
By taking a Pounds 750m write-off to cover its regional jet operations, BAe
has prepared itself for the worst. But it still hopes to remain an important
player in the regional jet market by forging a joint venture partnership
with Taiwan Aerospace. Such a partnership could help BAe challenge the
European regional aircraft consortium now being put together by Deutsche
Aerospace of Germany and Fokker of the Netherlands.
BAe appears optimistic it will complete its Taiwan deal by the end of this
year. This would see the two partners investing Dollars 250m each in the
venture to build the family of BAe 146 regional jets launched by the company
earlier this year.
But the regional aircraft market continues to suffer from acute overcapacity
and competition is likely to remain intense. The deal struck with Taiwan is
still no more than an agreement in principle. The US McDonnell Douglas
company negotiated a similar deal with Taiwan Aerospace last year which has
so far produced no concrete results.
The decision to concentrate all BAe's turbopropeller aircraft activities at
Prestwick is designed to improve the productivity of these loss-making
operations. In the longer term, BAe may also be forced to seek a partner to
strengthen these activities.
It tried to do so with its corporate jets when it announced in May that a
majority stake in this business was up for sale. Yesterday BAe confirmed it
would retain this activity. The fact the company failed to find a buyer
prepared to make a sufficiently attractive offer for its corporate jet
division did little to improve City sentiments.
The Rover car activities continue to be plagued by the depressed state of
the UK market, and there are few signs of recovery. Rover, which reduced its
first-half losses to Pounds 31m from Pounds 43m last year, has been turned
into a much more efficient manufacturer during the past two years, helped by
its partnership with Honda of Japan. The immediate issue is whether the UK
car market can recover to the point where Rover can start to make money.
BAe also expects its property assets, totalling about 13,000 acres of prime
sites in the UK, to generate cash when recovery occurs. Although they are
both struggling, Rover and the property business appear far less of an
immediate problem for BAe than its debacle in the commercial aircraft
sector.
Mr Cahill and his team believe they have now taken a significant step
towards resolving the company's commercial aircraft difficulties. The joint
venture with Taiwan would protect jobs in the UK and ensure the country's
presence in the regional jet market, Mr Cahill said, adding that his
strategy was 'evolutionary rather than revolutionary'.
By its reaction yesterday, the market was looking for revolution. One could
soon be in the offing. With its share price plunging, the City was again
rife with rumours of a possible GEC bid for BAe.

What is going on at Sir Nigel Broackes' Trafalgar House? The shares of the
embattled conglomerate slipped to 50p yesterday - capitalising the group at
around Pounds 250m - and Lord Matthews, Sir Nigel's old partner, tells me
that he is as puzzled as everybody else at the decline of his old employer.
It is almost 10 years since he and Trafalgar's newspaper interests were spun
off, yet he retains as lively an interest as ever in the affairs of the
conglomerate. 'If the business is going to continue, then the shares are a
ridiculous price,' he tells Observer from his farm in Jersey. However, what
worries him is that he has seen no sign of Trafalgar's directors buying
shares at current depressed levels.
According to Directus, the Edinburgh-based firm which monitors directors'
share dealings, it is 9 months since Trafalgar's directors bought shares at
levels more than double the current price. Sir Nigel and his family sold a
chunk in May, at around 133p, and since then nothing. Lord Matthews says
this makes him 'very cautious'.
The company, which normally reports its full year figures in December, is
not yet in its close season which would prevent directors' dealing.
One possible explanation is that the directors know of some potentially
price-sensitive deal - such as a large asset sale - which prevents them
underscoring their confidence in the business by topping up their stakes.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Observer: Ore no more
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bang goes another little piece of history. Sweden's 10 ore coin is to be
taken out of circulation next Thursday, the authorities having finally
deemed it no longer worth keeping.
While it still represents slightly more than Britain's 1p, decades of
inflation have reconciled even sentimental Swedes to the disappearance of
the tiny coins, which must be swapped for krona by the end of the year.
Indeed, it's not uncommon for 10 ore pieces to be left lying on the ground,
simply because the people who've accidentally dropped them can't be bothered
to pick them up.
But given the national abhorrence of waste, at least in principle, the
citizenry will be reassured by the promise that good use will be found for
the estimated Pounds 21m worth of ore due for withdrawal. The coins are to
be sold off for melting down into scrap metal.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's vows to head off the currency speculators took on a
sharper tone with finance minister Michel Sapin's radio broadcast following
the hoist in the short-term repurchase rates.
Although he described the object - to hit speculators 'where it hurts: in
their pockets' - as a 'civilised' measure, there was nostalgia in his voice
as he commented: 'During the revolution, such people were known as agioteurs
and they were beheaded.'
As it happens, he does not have all that far to look back. France did not
officially abolish capital punishment until 1981, and the last use of the
guillotine was on a murderer only four years before. Alas, the name of the
last speculator to get the chop remains a mystery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't talk of the 'flight from the lira' to the Bank of Italy's 71-year-old
governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. On top of the thankless task of defending the
national currency, he has been having ups and downs with airlines too.
For instance, the aircraft taking him to last weekend's IMF meeting in
Washington returned to Rome with a fault an hour after take-off - which may
explain a certain change in his demeanour when he finally arrived.
Normally extraordinarily reserved in public, he began airing his feelings
about such things as the behaviour of Italy's European Community partners on
the fateful weekend of September 12, which led to the lira devaluation and
currency-market chaos.
While admitting his country's failure to put its financial house in order,
he plainly deplores other EC governments' unwillingness to devalue in
concert, even though a number knew their currencies needed adjusting.
If the principle of a general realignment had been followed there and then,
he said, 'the Germans would have certainly lowered their interest rates
further'. The British shouldn't need telling who were the main culprits he
had in mind.
Whether his communicative mode will continue can only remain to be seen. But
the omens seem good. His flight home for urgent appointments yesterday was
two hours late.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: Singapore aims to maintain competitiveness in face
of western recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ABDUL AZIZ MAHMOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Growth falls give Singapore an attack of economic angst'
(September 16) is misinformed.
Singaporeans do not 'watch as their old rival, Hong Kong, continues to grow
rapidly'. Each year since 1988 Singapore has achieved higher growth and
lower inflation than Hong Kong. This year Hong Kong expects growth of 5 per
cent, the same as Singapore.
The construction boom is due to the private sector rather than the
government - the share of public sector projects fell from 80 per cent in
1987 to 48 per cent this year. The government is not pump-priming the
economy 'by pouring money into the construction sector'; in fact it is
considering postponing some of its projects until the industry cools down.
Manufacturing output does not 'continue to fall'. While the sector
contracted in the first half of 1992 (-0.4 per cent), it is now expanding,
and full-year growth should be 2 per cent.
Being a small open economy, Singapore never believed it could 'escape the
effects of the recession in the west'. Hence, its emphasis on maintaining
competitiveness.
The strong exchange rate reflects investor confidence and has kept inflation
low. Transportation, telecommunications and other business costs have
remained stable. Wages have risen faster than productivity, but no more than
in other newly industrialised economies.
Measured against them our overall relative competitiveness is at the same
level as in 1986.
Commentating on the Singapore economy is not at all hazardous, but anyone
leaking or receiving confidential official data does so at his own risk. GDP
growth estimates are classified secret until they are properly released,
because they are price sensitive information.
Journalists or financial analysts who obtain or use them without
authorisation will be dealt with according to the law.

Sir, The government wants employment training to be more tightly restricted
to people who have been unemployed for more than six months ('Training
obligation for jobless ruled out', September 23). But common sense, research
evidence and good 'outplacement' practice indicates that help, guidance and
re-training are most needed and most effective immediately after or even
before the impact of unemployment. The damage to individuals and the economy
of this delay must outweigh any saving of public expenditure.
It is like the ambulance service restricting service to those accident
victims who have not walked away or found other help for more than six
hours. Now, there's a thought for the Treasury]

Sir, At the beginning of 1979 the pound was worth about FFr8.50. The French
franc joined the EMS and, for most of the next 14 years, the pound stayed
out. Today, the pound is again worth about FFr8.50. Both currencies have,
therefore, in the long term, lost a similar amount against the D-Mark, one
within the EMS and one, mainly, outside.
The question cannot be avoided: apart from smoothing out short-term
fluctuations, how can it be held that membership of the EMS preserves
exchange rate parities?

FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: Reality of being out of ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LORD COBBOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is naive for anyone to assume that we can copy the US and reduce
interest rates to low single figures and let the currency float down. The US
economy has only a 10 per cent exposure to external markets, Britain's is
over 40 per cent. Apart from the inflationary implications, it would be an
aggressive act of competitive devaluation that would jeopardise our trading
relationships and particularly our participation in the single market.
Can Britain expect its European partners to welcome a flood of cut-price
Nissan cars from Sunderland next year?
The devaluation that has already taken place provides ample short-term
stimulus to the economy. The government must quickly define a new exchange
rate target and re-establish its credibility. The best way of doing that is
to rejoin the ERM at the earliest opportunity.
Why the authorities allowed the foreign exchange market to pick off the
currencies one by one, instead of acknowledging earlier that the
unexpectedly high cost of absorbing east Germany was legitimate
justification for a general realignment, remains a mystery. The ERM is,
after all, designed as a fixed but adjustable system. Its purpose is to pave
the way to a single currency.
If we had had a single currency in Europe, monetary pressures would have
been more evenly spread and last week's crisis would not have happened.
Reality will inevitably require management of the exchange rate vis a vis
the D-Mark and a higher risk premium, meaning higher interest rates, will
apply if we are outside the ERM. We will not escape the Bundesbank by opting
out.
John Major has to recover the initiative in Europe while he is president of
the Council. It will require great courage but he should use the events of
last week as justification for accelerating the establishment of a monetary
institution that is responsive to the monetary needs of Europe as a whole
and not just to the perceived needs of one member country.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your very interesting article (Technology, September 22) about a
machine that can send the contents of a personal computer floppy disc over
the phone gives the credit for this technique to the Japanese.
In fact, the first machine of this kind in the world (as far as we can
discover) was designed in Britain and launched on the UK and European
markets as the 'Diskfax' nearly two years ago by our company. It now has a
substantial base of users in large corporations and in niche markets such as
desk-top publishing and computer-aided design.
Not only did the British Diskfax pre-date the Japanese device but it has a
substantially higher performance. By using a novel transmission method, it
can send discs virtually error-free over ordinary telephone lines. Its users
do not need to have access to an integrated services digital network (ISDN).
It can also operate unattended, just like a fax machine, and can share a
single phone line with a fax machine.
We hope that in making these points our letter will demonstrate that not all
innovative electronic products originate in Japan.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Technology: Don't shoot the messenger - Voice mail systems
may seem impersonal, but their efficiency is winning them friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I AM either on the phone or away from my desk. Please leave a message after
the tone. To reach my assistant, press 'One'. To reach an operator press
'Zero'. To skip this message in the future, press the '****' key.'
If you are a regular caller to companies in the US this type of greeting,
played by 'voice messaging' or 'voice mail' systems, is already familiar. It
provides an efficient - if somewhat irritating and impersonal - means of
communication.
In its basic form, voice messaging is merely a computerised answering
service that records and replays telephone messages. However, the latest
systems integrate voice with facsimile and electronic mail, transforming the
telephone into a multimedia communications terminal.
Voice mail is a technology that Americans love to hate, but they are using
it in ever-increasing numbers. An estimated one-third of all large- and
medium-sized companies in the US already use voice messaging and many
residential telephone users also have access to voice mail services provided
by regional telephone companies.
'Ten or 15 years ago, if you called someone and got an answering machine you
wondered who that person was trying to avoid speaking to. Today, if a call
is not answered by a person or machine, you wonder the same thing. Who are
they trying to avoid?' says George Sollman, president and chief executive of
Centigram, an early leader in the voice messaging systems market. 'That
shows the extent to which we have adapted to the technology.'
Not so in Europe and Asia, however, where sales of voice messaging systems
have been slower to take off, in part, it seems, because there is more
resistance to talking to machines. In Europe, there are also regulatory
hurdles. It takes about six months and costs about Dollars 500,000 (Pounds
280,000) to obtain approval from a European PTT (national telephone company)
to connect a voice messaging system to the phone network, says Douglas
Chance, president of Octel Communications, the largest US supplier of voice
messaging systems.
Yet as Octel and other voice messaging system manufacturers step up their
international marketing efforts, voice mail appears set to become more
widely accepted. Voice mail is catching on in Europe as a service for users
of car phones. The system picks up messages while the user is not in the car
or when the telephone is turned off.
In the US, however, voice mail is viewed primarily as a productivity tool,
especially among the many companies that are 'downsizing' and cutting
support staff. With fewer secretaries to take messages, the voice mail
system ensures that calls do not go unanswered.
Unlike the standard answering machine, a voice mail system picks up calls
when you are already on the telephone. Most systems also give callers a
generous amount of time to record their message and the opportunity to
review what they have said.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of voice mail is that it eliminates 'telephone
tag'. If the other party is 'on the phone or away from my desk' it is always
possible to leave a message. As people get used to the system they leave
more substantive messages and no longer feel the need to talk directly to
one other.
Messages that are too complicated, or too sensitive, to be relayed by a
third party can also be delivered in confidence to a 'voice mail box'.
Companies with international operations find voice messaging a more personal
alternative to electronic-mail or facsimile for sending messages across time
zones. Hotels are beginning to install voice mail as a service to guests, so
that callers are able to leave accurate, confidential messages in any
language.
Voice messaging services can also provide a communications lifeline in
emergency situations. Following the devastating explosions that destroyed
the Reforma district of Guadalajara, Mexico, earlier this year, Telefonos de
Mexico (Telmex) swiftly transformed its corporate 'voice mail' service into
an emergency message system.
In normal circumstances, however, voice messaging simply provides improved
communications capabilities. The full potential of voice messaging is just
beginning to emerge with the introduction of 'voice processing systems' that
allow users to access a wide range of services over the telephone.
The caller can tap into broadcast news services, retrieve and update
computer database records, initiate or receive facsimile and electronic mail
messages, and even have them read by a computer generated voice.
Sollman describes how a voice processing 'power call' works. He is on a
business trip. A call to his voice mail box alerts him to an urgent fax sent
to the office, which is then 'read' to him by the Centigram system. A
customer wants a quotation on a customised voice messaging system.
Having listened to the message, he taps in the fax number of the hotel where
he is staying and a copy is automatically routed to him. The customer's
request requires immediate attention and several people on Sollman's staff
need to be alerted.
From his hotel room telephone, Sollman records a voice mail annotation
urging action on the customer's request. He sends the message and the
original fax to a pre-determined list of colleagues by pressing a few keys
on the phone.
Voice processing can similarly provide links with electronic mail and
computer databases or information services. Interactive voice response
systems, which enable the caller to speak directly to a computer and be
understood, also promise to broaden the applications of voice processing.
Each of the leading voice processing systems manufacturers has its own
specialty. Centigram has taken a lead in the use of computerised 'text to
speech' translation.
Octel is offering features that turn the touchtone telephone keys into a
primitive keyboard to type facsimile messages, select news or traffic
reports and post electronic mail messages. VMX, another voice messaging
systems company, is building a broad range of applications by encouraging
third-party software developers to write programs for its systems.
Voice messaging specialists are, however, facing increased competition from
manufacturers of private branch exchange equipment such as AT&amp;T, Northern
Telecom and Rolm, which are offering voice messaging as an adjunct to their
PBX systems.
And although voice processing systems manufacturers claim that their
products are complementary to computer network systems, it seems certain
that the two industry segments will eventually collide.
While voice processing systems are beginning to access data processing
systems, computers are acquiring many of the attributes of voice processing
including 'business audio' features that enable the user to record spoken
messages and incorporate them in text and graphics documents.
Talking to machines may still be an uncomfortable experience for many, but
by the end of the decade it is likely to be commonplace. Worse, it seems
that these computerised systems will increasingly talk back to us. Perhaps
the only consolation is that when talking to computers we can be as rude as
we please without causing offence.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Technology: Going with the flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Power fluidics, a new technology which uses the flow of liquids or gases
instead of mechanical devices to control manufacturing processes, is set for
widespread application in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority originally developed power fluidics as a
maintenance-free way of controlling highly corrosive and radioactive fluids
in the nuclear industry. Now, in its new guise of AEA Technology, it is
transferring the system to non-nuclear users.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drug company, agreed earlier this
year to develop power fluidics for some of its key manufacturing processes,
starting with antibiotics. And this week AEA signed an agreement with Foster
Wheeler, the international engineering contractor, to exploit the technology
more widely in the pharmaceutical industry.
Power fluidics does away with the need for mechanical devices such as
valves, pumps and mixers. No moving parts come into contact with the process
fluid. Instead, hydrodynamic forces such as a swirling vortex are used to
control it.
For example, AEA has developed three different fluidic mixers to replace
conventional stirrers. They can produce fast, medium or slow mixing,
depending on the chemical conditions required.
According to AEA and SB, the advantages of fluidics include: reduced
maintenance requirements and costs; increased product yield and quality;
more compact and therefore less expensive process equipment; move from batch
to continuous processing; environmental benefits through increased
reliability and reduced waste.
Ray Allen, who runs AEA's processing engineering department, says power
fluidics is already bringing in revenues of Pounds 1m a year. These are
expected to increase rapidly, once Foster Wheeler starts marketing the
technology to its customers in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.
Although drug manufacturing is likely to be the largest application, AEA
will also sell power fluidics to other process industries where
maintenance-free operation is important, including off-shore oil.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Technology: Breaking free from 'voice mail jail'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They call it 'voice mail jail' - an automated telephonic maze that traps
callers and foils their efforts to reach a mere mortal. It has become one of
the daily hazards of business life in the US and it is what gives voice mail
a bad name. Everyone has horror stories about voice mail. Here is a small
sampling:
Calling a software company for the first time, the voice mail system
answers: press 'One' if you know the extension of the person you are
calling, press 'Two' to reach the person by name. This presents something of
a problem if you know neither the extension or the name, but want to speak
to the marketing manager. Undaunted, you press a few keys in the hope of
raising a response. Sure enough, a phone starts ringing, but the person is
unavailable and you now have the option of leaving a message for an unknown
party or following instructions on how to reach his assistant. Choosing the
latter, and beginning to feel frustrated, you reach yet another voice mail
message, and a third and so on. You are in voice mail jail.
Some voice mail systems are horribly complicated, presenting you with a
blizzard of options. Government agencies are among the worst. Calling the
'Ask Immigration' line at the Los Angeles Immigration and Naturalisation
Service is an experience guaranteed to persuade some would-be immigrants to
go home. There are more than 20 different options that callers can select,
including one to hear instructions on how to arrange to talk to an
immigration officer - but not by telephone.
Pity General Motors employees in Missouri if they cannot get to work on
time. After ploughing through three sets of voice mail choices they reach a
recording: 'Please indicate the reason for being late or absent. Press 'One'
for personal illness; press 'Two' if this is a family-related illness;
'Three' for car trouble; 'Four' for personal business; 'Five' if you've
overslept; 'Six' if this is court-related; 'Seven' if death related; 'Eight'
if weather related.' But what if it is plumbing related, or just not related
to any of the options given? 'You will NOT be switched to an operator,' the
recording warns sternly.
Nevertheless, there are steps you can take to avoid 'voice mail jail'. Most
systems give you a chance to listen again to lists of options. Choose
carefully. If you decide that you have gone off track and are not likely to
reach the right party or their designate, hang up and start again.
Back-tracking is almost impossible.
The best systems always give you a chance to press 'Zero' for an operator.
If you are not sure who you need to reach or cannot fathom how to use the
voice mail system this is the best option.

FT  24 SEP 92 / US bank shuns Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL BANK, the third-largest bank in the US, yesterday announced plans
to move its European headquarters to Alban Gate in the City of London
instead of Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project in London's Docklands.
The decision is a further blow to the viability of Canary Wharf, the project
developed by Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian company that has sought protection
from its creditors.
Canary Wharf has already been damaged earlier this month by the loss of
American Express, another prominent tenant.
The US bank's move greatly benefits Alban Gate, another conspicuous new
building that has struggled to find tenants since its completion.
The large, high-profile building in London Wall, designed by Terry Farrell,
was developed by MEPC, Britain's second-biggest property company.
Chemical Bank has withdrawn from Canary Wharf, where it agreed to let about
200,000 sq ft of space, because of the project's 'inability to perform' on
incentives once it went into receivership.
The lease was signed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust before it merged with
Chemical Bank last year.
Alban Gate will be used for the bank's trading-based and corporate finance
businesses, currently housed in buildings in the Adelphi and the Strand.
Chemical Bank's agreement to rent 164,000 sq ft is one of the largest office
lettings in the City in recent years.
The terms of the deal were confidential, although MEPC said that the 25-year
lease had break clauses - which allow a tenant to move out - next August and
at the end of the 5th and 15th years, subject to penalties.
The insistence on a break clause of less that one year is highly unusual.
MEPC believes it is unlikely to be exercised, since the bank will spend more
than Pounds 20m in fitting out its premises, starting in December.
MEPC said it hoped it could announce further agreements soon regarding the
173,000 sq ft of space that still remains to be let.
The letting of half the vacant space in Alban Gate resulted in a sharp rise
in MEPC's share price, which closed 13p up at 252p.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Councils warn on budget cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of local authorities yesterday renewed threats of wide-scale
redundancies to come if next year's grant settlement is, as expected, capped
at the rate of inflation or below and councils are not allowed to spend
their capital reserves.
The threats were given substance by an announcement by Sheffield City
Council that deep cuts, necessitating up to 800 redundancies, would be
needed to balance the ciy's budget.
Sheffield needs to save about Pounds 7.25m to keep spending down to about
Pounds 400m. The council's Labour leadership yesterday rejected suggestions
that it had deliberately overbudgeted, hoping to be rescued by a Labour
victory in the general election, but said that government limits for
continuing a normal range of services were too tight.
The city employs about 27,000 people, equivalent to 25,000 full-timers. Its
management standards have in the past been commended by the District
Auditor, the government's local watchdog on public spending.
The cuts package will be put to a council meeting on Monday. About 150 jobs
will go across all departments, plus 225 in works, cleansing and cleaning.
Some public toilets will be closed. Other cuts will affect book purchases by
libraries, council house maintenance and school clothing grants to parents
in need.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, urged ministers to allow local authorities to
spend accumulated capital receipts to boost employment.
He said: 'English councils have about Pounds 7.2bn of accumulated capital
receipts, largely from the sale of council homes. But we can spend about
Pounds 700m of this because of government dogma that use of such receipts
increases the public-sector borrowing requirement.'
Local authorities are particularly concerned at shortfalls in funding for
community care of the elderly and disabled, for which councils will take
responsibility next April.

UNIONS yesterday attacked British Rail's plans to cut staff at most

would increase.
Leaders of the RMT and TSSA rail unions said information leaked by senior BR

fully staffed within the next five years, as costs were cut ahead of
privatisation. BR dismissed the unions' claims as 'probably highly

However, both sides last night made clear they regard as groundless rumours

FT  24 SEP 92 / Major to meet Irish PM on future of Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN URGENT meeting is to be held between the British and Irish prime
ministers in London tomorrow after three days of talks in Dublin on Northern
Ireland's political future, and a week of pressure on the Irish punt
triggered by sterling's departure from the ERM.
The Dublin talks, which were boycotted by the Democratic Unionist party
(DUP), appear to have made only limited progress.
Differences have emerged between the British and Irish governments over the
sensitive issue of finding a date for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish
conference.
Five hours of talks on Tuesday night between the two government delegations
failed to produce a date, which had been tentatively pencilled in for next
Monday. The two unionist parties object to any further meetings of the
conference, held under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, while
the present round-table talks are in progress. There is concern that the DUP
might use a new conference meeting as an excuse to abandon the round-table
talks.
The Irish government is anxious that the agreement should not be undermined
by further postponements of the conference, which gives it some, albeit
limited, influence in Ulster's affairs. There have been two postponements
since July and it has been five months since the last conference meeting. Mr
Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is apparently seeking an
'immutable' date to be fixed.
The complex three-strand round-table talks are scheduled to resume in
Belfast next Wednesday.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the deputy leader of the Official Unionist party, described
this week's Dublin round of talks as 'satisfactory'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'There is a lot of
work to be done. It is a slow process . . . but I am heartened by the
progress that has been made here.'
Although Ulster will be high on the prime minister's agenda tomorrow, they
will also discuss the ERM crisis.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUILDING society mortgage which is probably the first at a five-year fixed
rate of 8.25 per cent was offered yesterday by National &amp; Provincial, the
seventh-largest society, as more medium-sized mortgage lenders broke ranks
and cut interest rates.
National &amp; Provincial cut its variable mortgage rate for new borrowers to
9.99 per cent.
Northern Rock, one of the two societies that reduced rates on Tuesday, came
into the market with a mortgage with interest fixed at 8.99 per cent for two
years.
The new norm for variable-interest-rate mortgages is emerging at around 9.99
per cent. Societies have kept some of the benefit of the base rate cut and
are likely to widen the margin between lending rates and rates to investors.
Royal Bank of Scotland cut its mortgage rate for new borrowers from 10.7 per
cent to 9.95 per cent. Existing customers do not benefit yet.
Skipton, which raised its mortgage interest rate for existing customers to
11.25 per cent in August, said it was cutting it to 10.25 per cent. The same
rate will apply to new borrowers from October 19.
Midland Bank cut its mortgage rate for new borrowers from 10.7 per cent to
9.95 per cent. Rates for existing borrowers will change on October 23.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Health fees criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDICAL consultants can earn six times their National Health Service salary
by carrying out equivalent work in the private sector, a study by Laing and
Buisson, health care consultants, said yesterday.
The analysis, sponsored by Norwich Union Healthcare, one of the UK's largest
private health insurers, concluded that private specialists' fees were
substantially above 'necessary' levels and had risen sharply in the past few
years.
It estimates that 12,000 of Britain's 19,000 NHS consultants conduct private
work, and that on average such specialists will earn about Pounds 95,000
this year.
Consultants' net income from private practice as a proportion of total
earnings including that from the NHS has risen from 15 per cent in 1975 to
31 per cent in 1990.
The report says a specialist occupied full-time in private practice charging
at limits set by Bupa, the health insurer, would earn Pounds 300,000-Pounds
340,000.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced an inquiry this month into
fees charged by consultants.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Patients' Charter 'not up to its job'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Consumer Council, a government-funded watchdog, says in a
report published today that the Patient's Charter is inadequate and needs
strengthening. The charter is at the heart of government plans to improve
the National Health Service, but the council says patients were not
consulted when it was compiled.
The council calls for additional rights for patients with independent
inspection to monitor performance, and makes several complaints about the
charter:
It says the government has watered down the promise in the Citizen's Charter
to provide 'good quality care' - the Patient's Charter makes no reference to
quality.
Basic rights are left out - for example to choose a doctor or hospital.
The views of patients are ignored in setting and monitoring standards.
The only measurable standards in the charter are limited to waiting times,
for example, for an ambulance or for treatment once diagnosed. Other
standards should be set, the council says.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Smiths Industries buys medical group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS INDUSTRIES, the UK-based aerospace electronics, medical systems and
specialised industrial components group, is buying Intertech Resources, a
privately held US disposable medical products company, for Dollars 110m
(Pounds 64.3m).
Smiths' share price fell 6p to close at 308p.
The cash purchase, which includes the assumption of Dollars 18m debt, will
significantly expand Smiths' existing medical products business, while also
adding to the group's US operations. Smiths' is one of the world's leading
suppliers of disposable medical products and has significant market shares
in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Intertech is a large supplier of 'single-use' anaesthesia and respiratory
devices used in surgery and intensive care. It reported an operating profit
of Dollars 8m before interest of Dollars 1.6m on sales of Dollars 43.5m in
the year to June 30. It ended the period with assets of Dollars 24.4m.
Commenting on the acquisition Mr Roger Hurn, Smiths' chairman, said:
'Intertech is a strong company with highly respected brands. I expect the
company to make an early contribution to profits after financing costs.'
Smiths, which had net cash of Pounds 95m at the beginning of February, had
been expected to continue diversifying from defence and civil aerospace. Mr
Hurn hinted at an acquisition in April when he told analysts that the
group's management was ready for 'a major challenge'.
Intertech employs 450 people. Its headquarters are in Chicago, but its main
operations are in Fort Myers, Florida. Almost 90 per cent of its sales are
derived from its own production and its products are sold in the US
healthcare market directly and through distributors.
The acquisition, subject to US anti-trust clearance, will boost Smiths'
growing Medical Systems division which had sales of Pounds 125.3m in the
1990-91 financial year. In the latest six-month period to February 1 the
division accounted for 31 per cent of the group's Pounds 37.8m trading
profits and 21 per cent of its Pounds 307.4m half-year turnover.
The US company will join Smiths' existing medical operations in North
America which include disposable devices for intensive therapy, blood gas
sampling kits, and monitors for body temperature.

FT  24 SEP 92 / KIO to inject Dollars 1bn into Spanish industrial empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) announced yesterday in Madrid that it is
to pump Dollars 1bn into its troubled industrial empire in Spain and convert
Dollars 1.4bn of debt at its Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, into
capital.
The KIO holdings in Spain, including the large Ebro foods group, the Torras
Papel paper group, the large property developer Prima Inmobilaria and the
chemicals group, Ercros, have been troubled since June, when the new
management at the KIO decided to stop a flow of funds into the companies.
Ercros is in receivership.
The Kuwait Investment Office said yesterday that Torras Papel would receive
about Dollars 400m by the end of the year as part of the rescue plan, but it
said that Prima's precarious financial situation would have to be resolved
in conjunction with its creditors, raising fears that the company could yet
go into receivership as well.
Prima has gross debts of around Dollars 700m, while Ebro is fundamentally
sound.
The KIO made no mention of Ercros but is believed to be trying to revive
talks which could result in the group's disastrous fertiliser businesses
being taken over by Freeport MacMoran of the US.
A fresh injection of capital into the group was first urged late last year
by KPMG Peat Marwick, KIO's auditors.
However, the new management has until now been deeply suspicious of the
decisions and recommendations that were made under the agency's former
leadership.
The KIO now appears to have decided that the bulk of the Spanish investments
made over the past six years are worth saving.
The Kuwaiti government is believed to have been directly responsible for
triggering the collapse of Ercros, and a credit crisis at Prima Inmobilaria,
by cutting short a transfer of funds for 1992 to the Spanish industrial and
property assets of the KIO. The KIO is believed to have passed Dollars 700m
to Grupo Torras, its Spanish holding company.
However, the transfers were not considered as fresh capital by the Kuwaiti
authorities and the Finance Ministry, over-riding the Kuwait Investment
Authority, the KIO's governing body, decided they should be stopped or
dramatically curtailed.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Sugar may buy rest of Amstrad's shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Sugar, founder and chief executive of Amstrad, the consumer
electronics and computer company, is considering buying the shares in the
company which he does not currently own, the company said yesterday.
The announcement followed speculation in the City that Amstrad would be
taken private again after the company's shares, which had been languishing,
rose strongly for no apparent reason.
Amstrad said Mr Sugar, who is the single largest shareholder with 35.4 per
cent of the shares, was looking into the possibility of buying the remaining
issued ordinary shares which he does not own at 30p a share, subject to the
availability of financing.
The news, which did not come as a complete surprise, was received fairly
positively in the City and Amstrad's shares rose 3p to 28p.
There had been speculation for months that Mr Sugar might want to take
Amstrad private again. The consensus among analysts was that at its current
price, Amstrad was so cheap it must have looked a good opportunity to Mr
Sugar.
The company has seen its share price fall from a peak of 233p in 1988 to 20p
last week. The share price stands at about half the asset value, estimated
at about 45p per share.
Analysts say going private would make it easier for the company to carry out
the drastic restructuring that may be needed to turn the company around.
Although the offer of 30p a share is unlikely to look attractive to many
shareholders, they may not have much choice, says Mr Patrick Wellington,
industry analyst at County NatWest.
If a buy-out is attempted and fails, they would have a disappointed
potential buyer as a chairman, he added.
Amstrad, which will announce final results for the year to June 30 a week
from Friday, is expected to report a loss of between Pounds 65m and Pounds
75m.
Analysts expect the dividend to be cut from 1.3p last year to 0.53p, if not
passed altogether, and there is little hope of a return to profits in the
near term. Under those circumstances, '30p may not be so bad after all,' Mr
Wellington said.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Barratt back in the black at Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LAWRIE Barratt, who 14 months ago came out of retirement to rescue
Barratt Developments, Britain's third largest housebuilder, yesterday
announced that the group had turned a Pounds 105.9m loss into a Pounds 11.3m
pre-tax profit during the 12 months to the end of June.
The turnround occurred in spite of extremely difficult trading conditions,
said the Barratt chairman. Sir Lawrie appealed to the UK prime minister to
cut base interest rates to 6 per cent, end stamp duty on house sales, raise
the ceiling for mortgage tax relief and provide capital allowances to
encourage the private rented market.
Barratt's share price rose almost a third yesterday to 67p following the
announcement that the group was to pay a final dividend of 2p. Earnings per
share were 7.8p.
Sir Lawrie said the group had achieved its twin targets of returning to
profits and dividends and reducing gearing to below 50 per cent.
Net debt including off-balance sheet finance had fallen from Pounds 205m to
Pounds 71m over the 12 months cutting gearing from 120 per cent to 39 per
cent. This had been achieved largely through improved housekeeping, said Sir
Lawrie. Savings of almost Pounds 60m arose from reducing Barratt's stock of
unsold and part-exchange houses held for sale.
Sale and leaseback of show -homes had provided another Pounds 38m of
savings. The group had also benefited from Pounds 14m of commercial property
disposals.
The group said the return to profits had been achieved in spite of difficult
trading conditions in the UK and US housing markets.
The group, which builds homes in southern California, reduced its US losses
from Pounds 39m to Pounds 6.7m and expected to break even in the current
year after closing two of its three subsidiaries there.
In the UK the group sold 4,706 homes - 5 per cent fewer than the previous
year. Sir Lawrie said this was a creditable performance given that most of
Barratt's developments in southern England had been closed at the beginning
of the year.
Barratt made a further write-down of Pounds 6.1m against its UK housing
land. This compared with a write-down of Pounds 84m the previous year. Sir
Lawrie did not expect to make any further provisions as he believed that UK
house prices had stopped falling.

FT  24 SEP 92 / A new car industry set to rise in the east: The German
translation of the Japanese gospel of lean production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The air in Eisenach appears to encourage religious zeal. In the town where
Martin Luther first translated the Bible into German, the European motor
industry is now trying to translate the gospel of Japanese lean production
into German.
Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, yesterday
officially opened its DM1bn, (Pounds 400m) assembly plant where less than
two years ago the east German motor industry was building antiquated
Wartburgs.
For GM, the Eisenach plant is a chance to demonstrate that on a greenfield
site in Europe it can achieve the high quality, productivity and efficiency
of the Japanese 'transplants' set up by Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK,
and which have already sprung up across North America in the last decade.
For the hard-pressed German government it is a chance to show that
reunification can lead to the rapid regeneration of east German industry.
Yesterday was an occasion for proclamations of faith, both in the industrial
re-birth of east Germany and of GM.
'Today we must say 'Go east], young man, go east',' declared Mr Jack Smith,
GM president, yesterday. In North America the GM president plans to close 21
plants by the mid-1990s, but in Europe GM needs new capacity to respond to a
market that has reached record sales levels for seven successive years.
In terms of sales volumes the boldness of the GM vision - the speed of
execution in Europe contrasts vividly with the picture of GM's lumbering
bureaucracy in North America - has already been rewarded. In eastern Germany
Opel has emerged as the number one make ahead of Volkswagen.
Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, came to Eisenach for the first time
on January 8, 1990, and is the driving force behind GM's push into east
Germany.
GM may need the extra volumes offered by Eisenach, but Mr Hughes insists,
'We have only one interest and that is to make sure that the lean production
process is in place in all its purity, regardless of volume. We could have a
fast start-up and not have the process in place, but we are not going to
sacrifice the process.'
He clearly thinks that Eisenach can act as a catalyst for Opel's huge and
expensive west German operations. GM Europe has brought together a small
management team of like-minded believers, who have long experience either of
GM's North American joint ventures with Toyota (Nummi) and with Suzuki
(Cami), or who have been drawn directly from Toyota in the US.
'We call them advisers,' says Mr Hughes, 'but in another sense they are more
like missionaries - and we are in need of conversion. It is close to
religion, it is a life philosophy, it is that different'.
He says: 'It needs a complete change of thinking. Under mass production the
individual was subordinated to the machine. The manpower was paced to the
pace of the machines. In lean production the machines are paced to the men.
Lean production is oriented towards people, while mass production is
oriented to capital and equipment.
'The mass production of Henry Ford has no future. Lean production is the
second great industrial revolution, after the invention of the assembly
line.'
According to Mr Hughes, GM has already tried elements of lean production in
pilot projects at European plants, from team working, to zero-defect
production strategies, just-in-time components delivery and continuous
improvement techniques.
'When you combine all the elements of people, materials, equipment and
systems, the results can be staggering. We would normally need much more
than 3,000 people to get the same capacity as Eisenach with 2,000 people.'
Mr Hughes says he is targeting Eisenach to operate at the level of the
Japanese transplants. 'We have reason to believe we will achieve this. We
would hope to be far more efficient than any of our European competition.'
Eisenach has been designed to produce two GM ranges, the Astra small family
car which started yesterday, but more importantly it will become the second
plant in Europe - along with Zaragoza in Spain - for production of GM's new
generation Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova, to be unveiled next year. Output should
eventually reach 150,000 cars a year.
For the moment GM has not only the advantage of a greenfield site and an
enthusiastic and young workforce eager to learn new working methods, but
also wage rates are 40 per cent of those at its Russelsheim plant, near
Frankfurt.
The gap is supposed to close somewhat in the next few years, but for the
moment the Eisenach workers receive no extra holiday pay, no 13th month of
salary and they work longer hours than their pampered colleagues in western
Germany - 40 hours a week versus 37 1/2 . They also receive only 24 days
holiday a year against 30 days in the west. The seeds of division and
tension are plain to see.
With 19 per cent official unemployment in Eisenach and as much as 43 per
cent unofficial unemployment in the Thuringen region, Mr Volkmar Jonik, a
34-year-old production supervisor, who joined Opel from the old Wartburg
plant, admits that many were euphoric to get the Opel jobs at Eisenach.
'We cannot have everything at once,' he says, but he admits tensions are
rising. 'We pay the same prices for many things, for petrol, for food, rents
are rising, but we only get half the pay.'
Last week Mr Louis Hughes took his GM Europe top executives on a
character-building course to the Swiss Alps. He managed to get them
abseiling together, but it remains to be seen whether he can scale the
automotive cliffs of a united but still socially divided Germany.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Lecturers face tight limit on pay: Patten tells universities
to improve productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday gave universities a sharp
warning that the expansion of student numbers will require tight limits on
lecturers' pay and the squeezing of more from existing resources.
'Any irresponsible increases in pay would lead not to an increase in
exchequer grant but to a loss of jobs,' he told vice-chancellors at their
annual meeting in Exeter. He added: 'The only prudent basis for an increase
in pay therefore is improvement in productivity and performance . . . I hope
there will be maximum scope for individual institutions to settle the pay of
their own staff locally within the resources available to them.'
After his action in overriding the vice-chancellors' 7 per cent pay offer to
lecturers earlier this year, Mr Patten's warning is tantamount to an
instruction. He said there was 'no other way' than continued efficiency
gains to ensure expansion towards the government's target of one in three
18-year-olds proceeding to higher education by the year 2000.
Mr Patten also urged vice-chancellors to give students with vocational
qualifications - particularly the General National Vocational Qualifications
being piloted this year - parity of treatment with A Level candidates in the
competition for places.
'The expectations of students will only be satisfied if higher education in
general is seen to be making a positive response,' he said, adding: 'Before
long it will not make sense to deal with higher-education entry on a basis
which presumes a standard A Level route.'
Mr Patten welcomed the decision of the Higher Education Funding Council for
England to review the organisation of the academic year.
Also addressing the vice-chancellors, Professor Graeme Davies, chief
executive of the funding council, reinforced the government's message on
efficiency. He said the funding council had asked Mr Patten to start
discussions with the Environment Department about planning restrictions that
limited expansion, and with the Treasury on the issue of universities using
premises as security for commercial loans. Universities are limited in their
capacity to use state-funded assets as security.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Concern for care of elderly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HERBERT LAMING, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate,
added his weight yesterday to growing concern about councils' lack of
readiness to shift care of the elderly and disabled into the community.
Presenting the inspectorate's first annual report, Mr Laming said he judged
that enough would have been done by next April to make the change work.
Nevertheless it would be some time before the full range of activities
planned for care in the community would be in place. He warned that most
local authorities 'have a great deal of hard work still to do, and a number
are seriously behind the timetable'. Monitoring exercises were planned to
identify those lagging behind and direct additional help to them.
Mr Laming reported that the inspectorate was strengthening its checking
after a series of scandals over the management of residential children's
homes. Proposals to involve lay people in the inspection process would soon
be published.
The inspectorate has been working with the national training council for
social workers to help unqualified heads of local-authority children's homes
to achieve a professional qualification.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Sea change in industry turns tide for unions: Old-style pay
bargaining is declining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE latest Workplace Industrial Relations Survey
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the most comprehensive of its kind - will seem old hat to close observers of
UK industrial relations, but still contains a fair number of surprises.
It concludes that the UK's distinctive 'system' of industrial relations,
based on adversarial collective bargaining, no longer characterises 'the
economy as a whole'. Where it persists, institutional change has been
slight, and no new pattern of industrial relations has emerged in the
non-union sector.
The survey is sponsored by the Department of Employment, the Economic and
Social Research Council, the Policy Studies Institute and Acas, the
conciliation service.
The 1990 survey, published today, finds fewer union members, fewer employees
covered by collective bargaining, fewer shop stewards, fewer closed shops
and fewer strikes than in the 1980 and 1984 surveys.
The 1984 survey, published in 1986, caused some surprise because it found
that the Thatcherite revolution, then in full swing, had had relatively
little effect. The 1990 survey confirms that union power has declined, but
not disappeared.
The authors say changes in industrial relations law were only one cause of
the sea change in industrial relations. In the 1980s the nature of the
workplace was changing. There were far fewer big manufacturing plants, less
manual work, a smaller public sector and a growing service sector.
Least change has been recorded in public-sector workplaces, which are much
more likely to be unionised, more likely to have national-level bargaining
with several unions, and much more likely to experience strikes.
Private manufacturing has the 'model' profile, with fewest strikes, the
highest incidence of merit-based pay, and - where unions are recognised -
the highest number of single-unit bargaining groups.
The survey is based on 5,000 interviews with managers and employee
representatives at 2,000 workplaces, together employing more than 1m people.
It starts with the chronicle of decline.
Union density - the proportion of union members in the national workforce -
fell from 58 per cent in 1984 to 48 per cent in 1990. The survey excludes
workplaces with fewer than 25 employees, so it probably overstates union
density, and similar indices, perhaps by 10 percentage points.
Density is down from 66 per cent to 53 per cent among manual workers and
from 51 per cent to 43 per cent among non-manual workers. The newest plants
show a slight increase in union density over the early 1980s, so the
high-water mark of 'macho management' may have passed.
The proportion of workplaces with 100 per cent unionisation has declined
from 18 per cent to 13 per cent - partly because of the collapse of the
closed shop, which now covers an estimated 4 per cent of manual workers.
The index of union recognition for collective bargaining on pay has dropped
from 66 per cent to 53 per cent of workplaces, with engineering (down from a
half to a third of plants) and printing and publishing (from more than three
quarters to less than half) the most affected.
The proportion of employees covered by collective bargaining has fallen from
71 per cent to 54 per cent - 8.4m workers out of the sample of 15.3m.
It is hard to say how much of the fall-off in collective bargaining is due
to derecognition. One part of the survey says that only 3 per cent of
workplaces derecognised unions between 1984 and 1990, but a separate panel
found the figure to be 9 per cent.
Although the reach of traditional collective bargaining has been reduced,
its form is surprisingly unchanged. Multi-unionism still predominates, with
an average of 2.5 unions to each workplace, and a third of public-sector
workplaces with four unions or more.
Against that, more than half of private-sector workplaces have just one
bargaining unit. The average number of bargaining units in the public sector
is 2.5.
Only 10 per cent of workplaces experienced strike action in 1990, compared
with 19 per cent in 1984 - the figure in the public sector was 25 per cent,
concentrated in local government and higher education, while the
private-sector figure was 3 per cent.
About a third of strikes were likely to involve picketing, considerably more
than in 1984. The main cause of strikes remained disputes over pay.
Pay bargaining at workplace level has become the most common form of
bargaining in private manufacturing. The most common bargaining level is
still multi-employer, national bargaining, covering 26 per cent of
workplaces. Single-employer bargaining covers 15 per cent of workplaces and
plant bargaining 5 per cent.
The most important influence on pay settlements is still the Retail Prices
Index, but there is now more merit-related pay, which covers some employees
in 45 per cent of workplaces - 31 per cent in the public sector, 66 per cent
in private manufacturing.
Forty per cent of workplaces have profit sharing and 32 per cent employee
share schemes. About 27 per cent of workplaces, especially those with mainly
women workers, paid low pay - below Pounds 3.28 an hour.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Steward complains of change in status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL July, Mr Roger Weston was paid by Royal Mail to negotiate full-time on
behalf of about 2,000 members of the UCW postal workers' union in and around
Reading.
Now he drives a van, delivering parcels, and spends only 12 hours a week on
the problems of about 180 colleagues in the delivery section of his depot.
The decline of the full-time shop steward is one aspect of the shrinking
influence of unions, highlighted in the Workplace Industrial Relations
Survey.
Previously, as a full-time UCW branch official, Mr Weston was responsible
for sorting out a host of matters - from disciplinary issues to
disagreements over rotas - on behalf of all three Royal Mail sections in his
area.
This year the UCW and Royal Mail concluded an industrial-relations agreement
that included a revised framework for negotiating at local level. It
provoked a restructuring of the union's branches, with the relationship
between the union and the employer forged at the workplace level rather than
at branch level.
'My responsibilities are the same and I still have use of an office and a
telephone but my role has been diminished,' says 46-year-old Mr Weston, who
held his full-time post for six years. 'The men still treat me as the old
Roger Weston, but my status has changed among the managers.
'For example, they tended to ask me before they made any radical changes to
shift patterns. Now it's more individuals coming to me to say that their
shifts have been changed and can I sort it out for them.'
Mr Weston believes one of the reasons that Royal Mail had such good
industrial relations was that full-time officials took the time to resolve
difficulties as they arose.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Tec to subsidise company pay bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council is to offer small
manufacturing companies a wage subsidy to help them retain employees.
The scheme, announced yesterday, is believed to be the first time any of the
82 Tecs - which administer government training schemes in England and Wales
 -has offered to help companies to meet their wage bills.
Ms Joy Street, South Derbyshire TEC chief executive, said: 'In many cases,
firms are having to let people go in order to cut costs when they need the
same people to help pull them clear from recession.
'For example, a manufacturing company with 20 employees which because of the
current conditions is considering shedding three jobs could receive a
subsidy of up to Pounds 25 per week per job for six months.'
Tecs have a limited budget for local initiatives, although most of their
resources are devoted to paying for Employment Training and Youth Training.
Costs of the South Derbyshire scheme will be met from the Tec's reserves.
Officials said detailed qualification criteria for the new scheme had still
to be worked out.
Contact was being made with banks and accountants to obtain lists of
companies requiring help.

FT  24 SEP 92 / IMF to support Brazilian debt revision with commercial banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, ROBERT PESTON and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON,, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund plans to provide a letter of support to a
debt restructuring agreement by Brazil and its commercial bank creditors,
even though the government is out of compliance with an IMF stand-by loan
programme.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, has indicated to Brazilian
officials that he would provide a positive letter in support of the
agreement when it is offered to banks, probably later this year.
This is unlikely to be sufficient, however, to satisfy the banks unless the
government returns to compliance with the IMF. It failed to meet first and
second quarter targets under the fund agreement which it entered in January.
Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman of Chase Manhattan bank of the US, which has
Dollars 1.07bn (Pounds 620m) of loans outstanding to Brazil, said Brazil's
failure to meet IMF conditions for the management of its economy would
constitute a serious obstacle to completion of the debt deal.
However, he added that the debt agreement was 'far from academic', despite
the corruption scandal surrounding Brazilian President Fernando Collor. Mr
Labrecque said Brazil's bank creditors are hopeful that any change in the
government would not be too disruptive.
A detailed agreement was reached this week by negotiators for the government
and the banks. That must now be translated into Portuguese and approved by
the Brazilian Senate before it can be offered to all Brazil's bank
creditors. This will take more than a month, even if the decision is not
held up by the corruption scandal involving Mr Collor.
In Braslia last night, the nine judges of Brazil's Supreme Court ruled,
during a nationally televised session, that the forthcoming vote in Congress
on whether it shall hold an impeachment process against Mr Collor is to be
open, and that it is to take place early next week as originally scheduled
by the chairman of the House of Representatives.
Mr Collor was believed to have more chance of survival if the vote were
secret, and if it were delayed until after the municipal elections of
October 3, thus giving him more time to present his defence and to rally
support in the House. A two-thirds majority there is required to start such
a process against the president.
An extraordinary session of Congress was called for last night so that the
special commission on impeachment could discuss Mr Collor's defence papers,
filed on Tuesday night. These make no attempt to exonerate the president,
but criticise the Congressional inquiry on the corruption scandal and - in a
bid to win more time - demand that 20 witnesses be called.
An agreement by the Argentine government and its leading bank creditors,
announced yesterday, should allow signature of a debt restructuring accord
by the end of next month, a senior banker said yesterday. It commits banks
to take at least 35 per cent of discount bonds offered under the
restructuring, the less attractive to most banks of the two types of bonds
on offer.
'The attitude of many banks is that they want to have the deal completed as
soon as possible,' said Mr William Rhodes, Citicorp vice-chairman.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Britain ahead in OECD student survival league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN, with one of industrialised world's lowest proportion of
18-year-olds going to universities - put at 15 per cent in 1988 - has the
highest rate of student survival with 94 per cent finishing their courses.
Figures released yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) show that Japanese and German students survive almost as
well with a far higher proportion entering universities at 25 per cent and
20 per cent respectively.
'In general, there is apparently only a weak relationship between the number
of students entering the university system and the proportion eventually
graduating,' conclude the OECD.
Barely half of French and Spanish students starting degree courses completed
them, while among Italians the proportion fell to under a third.
University spending in the developed world ranged in 1988 from Dollars 1,300
to Dollars 5,700 per student. Lowest spending is in Ireland, Portugal and
Spain, and the highest in Sweden, Luxembourg and Norway.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Environmental groups invited to OECD talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENT campaigners from across the industrial world meet OECD officials
in Paris today in what many regard as a last ditch bid to get the Uruguay
Round of talks on world trade liberalisation to take proper account of their
environmental priorities.
In an unprecedented move, the OECD has invited three environmental lobby
groups from each of its 24 member countries for two days of private meetings
with government delegations on its Trade and Environment Committees. UK
environmentalists will be represented by campaigners from Greenpeace, the
Worldwide Fund for Nature, and Safe, a consumer group.
The gesture provides belated recognition of the influence of environmental
groups, particularly in the US. It also implies recognition of
environmentalists' calls for curbs on unfettered free trade.
The meeting follows private consultations last week by officials at the
Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) with a number of
environmental groups.
The draft Uruguay Round agreement, stalled for a year by disagreements
between the US and the EC over reform of farm trade, takes no account of
environmental issues.
Negotiators acknowledge that trade policies can have potent environmental
implications, but have argued consistently that the Uruguay Round agreement
would be indefinitely stalled if they attempted at this late stage to bring
such issues on board. The environment along with competition policy are set
to be the two principal 'post-Uruguay Round' issues.
Lobbyists have argued that environmental problems linked with present
international trade rules are so pressing that they cannot be deferred until
after the Uruguay Round is completed.
The issues of most pressing concern over the next two days are expected to
be:
A challenge to the 'holy grail' of trade economists that falling trade
barriers lead automatically to growth, which in turn leads to a better
environment.
The right of governments in environmentally 'progressive' countries to take
unilateral measures forcing higher standards on trading partners. Trade
officials, and a number of third world governments, see this as
'eco-imperialism'.
The right of governments to bar imports manufactured by processes not
regarded as environmentally sound. The enforcement of environmental
standards as minimum requirements, rather than ceilings to be aimed for.
Environmental campaigners will be pressing for the Multilateral Trade
Organisation, which the Uruguay Round proposes to set up as a powerful body
to police international trade, should go beyond a commitment to seek
'sustainable development', to giving environmental aims at least equal
priority to trade objectives by means of 'environmental impact assessments'.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Israelis optimistic over US aid packages: Military
co-operation and ratification of Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees look likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL is confident of securing two substantial economic and military aid
packages from the US in the next two weeks which would consolidate its
position as the biggest recipient of US foreign assistance.
Congressional ratification of Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees - attached to
the 1993 fiscal year foreign aid bill which includes Dollars 3bn in direct
economic and military grants for Israel - is expected by October 1.
Israeli defence officials are meanwhile negotiating a military co-operation
package with the Pentagon aimed at retaining Israel's technological edge
over its Arab neighbours and which is likely to include a US commitment to
preposition military equipment in the country. The talks follow the Bush
administration's decision to sell up to 72 advanced F-15 fighters to Saudi
Arabia.
Israel and its supporters in the US see the military talks as evidence that
the US-Israel relationship, frayed last year by political differences
between the Bush administration and Mr Yitzhak Shamir's Likud government,
has been fully restored since Mr Yitzhak Rabin's election as prime minister
last June.
Israel and its backers reject suggestions that the extra aid has been
provided to help Mr Bush recoup support among American Jewish voters before
the November presidential election. 'They signify a fundamental
understanding of Israel's needs, not just election politics,' said one
lobbyist.
Policy analysts in Washington agree the underlying relationship with Israel
is strong. Although its Cold War role of bulwark against Soviet influence in
the Middle East has gone, they say the US values strategic and political
co-operation with Israel in what remains an unstable region. But there are
signals in the US that the historically high levels of financial assistance
to Israel may be threatened by Washington's general budgetary pressures.
One American participant in a recent seminar for senior US and Israeli
policymakers said: 'There were stark messages for Israel. The (US)
willingness to regard the aid to Israel as an entitlement has disappeared.
It is too attractive a target not to be hit over time.'
But Israel will not feel the squeeze for the next year at least. The 1993
foreign aid bill includes Dollars 1.8bn in military aid and Dollars 1.2bn in
economic aid from total foreign aid spending of Dollars 13bn. These totals
are non-repayable grants paid up front, allowing Israel to earn interest on
them.
The loan guarantees provide the full amount requested by Israel to help it
absorb Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The US president can,
under the terms of the guarantees, subtract amounts spent on Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories. Other conditions are fairly loose,
including no specific requirements for structural reforms to Israel's
economy.
The US offered the total of Dollars 10bn - which is just Dollars 2bn short
of the total value of US-provided guarantees to all Arab countries in the
last five years - despite Israel's admission that a recent slowdown in the
rate of immigration means it may not need to borrow to the full total.
The guarantees enable Israel to borrow on preferential terms. Israeli
officials are pleased that the level of risk capital which must be set aside
in the US budget to underpin the guarantees was set at 4.5 per cent, not 7
per cent as originally proposed by US officials. Israel has agreed to pay
this amount.
The military co-operation deal under negotiation is expected to detail the
transfer of Dollars 700m in used US equipment to Israel and Dollars 200m in
pre-positioned US equipment.
The deal is likely to cover greater co-operation in both intelligence and
early warning, along with development of high-tech weaponry. Israel is also
seeking to spend more of its US military aid on domestically produced
weapons to bolster its hard-pressed military industries.

FT  24 SEP 92 / US seeks Gatt ruling in oilseed row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to rule
on how much the European Community must compensate trading partners for lost
exports due to EC subsidies on oilseeds.
The request for an arbitration panel, which will be considered by Gatt's
governing council on September 29, suggests the US wants a further breathing
space before unleashing its threatened trade sanctions against Dollars 1bn
worth of EC food and drink imports. Retaliation from Brussels would
precipitate a damaging trade war just when the two sides are hoping to
finalise a deal on farm trade, including oilseeds, within the Uruguay Round
of global trade talks.
Senior trade officials from the 'quad' countries - US, EC, Japan and Canada
 -met in Geneva yesterday to assess prospects for the round. Negotiators had
hoped for a deal in the 'window of opportunity' between the French
referendum on Maastricht and the US elections on November 3, unlocking the
round for completion early in 1993. This has now been clouded by the narrow
French Yes vote last Sunday and President Bush's poor showing in the opinion
polls.
If established, the Gatt panel would have 30 days to come up with a binding
estimate of lost oilseeds trade which would serve as the basis for EC
compensation or, failing accord, retaliation by trading partners.
The US says it and nine other producers of oilseeds, such as soyabeans,
sunflower seed and colza, are losing Dollars 2bn a year from lower sales in
the EC market. The EC has put the figure at no more than Dollars 400m.

<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT may decide next week whether or not to revive his abandoned
campaign for the US presidency, and on what basis.
The Texas billionaire, who said on Tuesday that he had made a mistake by
withdrawing from the race in July, has tentatively scheduled a meeting next
week with the heads of his volunteer movement in the various states. He says
he will take their advice. Several of them have publicly urged him to get
back into the contest.
Mr Perot also met privately on Tuesday Mr James Baker, who runs President
George Bush's campaign, and Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic
national committee. No report of either meeting has been forthcoming.
Perhaps the best insight into Mr Perot's thinking was provided in an
interview yesterday with the Washington Post by Mr James Squires, the former
Chicago newspaper editor who served as press secretary to Mr Perot's earlier
effort and is still on his payroll.
Mr Squires, who said he had spoken to Mr Perot several times over the
weekend, repeated that the latter wanted to continue to put pressure on Mr
Bush and on Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, to
come up with credible plans to cut the US budget deficit.
But, Mr Squires added: 'I don't think there is a chance in hell that Ross
Perot could ever endorse George Bush.' He could back Mr Clinton, if the
Democrat were to adopt some of Mr Perot's budget-cutting ideas, and he could
launch a limited campaign, confining himself to such states as Texas and
Florida, 'just to help Clinton,' Mr Squires believes.
Mr Perot insists he does not want to re-enter the race as 'a spoiler', and
he denies, as many suspect, that this renewed teasing of the political
process is mostly designed to satisfy his own ego.
Opinions are divided over the impact of his return, if any. It might
initially hurt Mr Clinton, because he was the principal beneficiary of the
July withdrawal, but hard-core Perot support is beyond dispute mostly
Republican.
In Florida and Texas, that support could, if energised, work to Mr Clinton's
favour; in the industrial Midwest, now leaning towards the Democrats, it
might cut the other way. In California, where Mr Perot was popular, Mr
Clinton now seems too far ahead to be threatened.
If he does return to the race, Mr Perot might claim a place at the televised
debates between the main candidates, assuming at least one takes place. The
Clinton and Bush campaigns continued yesterday to accuse each other of
conspiracy to prevent this confrontation.
But, if Mr Clinton's lead (21 points in the latest Washington Post/ABC
opinion poll) continues to hold up, the president may have no choice but to
accede to a debate.
However, the president's campaign, reflecting Mr Baker's thinking, continues
to maintain that Mr Clinton has most to gain by appearing on the same
platform as the president in a debate. It therefore rejected the latest
proposal by the independent commission in charge of the debates that one be
held at Louisville, Kentucky, next Tuesday with a single moderator rather
than a panel of questioners, as the Bush campaign wants.
The movement behind Mr Perot has at its hub the Perot Relations Committee,
constituted to put his name on all state ballots. According to the federal
election commission, Mr Perot has spent about Dollars 16m of his own money
on this effort - nearly Dollars 7m of that after his official withdrawal
from the race.
There is an almost complete absence of professional political advice and
polling in this volunteer organisation.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Ecuador halted by general strike

<TEXT>
A NATIONAL general strike yesterday brought Ecuador's economy to a
standstill, closed schools and led to violent street demonstrations, after
nearly three weeks of protests against the new government's economic
austerity measures.
The one-day strike, called by the United Workers' Front (FUT) to protest
against big price rises for basic goods and services, is the latest in a
series of obstacles to the economic reforms of the six-week-old
administration of President Sixto Duran Ballen.
Cities throughout Ecuador have experienced unrest as the protests rose. In
Guayaquil, the main port and the largest city, demonstrators looted shops,
burnt buses and battled police in the streets. In the capital, Quito,
workers rioted in front of the presidential palace as their leaders were
refused access to officials.
The government's attempt to shrink the public sector has also run into
resistance. State-employed doctors and nurses last week closed hospital
doors in protest at the government's reforms, paralysing medical services in
cities and leaving hundreds of patients on the streets. On Monday, the
judicial system was halted as court employees closed tribunals in response
to government initiatives on curbing corruption and inefficiency.
The government lacks political support for its economic reforms. The
National Assembly, where it has no majority, rejected the bill to require
civil servants to retire at the age of 65. It also refused the proposal for
a salary bonus intended to compensate workers for recent price rises.
Responding to the protests, Mr Duran on Friday announced that the price of
bottled gas, used in most Ecuadorean households, would be reduced by 20 per
cent. Mr Fabian Zurita, FUT director, rejected the reduction as a political
manoeuvre.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Privatisation plans delayed in Bolivia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIA'S privatisation programme is running into the sand amid allegations
of corruption, a lack of interest by potential investors and opposition from
unions and the military.
Launched in June by Mr Samuel Doria Medina, planning minister, the process
initially involved some 60 state-owned enterprises, to be sold at the rate
of one a week. This number has now been increased to about 100, including 14
hotels and 25 military-run corporations.
However, the sale of two La Paz hotels was cancelled this month by President
Jaime Paz Zamora after allegations of corruption and influence-peddling in
the auction process had emerged soon after the sealed bids were opened.
Another attempt to sell them will be made next month.
A few days before, the first stock market flotation of a state-run company -
Fanviplan, a glass-maker - had failed to attract a single bid.
Since then, six further attempts to sell the company have met no success.
Many said the company was over-priced, given that it was poorly equipped,
facing strong foreign competition and running well below capacity, like many
others in the first privatisation stage.
The government has also failed to find a foreign airline to take a stake in
the national carrier Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB). Spain's Iberia bid but
this was turned down by the government as 'inadequate'.
Mr Doria already faces strong trade union opposition to privatisation and,
if the government pursues its stated intention of selling the 25 enterprises
run by the military, hostility is expected from older members thereof.
But the minister is optimistic: 'In the next year, Bolivians are going to
see the positive side of privatisation, such as increased employment.'

HUNGARY and Poland have shelved plans for a central-east European free trade
zone with Czechoslovakia in favour of a separate bilateral agreement.
Mr Jozsef Antall and Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the Hungarian and Polish prime
ministers, decided yesterday in Budapest to press ahead alone with
liberalisation while the relationship between the Czech lands and Slovakia
remains unclear.
The two leaders said their goal was bilateral free trade from the start of
next year, followed only later by individual agreements with the two halves
of Czechoslovakia.
Hungary and Poland are treating the Visegrad grouping of central-east
European countries as a framework for bilateral agreements rather than as
the coherent economic bloc which had been envisaged.
The latest move leaves the Central European Co-operation Council, the
regional economic grouping launched in April, up in the air. One of the
CECCs first decisions was to press ahead with the formation of a free-trade
zone covering the three countries in the second half of this year.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is improving slowly and prices are generally stable aside
from a jump in lumber costs caused by Hurricane Andrew, the Federal Reserve
said in its latest national survey, Reuter reports from Washington.
'Economic activity has been improving slowly in most of the nation, but the
pace of recovery has been uneven across regions and sectors,' the survey by
the 12 Federal Reserve banks said. The report, known as the Beige Book, was
based on information gathered before September 15 and is the last one before
the November 3 presidential election, in which joblessness and economic
weakness are key voter concerns.
'Little upward pressure on prices has been evident, except for products such
as lumber and natural gas associated with storm-related damage,' the summary
said. Rebuilding after Hurricane Andrew would eventually stimulate economic
activity in Florida and Louisiana.
Retail sales were 'steady or slightly higher' in most regions, except for
lacklustre new-car sales. Manufacturing activity had weakened for cars,
aerospace and defence-related industries.
'In manufacturing outside these sectors, however, improvement is noted in
orders, production and sales.'
The survey found that the pace of new homebuilding was improving slowly,
particularly for low- and mid-priced homes, although commercial and other
non-residential construction was weak.
The Fed banks in Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Richmond, Va, said retail
sales in their regions had picked up in recent weeks. Merchants in Chicago
and New York also saw some sales growth for most consumer goods in August
and early September. But auto sales were weak.
The Chicago and Cleveland Fed districts said dealers there were cutting
orders below sales to keep inventories under control.

FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Porsche says Bohn is to leave
the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION about the future direction of Porsche, the troubled German
sports car manufacturer, intensified yesterday after the company announced
that Mr Arno Bohn would step down as chief executive at the end of the
month.
The Stuttgart-based company said Mr Bohn, 45, was leaving by mutual
agreement because of differences of opinion over business policy. His
successor will be Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, the 40-year-old main board director
responsible for production.
The move comes several months after a dispute between Mr Bohn and the
supervisory board. The board at first failed to confirm him in office, going
so far as to line up an outside successor. But in February it renewed his
contract for three years after he threatened to resign.
With sales down to less than half the level of the mid-1980s, the company is
struggling to find its way forward in the leaner 1990s. In the first half of
the year to July 31, pre-tax profits fell 97 per cent to DM2m (Pounds
780,000) on sales of DM1.1bn.
Analysts suggested that a possible explanation for Mr Bohn's departure was
that the company was heading towards a loss for the whole of 1992. Mr Bohn
forecast earlier this year that Porsche would make a profit in spite of dire
conditions in international markets for the group's cars and the likelihood
of a 25 per cent drop in sales to DM2.5bn.
His resignation could also be the inevitable result of the boardroom fracas
earlier this year, when the Porsche and Piech families which control the
company and dominate the supervisory board, made plain their lack of
confidence in Mr Bohn. Another is that his departure signals the end of the
company's independence, although there was no hint of a sale in yesterday's
statement. Some industry observers speculate that Mr Wiedeking might to be a
caretaker pending the sale of the company.

in first half
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, one of France's largest industrial companies, saw
net profits rise by a modest 2 per cent from FFr697m in the first half of
1991 to FFr711m (Dollars 139m) in the same period this year.
Lyonnaise has had problems with its Dumez construction interests following
the downturn in the European building industry. Dumez's difficulties were
chiefly responsible for a fall in the group's net profits from FFr1.4bn in
1990 to FFr1.17bn last year.
The construction sector remained depressed during the first half of this
year, producing a loss of FFr38m.
Lyonnaise was also burdened by a steep increase in financial charges from
FFr290m in the first six months of last year to FFr500m in the same period
of 1992.
However, the group's other interests fared reasonably well.
It succeeded in increasing sales by 14 per cent from FFr38.6bn to FFr44bn
and operating profits by 37 per cent from FFr803m to FFr1.1bn.
The company recently announced a rationalisation programme for Lyonnaise's
investments which will include selling its 3.9 per cent stake in Havas, a
leading French media group, and eventually ceding control of United
Westburne, its Canadian construction materials sub-sidiary.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-Signal, the industrial technology company in the throes of a major
restructuring, announced yesterday that it would be selling its 39 per cent
stake in Union Texas Petroleum in a public offering which is likely to raise
around Dollars 600m gross.
It will raise a further Dollars 355m through the cash redemption of Dollars
200m of preferred Union Texas shares and Dollars 155m of warrants. A
spokesman for Allied said the proceeds should translate into a pre-tax gain
of about Dollars 350m.
Mr Lawrence Bossidy, who took over as chairman of Allied in the summer of
1991, has made no secret of his desire to shed the company's oil and gas
interests as part of a slimming and refocusing of the high technology
conglomerate.
However, until now Allied had deemed the market for energy properties too
weak to justify a sale. The company said yesterday the proceeds would be
used to reduce debt, accelerate productivity improvements and for other
corporate purposes.
Costs associated with the productivity action might offset the gains from
the sale.
Union Texas is the second largest independent US oil company and is
particularly active in the UK and Indonesia.
It was acquired by Allied, then primarily a chemicals company, in 1962. In
1985 it went through a leveraged buy-out in which Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts,
the buy-out specialist, acquired a 50 per cent stake, and a public offering
followed in 1987.
A spokeswoman for KKR said yesterday it would be retaining its remaining 39
per cent equity stake, but would be redeeming Dollars 145m of warrants.
The Allied offer, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, is for
33.3m shares of common stock.

LAFARGE Coppee, the French company which is the world's largest construction
materials group, returned to profits growth in the first half of this year
with a modest increase in net profits of 1 per cent from FFr688m to FFr695m
(Dollars 136m).
Last year,Lafarge suffered a fall in profits, the first decline for eight
years, with net profits sliding from FFr2.19bn in 1990 to FFr1.23bn in 1991,
mainly because of the downturn in the group's US interests.
Lafarge managed to hold profits in the first six months of this year,
despite a decline in cement sales in France, where the construction industry
has been hit by the economic slowdown.
The group had earlier announced that its interim turnover was 1 per cent
down at FFr15.06bn. Earnings per share fell by 2 per cent from FFr13.7 in
the first half of last year to FFr13.4 in the same period this year.
Mr Bernard Collomb, chairman, recently announced that the group, which has
expanded aggressively by acquisition in recent years, would be reining in
its investments this year in order to try to restrain its net debt.
Salomon, the French ski and sports equipment maker, expects to see a rise in
profits, a 7 per cent increase in sales and a reduction in debt in 1992-93,
Reuter reports from Paris.
Salomon made a net profit of FFr66.3m in the year ended March 1992 on sales
of FFr3.01bn. The company said capital spending should be stable in the
1992-93 after FFr131m the year before.

FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rothschild Bank opens a new
account - Ian Rodger examines attempts to end a troubled decade in the
family business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British, French and Swiss Rothschild families who own Zurich-based
Rothschild Bank are hoping that an additional SFr150m (Dollars 115.30m) in
provisions, plus a new general manager, can bring an end to a very troubled
decade at the bank.
'We hope that this is a book that is now closed,' Sir Evelyn de Rothschild,
chairman of the bank, said yesterday.
Sir Evelyn said the latest provisions, which are in addition to the SFr100m
announced in July, arose entirely from loans made improperly by the bank to
companies associated with the two German-Canadian property financiers, Mr
Karsten von Wersebe and Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg.
In a statement this week, the bank recalled that 'the individual concerned
at the bank' had been arrested. Last month, Mr Jurg Heer, a former senior
executive of the Rothschild Bank, was arrested in Zurich for irregularities
involving several millions of Swiss francs, according to the Zurich
prosecutor.
Subsequently, it was confirmed that the bank had also infringed Swiss
Banking Commission regulations by lending more than the equivalent of 20 per
cent of its capital to companies related to Mr von Wersebe.
Rothschild Bank, like many in Switzerland, specialises in managing funds for
rich individuals and normally does not engage in lending.
If this were the only unseemly incident that the bank had suffered in recent
years, no one would be too concerned. But it is, in fact, the third in eight
years.
The last was in 1990, when Rothschild was retained by the US tobacco group
Philip Morris to advise it on its planned acquisition of Jacob Suchard.
Prior to news of this takeover being made public, the bank bought some
SFr11.8m worth of Suchard shares for its own account through a Panamanian
company.
Shortly after these purchases came to light, Mr Erwin Brunner, then the
bank's general manager, resigned and the bank donated its SFr2.3m in profits
from the position to charity. The Swiss authorities investigated the affair
but no charges for insider trading were filed.
In 1984, the bank made a SFr49.9m loan to Marc Rich, the Zug-based
international commodity dealers, secured by a first mortgage on a Rich
tanker. The Swiss Banking Commission, upheld by the Swiss Federal Court a
year later, decided that the loan was a fiction aimed at protecting the
tanker from confiscation by US tax authorities who then had a claim against
Mr Marc Rich. As such, the loan contravened Swiss banking law.
Even an official of the Swiss Banking Commission, which as a rule does not
comment on developments at individual banks, was prompted to observe a few
weeks ago that this constituted 'quite a list' of problems.
Sources familiar with the bank suggest that its difficulties stem from a low
level of supervision during much of the 1980s. This, in turn, reflected
tensions in the French and British wings of the Rothschild family. Until
1991, when a Swiss company controlled by the British family raised its stake
to 51 per cent, the bank was controlled by the French family represented by
the ageing Baron Elie de Rothschild, who was chairman.
Baron Elie hired Mr Alfred Hartmann, a former executive of Union Bank of
Switzerland and of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, the Basle-based pharmaceutical
group, as general manager in 1983. Mr Hartmann, who is still on the
Rothschild Bank board, was also a director of the collapsed Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
Mr Brunner took over as general manager at the beginning of 1989, but
following his resignation two years later a replacement was not found until
this week when the appointment of Mr Guy Wais, general manager of
Guyerzeller Bank in Zurich, was announced.
Sir Evelyn said he could not comment on the past. He pointed out that he
took over as chairman in July 1991 and shortly after discovered serious
problems.
He said no other bank executives would be leaving as a result of the latest
irregularities. He acknowledged that the bank had lost 'a very few'
customers as a result of the scandal, but said most were loyal and, he
hoped, satisfied with the service they were getting.
He said Mr Hartmann's continued presence on the board was 'a fair question
that has to be dealt with in due course'.
The bank's financial position remained sound and it was operating
profitably, Sir Evelyn said. When the first SFr100m of provisions were
declared, the bank liquidated its SFr63.5m in hidden reserves.
Responsibility for the loans involved in the latest SFr150m has been shifted
to a private Rothschild family company in Switzerland, leaving shareholders'
equity at the SFr204m level declared in the March, 1992 balance sheet.

14% on strong sales
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, raised operating profits by 14 per cent
to L689.7bn (Dollars 554m) in the first half of this year, due partly to a
12 per cent rise in sales to L10,601bn.
The company warned that Italy's slowing economic growth could hit earnings
and turnover this year. However, Mr Ernesto Pascale, chairman, 'promises to
maintain profitability at all events,' by maintaining productivity
improvements and investment spending.
The growth in calls had been particularly strong on long-distance traffic,
while SIP's highly profitable mobile communications activities continued
their surge, with a 59 per cent jump in subscribers. Subscriber growth for
all telephone services, which increased by 3.3 per cent in the first half,
was maintaining 1991 levels.
SIP said that forecasts for this year's earnings would be complicated by the
effect of the government's budgetary plans, which involve higher taxation
and a possible freeze on tariffs.
Elsag Bailey, the stock market-listed automation equipment subsidiary of the
state-owned Finmeccanica group, raised operating profits by 20 per cent to
L48bn in the first half of this year. The company predicts a year-end
turnover figure of around L1,400bn, which would be 11 per cent up on last
year's L1,258bn.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Costain omits interim after decline to
Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the construction group which is seeking to sell all or part of its
profitable Australian coal mining business, saw pre-tax profits more than
halve, from Pounds 5.7 to Pounds 2.5m, in the first half of 1992.
The group is passing its interim dividend (4.75p) after reporting losses per
share of 1.3p (earnings of 1p). Turnover fell from Pounds 651.2m to Pounds
586.9m.
Costain's share price slipped a further 2p to 27p.
The figures underlined the need for the group to raise cash to reduce its
borrowings which remain large despite the sale for Pounds 101m of its
commercial property portfolio at the end of last year.
The group revealed yesterday that it had been approached by several parties
interested in acquiring all of its Australian mining subsidiary. Previously
it had announced it would be selling a stake in the business which it
intended to float this year.
Group net debt at the end of June was Pounds 240m, including convertible
preference shares but excluding Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet borrowings
relating to the proposed Spitalfields office development in London.
If that debt is included, gearing at the end of June would have been more
than 100 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 276m at the year end.
The Australian coal mining business is estimated to be worth about Pounds
130m but this would assume a purchaser taking on the subsidiary's local
borrowings of about Pounds 40m.
A sale would substantially reduce gearing even if, as seems likely, the
group has to make further provisions on its UK housebuilding operations and
on its share of the troublesome Spitalfields development.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said yesterday that the group would be
considering what level of provisions, if any, it would need to make at the
year end.
He said that UK housing and construction markets remained deeply depressed.
Housing incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 2.6m against a Pounds 4.2m loss
last time. Construction and engineering profits fell from Pounds 14.8m to
Pounds 4.5m during the first half.
Mining profits were down from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 14.3m. Lower profits
from Australia offset improved productivity in the US, the group said.
COMMENT
Without Australia to sell, Costain would be in even deeper trouble. As it
is, a sale of the mining business could leave the group with gearing of
anywhere between 50 per cent and 70 per cent, depending upon how the cards
fall. The question then is what will the remaining businesses be worth. The
group, although it will retain a small housing operation selling about 400
homes a year, is not an obvious housing recovery play. Margins in UK
contracting are low at the best of times and at the moment are paper thin to
non-existent. US mining has promised much but still has deliver. On the plus
side the group is proving successful in overseas contracting where margins
traditionally are better. Meanwhile, property provisions this year could be
as high as Pounds 50m. There appears little reason to support the shares at
least until Australia is sold.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Geest shares fall following warning on
produce prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEEST, the fresh produce and prepared foods group, reported pre-tax profits
slightly ahead at Pounds 15.4m, compared with Pounds 15.1m, for the first
half of 1992.
However, a recent collapse in fresh produce prices led to a warning that
full year profits may be less than the Pounds 26.2m achieved in 1991.
The shares fell 36p to 302p.
A bumper crop of fresh fruit, excluding bananas, from the northern
hemisphere contributed to a dramatic fall in prices in July and August.
Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said: 'It is very tough now but it is
going to get worse.'
Imports and consumer demand for bananas rose during the period ensuring that
trading profits from the fresh fruit division edged up to Pounds 11.4m
(Pounds 11.3m).
Prepared foods increased trading profits to Pounds 3.71m (Pounds 3.22m). Mr
Sugden said the group had identified 'growing niches' to withstand the
recession.
Earnings per share advanced to 15.3p (15.1p). The interim dividend is
increased to 3.7p (3.6p).
COMMENT
The 9 per cent fall in Geest's share price had more to do with uncertainty
surrounding the total European Community banana volumes than to the price
deflation affecting fresh produce. However, the unprecedented 6 per cent
decline in the volume of fresh produce underlines the seriousness of the
problems over the next six months. Yet this should be put in prospective. If
the short-term is not looking so good the long-term looks considerably
better. Geest's penetration of the EC and dollar banana markets should
enable it to increase its banana sales by 60 per cent next year when the
quota of EC banana volumes is expected to fall by about 16 per cent to 3.3m
tonnes. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 25m, giving earnings per
share of 24.8p, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 12.1. In the
long-term they offer good value.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Greenwell Montagu absorbed in Hongkong Bank
rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES CAPEL, the investment house owned by Hongkong Bank, is to absorb the
private client stockbroking business of Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers with
the loss of up to 150 jobs.
The move, to take effect next January, is part of the rationalisation
following the merger of Hongkong Bank and Midland.
Mr Bernard Asher, director of HSBC Holdings, said Greenwell's business was
'substantial in revenue terms but not enough to make it profitable.' Putting
the two sides together would lead to 130-150 redundancies among Greenwell's
current 220 staff, he said.
The move will in effect mark the final demise of the once-proud name of
Greenwell, one of London's top brokers before Big Bang. The new business
will be known as 'James Capel, incorporating W Greenwell,' said Mr Asher -
in practice relegating the Greenwell name from view.
As part of the break-up of Greenwell, Smith Keen Cutler - a private client
broking part of the group based in Birmingham - is to be sold to Allied
Provincial, a stockbroker in which Capel owns 24 per cent. The smaller
company and corporate finance teams of Smith Keen Cutler is to join Capel.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Warburg closes its discount house side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG, the merchant banking group, is to close down the last vestiges
of its discount house operation at the end of this month, further reducing
the dwindling band of specialist intermediaries who play a pivotal role in
the London money markets.
Discount houses are the only institutions able to deal directly with the
Bank of England, making them an important link in the Bank's activities to
influence money market interest rates.
Warburg merged its discount house into its gilt-edged market making business
earlier this year, effectively cutting back its activities in the area, and
is now to close the business entirely.
The move was prompted by the decision to merge the money market activities
of Warburg Securities and SG Warburg, which has led to a review of the
business.
Warburg said the business employed only one front-line trader and was not
significant in the context of its main gilt-edged market making and money
market activities.
Other discount houses report that they have had a busy fortnight due to the
upheaval in financial markets. Sterling's departure from the European
exchange rate mechanism could prolong the life of London's discount market
if it slows down or prevents sterling's participation in European monetary
union.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Straying from the charted path / A look at
the background to Amstrad's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Amstrad became a public company in 1980, the UK was sliding into a
recession. Despite this, the company was able to beat its forecast and raise
profits by 50 per cent.
Twelve years later, as Mr Alan Sugar contemplates the possibility of taking
Amstrad private again, Britain is once more in the grip of a recession.
But this time Amstrad is about to report a loss that many expect to be worse
than the company has forecast, and it faces the prospect of further
retrenchment in one of its biggest and most successful businesses - the
personal computer market.
To some extent the reversal in the company's fortunes reflects the changes
in the markets in which it operates.
Consumer electronics and personal computers, two markets where Amstrad has
made its mark in Europe, have become so competitive that one bad mistake can
send even the leading players reeling.
But the company's problems are not simply a result of the turmoil in its
markets. 'Amstrad is not losing money just because of the recession,' as one
analyst put it.
The difficulties the company finds itself in are as much symptoms of a
creeping change in the way it operates. Amstrad has failed to follow its own
cardinal rules that laid the foundation for its extraordinary success in the
1980s.
Mr Sugar had built Amstrad from scratch into a company with a Pounds 600m
annual turnover by offering consumers product after product that were based
not on any technological breakthrough but on a brilliant grasp of what they
wanted.
In the late-1970s it was the Tower System which combined the amplifier,
tuner and cassette deck in one unit and brought the hi-fi set to the truck
driver and his wife, as Mr Sugar liked to say.
By the mid-1980s, Amstrad had moved on to personal computers and scored a
coup with its low cost, one-plug, all in one PCs. As one computer success
followed another and were joined by inexpensive facsimile machines, video
recorders and satellite dishes, the company's profits soared to a record
Pounds 160m in 1988 on turnover that peaked at Pounds 635m. Amstrad's share
price climbed to a high of 233p in August 1988.
While Mr Sugar steered Amstrad to the height of its glory with one hit after
another, he was always careful to ensure that the company moved out of its
markets as soon as the going got rough.
'We're a very profit-oriented company and the best way to make profits is to
be active in an area where no-one else is. And as soon as margins are
eroded, it's time to say Sayonara,' Mr Sugar once remarked.
As the company prepares to report a huge loss for the year, shareholders may
be forgiven for wondering if Mr Sugar has lost his knack for reading the
market.
The company has not had a big hit on the market for some time and the new
offerings it has lined up do not have the same sparkle as its earlier
products.
The cheap videophone and user-friendly notepad PC are fine ideas but the
videophones made by the big name manufacturers are not significantly more
expensive and everyone knows that prices will fall anyway within a few
years.
The problem facing Amstrad is perhaps not just that it cannot come up with
good ideas, but that the formula of selling easy-to-use electronics at low
prices is no longer its sole preserve.
That is where the company got stuck with the PC market. Having plunged into
the business, Amstrad was clobbered when it was slow in moving old products
and introducing new ones.
While going private could pave the way to the more radical surgery that may
be needed to nurse the company back to profitability, the view among
analysts is that it may also provide an easier exit from the PC market.
The company still has a credible position in brown goods and satellite
equipment which could provide profits when the upturn comes.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Market conditions hit Woolcombers float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLCOMBERS Group, the Yorkshire wool processor, yesterday postponed its
planned flotation because of unstable market conditions and the lack of
liquidity in small companies.
Following the circulation of the outline prospectus on September 10, James
Capel, the stockbrokers, were to announce the details of the issue
yesterday.
A market value of between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m was expected for
Woolcombers, with just under Pounds 20m set to be raised via a share
placing. However, not enough institutions were prepared to take the shares.
Mr Alan Lewis, chairman of Woolcombers, said: 'We have just been through the
most turbulent market conditions since 1987. This coupled with the lack of
liquidity in the small companies sector forced us to postpone the issue.'
He denied that the postponement had anything to do with the business.
Mr Lewis hopes Woolcombers will return to the stock market when conditions
stabilise. However, he indicated that uncertainty in the markets could delay
the planned flotation for a long time.
Woolcombers is part of the Illingworth Morris group, taken private by Mr
lewis in 1989. Mr Lewis controls a string of textiles companies.

Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property company,
yesterday posted its defence document in which it rejects the hostile 200p
per share offer from a subsidiary of Brierley Investments, the New Zealand
investment company, writes Peter Pearse.
The brewer, which is 59 per cent family-controlled, also announced it had
conditionally agreed to acquire UK D, a wholesale distributor of alcoholic
and non-alcoholic drinks for an initial Pounds 2.33m in loan notes and
shares. Depending on profits in the year to April 3 1993, there is
additional consideration of up to Pounds 540,000 in shares.
BIL's bid values its target at about Pounds 11m. In the statement issued
today, Gibbs Mew said that the board and other members of the family
controlling 55.5 per cent of the share capital intended to reject the offer.
BIL replied that the Gibbs family had attempted to present a fait accompli
and had not waited for independent shareholders' views.

warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PITTARD GARNAR, the leather company which is on a recovery path, announced a
22 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.27m for the half year to
June 30.
Mr David Macdonald, chairman, admitted that the results fell short of
expectations because of depressed economic conditions in the UK and the US.
He attributed the pre-tax gain to continued reduction in bank debt and
struck a cautious note for the second half.
Sales fell 6 per cent to Pounds 47.3m (Pounds 50.5m) on weakened demand,
especially in its clothing and chamois division and shoes and leather goods.
Sales at the gloving division rose to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 9.7m) against a
fall to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 17.1m) in shoes and to Pounds 20.6m (Pounds
23.6m) in clothing.
Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.33m) largely due to a Pounds
200,000 loss in the clothing division (Pounds 200,000 profit).
Interest charges, however, fell to Pounds 945,000 (Pounds 1.3m). The group
trimmed borrowings to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 18.5m) for gearing of 51 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose to 3.5p (2.5p) and an interim dividend of 0.5p (nil)
is declared.

Conder Group, a Winchester-based construction group, yesterday went into
administrative receivership, writes Vanessa Houlder.
Mr Alan Barrett of Price Waterhouse, who was appointed joint administrative
receiver, attributed the group's financial difficulties to severe losses a
year ago in its Elemeta division.
The group failed in efforts to raise additional working capital and had
attempted to sell parts of the business to generate cash. Following the
withdrawal of the last serious purchaser this week, the board decided it was
unable to continue trading.
The group employs over 830 people.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exploration write-off pushes Clyde into red
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDE PETROLEUM, the UK independent exploration and production company,
announced a net loss of Pounds 5.48m for the six months to June 30. The
result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration
activities.
Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the
company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration
immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation
of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be
capitalised and depreciated against eventual production.
Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house'
between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and
successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups.
Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where
it drilled a dry hole.
Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a
'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds
11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m.
Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was
suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear dumping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW international treaty on sea pollution, signed this week in Paris, was
right to extend the present ban on dumping radioactive waste for 15 years.
But it was also right to resist calls for a permanent ban. The treaty
commits the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic to reduce and
eventually eliminate the dumping of a wide range of toxic materials.
The most controversial point was that Britain and France insisted on
retaining the right to dump low and medium-level radioactive waste in the
sea. Alone among the north-east Atlantic countries, they have nuclear
submarines and power stations that must be decommissioned in the next two
decades.
Under the compromise agreed, Britain and France will continue to weigh up
land-based alternatives, reporting every two years to their co-signatories,
and will fund expensive research into the impact if they consider dumping
again after 2007.
This is a sensible approach, though not because such studies will give a
conclusive answer. It is impossible to prove that there will never be damage
to marine life even when the waste is dumped in a three-mile deep trench 400
miles from shore, although Britain and France have many scientists on their
side in arguing that the effects could be very small.
But those studies will increase the currently inadequate levels of marine
research and help focus attention on the dangers and costs of keeping the
decaying hulks on land and the risks to the people who must dismantle and
store them. In short, it will help achieve what Paris failed to do this week
 -to set the risks of radioactive waste in the context of other kinds of
pollution.
Top of that list is the discharge of industrial waste into rivers and
estuaries. Environmental groups have called steadily for better studies of
the effects.
The new treaty has also left unclear some of the obligations on countries
and companies to publish information. The Ministry of Defence has claimed
recently that under sovereign immunity it did not have to disclose its
munitions dumping, and that clause persists in the new agreement. The
treaty's fine print is open to interpretation on such points. It should
always be interpreted in favour of full disclosure.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A time for leadership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNSURPRISINGLY, in the light of the events of the past eight days, the prime
minister has lost much of his authority. His credibility is near to zero. He
put his shirt on Britain's permanent adherence to a particular parity with
the D-Mark, and lost. He staked his good name on steadfast adherence to the
Maastricht treaty, and saw his stake swept away. He gambled on a carefully
nurtured friendship with the German chancellor, and was disillusioned. Now
it is asked of Mr John Major that he rise above these disappointments.
It is a great deal to expect of any individual. The debate in the House of
Commons this afternoon is ostensibly about the future of Britain and Europe,
but there is a possibility that it will degenerate into a slanging match
about the fitness for office of the prime minister and his party. Labour
will have to show self-restraint if it is not to initiate such a contest. It
is, however, open to Mr Major to set the tone for a serious assessment at a
time of genuine national concern. To achieve this, he must indicate that he
is no longer befuddled by the hour-to-hour tactics that have characterised
so much of what the government has done over the past week.
What is not required is a rehearsal of the by now familiar catalogue of
explanations and excuses for the devaluation of the pound. It would be
particularly destructive to add to the heaped-up pile of doubts about the
position of Britain within any exchange rate mechanism, however
strengthened, or any version of the Maastricht treaty, however revised. A
U-turn switching the Conservative party away from being the 'party of
Europe' towards the narrow nationalism that so ill-fitted Labour before 1983
would be a humiliation for the Tories and a disaster for Britain.
Much will depend upon nuance. The existing Maastricht treaty has no future,
but the process of amending it can be either constructive or destructive.
Britain should be a friendly participant in the discussions among the 12. It
is one thing to wait a few weeks for the Danes to declare their hand; it is
quite another to indicate that Britain will not attempt to ratify
Maastricht-as-amended until a second Danish referendum has come back with a
positive vote. It makes sense to link the ERM and Maastricht, but it is
perfidious to suggest that assent to the latter can only follow the
elimination of the 'fault lines' in the former.
Much more will depend upon tone. 'Overall,' Mr Major might say, as he did on
September 7, 'the treaty is good for Britain and good for Europe.' He could
add that 'what lies at the heart of the community . . . is the notion that
by binding together the nations of Europe in a common economic framework it
would be possible to build an inextricable network of shared interests that
would render war between former enemies impossible.'
This would be better than chants about the franc's current difficulties. It
would challenge Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to live up to his solidly
pro-European stance. It would not create hostages to fortune against the day
when Britain once again participates wholeheartedly in European affairs.
Such a speech would begin the process of rehabilitation of the prime
minister. Anything less would not.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Anatomy of the UK defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the battle for the French franc will shed light on the
humiliating British departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. It
will, for instance, suggest whether the main fault lines were in the
mechanism or in the people operating it.
If the franc is upheld at its previously established parity against the
D-Mark, it will be a sign that the 'hard ERM' has some durability. If the
ERM continues to exist, but with a lower parity for the franc, it will show
that the hopes of a hard ERM were premature and that the mechanism is best
operated as a system of fixed but adjustable bands.
Suppose on the other hand that France, Germany and their smaller neighbours
react as Karl Otto Pohl has advocated, by establishing a currency union 'not
in 1997 or 1999 but in the near future'. Then the moral is that the ERM has
been a highly useful transitional system, but no more.
Only if the ERM collapses with nothing in its place will the Euro-sceptics
be able to say that it was the system rather than the people operating it
that had been flawed. Even then it was of great help in reducing British
inflation.
As far as the UK is concerned, I had always told my friends that I would be
left arguing for the ERM policy after the government had abandoned it - as
with every other policy I had ever supported. Then I made the fatal error on
July 24 of writing, on the basis of speeches such as the one cited here,
that the ERM policy would not be changed while John Major and Norman Lamont
remained at their present posts.
I do not doubt the chancellor's sincerity in delivering this and similar
speeches. After all these years I did not allow sufficiently for politicians
using words differently from the way other people use them. What did
subsequently enrage me was Norman Lamont's treatment of defeat as if it were
a victory and the new spring in his step as he beat a tin patriotic drum
announcing a 'British policy in British interests'.
How did we get here? By Wednesday, September 16, it was clear to the inner
cabinet that the 2 point increase in base rates to 12 per cent, belatedly
introduced in mid-morning, had not stemmed the torrent of speculation
against sterling. The 15 per cent rate later in the day was just a panic
reflex and caused not a flicker of market interest.
The inner cabinet that morning was presented with three options:
A huge increase in overnight rates on the Swedish model (but not alas of
Swedish dimensions) to deter speculators before the French referendum the
following Sunday.
A temporary suspension of ERM membership until after the French referendum.
This was the course followed by Italy which still talks of the earliest
possible return.
Indefinite withdrawal from the ERM.
The third course was chosen after a sum equivalent to more than half the
UK's Pounds 20bn of reserves had been vainly expended. Not altogether with
hindsight, I would have preferred a combination of the first two, much
earlier on.
Why was the first course not taken? Partly because the Bank of England could
not guarantee that it would succeed. And partly because the increase would
have spilled over for a time into shock horror base rates and mortgage
rates.
The reasons for rejecting the second course are not so convincing. A
re-entry would have had to be at a lower parity; but at least the UK would
still have been in the ERM. It took France eight years after joining as a
founder-member in 1979 before it could set its face against parity changes.
The vital background was the official view that UK interest rates were too
high on domestic grounds - 'we were overachieving in the battle against
inflation' was the unfortunate phrase used by the British in Washington.
There was, therefore, no stomach for rejoining at a new parity with perhaps
weakened credibility and interest rates still related to the German ones.
But how had events come to such a pass? The official explanation is that the
force of the speculative gale was totally unexpected and unprecedented. I
have always heard this said and never fail to be astonished. Whenever I have
been asked about the likely size of the next sterling crisis, under many
different currency regimes, I have always said: 'Think of the worst number
you can and multiply by 100.'
Another excuse was that this was the first time that speculators were
presented with a single day well in advance - that of the French referendum
 -on which to expect parity changes. This cuts both ways. Previous sterling
crises have blown up unexpectedly after events such as a Middle Eastern war
or a British strike. This time, the government had months in which to
prepare.
A further explanation is that the pound might have been held had not the
Bundesbank president, Helmut Schlesinger, given the Handelsblatt an
interview on September 15 calling for a wider realignment than just the
lira.
In fact, the Bundesbank was pushing for an ERM realignment well before
Britain joined in October 1990. After that, everyone from the president down
to the humblest staff economist made it clear he thought that the UK had
entered at the wrong time and at the wrong parity rate. While Bundesbank
pressure for a franc realignment gradually waned, disbelief in sterling's
parity increased.
I am told that these sentiments were not expressed face to face to the
chancellor or the governors of the Bank of England. But that is no excuse
for their not taking on board what was common knowledge. I could not take a
holiday anywhere in central Europe without hearing the sterling parity being
attacked by the time we came to the coffee and schnapps.
I did not pretend to agree. But the Bundesbank economists have
straightforward, unreconstructed mainstream views. They judge the sterling
parity by the British trade figures and the fact that even in recession
Britain's headline inflation is still slightly higher than Germany's. There
was little chance of the Bundesbank's view being overthrown when it was
shared by the vast majority of British commentators, from professors of
econometrics to teenage dealers. It cannot be said that the one or two
anti-devaluation studies that the Treasury did us a favour in publishing and
at which the Bank merely darkly hinted, were of the same calibre as the
better pro-devaluation analyses.
Of course it was not statistics or articles which undermined the market's
belief in sterling, but the view - perfectly justified in the event - that
ministers were bluffing and would not be prepared to do whatever necessary
to defend sterling in the face of a severe and prolonged recession. I should
have noticed the fatal signs when base rates were not raised in July when
the ERM divergence indicator for sterling passed minus 75 per cent, pointing
to a presumption in favour of a base rate increase, as well as of
pro-sterling intervention by others.
The case for a system with the D-Mark as an anchor was immensely strong
throughout the 1980s up to German reunification - which is just when Lady
Thatcher was able to veto British membership. I realised that something
would have to give last December when the Bundesbank raised interest rates,
while outside the Community they were being cut to counter recession. But I
did not think aloud because it was overwhelmingly important for Britain to
remain in the ERM at the entry parity as long as possible if there was to be
a chance of breaking inflationary psychology, and improving economic
prospects in the 1990s. My hope was that if only we could get past the
French referendum, eventually German interest rates would start to fall, as
recessionary forces in Germany gathered momentum. I had other ideas in
reserve.
These are now pipe dreams. But so are the ideas of the motley coalition of
right-wing Tory backbenchers and left-wing commentators who believe that
there is something called 'going for growth' which the government can
achieve by the old American slogan of 'Cheap money and plenty of it'. In one
way or another - I hope not too painfully - the exchange rate will regain
its place at the centre of macroeconomic policy.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The franc at bay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for the preservation of the parity of the French franc is not
just a fight to preserve French monetary policy. Nor is it merely about the
survival of an ERM without exchange controls. It is about the fate of the
Franco-German relationship, the heart of the European Community.
Fresh from having made large fortunes by speculating against the Italian
lira and the pound sterling, investors are testing the French franc's parity
to destruction. But the French and the Germans can defeat the speculation.
They should use their powers without stint.
French Finance Minister Michel Sapin has insisted that the attack on the
franc is unwarranted by the fundamentals. He has received strong support for
this view from the Bundesbank and the German finance minister, Mr Theo
Waigel. If one ignores purely cyclical differences between Germany and
France, the view is correct. Thus whether or not this parity can be held
will show whether any fixed exchange rate regime, short of monetary union,
can be preserved among larger European countries.
The cyclical economic divergence is important, however, in explaining
current pressure. Given the high level of unemployment in France, the
unpopularity of the Socialist government and the tiny majority in favour of
the Maastricht treaty, investors wonder whether the French authorities will
be willing to pay the price that may be needed to preserve the parity. The
announcement that German broad money grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent
between the last quarter of 1991 and August 1992 further increased the
doubts, since it suggests that any early easing of German monetary policy is
unlikely.
French tactics can be faulted. Mr Sapin may, for example, have made an
important, if understandable, mistake when he suggested last week that a
French interest rate cut was merely being postponed until after the
referendum. Perhaps the French authorities should have raised interest rates
sooner. Yesterday's 2 1/2 percentage point increase in the French emergency
lending rate and the overnight rates of 30 per cent may also be
insufficient.
Yet tactics are not everything. What matters in the end is the determination
to ensure that - cost what it may - those who buy the French franc will be
enriched and those who speculate against it will be impoverished.
The French can do most of what is needed for themselves. But at this
critical juncture, they also need German help. The French have dedicated
themselves, over almost a decade, to making their country 'Bundesbankable'.
The Bundesbank should return the compliment.
German rates of interest should, if necessary, be cut. Once the fingers of
the speculators have been burned, they can be raised once more. This is not
a choice which the Bundesbank will want to make, caught as it is between the
goal of German monetary stability and that of sustaining the parity between
the D-Mark and the French franc. But it should now treat European monetary
stability as, to an extent, a Franco-German effort. If the Bundesbank does
not show the needed flexibility, it will still rule the European monetary
roost, but it is likely to do so in uncomfortable isolation.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Effects of leaving ERM and cutting interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'THERE are those who think we should slash interest rates, cut loose from
the ERM all together, and let the pound find its own level.
'It sounds simple. After all, the US floats its currency; why shouldn't we
do so too? But there is, of course, a very significant difference. The
British economy is far more dependent on international trade. More than a
third of our national output is exported, compared to just a tenth for the
US. For Britain the threat of imported inflation is very real.
'Many who advocate floating know full well what the consequences would be.
They intend a devaluation of the pound. And they would certainly achieve it.
For the result of leaving the ERM, combined with large cuts in interest
rates, would be a fall in the pound probably unprecedented in the past 40
years. It's the cut and run option: cut interest rates and a run on the
pound.
'Whatever the position may be for other countries, we know from bitter
experience that devaluation doesn't work for Britain. If depreciating the
currency solved anything, Britain would already have been one of the most
successful economies in the world.
In 1966 the pound was worth - amazingly - more than DM 11. But the
devaluations of the past yielded not booming exports but rather a steadily
falling share of world markets.
'Contrast that with the export successes of the strong currency,
low-inflation countries like Germany and Japan. They have shown that the way
to success is to adjust your costs to your exchange rate, not the other way
around.
'The stark reality is that outside the ERM, we would still have to compete
with the ERM countries. Some, like Germany and France, which already have
low inflation and others like Spain, whose ERM membership is helping bring
inflation down. And our initial gain in competitiveness would soon be eroded
as imports soared and pay deals rose. That would do British industry no good
at all.
'Markets should see that, unlike all our major European competitors, Britain
lacked the will to pursue the goal of permanently low inflation. And they
would be right. We would have given up after less than two years. They would
conclude that we were back to our bad old ways; that given the chance we
would always delude ourselves by thinking that with a
little more inflation we could get a little more growth.
'The credibility of our anti-inflationary strategy with businesses and
employers would be in tatters. It would certainly be the end of the battle
with inflation - we would have surrendered. And quite soon interest rates
would have to go back up again - to much higher levels than they are today.'
Norman Lamont's speech to European Policy Forum, July 10 1992

TONY BENN: THE END OF AN ERA, DIARIES 1980-90 By Tony Benn Hutchinson Pounds
25, 687 pages
'Tuesday 3 June 1980: The Daily Mail had the headline, 'Centre Party to be
formed on Monday', claiming that Roy Jenkins was going to resign as
president of the European Commission within a month and return to British
politics. I think it is unlikely.'
Thus begins the fifth and final volume of the diaries of Tony Benn. As so
often, Benn had it wrong. Jenkins did return, and his role in the formation
of the Social Democratic party and the alliance with the Liberals was
seminal in British politics for much of the 1980s. It was a challenge to Mrs
Thatcher, who withstood it, and it had a devastating effect on the fortunes
of the already crumbling Labour party.
Still, we should not judge Benn as a forecaster, but more as a chronicler of
the times or, more accurately, the times as he saw them. As he puts it in a
diary entry during February 1981: 'I do not leak. I am a diarist. I am the
Hansard of the party.'
To the general reader, this volume will seem less riveting than its
predecessors. The reason is simple. After Benn's narrow defeat in his
challenge to Denis Healey for the deputy leadership of the Labour party in
1981 - a contest that was electric at the time and occupies much of the
first 150 pages - he became increasingly out of touch with mainstream
politics, even in his own party.
Those who have followed the diaries so far, however, will delight in this
coda. It reveals a great deal about the man. Perhaps in the end he will go
down as a rather charming English eccentric, and not the wrecker that he
sometimes seemed. His principal characteristic was that he was a late
developer.
Benn appears never to have gone into a library with an open mind. He relied
on books sent to him by his admirers, such as the professor of politics,
Ralph Miliband. He seems to have discovered the French revolution only in
the 1980s, so much so that there are several references to it in these
diaries and he even notes its 200th anniversary.
He also picked up fashions rather than set them. Long after most of the
educated public must have realised that there was a women's movement, Benn
hears about it from the (then) communist, Bea Campbell, and recalls that he
has heard something before from his daughter, Melissa.
He must have picked up vegetarianism in much the same way. In Dundee in
1982, he notes: 'We went for a meal with the Lord Provost. I didn't eat the
gammon steak - I should say that Caroline (his wife) and I gave up eating
meat about 18 months ago - just the chips, the peas and the pineapple ring.'
Benn's taste in politicians is equally revealing. He came to distrust
Michael Foot later on because of Foot's alleged move to the right. Neil
Kinnock he disliked and distrusted from the start. When Kinnock introduced
the pink rose as the party symbol, Benn wrote his own words to The Red Flag:
'The people's rose in shades of pinks/Gets up my nostrils and it stinks.'
He could not stand Edward Kennedy, who reminded him of Roy Jenkins. He
thought that Stuart Holland, once a young ambitious Labour MP on the left,
would make a better foreign secretary than David Owen. He was not entirely
disrespectful of Roy Hattersley.
It was the Tory individuals he preferred - Margaret Thatcher, of course,
because she put her own stamp on the Tory party just as he would have liked
to have done to the Labour party. He learned and approved of how she did it
from the young William Waldegrave. There were others: Geoffrey Howe, Julian
Amery and Enoch Powell are all commended in different ways. Of Powell, he
notes: 'Although Enoch is a nationalist and I am an internationalist, there
is a sort of commonality of interest between us.' Michael Heseltine, on the
other hand, reminded him of Kinnock.
Keith Joseph was a favourite. Once they met on the railway platform at
Bristol, 'got into an empty first-class compartment and talked all the way
back to London'. At Paddington the engine driver called out: 'I wish I could
get a picture of you two buggers for the newspapers.'
The eternal boy scout had his endearing traits. When he lost his seat in
parliament and had to pay for his own mail, Benn, the former postmaster
general, was astonished by the 'astronomic' cost of postage stamps. The
former minister of technology puts a hammer through the bowl while trying to
mend the lavatory seat. And the man who wanted to transform society admits:
'I just can't cope with financial matters.'
Nevertheless, he tells it all and all five volumes have been wonderfully
edited by Ruth Winstone. Towards the end, there is a prophetic gem:
'9 March 1989 - William Cash, a young right-wing Tory MP, told me that the
Tory party was on the point of splitting over the federalisation of the
Common Market . . . the issue would realign British politics in a way
comparable to the alliance of John Bright and Disraeli at the time of 1867
Reform Bill. This,' Benn comments, 'was music to my ears.'

FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: I Capuleti e i Montecchi - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bomb-scare at the Theatre Museum late on Tuesday afternoon played havoc
not only with Covent Garden traffic, but also with the schedules of the
theatres in the vicinity. In the case of the Royal Opera House, it prevented
the Pier Luigi Pizzi sets for Bellini's Capuleti from reaching the stage
until impractically late in the evening, which in turn resulted in the first
performance of its latest revival being given in limited form - in costume
but without props or set-change.
Generously, the house offered the show free, with money-back and re-booking
facilities as part of the deal; those who decided to remain and wait out the
45-minute delay before curtain-up seemed not to mind the limitations. And
indeed, anyone who recalls the static, tableaux-by-numbers quality of
Pizzi's own production in its original (1984) estate is unlikely to have
indulged in an excess of hand-wringing over its trimmed-down presentation.
As sometimes happens in such circumstances, the audience spirit of
mucking-in and the performers' determination to deliver their utmost came
together to provide an enjoyable evening. The opera is, of course,
indomitably enjoyable in its own right - early Bellini, peculiarly pithy and
candid in its musical and dramatic qualities, a Romeo and Juliet pared down
to essentials. In addition (and given that one should judge any such
performance with proper caution), the evidence of careful, thoughtful
musical preparation was everywhere apparent.
For this we must obviously thank Daniele Gatti (who first came to the house
earlier in the year, as conductor of another Bellini opera, I puritani). He
allows not a moment of slackness or routine; he encourages the players to
dig into the lines as though no critical disapproval of Bellini's scoring
had ever seen the light of day. His ardour is winning, even though my own
taste in Bellini interpretation is for a far less frenziedly assertive
directorial personality, less pushing of the voices, less beating-out of
every rubato, altogether greater lyrical spontaneity.
In truth, the performance was also enjoyable in spite of the absence of a
single cast-member who could honestly be reckoned a born Bellinian. The men
matter, of course, less than the women (though the wooffy Italian
enunciation of the basses was distressing, and Keith Lewis, a Tebaldo
remembered from 1985 revival, sounded in poor vocal form). Amanda Roocroft
(Juliet) made pretty, easily emitted sounds above the stave (and her
familiar gummy ones lower down); she has worked touchingly hard on the role,
without so far evincing the faintest glimmer of instinct for either the
Bellinian line or the drama that should emerge out of it.
More problematic was the immensely distinguished presence of Anne Sofie von
Otter, undertaking here her first Romeo. She looks wonderful: tall, trimly
adolescent and athletic. She sings words and phrases with her usual,
admirable musicality; the tone, when not pinched by the highest reaches of
the role, is beautiful. What she lacks is the essential Italianate attack,
colour-variety, forwardness of personality. In my view she is unsuited to
the bel canto repertory, and the disadvantages, even possibly the dangers of
her further exploration thereof should not be underestimated.
In repertory at Covent Garden until October 14

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Tuesday's concert by the London Philharmonic was a Gala Evening, sponsored
by Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld, to inaugurate their South Bank residency. The
thinking behind the programme was transparent: one popular blockbuster -
Orff's Carmina Burana - enhanced by a strong trio of solo voices; one safe
Romantic piece for an admired virtuoso - Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto
with Pinchas Zukerman; one 'advanced' exhibit, not too time-consuming -
Webern's op. 6, his Six Pieces for Orchestra (1909) - to show loyalty to the
current South Bank ideals.
It came off pretty well. We have heard more sharply etched performances of
the astonishing Webern set, but Mehta synthesised some hallucinatory colours
for individual pieces. It was rewarding to learn from Anthony Burton's
programme-note that the second piece represents a train journey: suddenly
one heard the music in a new, down-to-earth frame.
While Zukerman delivered the Bruch concerto with sovereign professionalism
and a nice, unabashed indulgence in period portamenti, Mehta chose to
provide self-effacing support. Agreeable enough; but less than a month ago,
a Prom performance with more creative give-and-take between orchestra and
soloist searched harder into the music, and gave it a more cogent shape.
Having successfully evaded the Carmina Burana for several years now, I could
enjoy it this time. Yes, Orff's deliberately bald writing and his
instrumental trouvailles make bracing effects; no, the net impression is
never more than the sum of its glinting parts. Mehta paced it with a
masterly hand, and the LPO's Choir gave the work everything it deserves  -
except properly gutsy consonants, for which nothing less than a echt-German
chorus will do. The Southend Boys' Choir were first-rate: melting in the
choirboy-range, unexpectedly forward and lusty when they dropped down to a
grown-up tessitura.
Sumi Jo sang the brief soprano solos ravishingly, and Jochen Kowalski had
been flown in just to lend his artful alto to the Roasting Swan's plaint.
The plum baritone role went to Jeffrey Black, the Royal Opera's current
house-Australian. If his vocal wattage began to fade before the end, he had
already distinguished himself with a calculated air of macho wildness, and
musical imagination far beyond the macho norm.

of Siberia where temperatures fall to minus 70 centigrade. There are 15,000
of them and, since they live by following the reindeer herds, it seems they
are not easy to find. They were almost eradicated during the communist era,
and the tribe's survival is threatened again by the political and economic
upheavals of what was the Soviet Union.
Today's episode in Present Imperfect (9.30 BBC2) is concerned with Max

Antonia de Sancha. Mr Clifford is credited with helping these people polish
their stories and then negotiating the tabloid deals which have made them so
profitable.
BBC2 screens a Late Show Special devoted to Michael Powell, the English film
director who formed a famous partnership with Emeric Pressburger (11.15).
His best known movies include 'The Spy In Black' and 'The Life And Death Of

PATRIOT GAMES (15) Empire
SWOON (18) Metro
JUST LIKE A WOMAN (15) Odeon West End
SECRET FRIENDS (15) MGM Tottenham Ct Rd
CALIFORNIA MAN (PG) MGMs West End
With Patriot Games and Swoon opening in one week, we have a definitive Yin
and Yang of modern American cinema. On my right the latest large-screen,
all-colour, exploding action thriller starring Harrison Ford and based on a
Tom Clancy novel. On my left the strange, delicate and monochrome Swoon.
This stars two actors we have never heard of before and is based, with many
a deconstructionist trope and modernist gay inflection, on the Leopold-Loeb
murder case of the 1920s.
While Patriot Games will pack them in at every Odeon, Swoon will probably
fill one and a half arthouses. And while Patriot Games gallops along using
as narrative whip the tried-and-true question 'What next?', Swoon stands
moodily in one place turning different facets of itself to the grainy light.
Thanks to the riddling, fragmented structure of this film, written and
directed by Tom Kalin, the question 'What next?' is replaced by 'What just
happened?' History already knows the what-nexts in the Leopold-Loeb story
and so do most moviegoers: they were fictionalised in Hitchcock's Rope and
dramatised semi-factually in Richard Fleischer's Compulsion. Swoon makes us
turn away from the known culmination points - murder, trial, life
imprisonment - to search for earlier formative truths about the culprits and
their society.
Leopold and Loeb were two young gay lovers who murdered, seemingly without
motive, a neighbour's child in Chicago in 1923. Theories grew like jungle
weeds around the subsequent trial, where Clarence Darrow, no less, took the
defence brief. Were L and L self-styled superman who had overdosed on
Nietzsche readings? Were they common-or-garden sadists? Or were they
affectless artists of life, seeking to sculpt the perfect crime?
Writer-director Kalin gives us less an answer than a deepening conundrum.
His film is series of tableaux vivants in search of a 'story.' Nathan
Leopold (Craig Chester) and Richard Loeb (Daniel Schlachet) are young,
spoilt and narcissistic; they are also grave, introspective and mysteriously
resistant to the probings of police, lawyers and even film-maker. Swoon's
power comes from its ability to provide a searing photogravure recreation of
period and character - from Prohibition speakeasies to Gatsbyish tea
parties, from grainy gay love scenes to shadow-strewn police interrogations
 -and still to haunt us by leaving more questions than answers.
In a mainstream Hollywood genre film this would be a fault. Why are the ends
not tied up, the audience would cry in unison? Take Patriot Games. Here
every loose end is painstakingly knotted by the close, as if by some
demented Norn doing punishment time. I once opened Tom Clancy's novel with a
view to reading it, but closed it again on realising its extreme dottiness.
In the book CIA hero Jack Ryan heads off an IRA conspiracy against our royal
family and has much badinage en route with the likes of Charles, Di, Philip
and HM. In the film these persons are thrown out and replaced by an
all-purpose fictive toff: James Fox as 'Lord Holmes.'
Perhaps as well. What could the IRA do to the Windsor family that the
Windsors are not doing to themselves already? So we have Provo thug Sean
Bean attempting to assassinate Lord H outside Buck House; the happily
on-hand Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) saving his nobship in the nick of time;
and then Mr F spending the remaining 100 minutes eluding the deranged
attentions of the pursuing Bean.
It all ends on Cape Cod or somewhere, as the British Lord descends on the
American Ford for dinner to hand him his honorary knighthood; whereupon,
guess what, the lights go out and the mad Bean is revealed to be in the
garden.
This is one of those films where one cannot spoil the plot even by telling
it. In the screen's last Clancy adventure, The Hunt For Red October, we had
a red-hot story, about a defecting Soviet submarine captain, plus some
clever casting: one newcomer (Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan) blended with one
grizzled veteran (Sean Connery as the Russky). In Patriot Games the plot is
threadbare and Harrison Ford's prolific serial-hero career to date (formerly
Han Solo and Indy Jones) now lends a sense of deja vu to this latest parade
of winks, nods and startled reaction shots.
To these demerits we must add auto-pilot direction by Philip Noyce (Dead
Calm) and an array of the usual wondrous Hollywood-goes-to-Britain
topographical oddities. I was particularly struck by the chase scene which
debouched from Piccadilly's Burlington Arcade into Aldwych tube station;
though I must award a runner-up prize to the reference to Lymington the
well-known port in 'Kent.'
The list of Americans lost in Britain is large and growing larger. Gerald
(Adrian Pasdar) in Just Like A Woman is an international banker living in
London with his family; at least until he is thrown onto the streets by his
wife when she discovers enough silk lingerie in his wardrobe to costume an
entire Rainer Werner Fassbinder film.
But Gerald is no adulterer. No; forced to answer the question 'Who was that
lady we saw you with last night?' he would have to reply 'That was no lady,
that was myself.' He is, in short, a transvestite.
Shock for audience; nervous giggles from his new landlady Julie Walters; and
then the sweet unfolding of a twin-track plot about passion en travestie,
Pasdar bedding Miss W, and bewilderment in the boardroom. For our hero ends
up outfacing his bigoted boss (Paul Freeman) and proving that a man can
broker multi-million-dollar business deals even while wearing lipstick and
high heels.
Scripted by Nick Evans from Monica Jay's true-life story Geraldine - Miss
Jay being the model for Walters's role - the film is endearing even when it
sails close to that perilous concept, British comedy. There is many a
telegraphic reaction shot and many a ho-ho supporting character. But
whenever he is left alone with his two stars, both superb, director Chris
Monger fashions a touching tale of love's ability to ride out stupefaction.
Other new London openings are less auspicious. After Blackeyes Dennis Potter
is still being allowed to operate a movie camera: result, Secret Friends.
Alan Bates plays the walking, or sitting, identity crisis whose past life
flashes before him during a British Rail journey.
Attacked by flashbacks as if by violent indigestion, he is asked by the
waiter in one scene if his sole was satisfactory. 'Soul?' jumps Bates - it
is that kind of film - and after a brief nervous crisis he settles back into
the mental jigsaw-work that occupies most of the film. His memories include
two sexy women (Gina Bellman, Frances Barber), a bloody garden fork, a
series of plant drawings, a mad vicar father and heaven knows what else.
When twinned with a well-trained craftsman-director, Potter's stylistic
paroxysms as a writer are usually welded and streamlined into art. See The
Singing Detective or Dreamchild. When twinned with a fellow dervish in the
director's chair - Nicolas Roeg in Track 29, himself here - confusion is
confounded beyond all recall.
Still, it beats California Man, scripted by Shawn Schepps and directed by
Les Mayfield: a jokeless youth comedy from the same industry and mind-set
that brought us Wayne's World. Here two high school boys (Sean Astin, Paul
Shore) accidentally revive a deep-frozen caveman (Brendan Fraser). That the
latter proves more intelligent and resourceful than most of the population
of Los Angeles is supposed to be a surprise.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: Colquhoun and MacBryde - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tale of Colquhoun and MacBryde, as John Byrne tells it in this new play,
is basically not new: two Scotsmen drink themselves through their early
successes and then into their steady decline. Three ingredients make the
story piquant: the two were artists; they were lovers; and their story
actually happened - in living memory.
As detected at the Royal Court, both Robert Colquhoun (1914-62) and Rober
MacBryde (1915-66) were robust, funny, uninhibited characters, ambitious to
the degree of considerable self promotion and ultimately self-destructive.
If, like myself, you knew little of them beforehand, you may be grateful for
what the play tells you - especially in its first half, which ends during
the Second World War - and for the way it puts them in context. David O'Hara
and Ken Stott both give excellent performances, relishing at first the
romping comedy, then realising sharply the helpless drunkenness that
follows.
All that is on the one hand. On the other is the fact that Colquhoun and
MacBryde is not much of a play. Written in a rapid stream of brief scenes,
with Colquhoun providing intermittent commentary during early episodes, it
feels like a string of 'Do you remember?' anecdotes. And the anecdotes -
though usually featuring only Colquhoun and MacBryde on stage - give us an
outsider's view of both artists. Though the play's main interest lies in the
fact that these were homosexual artists, the treatment of their love life is
sketchy, that of their painting extremely vague. Psychologically, everything
is always superficial. The action touches much too briefly on MacBryde's
jealousy of Colquhoun, finds their ambitions entertaining but not revealing;
and only hints at any connection between their self-promotiveness and their
self-destructiveness.
Though they were an unusual couple, Byrne handles them very conventionally.
Most scenes end with such easy punch lines that the events on stage soon
seem unhistorical. The dialogue is neatly dotted with jokes and with
salacious detail; Byrne works so hard to make the story an entertainment
that he even has the drunken MacBryde try to get the audience to join in a
song. The most intentionally riotous scene in which uninvited guests turn a
quiet supper into a vulgar farce is just the drunks' version of standard
custard-pie comedy. Some of the blame for this depressing slickness must go
to the director, Lindsay Posner.
Everything about the depiction of the artists' gradual decline is obvious.
'What are you staring at?' says MacBryde, at some point in the 1950s.
Colquhoun, gazing at a huge Abstract Expressionist daub by Jackson Pollock,
says, 'The future.' The rest of the play is endless drunk scene, with
fights, recriminations, tears - all treated with wretched glibness. To bring
real people to life in drama requires an effort of the imagination; and it
is in precisely that department that Byrne's play falls flat.
Royal Court Theatre, until October 13.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp deterioration at BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DETERIORATION in British Aerospace's operating performance caught the
City by surprise. An interim loss of Pounds 129m, against a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 86m a year earlier, indicated conditions had deteriorated sharply
for the group.
The problem lay in commercial aircraft production with a loss of Pounds 286m
(loss of Pounds 32m a year earlier). Defence raised profits to Pounds 296m
(Pounds 281m), Rover trimmed its loss to Pounds 31m from Pounds 43m, the
Arlington property division had a loss of Pounds 6m (loss of Pounds 5m) and
construction turned in profit of Pounds 12m (Pounds 20m).
The Pounds 750m charge for reorganisation costs - or Pounds 1bn before
before a tax credit - was the maximum analysts had forecast.
As provisions go, it will be one of the largest taken by a UK company.
By comparison, British Petroleum, took this summer an exceptional charge of
just over Pounds 1bn for redundancy costs - covering 11,500 job losses - and
asset write-downs. Barclays Bank wrote-off bad debts of Pounds 1.07bn.
In the case of BAe, however, the Pounds 750m exceptional cost to be taken in
the second half will create a deficit of Pounds 746m on the company's (as
opposed to the group's) profit and loss account.
This hole in the distributable reserves prevents a dividend being paid.
To restore the reserves and enable a delayed payment of the interim
dividend, the group is proposing a reduction of capital.
This will involve the following cuts in surpluses in other areas of the
capital and reserves that make up shareholders' funds:
reducing the share premium account, which stood at Pounds 616m in the last
set of accounts, by Pounds 599m;
reducing the nominal amount of each ordinary share from 50p to 10p to
release Pounds 151m.
The changes must be approved both by the shareholders at an extraordinary
general meeting, to be held on October 19, and by the High Court.
If these approvals are obtained, BAe plans to pay a late interim dividend of
3p, cut from 8.9p.
The payment would be made next February, on the day after the announcement
of the 1992 results.
The preference share dividend due on January 1 would also be delayed until
then. The board's decision on the final dividend will be a separate matter.
Other parts of shareholders' funds will not be affected, namely the
statutory, revaluation and capital reserves.
With preference share capital staying intact, the issued share capital of
the group will come down from Pounds 256m to Pounds 105m. About Pounds 17m
will be left in the share premium reserve.
The amount in the group's accumulated profit and loss account after the
interim losses comes down to Pounds 424m.
This will leave pro forma shareholders' funds at about Pounds 1.8bn,
compared with the Pounds 2.54bn quoted in yesterday's accounts, before the
reorganisation provision.
Net debt on June 30 stood at Pounds 987m, made up of Pounds 1.22bn of
advance payments, mainly from defence customers, and Pounds 230m of cash
balances. The pro forma debt-equity ratio would be about 55 per cent.
BAe said that this level of borrowings was acceptable since working capital
requirements reached a peak in the summer and the reorganisation would
reduce the cash drain in the regional aircraft operation.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Uncertainty hangs over vital defence side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace has become increasingly dependent on defence as the
mainstay of its business but faces lingering uncertainties about crucial
military programmes.
First half results show its defence side as an island of profit in a sea of
losses. Defence activities - embracing military aircraft, missiles and the
Royal Ordnance munitions and land weapons business - produced earnings
before interest of Pounds 296m, up Pounds 15m from the same period last
year. The only other sector in the black was construction, with a Pounds 12m
profit.
Although BAe refuses to break down its figures, all the defence businesses
are currently profitable, including the heavily restructured Dynamics
division.
But the real core is undoubtedly its military aircraft operation based at
Warton in Lancashire, now facing unresolved questions affecting both its
immediate and long-term future.
BAe is counting on new orders from Saudi Arabia to keep its production of
Tornado fighter-bombers at Warton going up to 1996. Tornado work on current
Tornado orders has already virtually finished. Germany and Italy, the other
partners have ended their programmes, and BAe has moved some work on its
Hawk trainer aircraft to Warton in order to fill unused capacity.
A long-awaited Saudi deal covering 48 more Tornados and a number of Hawk
aircraft, together worth several billion pounds, is still pending. BAe is
confident that the Saudis' requirement will not be affected by their planned
purchase of F-15 aircraft from the US.
But the Saudis are not averse to playing one supplier off against another,
and it is unlikely the contract will be sealed before the F-15 deal has been
cleared by the US Congress.
Supplies to Saudi Arabia under a framework deal for which BAe is prime
contractor are running at Pounds 2bn a year and are presumed to be the
company's biggest single profit source. BAe said a new contract should be
signed by the end of the year. But then it was saying the same this time
last year.
Tornado production is due to be replaced after 1996 by the European Fighter
Aircraft, currently under question after Germany's rejection of the
four-nation jet and its proposal to launch a less ambitious project.
Spain and Italy, the other partners could also drop out of the project as
currently conceived.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, says the group still aims at a
collaborative project, but maintains that it would be 'perfectly feasible'
for the UK to produce the aircraft on its own.
This, he says would save up to 30 per cent on the cost of collaborative
production, and would bring the full export benefits to the UK. BAe and GEC
 -the other main British company with a heavy stake in EFA - are both
considering the possibility of acting as risk-taking managers of the project
on behalf of the UK government.
However, possible options for the future of the project will not become
clear until the completion of studies by the four governments and industrial
partners next month. Also in question is the future of BAe's missile
division, where employment has been reduced by two-thirds in the last three
years to 5,300.
Restructuring in the US - particularly the recent acquisition of General
Dynamics' missile operations by Hughes Aircraft - has increased pressure for
reorganising the business in Europe to enable it to compete in the world
market.
Plans to merge BAe's guided weapons' interests with those of Thomson-CSF of
France collapsed early last year.
Matra of France has recently been in discussions on the future of the BAe
division, seeking a link-up between prime contractors which might also
eventually embrace the French state-controlled company Aerospatiale. GEC
might also be involved in a joint missile venture

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Rover cuts losses despite poor market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP, BAe's cars and Land Rover vehicles subsidiary, cut its
first-half losses before interest from Pounds 43m to Pounds 31m, despite the
savage recession in the UK new car market.
Although most motor industry analysts expect UK sales to remain heavily
depressed for the rest of this year, and at best a marginal recovery in
1993, BAe chairman Mr John Cahill said Rover would be in a position to 'come
back very strongly' when the market showed an upturn.
He emphasised BAe's intention to retain the Rover business - in which Honda
of Japan has a 20 per cent stake - even after the embattled aerospace group
becomes entitled to sell formerly UK state-owned Rover group from August
next year.
'We have no plans to sell it; we are very happy with it, and its management
has done an outstanding job with it,' declared Mr Cahill.
The improvement in Rover's financial performance arose from continuing
cost-cutting and productivity measures, and was achieved despite a reduction
in turnover from Pounds 1.863bn to Pounds 1.651bn in the first six months.
The efficiency improvements have reduced Rover's break-even to around
440,000 vehicles annually.
The break-even position last year was around 495,000 vehicles, according to
Mr George Simpson, BAe's deputy chief executive and Rover's chairman.
This year's objective remains well above the informal target of 404,000
Rover had hoped to achieve by the end of 1992.
The cost savings already achieved this year should have been sufficient to
reach the lower level, said Mr Simpson. However, Rover has been blown off
course by the fact that the much-predicted second half upturn in the UK car
market failed to materialise.
As a result, profit margins have been much reduced by the savage price war
still raging in the marketplace.
Nevertheless, the benefits of the productivity measures and cost cutting
would continue to lower the break-even threshhold over the coming months,
insisted Mr Simpson.
Rover's first half unit sales totalled 202,000, with the second half
expected to be 'little better', according to Mr Simpson.
Some 45 per cent of first half sales were exports, mainly to the continental
Europe. Because of the high UK content of its cars Rover's financial
performance is also expected to be boosted by sterling's devaluation against
continental currencies, following the pound's withdrawal from the ERM.
'Potentially, it will make a big difference', said Mr Simpson, who also
expects the share of Rover's total sales taken by exports to rise slightly
over the coming year.
Rover's competitive position inside the UK should also be strengthened
because of the much higher import content - whether cars or components - of
main rivals Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot.
While acknowledging that Rover still had some way to go to meet Japanese
efficiency levels of 45 cars per man year, he said Rover's 35 was now 'a
match for anyone in Europe', where the industry average is 30 cars a man
year.
BAe made clear yesterday that despite the problems elsewhere in the
business, there would be no let-up in investment programmes at Rover, which
involve spending of Pounds 200m in each of the next two years.
Most of this would be financed by Rover itself.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Commercial aircraft cause group deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE'S commercial aircraft activities were responsible for
dragging the company into the red in the first half of this year.
These operations, whose sales fell from Pounds 839m to Pounds 659m in the
first six months, saw their overall losses surge from Pounds 32m to Pounds
286m at midway.
The bulk of the losses came in the BAe 146 regional jet business and the
company's turbopropeller activities.
These are now at the centre of a sweeping restructuring programme involving
the closure of Hatfield, the regrouping of all turbopropeller aircraft
manufacturing activities at Prestwick in Scotland, and a planned joint
venture with Taiwan Aerospace to take over production and marketing of BAe's
new RJ family of regional jets.
The regional jet business lost Pounds 167m in the first half, while the
turboprops, which include the ATP and Jetstream aircraft, lost Pounds 111m.
The regional jet and commuter turbopropeller aircraft business has been
severely hit by the recession in the airline industry and the financial
problems of smaller airlines.
It is also suffering from over capacity and is in the throes of growing
concentration, as manufacturers scramble to forge alliances and
partnerships. Production of BAe 146 regional jets has fallen from more than
30 a year to about 24 this year. Since the 146 programme was first launched
in the early 1970s, a total of just over 200 aircraft have been sold.
One of the handicaps of the BAe regional jet has been its four engines at a
time when the market has tended to prefer twin-engine jet aircraft. But BAe
claims it has enhanced its four-engine regional jet with its new family of
revamped 146s and is considering developing a twin-engine version of the
aircraft.
BAe is also attempting to forge an international partnership with its
preliminary agreement with Taiwan Aerospace to form a Dollars 500m joint
venture which would aim to produce about 35 regional jets a year.
BAe's traditionally profitable corporate jet business, including the BAe
125-800 and the BAe 1000, also showed a small Pounds 4m loss in the first
half. BAe had sought to sell a majority stake in this business. But after
failing to secure a sufficiently attractive offer decided this week to
retain this activity.
The company now regards its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus
programme as one of its most promising assets. BAe produces all the wings
for Airbus airliners.
Although its participation in Airbus resulted in a Pounds 4m loss in the
first half, the company said Airbus continued to have a strong order book
with firm orders covering almost the entire production for the next two
years. BAe said yesterday it anticipated Airbus to become a cash generating
business by the mid-1990s.

big ambitions

FOR A company almost exactly one year old, Taiwan Aerospace (TAC) could be
accused of running before it can walk.
Despite having less than 100 staff, invested capital of about USDollars 200m
(Pounds 120m) and only one small factory, it has been courting the world's
largest aerospace companies offering fresh cash for Western technology.
Last November it reached preliminary agreement to buy 40 per cent in
McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft division for up to USDollars 2bn.
Both sides say discussions are continuing, but observers in Taiwan say talks
have stalled. Following this setback, yesterday's announcement of a 50/50
joint venture with British Aerospace's regional aircraft division gives TAC
the chance to prove it is able to execute, as well as dream up, the big
idea.
TAC was set up in September 1991 to negotiate joint production agreements
with foreign aircraft manufacturers and link them with Taiwanese
sub-contractors. The largest shareholder is the government with 29 per cent.
Other shareholders include some of Taiwan's largest companies such as
shipping group Evergreen and plastics giant Formosa.
But the thinking behind TAC goes back further. After Taiwan's rapid economic
growth as a low cost manufacturing centre, the island lost competitiveness
in the 1980s as wage and land costs increased sharply.
In an effort to upgrade its industrial base, the government designated ten
strategic industries which it pledged to foster. Aerospace was one of the
most important. Spurned by international arms suppliers until recently
because of worries over China relations, Taiwan had already been forced to
develop with foreign assistance its own military aircraft, the Indigenous
Defence Fighter (IDF).
This has received mixed reviews, but the government was concerned that
because its programmes were military, key aerospace-related technology was
being denied the private sector.
Starting in 1990, it set up two government agencies to co-ordinate the
public and private sectors and inject aerospace technology into industry.
Finally, with the creation of TAC, it launched a high-profile procurer of
foreign technology.
Under the memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, final assembly of
BAe's RJ family will be split, initially at least, between the UK and TAC's
factory in central Taiwan.
Mr Charles Masefield, president, BAe regional aircraft, said there will be
'no limit' on technology transfer to Taiwan. It could include transfer of
BAe's wing design aerodynamics, used on the European Airbus, as well as
electronics and avionics, he said.
In return, BAe will receive about Pounds 135m for 50 per cent of the
division, and access to Asia through a cheaper manufacturing base. Mr Denny
Ko, president, TAC, estimated skilled Taiwan labour costs are 30 per cent
below Europe. BAe said it can cut costs 20 per cent to 25 per cent by moving
to Asia.
Precise details on where components will be manufactured have not been
agreed. Other, cheaper Asian locations may be used.
BAe already makes undercarriage doors for the 146 aircraft in north east
China. Mr Masefield said the proportion of manufacturing transferred from
the UK would depend 'entirely on whether it is cost effective'.
The joint venture is due to begin operations on January 1 next year. Before
then the two sides will decide how it is to be structured. They have agreed
already, however, that marketing and support will be co-ordinated on a
worldwide rather than regional basis.
Aerospace analysts in Taiwan said the joint venture was likely to be a good
deal for TAC. There are fears, however, that TAC is trying again to link up
with a troubled Western aerospace company.
Doubts also remain how substantial a company TAC really is. This is mainly
because of the perceived failure to agree although there are fears again
doubts remain about how substantial a company it is.
This is mainly because of the perceived failure to agree terms with McDonnel
Douglas. Mr Ko said TAC's factory, which only recently started production of
some small parts for the IDF, could quickly be expanded with up to 300 more
workers.
'The advantage with BAe is that we are getting in on a deal which is
on-going. That makes it easier to raise the money,' he said.
Under an agreement reached when TAC was set up, shareholders are due to
increase their investment by NTDollars 4.2bn later this year, lifting TAC's
capital base to NTDollars 5.5bn.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hatfield loses its heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPEED and detail of the local reaction yesterday to the BAe announcement
that it intended to close its Hatfield factory by the end of next year
showed the decision was not unexpected. But it still came as a numbing blow
to the local workforce.
Specific plans for alleviating the difficulties of the 2,300 to be made
redundant and for bringing new jobs to the area were announced by local
authorities and the Hertfordshire Training and Enterprise Council (TEC)
virtually immediately.
However, there was no attempt to hide the scale of the problems the local
economy will now face.
'It's impossible to exaggerate the impact locally and the size of the
disaster for Hatfield,' said Mr David Riddell, chief executive of Welwyn
Hatfield Council.
The workforce clocking on for the afternoon shift agreed. Mr Bob Cartwright,
a machinist at the factory for 10 years, said the news had not been
unexpected because of the steady reduction in the workforce in recent years,
and the worldwide problems facing the aerospace industry.
'But it still comes as a very nasty shock. Nearly everyone you know around
here works for BAe. Something like this touches every family,' He said. He
expects a redundancy pay-off of around Pounds 7,000 and does not want to
move away from the area. A problem he shares with many others is the fall in
the value of his house - by at least Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 65,000 - which
reduces his job mobility.
According to the local TEC, which is putting up around Pounds 500,000 of the
money targetted to alleviate the growing unemployment problems, 85 per cent
of those redundant are men and over 1,000 are skilled technicians. About 40
per cent of the workforce lives in Welwyn and Hatfield, and a further 40 per
cent in the rest of Hertfordshire.
The problem is that Hatfield is already a jobless blackspot, with an average
unemployment level of 9 per cent, and with 17.5 per cent out of work in some
areas.
British Aerospace suppliers in Hertfordshire are set to lose around Pounds
15m worth of orders a year. But the cumulative impact on the local economy
is likely to be twice as high.
It is Hatfield's pride as well as its pocket that is hurt, though. The town
has an unrivalled place in British aviation history having built many famous
aircraft, including the wartime Mosquito fighter-bomber, the de Havilland
Comet airliner and, more recently, the Trident, the 125 executive jet and
the 146 regional jetliner. There were 7,500 employed at the Hatfield factory
until the mid-1980s but since then the rundown has been steady.
In 1989, the weapons' operation was closed and, as the recession cut deeply
into the world aviation market, the company was forced to reduce production
costs to remain competitive.
There was very little criticism locally of the company. Its closure decision
was seen as the inevitable result of market forces and the fall in demand
for commercial aircraft.
'No blame attaches to BAe. We understand the pressures they have had to face
and the efforts they have made to keep the factory open,' said Mr Riddell.

HATFIELD: SIX DECADES OF AVIATION HISTORY
The de Havilland Aircraft Company established its headquarters in Hatfield
in 1930.
The company was started 20 years earlier by Sir Geoffrey de Havilland in a
rented field at Stag Lane, Edgware, north London.
It was Hatfield that historic aeroplanes such as the Tiger Moth, Mosquito
and Vampire came into existence.  But it is probably most famous for being
the birthplace of the world's first jet airliner, the Comet, which entered
service in 1952.
By 1934 a new factory and offices had been built at Hatfield and production
of Tiger Moth trainers and Dragon light transport aircraft was under way.
At the outbreak of war, de Havilland turned to military aircraft and created
the Mosquito - a revolutionary twin-engined, high-speed fighter-bomber made
of wood.  Nearly 8,000 were eventually built.
During the post-war period the Hatfield design team worked on both civil and
military projects.
One of their greatest successes was the distinctive Vampire jet fighter,
distinguished by its unusual twin-boom tail.
The aircraft and its derivatives sold in large numbers to the RAF and the
Royal Navy and became the first jet fighter to fly in many of the world's
air forces.
De Havilland in the UK became absorbed into today's British Aerospace via a
merger in the 1960s with Hawker Siddeley.  In Canada, the company's Toronto
offshoot went on using the name, made famous there initially by de Havilland
Canada's Chipmunk two-seat trainer.
The name survives today as a subsidiary of Bombadier, the Canadian
engineering and transport conglomerate.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why goodwill can be
bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following what turned out in 1991 to be the advertising industry's worst
post-war year, few advertising agencies are prepared to square up precisely
to how financially strapped they are. The recession could hardly have come
at a worse time, following as it did the acquisition-driven merger mania of
the previous decade and ensuing debts.
However, investors in the advertising sector can now turn for guidance to a
report* produced by Willott Kingston Smith, the London-based accountancy
firm.
Taking as the basis for its survey the most recent annual accounts of 50
public and private companies, the study concludes that, in aggregate terms,
the companies paid 45 per cent of their combined operating profits - Pounds
97m - in interest during their last financial year. This compared with
Pounds 81m (22 per cent) the previous year.
Collectively, pre-tax profits collapsed by 76 per cent and profit margins
halved; 36 per cent of the companies incurred a pre-tax loss, compared with
16 per cent a year earlier.
In terms of returns on capital employed, the study concludes that the
advertising sector, overall, has fallen behind expectations.
The survey states that 'the measurement of profits as a return on capital
employed in the business has become of increasing importance' following
agencies' acquisitions of other companies, investment in freehold properties
and spending 'on anything from information technology to fleets of smart
cars. At its most basic, the return on the investment must leave a margin of
profit after paying interest on the capital borrowed to run the business.'
The report points out that 'the balance sheets of acquisitive UK public
companies do not show the full extent of the capital which has been ploughed
into the business' because of the perfectly legal practice of immediately
writing off any amounts paid for the goodwill of companies which have been
acquired in the past. This was a practice popular with many of the companies
in the report in the 1980s, since it helped them with further acquisitions.
Willott Kingston Smith have thus reconstructed the balance sheets of the
companies involved to include the goodwill as an asset, giving 'a more
meaningful view of the total capital employed'.
On that adjusted basis, 'the return on average capital employed by the top
50 groups (including both quoted and private companies) . . . was a meagre
4.38 per cent. Much higher returns averaging 10.2 per cent were achieved by
many of the unquoted UK groups, particularly those which have eschewed the
acquisition trail.
'But the returns achieved by most UK quoted groups, after reinstating
goodwill write-offs, were quite unacceptable at an average of just 0.4 per
cent. Only CIA group (31.3 per cent), Geers Gross (26.4 per cent) and Abbott
Mead Vickers (21.9 per cent) could claim to be operating at a respectable
margin. None of the three had been particularly acquisitive.'

degrees / A look at a new generation of universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On August 1, the citizens of east London awoke to find their streets
festooned with banners proclaiming the birth of a new university.
How many realised Greenwich University was none other than Thames
Polytechnic in new garb? Only, perhaps, early birds who witnessed the
respraying of its vans, or the men abseiling down the side of the poly's
main Woolwich building to remove the old signs.
For South Bank Polytechnic, also reincarnated as a university in the summer,
new logos were just the beginning. Posters proclaiming 'a university without
ivory towers', 'poly gone' and 'universities challenged' have been bemusing
commuters and would-be students alike.
The opportunity given to Britain's 36 polytechnics to call themselves
universities, under the government's policy of creating a unified higher
education sector, has been seized by most to relaunch themselves.
Poly directors, not renowned for inspirational marketing, now gossip about
'corporate identity' and 'Swot analysis' - analysing Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats to their market share. Image and PR consultants
are doing a roaring trade.
The name changes tell much of the story. Leicester Poly adopted the city's
medieval earl to become De Montfort University; Liverpool took on the local
tycoon - whose son, fortuitously, is chairman of its governors - and is now
Liverpool John Moores University.
Even the least pretentious name changes reflect careful positioning. Says
Valerie Stead, Greenwich's deputy vice-chancellor: 'We found the name
(Thames Poly) a liability, because nobody was quite sure where we were.' Six
agencies were asked to tender for a name and logo: Greenwich and the
compass, put forward by Primary Contact, a subsidiary of Ogilvy &amp; Mather,
triumphed after market research showed Greenwich to be the second best-known
place in London after the Tower.
Leicester Polytechnic, on the other hand, selected De Montfort because it
wanted to escape close identification with its parent city. A 'distributed
university' with campuses in Milton Keynes and Leicester, to which colleges
in Lincoln and Bedford are likely soon to be added by mergers, it was keen
to project a regional image.
According to Jan Hall, an executive with Coley, Porter, Bell (CPB), the
corporate identity consultants employed by the new university: 'De Montfort
conjures up all the right feelings of status and quality - and the name is
well known in the Leicester area. In our surveys, it went down particularly
well with the overseas students and employers: it's clearly British and
prestigious-sounding.'
CPB's Swot analysis for De Montfort and North London University - its other
former poly client - showed the main 'threat' to be the very change of
formal status for which polys had been campaigning. Says Hall: 'Most of the
polys had strong local links with sections of the community not used to
higher education. Many of the mature students we canvassed - particularly
those on part-time courses - told us they'd never have thought they were up
to a university, or variations on that.' Hence the emphasis on 'no ivory
towers at the Elephant and Castle'.
Greenwich's promotional literature stresses that as a university it will
'continue to encourage applications from older students who don't
necessarily have traditional qualifications'. It has no intention of
changing its course portfolio, or of seeking to reduce from 47 per cent the
proportion of its students aged 25 or over.
With most of the new titles barely a few months old, it is too soon to say
what the new names, logos and marketing have done for recruitment. In
London, where the concentration of institutions generates fierce
competition, efforts at differentiation are intense. According to John
Callen, head of marketing at North London, 'It's not just new logos and
names. We are trying to destroy the segmentation in consumers' eyes about
the polys, while retaining loyalty as a student-focused, community
institution.'

FT  24 SEP 92 / Building orders show fall on year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the construction industry is tightening rather than
slackening its grip, according to government figures published yesterday.
The Environment Department said that construction orders won by British
contractors fell 16 per cent during the three months to the end of July
compared with the corresponding period last year.
Private-sector orders by industry and commerce were among the worst
affected.
Private industrial orders were 26 per cent lower than in the corresponding
period a year before, while private commercial orders, mainly for offices
and shops, were 22 per cent lower.
Private housing orders on the same basis were 15 per cent lower. However,
public housing orders, including those from housing associations, were 24
per cent higher than in the corresponding period.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Maxwell probe fees detailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS AND lawyers to the Maxwell private companies have charged as
fees 10 per cent of the proceeds from sales of assets so far raised, the
Commons social security committee learned yesterday.
Mr John Talbot, head of insolvency at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm,
who is one of the administrators to the companies, said realisations by the
end of July were Pounds 110m.
The administrators' fees were Pounds 6m up to that date, including Pounds 4m
already billed. The legal fees so far were Pounds 5m, of which Pounds 4m has
already been billed.
Arthur Andersen's own billed time rose to a maximum of 18,000 hours in
January, falling to just over 6,000 hours by the end of July.
The realisations included the sale of 52 of the 55 trading businesses
controlled by the administrators.
So far, investigations costing Pounds 400,000 have yielded recoveries of
Pounds 4m. Administration and legal costs yet to lead to recoveries have
totalled Pounds 3m to date.
Separately, Mr Talbot said that total cash outflows from the private
companies last year were Pounds 1.2bn. That included Pounds 204m in offshore
purchases of shares in MCC and MGN, in addition to Pounds 45m which was
disclosed in the accounts.
There were bank loan repayments of Pounds 261m, overdraft repayments of
Pounds 240m and loan interest and bank charges of Pounds 123m. A further
Pounds 5m is under investigation.
There was also Pounds 25m allocated last year to PH (US), a US-based company
ultimately controlled by the Maxwell Foundation, based in Liechtenstein.
He said there had been 114 transactions with trusts, and said most had taken
place in 1991, although his team was also examining transactions during 1989
and 1990.
Cash inflows last year included Pounds 194m from Bishopsgate Investment
Management, which Mr Talbot said he believed was largely 'pensioners'
money'. There was also Pounds 37m gained with the acquisition of the New
York Daily News, and Pounds 239m in new bank loans and overdrafts.
There has been criticism from Maxwell pensioners of the level of
professional fees.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Spending rises but output remains flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER SPENDING rose in the second quarter for the first time in two years
in the second quarter, but official figures confirmed that overall output in
the UK was flat.
Expenditure by consumers on durable goods, energy, food, clothing and
services - which accounts for about three quarters of gross domestic product
 -rose by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first
quarter, the first quarterly rise since the three months to June 1990.
However, fixed investment continued to move downwards in the second quarter.
It fell by 2.5 per cent on the previous quarter and was 3.5 per cent lower
than a year ago.
The revised figures from the Central Statistical Office confirmed that
overall GDP fell by 0.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the
first, to stand 0.6 per cent lower than in the same period a year before.
Apart from a small upward blip in the third quarter of last year, this was
the eighth successive fall in GDP.
Excluding oil and gas extraction, GDP rose by 0.1 per cent in the three
months to June, ending seven quarters of falling on-shore output. It was 0.9
per cent lower than the same quarter a year before.
'Overall, today's data confirm the picture of an economy bumping along the
bottom, ready to pick up but with no strong impetus to do so,' said Mr Kevin
Gardiner of SG Warburg Securities.
The small rise in consumer expenditure was not unexpected. It followed
depressed levels of spending in the first quarter, when consumer confidence
was suppressed by pre-election nervousness.
Other highlights of yesterday's figures include:
A rise in general government consumption, which covers spending by central
government and local authorities, of 1.1 per cent on the previous quarter.
Compared with the same period a year before it fell by 0.5 per cent.
Sharp quarter-on-quarter rises in spending on clothing and footwear.
Spending on cars and beer also rose.
A 0.9 per cent fall in construction output compared with the previous
quarter. Output was down by 4.6 per cent compared with a year before.
Service-sector output was flat on the previous quarter but 0.3 per cent
lower than a year ago. Within that, hotels and catering rose by 0.5 per cent
on the previous quarter.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Barratt urges further interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LAWRIE BARRATT, one of Britain's best-known housebuilders, yesterday
called on the government to cut interest rates to 6 per cent and introduce
other incentives to help the UK housing market, which remained in a deep
recession.
Sir Lawrie, chairman of Barratt Developments, was called out of retirement
14 months ago to rescue the company after it incurred an annual loss of
Pounds 105.9m.
Yesterday the group said it had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.3m for
the 12 months to the end of June.
Sir Lawrie said in a letter to the prime minister and the chancellor, that
much more needed to be done if the housing market was to recover.
He contrasted the higher unemployment rate in Britain with that of the US,
which was also suffering from high trade and budget deficits.
'A bold approach must be taken to effect a major reduction in interest rates
more akin to the primate rate of 6 per cent prevailing in the US,' he wrote.
He also appealed for a permanent end to stamp duty on house sales which he
termed an 'iniquitous tax on home ownership'. He said: 'If it was right to
remove this tax in December last year to stimulate the housing market, then
it is even more essential to remove it again following the deterioration
which has taken place in the housing market since then.'
Sir Lawrie also called for the ceiling for mortgage tax relief to be raised
from Pounds 30,000 to more than Pounds 50,000.
He compared the failure to raise the tax allowance ceiling since 1983 with
increases in MPs' salaries during that time of 102 per cent and increases in
MPs' allowances of 225 per cent.
'The same treatment should be given to all homeowners entitled to mortgage
tax relief,' Sir Lawrie said.
He also called for a restoration of capital allowances to help the private
rented housing sector, which had fallen to just 7 per cent of the UK housing
stock.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Lamont shifts cabinet goalposts: Manoeuvrings that may spark
a ministerial battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Monday evening civil servants inserted an identical note into each of the
bulky red boxes that ministers take home at night to keep up with the flood
of paperwork generated by the Whitehall bureaucracy. The heading on the
briefing note was straightforward enough - 'ERM: new line to take'.
It was not remarkable that the Treasury was keen to ensure in such sensitive
times that cabinet ministers spoke with one voice about sterling's
ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. But a
significant shift in policy was concealed by the seemingly innocuous,
prepared responses to questions ministers might face.
Between the lines, the note confirmed that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
had unilaterally changed the emergency policy the cabinet had agreed four
days earlier in the immediate aftermath of the ERM debacle.
The tone reflected a substantial hardening in the Treasury's conditions for
the pound's eventual re-entry into the ERM; and a softening in the priority
that would be given to the defeat, as opposed to the control, of inflation.
Those changes foreshadowed the cut of 1 percentage point in interest rates
announced the next morning. They explain why the common front established by
the cabinet threatens to disintegrate into another full-scale battle over
Europe.
Colleagues say Mr Lamont has departed significantly from the spirit if not
the letter of the carefully worded deal struck at the end of last Thursday's
cabinet meeting. The chancellor's about-turn is the more remarkable because
he was most prominent in framing the statement issued after that meeting.
That statement, which reaffirmed government resolve in the fight against
inflation, said the pound would be put back into the ERM 'as soon as
conditions allow'.
It followed a long debate in which Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary,
put the case for semi-permanent suspension. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, argued forcefully for quick re-entry.
There was a general discussion of the need for the turmoil on the markets to
subside and for some structural reform of the ERM. But by the end, a clear
majority agreed that sterling's departure should be strictly temporary and
the government's commitment to Europe undiminished.
The only real backing for Mr Howard came from Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, and, to a lesser extent, from Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, lined up with Mr Clarke.
Mr Lamont was the most forceful in demanding that the 'as-soon-as' phrase be
released publicly to underpin confidence in the markets. He repeatedly
emphasised the need not to let up in the fight against inflation.
The timescale was not defined. But pro-European ministers such as Mr
Heseltine and Mr Clarke left Downing Street content that the phrase meant
weeks or at most two or three months. Everyone agreed that they should not
reveal the content of the debate but, as one put it: 'We were sure that
Norman (Lamont) was on our (the pro-ERM) side.'
Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke have stuck to the cabinet line, modifying it only
to accommodate Mr John Major's decision that the workings of the ERM should
be central to the agenda of the emergency summit of EC leaders next month.
But Mr Lamont has rejoiced in his new-found freedom, lengthening the list of
conditions for re-entry to the ERM and announcing a quick cut in interest
rates in spite of a 10 per cent devaluation of the pound.
He has reminded colleagues that he has always been on the Eure-sceptic wing
of the party. He has talked publicly of the new 'British' economic policy
the government will pursue.
His anti-inflation rhetoric has been subtly modified to put the aim of
economic growth alongside that of low, rather than zero, inflation. Other
ministers are beginning to suspect that the chancellor may now want to stay
outside the ERM indefinitely. They are determined to fight that policy.
Mr Major has so far remained neutral. A Euro-sceptic edge has crept into his
rhetoric and he sanctioned the reduction in interest rates - but he has
consulted closely with Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine.
He may be playing a tactical game - aiming to win back the 'soft' Tory
Euro-sceptics by securing an end to recession before rebuilding his economic
and European policies. Pro-European ministers are giving him the benefit of
the doubt.
The same cannot be said of Mr Lamont. Some colleagues believe that the
chancellor has decided to buttress his own position by emerging as the most
prominent spokesman in the government for the Tory Euro-sceptic wing.
When the chancellor joins his colleagues for this morning's cabinet meeting
he will be able to point to the intense strains on the ERM this week as
justification for his caution on re-entry. But if he confirms the suspicion
that he intends to embark on an economic policy that detaches Britain from
the European mainstream he will be setting the stage for a bitter cabinet
struggle.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Local rivals unite in gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Hertfordshire town of Stevenage, Mr Clive Willmott, chairman of the
local Chamber of Commerce, and Mr Alan Daley, a street trader - 'cash paid
for old gold' - voted differently at the general election.
But they now appear to have much in common on the economy and Europe.
Mr Willmott, who works as a financial services consultant in Stevenage's
industrial park, remains unimpressed by the government's performance of
late, is not convinced that the latest cut in interest rates is sufficient
to help some of his members who are on the verge of bankruptcy, and
considers his commitment to the 'European ideal' undented.
'If I'd been running my company the way the government has been running the
economy over the last week I would have gone bust a long time ago,' he said.
'You sack whole boards for this kind of thing.
'You can't blame it on the Germans or the ERM . . . you mustn't lose sight
of the fact that we've had two world wars and European economic integration
is intended to stop that from ever happening again.'
Mr Daley looked despondently at the trickle of people making their way along
the market stalls. 'Interest rates cut? It's had absolutely no effect here
today,' he said. 'People are fed up with the word interest rate, down today,
up tomorrow. We need good tough negotiators like Kohl and Mitterrand.'
Euro-sceptics could take comfort in the comment of Mr Paul Stevens, a postal
worker: 'If there was a referendum here tomorrow, the majority of us would
vote No, wouldn't we?'
In 1946, Stevenage - twinned with Ingelheim in Germany and Autun in France -
was designated as the first new town for blitzed Londoners. But the dream of
housing and jobs for all has turned sour in recent years. Unemployment has
risen in the past three years from 4 per cent to 10.7 per cent.
The recession has been most obviously felt in redundancies by the town's
biggest employer, British Aerospace.
Mr David Cullen, a member of the majority Labour council who works as a
dynamics systems engineer at the local BAe plant, said: 'The perception here
is that the government has screwed up, rather than Europe. Many of my work
colleagues are white-collar staff who voted Conservative but now feel
conned.'
While the mood was overwhelmingly negative on the government's economic
performance, it was by no means unanimous. Mrs Diane Clark, a health
visitor, welcomed the interest rate cut. 'We've been trying to sell my house
without success for six months and buy another one with a mortgage we can
afford. We are in with a chance now.'

FT  24 SEP 92 / More join ranks of the enemy within: The groundswell of
Conservative opinion against the Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO WONDER prime minister John Major has been adopting a Euro-sceptic tone of
late.
When he stands up to open today's emergency Commons debate on the
government's economic policy, he will be more conscious than ever of the
enemy within. It is the Conservative MPs who hold extreme doubts about the
text of the Maastricht treaty. As he weighs whether or not he can push the
treaty through parliament, Mr Major will be all too aware that the doubters'
ranks are growing.
A straw poll by the FT of Tory backbench opinion indicates that the number
of MPs prepared to defy the government, if it pushes for the Maastricht
treaty to be ratified without significant additions or amendments, has risen
to at least 40.
When the bill ratifying the treaty received its second Commons reading with
a majority of 244 four months ago, 22 Tories voted against the government.
Those who supported the government in May, but now say they could not back
the bill on the Maastricht treaty if it returned to the Commons unamended,
include: Sir George Gardiner, MP for Reigate; Mr Geoffrey Dickens,
Littleborough and Saddleworth; Mr Michael Lord, Suffolk Central; Mr John
Wilkinson, Ruislip-Northwood; Mr Andrew Hargreaves, Birmingham Hall Green;
Mr John Whittingdale, Colchester South and Maldon; Mr John Townend,
Bridlington; Mr Peter Griffiths, Portsmouth North; and Mr Michael Fabricant,
Mid Staffordshire.
In addition, Mr Roger Moate, MP for Faversham, who abstained on the second
reading, said he would now vote against unless there were 'enormous
amendments', while Mr Roger Knapman, MP for Stroud, who also abstained, said
he would not support the treaty 'in anything like its present form'.
The analysis - compiled from direct contact with a large number of Tory MPs
 -showed a wide divergence of opinion. Discontent with the text of the
treaty has increased markedly. But there were still those who saw no
difficulty either with the treaty or the government's ability to have it
ratified.
'I have no qualms about it whatsoever,' said Mr Robert Adley, MP for
Christchurch. 'I think the prime minister has a substantial majority in
favour across the parties.'
In addition to the 40 or more potential rebels, there was a sizeable
grouping of MPs who admitted to misgivings and stopped well short of
pledging unconditional support.
'If there is any thought of bulldozing through the same thing again, they
will find a lot of people like me hesitating,' said Mr James Hill, MP for
Southampton Test. Mr Nigel Waterson, MP for Mr Ian Gow's old seat of
Eastbourne, said: 'They cannot necessarily count on my support.'
A further sobering feature for the government was the number of MPs elected
for the first time at the general election in April who are among the most
sceptical. Many of those signed the motion in June that called on the
government to 'make a fresh start with the future development of the EC' in
the wake of the Danish referendum.
Most of those with reservations focused on the centralisation of powers and
the process of economic and financial integration. Backing for a single
European market was all but unanimous.
On centralisation, many MPs called for a clearer definition of the concept
of subsidiarity as set out in the treaty. The trouble with the present
definition was that 'you could drive a coach and horses through it',
according to Mr Fabricant, who said he would vote against ratification of
Maastricht 'as it stands at present'.
On financial integration, disillusioned MPs urged either extensive ERM
reform or recognition that the system was dead.
'I don't want us to go back into the ERM, so I don't see how I can support
Maastricht as it is,' said Mr Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench
finance committee. Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said: 'Any party
who say after this we are going back into the ERM should be consigned to
Devil's Island.' Circumstances would have to be 'very strange' for him to
support the Maastricht treaty if it returned to the Commons unamended.
Some MPs argued that the fault with the bill lay less in the text than the
government's failure to outline adequately what the treaty said. 'It is not
what is in Maastricht but what people think is in it,' said Mr Roger Sims,
MP for Chislehurst.
Many of the most sceptical prefaced their remarks by emphasising they were
not in the anti-European camp. Mr Griffiths said opposition was now coming
from 'committed Europeans' unhappy with the structures being proposed.
There was a common view among Euro-sceptics that they had supported the
government on the bill's second reading as a vote of thanks to Mr Major and
foreign secretary Douglas Hurd for negotiating UK opt-outs on the social
chapter and monetary union.
Some were also influenced by the assumption - since dispelled - that their
reservations would not be shared by significant numbers in other member
countries. 'One swallowed the bits one didn't like on the assumption the
rest of Europe was mad keen to go along,' according to one experienced MP,
who said Maastricht was now 'holed under the water'.
Mr Dickens said: 'It is nice to think we are not the only nation whingeing.'
There were several calls for a British referendum, although others were just
as passionately against such a step. A further group said the appropriate
time for a referendum would be prior to any decision to opt into a single
currency. Euro-enthusiast Mr Spencer Batiste, MP for Elmet, said: 'If there
is to be a referendum, it should be when the option on a single currency is
exercised.'

FT  24 SEP 92 / Labour split on Europe is staved off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday managed to avoid an open frontbench split over Europe
before today's critical Commons debate on the government's economic policy.
The party's ruling national executive committee rejected a referendum on
Maastricht, but many in the party believe that a showdown between Mr Bryan
Gould, shadow heritage secretary and a leading Labour Euro-sceptic, and Mr
John Smith, party leader, has been postponed rather than averted.
Mr Gould abstained in the NEC vote which approved by 24-2 a new policy
statement about economic and political co-operation in Europe. Earlier in
the meeting he joined Mr Tony Benn in supporting unsuccessfully a call from
Mr Dennis Skinner for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the UK's
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism.
The leadership's uncompromising stance was seen in the rejection, by 22
votes to six, of a proposal from Mr David Blunkett - who ran Mr Gould's
failed campaign for the Labour leadership - that the party leave itself some
leeway on holding a referendum. At a separate meeting later, however, five
of the 20-plus shadow cabinet members expressed at least some sympathy with
the idea of a referendum.
The policy statement agreed yesterday confirms Labour's support for 'a
managed system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, agreed through
international co-operation', and calls for stronger European action to
reduce currency speculation.
The paper also reaffirms the party's commitment to the UK's being at the
heart of Europe, pledging that Labour 'will continue to set out a positive
agenda for the devel-opment of the Community'.
Mr Gould is said to have been unhappy with the pro-European tone of the
statement.
The trigger for any possible split may come when the party decides what
tactics to adopt over the Maastricht bill. The shadow cabinet agreed
yesterday to remain silent on its approach to the legislation until the
government position is clearer.
Mr Smith reminded the shadow cabinet that while he had allowed public debate
on the party's attitude towards Europe in the run-up to yesterday's
meetings, the normal rules of collective responsibility would apply now that
decisions had been taken.
But Ms Clare Short, a 'soft-left' NEC member, said the paper did not
represent an end to discussion on the issue. 'It is still open season for
intelligent debate,' she said.
The first real test of whether Mr Gould intends to abide by the new policy
statement will be his appearance this morning at a press conference to
publish a pamphlet critical of the leadership's stance. Further indications
will come next week, when he will appear at several fringe meetings at the
Labour party conference in Blackpool - including, on Sunday, the
Euro-sceptic Common Market Safeguards Committee.
Meanwhile, the leadership was aiming to play down the significance of
articles to be published in two leftwing papers this morning, in which Mr
Gould returns to the attack on the Maastricht treaty. Officials pointed out
that the pieces were written before yesterday's meetings.
In New Statesman and Society Mr Gould describes the accord as 'a totally
overt, not to say shameless, statement of the bankers' view' of Europe while
in Tribune he warns against 'the establishment' in words that will be widely
read as a fierce attack on Mr Smith.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Indonesia denies piracy link in ships' collision

<TEXT>
INDONESIA has denied reports that pirates were involved in a collision last
weekend between an oil tanker and a container ship in the Strait of Malacca,
which divides the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Malay peninsula.
The collision left one person dead, 29 missing and a huge oil slick in one
of the world's busiest shipping channels.
An Indonesian team yesterday boarded the Nagasaki Spirit, a 96,000 tonne
Liberian-registered tanker, and the Ocean Blessing, a Panamanian-registered
container ship.
Concern over the involvement of pirates followed the release by Orient
Overseas Container Line, the Hong Kong operators of the container, of their
captain's last radio message: 'We're being fired upon and have a fire on
board in several of the tanks. We're abandoning ship. No more time for
messages'.
Rear Admiral Yusuf Effendi, the Indonesian naval commander co-ordinating
rescue operations, has dismissed a link with piracy. He said the collision
occurred at the widest point of the strait where ships cruise at normal
speed, making it difficult for pirates to board. The channel, however, is
notorious for piracy, with more than 100 incidents in the first half of the
year.
Indonesia will refuse passage to a proposed shipment of about a tonne of
radioactive plutonium from France to Japan. Details of the shipment's timing
and route on board a Japanese vessel have not been released.
'We have clarification from the Japanese government that security steps
would be taken (to protect the shipment). . . but an accident may happen at
any time,' a foreign ministry spokesman said. However, the quickest route
for the shipment would be through the Strait of Malacca, to which Indonesia
cannot legally deny access.

<TEXT>
AN investigation by Taiwan authorities into an estimated TDollars 8bn
(Pounds 184.5m) of stock defaults has intensified with the detention
yesterday of four market players in connection with illegal lending and
other securities offences.
Two of the four - both renowned as 'big hands' - were later released on
bail.
The move follows the arrest last Sunday of Mr Lei Po-lung, another of the
market's big players, which sent share prices tumbling 6 per cent by
Monday's close. Mr Lei is alleged to be responsible for at least some of the
defaulted payments and has been charged with breach of securities trading
laws.
The defaults are thought to be linked to Hualon, the textile and insurance
group which was allegedly involved in an insider trading scandal last year.
Mr Lei has claimed he purchased stocks on behalf of the group, which they
then failed to pay him for.
Within the past two weeks the government has introduced measures aimed at
stabilising the battered market.
Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said last week it would
tighten trading regulations, and the central bank eased its policy on
remittances into the country by foreign institutions for investment in
equities.
A remittance by Fidelity Investments of USDollars 60m (Pounds 35m) was
approved last week; the bank then approved a USDollars 50m application by
Pierson Heldring and Pierson of the Netherlands on Tuesday. The SEC has said
other applications would be considered speedily.
Analysts say these steps will do little in the short term to improve
investor confidence, already damaged by the arrest on September 10 of Mr
Weng Ta-ming, the ailing head of Hualon, for his alleged involvement in a
TDollars 600m insider dealing scandal.
Although the market made a slight recovery yesterday, stocks previously
associated with Hualon have repeatedly fallen this week by the permitted 7
per cent daily limit.

UNITED NATIONS efforts to ensure free elections in Cambodia are in trouble
because of the 'persistent failure' of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group to
abide by peace agreements reached in Paris, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, said yesterday.
In a report to the Security Council he voiced serious concern over the
continuing refusal of the Khmer Rouge to allow UN military and civilian
personnel access to the zones it controls. Its forces still eluded
demobilisation, he added.
Mr Boutros Ghali suggested the co-chairmen of the Paris conference - the
French and Indonesian foreign ministers - hold talks to find a way out of
what he acknowledged is an impasse. If this proved impossible they could
explore 'appropriate steps' to ensure realisation of the fundamental
objectives of the accord.
With a budget of Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.11bn) the UN operation, begun last
November with great fanfare, is the most ambitious of its kind. From the
start the Khmer Rouge, the country's largest guerrilla army, was reluctant
to co-operate.
'It is clear the time is approaching when some difficult decisions regarding
ways and means of pursuing this operation will have to be considered,' Mr
Boutros Ghali wrote in a gloomy account of the situation.
The Khmer Rouge leadership must be told of the UN's resolve to implement its
peace-keeping mandates 'vigorously and to the full'. To that end the
Security Council might want to take further action to emphasise the
international community's determination to bring peace to Cambodia and
enable its people to look to a better future.
The UN peace-keeping authority in Cambodia is to take direct control of the
country's central bank, a spokesman for the world body said yesterday,
Reuter adds from Phnom Penh.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Iran and UAE seek to defuse island dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to hold talks over the island
of Abu Musa in an attempt to defuse a tense dispute over control of the
territory, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent.
Senior Foreign Ministry officials from both countries are due to meet in Abu
Dhabi on Sunday in the first direct attempt to conciliate in a row which
broke in April when the UAE accused Iran of annexing the island.
The UAE also accused Tehran of expelling hundreds of the emirates' nationals
from the island and said it was in breach of a 1971 agreement under which
Sharjah claimed sovereignty over the island, on which Tehran was permitted
to station a garrison.
The island, with a population of less than 2,000, commands the Gulf's main
shipping lanes between the coast of Iran and Sharjah.
Iran said on September 10 it was the sole owner of the island. The
declaration prompted condemnations of Tehran's 'aggression' from the Arab
League and the Gulf Co-operation Council, comprising Saudi Arabia, UAE,
Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.

FT  24 SEP 92 / 'Real US' on offer in political package tour: Japanese
tourists to pay for the chance to see democracy in operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TOKYO travel agency has launched a group tour for Japanese who want to see
how democracy works or, at least, to see how a US presidential election is
conducted.
In eight politics-packed days the tourists will view the site of President
John F. Kennedy's assassination, marvel at Democratic candidate Bill
Clinton's campaign office in Arkansas, and see the sights of the Cable News
Network (CNN) studios in Washington.
The climax will come on polling day, November 3, when the travellers are
promised a front-row seat at the unfolding of history. As the brochure puts
it, they will experience 'the real America' and see 'something completely
unlike Japanese politics'.
Mr Hideo Soshi, sales manager at Pacific Tour Systems, said the strongest
selling point for the tour, a pricey Y598,000 (Pounds 2,900), is the
opportunity to view close up a political system widely different from that
of Japan.
'Our system is grey and unclear. In the US, politics is vivid and clear.
Many Japanese are interested in seeing the real America and America seems to
be at its most real during elections,' he said.
Whether attracted by the real or the surreal, in the two days the US
Presidential Election Tour has been advertised 10 people have applied for
the 20 vacancies. Mr Soshi views the response as vindication of 'our unique,
distinguished concept'.
Japanese politics is certainly passing through one of its greyer phases,
which could be an incentive to take a tour of the US political system. Since
late last month Mr Shin Kanemaru, the country's most powerful politician,
has refused to let prosecutors question him over a possibly illegal Y500m
donation from a parcel delivery company.
The prosecutors gave the 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party
until today to appear at their office, although Mr Kanemaru has not left his
house. He apparently keeps fit by walking his dog up and down the stairs,
and amuses himself by playing mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance.
Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister whom Mr Kanemaru claims to
have appointed, is as much a spectator of events as will be the Japanese on
the US Presidential Election Tour. He has made no public statement on the
fate of Mr Kanemaru, who now holds no official title but still presides over
the party's largest faction.
Shrouded in this 'greyness', Japanese politics remains off the tourist
track. But, as Pacific Tour Systems promises in its brochure, with its
close-up of the White House and of Bill Clinton on the telephone 'the whole
world will be watching' Washington on election night, and 'you will be
there'.

<TEXT>
MR Chuan Leekpai, leader of the Democrat party, became prime minister of
Thailand yesterday, 10 days after the general election in which the
Democrats won the largest number of parliamentary seats.
The appointment of Mr Chuan, 54, a mild-mannered career politician admired
for his integrity, follows two years of political instability embracing the
military coup d'etat of February 1991 and the killing of at least 50
pro-democracy demonstrators by troops in May this year.
Foreign investors and local businessmen have welcomed Mr Chuan's victory,
but few political commentators believe his fragile parliamentary coalition
will heed his calls for unity and survive intact until the end of the
government's four-year term.
The Democrats and three allied political parties opposed to the armed
forces' action in May won only a slim majority in the election, forcing Mr
Chuan to bring in the pro-military Social Action party as a fifth coalition
partner.
'I fully realise that, from this minute, the task facing me is great and
limitless,' Mr Chuan said after receiving a royal decree naming him prime
minister.
Negotiations were continuing last night on the final shape of Mr Chuan's
cabinet. Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, president of Siam Commercial Bank, said
he had agreed to become finance minister.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the anti-corruption campaigner who led the street
protests in May and heads the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party, has so far
declined to accept the proffered portfolio of transport and communications,
a notorious source of corrupt earnings for politicians in previous
administrations.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Gaidar vows to fight on for radical reform: The hard-pressed
Russian premier sets out his market economy programme to John Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the acting Russian prime minister, yesterday said his
government would 'fight as long as we can' for radical reform.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he said he would not compromise
with the powerful centrist forces who are urging an end to the reform
programme in favour of an 'anti-crisis' package to support industry.
Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs,
warned yesterday that 'the government cannot carry out reform with the
opposition of business - it's nonsense'. Mr Gaidar said: 'Yes, we will
compromise on some things, such as on defence conversion. But we will not
compromise on whether or not we will go forward to a market economy'.
Mr Gaidar was speaking the day after challenging the parliament with a
speech promising a return to the harsh monetary discipline of the first
quarter of this year.
The government would still face calls for its resignation, Mr Gaidar said,
even though Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker, and a bitter foe of
government policy, on this occasion had deflected opposition calls for a
vote of no confidence. This had not defused the struggle but only postponed
it. 'We will see how the situation develops. We now face very tough
opposition in parliament.'
The prime minister acknowledged that tough limits on credits would cause
bankruptcies - and he forecast a bitter struggle over the passing of a
bankruptcy law.
As evidence of the government's determination, Mr Gaidar said it 'might be
possible' to bring inflation down to single monthly figures and to confine
the budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, as he had
pledged to the International Monetary Fund. Inflation is running at between
20 and 25 per cent a month and the budget deficit is estimated at between 14
and 17 per cent of GDP.
In a strong plea to the west for debt rescheduling, Mr Gaidar said Russia
could pay at most Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of debt repayments totalling
Dollars 12bn this year. 'We appreciate there are serious problems,
particularly with the Germans who are owed the most. We are negotiating. It
is absolutely crucial to our success.'
He outlined the three main areas of work in restoring order to the chaotic
finances.
First, he would negotiate the exit from the rouble zone of those former
Soviet republics - in particular Ukraine - who wished to create their own
currency. In the past week, credits advanced to Ukraine of around Rbs100bn
had 'pushed up inflation to new heights'.
The government has frozen all monetary transactions between the two
republics. Mr Gaidar said 'we had no choice. We are not in a position to
grant unlimited credits to third parties'. He said he was working on the
assumption Ukraine would create a new currency, as agreed, on October 1.
Second, Mr Gaidar would 'work intensively' with Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the
central bank acting chairman, to reduce credits to enterprises. 'The actions
taken by the central bank in this direction have been dangerous, but I do
not think it wants to undermine the financial policy'.
Third, privatisation of big state enterprises would be pushed ahead, and
extra resources made available to the privatisation committee. 'We have
terrible legal problems here, a lack of qualified staff. But so far we are
on schedule'. Some 7m privatisation vouchers, each worth Rbs10,000, have
been delivered.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, said yesterday that success
in this area would make the reforms irreversible.

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations decision to exclude the rump Yugoslav federation from the
UN general assembly will sharpen divisions inside Serbia and could decide
the fate of Prime Minister Milan Panic, his advisers said yesterday.
The resolution went through late on Tuesday night by an overwhelming
majority in the general assembly. Its aim is to put pressure on the Belgrade
government to end its support of Serbian militia forces fighting Moslem
forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina and to co-operate with UN and European
Community efforts in bringing peace. The resolution made clear that Belgrade
must reapply to the UN if it wants membership of the general assembly.
Mr Panic, who earlier this week pleaded with western governments in New York
not to 'undermine a man of peace', faces renewed criticism from hard-line
Serb nationalists who call the Californian businessman a 'traitor' and a
'CIA spy'.
Behind criticism levelled at Mr Panic in the socialist-dominated federal
parliament, and on television still controlled by Serbian president Slobodan
Milosevic, the political battle lines are being drawn between the two men.
On Mr Panic's side is General Zivota Panic, army chief of staff; the
fractured urban democratic opposition; and young entrepreneurs. So far, the
military has supported Mr Panic in the belief he can turn the army into a
professional body.
Mr Milosevic, now rarely seen in public, is flanked by Mr Vojislav Seselj,
leader of the far right-wing radical party, state-run factory managers, and
the rural community.
Earlier this week, Mr Seselj accused Mr Panic of manipulating the army into
agreeing to the UN peace plan to withdraw its forces from Prevlaka, a large
strategic military base on Croatia's Dalmatian coast. In this way Mr Seselj
hopes to win over a section of the army.
Sandwiched between the two sides is Mr Dobrica Cosic, a respected writer and
president of Yugoslavia. Once Mr Milosevic's mentor - he drew up the
blueprint for a greater Serbia in 1986 - Mr Cosic now believes the Milosevic
policies have brought shame and ruin to the Serbian people.
By throwing his authority behind Mr Panic, Mr Cosic hopes this will attract
public support, isolate Mr Milosevic and lead to lifting of sanctions.
But Mr Seselj and his nationalist supporters are determined to use Mr
Panic's failure to get sanctions lifted, or to prevent Yugoslavia from being
excluded from the UN general assembly, as a means of ousting the prime
minister.
Mr Panic is gaining grudging support inside Serbia, largely because more
Serbs believe there is no practical alternative to him. Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman said yesterday there was no need to renew the mandate for the
UN peacekeeping force in his republic when it expires next March, Reuter
reports from the UN.
More than 13,000 UN troops are stationed in parts of Croatia with large Serb
populations. More UN soldiers, including up to 1,800 from Britain, are being
sent to neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Croatian authorities want the UN force to quit the republic so they can
exercise sovereignty over the areas where the force is based, according to
one official at the UN.

GERMANY will seek a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council,
if a change in the council's composition is considered by the member states,
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said here yesterday.
However, he made it clear in a speech to the UN General Assembly that
Germany would not take the initiative on this matter, but that it would wait
until it came up in the context of future discussions on reform of the
Security Council.
Reform of the council, whose permanent membership - the US, Russia, China,
the UK and France - reflects the immediate post-second world war situation
and does not take account of more recent international developments, has
become a subject of growing public interest with the rise of major new
powers such as Germany and Japan.
Britain and France are opposed to any change in the council's composition
for the moment because it would make it more unwieldy and less effective.
They have been particularly dismissive of the suggestion that they should
give up their own seats in favour of a single EC seat.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German cabinet yesterday launched an emergency programme to prop up the
east's fragile industrial base and protect 400,000 jobs.
The scheme includes subsidised financing for foreign construction contracts
and the extension of export credit guarantees to barter deals with east
European customers who are chronically short of foreign exchange.
Bonn has also promised to double federal purchases from east German
companies and pay premium prices for goods and services.
The main aims are to maintain the former GDR's export links with eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union and to open up new markets in western
countries.
However, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, who proposed the scheme,
was told it must be financed out of existing resources. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said on Tuesday that current annual transfers from the west of DM150bn
(Pounds 59bn) marked the limit.
Mr Mollemann had claimed earlier that his proposals would need more than
DM10bn a year. However, under the stern eye of the Bundesbank, the
government is committed to a public spending freeze.
Approval of the scheme coincided with an appeal for action from the
federation of German industry (BDI). The existence of the east's entire
capital goods industry - which accounted for 38 per cent of total industrial
sales - was in danger, it said.
Western companies, meanwhile, were concerned that falling production and
order intake in their factories signalled further economic weakening, the
BDI said. The effects of the sluggish recovery in export markets had been
exacerbated by a 10 per cent increase in unit labour costs since 1990 and
the recent appreciation of the D-Mark.
It was becoming increasingly difficult for them to contemplate investing in
the east.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Swiss hold key to EC's transport policy: The Swiss have a
vital decision to make on Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPARED with the French referendum on Maastricht, the run-up to this
Sunday's six plebiscites in Switzerland is singularly lacking in drama.
And it must be said that most of the issues, such as whether being a federal
parliamentarian should be a full-time job, bore even the Swiss.
But one of them, on the construction of two new high-speed rail lines
through the country, will have a large and long-term impact on not only
Switzerland's but also Europe's transport policy.
The proposal, to invest a whopping SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.4bn) on two rail
tunnels through the Alps and related infrastructure, was the Swiss
government's counter-offer last year to its European neighbours who were fed
up with the country's severe restrictions on lorry transit.
Switzerland restricts lorry weights to 28 tonnes, whereas most trucks in the
EC move with 40-tonne loads. Rather than lighten loads at the Swiss border,
truckers prefer to travel through the Brenner pass in Austria or one of
three passes between France and Italy.
The result, to the increasing anger of the Austrians and French, is that
Switzerland absorbs less than a fifth of north-south trans-Alpine freight
tonnage.
The Swiss insist that their narrow Alpine valleys cannot take much more
lorry traffic, and last year they won EC agreement for their plan to build
an efficient, high speed rail system for piggy-backing lorry loads through
the country.
Many hope that this approach will eventually be adopted more widely in
Europe, easing the pressure on motorways and contributing to the overall
reduction of air pollution.
The plan has wide support in the centre of the political spectrum in
Switzerland, even though the cost frightens many people. The government has
warned that rejection would mean that Switzerland could no longer hold back
the EC's 40 tonne juggernauts.
But the Greens object because they say it only promotes the already
excessive transport of goods between EC countries. On the right, the
Automobile Party fears that all that spending on rail transport will take
away from budgets for improving Swiss roads.
The treaty between Switzerland and the EC that contains the tunnel proposal
also includes a new airline agreement that would give Swissair rights
similar to EC-based carriers in EC countries. And the campaign for
acceptance has received a vigorous last minute boost this week from Swissair
directors, who claim that it is vital for the airline's survival.
Another referendum is on abolishing stamp duties on most securities
transactions. In the past, Swiss ministers dismissed the banks' warnings
that these duties were driving business abroad.
But Swiss-controlled mutual funds based in Luxembourg totalled SFr179bn at
the end of last year compared with only SFr34bn in Switzerland. And, for the
first time in a decade, the number of people employed in banking declined.
Now the government is calling for abolition and even the socialist party is

FT  24 SEP 92 / Confidence vote on Italian budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITALIAN prime minister Giuliano Amato is planning to call a vote of
confidence in parliament on the 1993 budget announced last Thursday.
The aim is to accelerate the normally lengthy process of parliamentary
approval and to rally support for his four-party coalition government. He
has already used this device to good effect to force through his July
emergency economic package raising L30,000bn (Pounds 13.9bn) in fresh
revenues and spending cuts.
The new vote of confidence underlines Mr Amato's strategy of demonstrating
to a fractious parliament that, if his two-and-a-half-month-old government
falls, the country would face unprecedented political chaos and damaging
loss of international confidence. The Socialist premier's coalition of
Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals has a narrow
16-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
The 1993 budget proposes to raise L93,000bn in new taxes and expenditure
cuts in order to hold the public sector deficit down to L150,000bn,
equivalent to over 10.5 per cent of GDP. The proposals, which include cuts
in the health service, new wealth taxes, a cap on pensions and a freeze on
public sector employment, have provoked protests from almost every segment
of society.
Yesterday was the second day of a series of rolling, regional four-hour
general strikes, called by the three main trades union confederations and
these could foreshadow a national general strike. Union leaders are due to
meet the prime minister on Friday, the second time this week. The government
appears willing to make only minor amendments, largely related to ironing
out anomalies or catering for proven hardship cases such as certain
categories of pensioners.
No timetable has been fixed for the vote of confidence which has to be in
both houses of parliament. The government must wait until next week when the
Chamber is expected to endorse the Senate's vote giving the executive power
to reform pensions, the health service, local administration and the civil
service - reforms central to the 1993 budget.
The speed with which the budget is approved and the extent of amendments is
closely linked to the credibility of Italy re-entering the European Monetary
System. Seven local politicians in Rome were arrested yesterday on
allegations of taking billions of lira in bribes from a Milanese railway
equipment maker. The arrests follow months of investigations into the
accounts of Socimi, a Milan-based engineering group specialising in railway
and transport equipment.

SWEDEN remains deep in recession with a 1.2 per cent drop in gross national
product in the first half of the year, figures published yesterday show. The
economy is expected to show negative growth for the second successive year.
In 1991, Sweden's gross national product declined by 1.1 per cent. The
country has now experienced seven consecutive quarters of negative growth.
There was a 1.9 per cent drop in GNP in the first quarter followed by a more
modest 0.5 per cent decline in the April-June period.
Gross fixed investment declined by 6.5 per cent in the first six months,
with industrial investment down 8 per cent. Local authority investment fell
5 per cent. In 1991 gross fixed investment fell 7.3 per cent.
Industrial production declined by 1.5 per cent with a 4 per cent fall in
manufacturing. This follows a 5.4 per cent decline in industrial output for
the whole of last year. Manufacturing plant capacity use was down to 81.7
per cent in the second quarter of 1992.
There was a 3 per cent decline in the total number of hours worked and a 4
per cent contraction in employment during the first half of the year.
The slump is also hitting living standards. Households had a 0.5 per cent
decline in disposable incomes and there was a 1 per cent drop in private
consumption after a 1.2 per cent improvement last year.
There was a 16 per cent drop in car sales in the first six months and there
was also a sharp 8 per cent decline in the acquisition of household goods
such as furniture and home electronics.

LEGISLATURES in Austria and Switzerland have endorsed joining the European
Economic Area (EEA), paving the way for eventual full membership of an
enlarged European Community.
Switzerland's upper house yesterday voted in principle by 37 votes to two,
following the backing of the lower house a month ago. Membership must be
ratified in a national referendum on December 6.
The EEA treaty was signed in Oporto, Portugal, in May by the 12 EC nations
and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) members - Austria, Norway,
Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
By extending the EC rules on free flows of people, goods, capital and
services to the Efta states, the treaty creates a single European market of
380m people, accounting for 43 per cent of world trade.
In the Austrian National Assembly on Tuesday night the treaty was adopted by
deputies of the ruling Social Democrats and the conservative People's party,
which control 140 seats in the 183-seat assembly.
The treaty must still be passed by the upper house, or Federal Assembly, and
then signed by President Thomas Klestil for full ratification.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday launched a strong counter-attack against
the barrage of accusations of bureaucratic meddling and power-grabbing.
Senior officials fear the growing criticism could presage the Commission's
emasculation, or at least damaging legislative paralysis.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was described by a senior official
as feeling 'distinctly bruised' yesterday after Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
hitherto the Commission's most powerful ally, hinted late on Tuesday that
Brussels' powers may have to be curbed.
Commissioners, who devoted their weekly meeting yesterday to discussing the
Maastricht treaty crisis, reacted immediately, by wheeling out two of their
'big guns' to defend Brussels' role in the EC.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the German commissioner in charge of the internal
market, used the pretext of a mundane piece of single market legislation -
on the technical harmonisation of motorcycles - to defend Brussels' mission.
'In normal circumstances I wouldn't bore you with such a directive,' he told
journalists, but 'the work done by EC institutions has constantly to be
explained.'
This was a perfect example of 'subsidiarity' he argued - which in his view
meant action taken 'at the most appropriate level.' This was a case, he said
'where only European legislation can solve the problem.'
Despite Mr Bangemann's confident exposition, he himself sought the
endorsement of the 12 internal market ministers on Tuesday, even though they
gave their go-ahead to the principle of technical harmonisation in June.
Some of Mr Bangemann's Commission colleagues had challenged the measure,
fearing it might be portrayed as meddling.
Increasingly demoralised officials believe, however, that this sort of
cap-in-hand posture will rebound on the Commission, which under EC rules has
the sole right to propose legislation.
'If you get into a totally apologetic, nervous state, people will begin to
assume that you have a case to answer,' said one senior Commission official.
'Soon we will be asking for permission to go to the toilet.'
Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner who runs competition policy,
joined the fray last night, warning against the danger of 'Eurosclerosis'
again taking hold.
'We must not abandon all policymaking in the face of anxiety, and the fear
of one political hurdle after another,' he said.
He appealed for renewed confidence between the member states and EC
institutions. 'It is time to stop mutual recrimination and abandon the
search for scapegoats. The common interest is too important for such
futilities.'
A test of the Commission's own dwindling confidence should come soon, when
it has to decide whether to recommend further liberalisation of EC telephone
monopolies.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Industrialists fear fresh round of
devaluations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the European currency turmoil showing no signs of abating, the spectre
of competitive devaluation is starting to worry EC industrialists.
Exporters in Britain, Finland, Italy and Spain are trying to use the
declining value of their domestic currencies to boost their competitive
advantage on foreign markets. But if other weaker currencies, led by the
French franc, fail to defend their fragile parities against the D-Mark,
these gains will be eroded. This could lead to pressure for a further round
of 'beggar-thy-neighbour' devaluations in which the whole of Europe would be
the collective loser.
In Britain, companies such as ICI, the chemicals group, believe last week's
decision to float sterling will have a strong and immediate impact on
boosting exports.
But the Institute of Directors, which represents executives throughout the
UK, warned yesterday that the benefits expected from sterling's decline
would be undermined by the downward movement of other currencies such as the
lira and the peseta.
The currency crisis comes at a highly sensitive time for French exporters
who were, until recently, able to take advantage of low inflation and
relatively stable exchange rates to win back market shares abroad.
LVMH, the luxury goods group, although concerned about the possible effect
of declining foreign currencies on sales in the US, the UK and Italy,
yesterday stressed that it prefers the stability of ERM membership to the
short-term gains - or losses - of a floating franc.
The country whose exports are likely to be most vulnerable to foreign
devaluations is Germany.
'The west German economy has been brought to the brink of recession by the
sharp appreciation of the D-Mark,' concludes the economics team of Salomon
Brothers International.
Since the start of this year, the D-Mark has appreciated by more than 4 per
cent against other European currencies. The D-Mark has risen 11 per cent
against the lira, 10 per cent against sterling, and 7 per cent against the
peseta.
More than a quarter of Germany's exports have been affected by the recent
parity changes - making foreign markets much tougher places in which to do
business.
For export-oriented companies such as those in the motor, engineering,
electrical, chemical, and steel sectors, this puts a sharp extra squeeze on
margins.
The decline in the lira, for instance, will have a clear effect on exports
of the Volkswagen car group. Its sales to Italy account for nearly as many
VW exports as the UK and France combined.
Mr Bruno Kesseler, an economist with Westdeutsche Landesbank, says the
problems caused by D-Mark revaluation for exporters come at a time when the
boom effect of unification has worn off. 'Now, as the world economy is in a
weak phase, companies are affected massively by the extensive revaluation.'
The mechanical engineering industry is already in a crisis and not expected
to emerge until next year, while the electrical industry is showing almost
no growth, he says. Overall, he expects German industrial production to fall
back slightly this year; earlier, he had expected it to be flat. 'What we
are seeing,' he says 'is a marked downturn.' If the currency instability
continues, it could get worse.

treaty
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish government yesterday proposed adding a supplementary text to the
Maastricht treaty, in an attempt to overcome Danish voters' objections about
the Community's democratic shortcomings.
Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said the government was not seeking to
renegotiate the basic agreement, which the electorate rejected in a
referendum in June.
But the new text, to be negotiated with the other 11 members of the EC,
would form a binding supplement to the treaty. The time needed to formulate
the proposals, aimed at reducing centralisation and making the Community
more open and democratic, could delay until next autumn a planned new Danish
referendum.
Denmark is proposing the text should clarify the application of
subsidiarity, under which decisions should be made at the lowest practicable
level of government. The government also wants more control over the
European Commission, and more openess on Community legislation.
A further suggestion is to open to the public meetings of the European
Council.
Mr Schluter stressed Denmark's proposals would address issues which are
problems in other EC countries. 'It is not good enough to develop the
European Community along lines which perhaps 40 or 50 per cent of our people
dislike,' he said, referring to the narrow pro-Maastricht majority in
Sunday's vote in France.
In the planned second referendum, the government will ask Danes to vote on a
set of special reservations to aspects of the treaty, Mr Schluter. These
will set out Denmark's desire to hold back from participation in a common
European defence, and in the final stage of economic and monetary union. He
left open the legal status of the supplement.

MR Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, yesterday called for new forms

Announcing a new study of global capital flows to be carried out by the
Group of Ten industrial nations, which he chairs, Mr Brady noted that daily
trading in the foreign exchange market now approaches Dollars 1,000bn
(Pounds 584bn).
'This is roughly double the total reserves of the major industrial countries
and well beyond the resources governments can bring to bear in the markets,'
he said.
Other countries have also suggested revamping economic co-operation
procedures, which recently have seemed powerless in the face of the turmoil
in forex markets.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Markets may yet trump Spain's ace /
Assessing the reaction to the reimposition of capital controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S decision yesterday to reimpose capital controls less than eight
months after triumphantly lifting them could damage its decade-long campaign
to streamline its domestic financial markets and present itself as a modern,
transparent, place of business.
Until yesterday morning the markets might have expected the Spanish
authorities to do two things to protect their currency from the speculative
turmoil in European currency markets - seek an official or unofficial
devaluation, or raise interest rates.
Instead, the Bank of Spain has resorted, it insists temporarily, to the
administrative regulatory mechanisms reminiscent of the days when economic
policy was designed to keep foreigners away.
On the face of it, triggering such thinly-disguised exchange controls by the
Bank of Spain is a desperate attempt to avoid the orthodox. By introducing
highly punitive measures against all who take positions against the peseta,
Madrid's monetary authorities have ostensibly fired a broadside at
speculators who have been hammering the currency for a week.
'Essentially Madrid told the money markets: 'Don't think you have got all
the aces up your sleeve, we have some too',' said Ms Wendy Niffiker, chief
European economist at James Capel in London.
And according to Mr Anthony Wands, director general of pension fund
managers, Pastor Alliance, in Madrid: 'The effect is that years of careful
grooming of the Spanish markets as they come of age has now been reversed.
We are back in the stone age as a result of a transitory measure aimed at
stopping those who hammer the peseta.'
Official interest rates in Spain stand at 13 per cent and the government is
already desperately trying to staunch huge budget over-runs through a
mixture of tax increases and spending cuts.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, must call a general election within
a year and while two weeks ago analysts were confidently predicting a fall
in interest rates next year, an increase now, or a further inflationary
devaluation, could seriously threaten the government's already shaky
credibility.
The speculators have clearly homed in on a depressing set of Spanish
fundamentals. Leaked portions of the 1993 budget draft forecast GDP growth
of just 0.7 per cent year and unemployment of more than 3m or over 20 per
cent of the labour force.
Central bank intervention, meanwhile, had come to be viewed as providing the
markets with a one-way bet. The reasoning is that if the D-Mark zone
currencies are discounted, together with the franc, because they have
support and if the marginal currencies are ignored, then the peseta emerges
as the prized target in every speculator's viewfinder.
'The peseta is the most 'attackable' currency right now,' said Mr Francesc
Guardans, chief executive of Societe Generale's Madrid broking firm.
The government accordingly turned on the speculators. Since the weekend, Mr
Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, has taken time off from the IMF meetings
he was attending in Washington to denigrate especuladores. They have become
what the 'gnomes of Zurich' were to Britain in the 1960s.
But investors might come back for revenge. Yesterday's Bank of Spain
decision came just as a Dollars 1.5bn Kingdom of Spain Eurobond issue began
to be traded on the markets. Directors of the issue were expecting retail
and institutional purchasers in Spain but this is unlikely now.
And with the Spanish treasury needing to raise a total of Dollars 55bn
before the end of the year, some Dollars 17bn of it in net new financing, in
order to service the budget deficit, the markets seem to hold a few aces
too.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday announced emergency measures to protect the
beleaguered peseta against currency speculators, effectively freezing
trading in the peseta in a thinly disguised reintroduction of exchange
controls eight months after they were abolished.
The measures, termed as technical by the central bank, force institutions
purchasing foreign currency against the peseta, or buying pesetas, to
deposit a sum equivalent to the transaction, interest free, with the Bank of
Spain for a year.
The Bank said the action was necessary because of the 'volatility,
speculation and disorder' in the currency markets. 'The measures are
absolutely temporary and will be in force solely during the period of
(currency market) instability, Mr Miguel Martin, deputy governor, told a
press conference last night.
Mr Angel Sanchez, chief currency trader at Banco Santander de Negocios,
said: 'We were expecting something on these lines but the measures are much
tougher than we had feared.'
In Brussels, European Commission officials said they were looking at whether
the Spanish government's moves were legally in line with its EC commitments,
but would not be drawn into any premature judgment.
Spanish officials in Brussels took the more relaxed view that by the time
the Commission makes up its mind, the government may have beaten back the
speculators.
Irish officials in Brussels have pointing to the relative success of
Dublin's use of its remaining exchange controls, which last week and on
Monday, they say, burnt some speculators who were unable to cover short
positions.
The Spanish development was a clear blow to those who were selling pesetas
short and who had gone 'long' on foreign currencies, particularly to those
taking one to three-day positions. Banks, both domestic and foreign, are
understood to have done considerable business in recent days by buying
against the peseta.
An indication of the scale of speculation came with the Bank of Spain's
additional order that the foreign exchange positions taken by domestic banks
could not exceed 7 per cent of their assets. Anything above that level would
also have to be matched with a deposit in a non-interest bearing Bank of
Spain account.
The peseta, which began trading in the EMS yesterday at Pta71 to the D-Mark,
closed at Pta68, moving from the bottom to the top of the ERM grid.
Analysts said, however, that the fate of the peseta remained intimately tied
to that of the French franc and to the future of the EMS.
The Bank of Spain was seen to have erected a temporary defensive barrier
while it awaited developments over a possible general realignment that would
necessarily involve the peseta.
With its move the Bank averted raising official interest rates, which
remained yesterday at 13 per cent.

target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's massive Bundesbank intervention to prop up the French franc will
send September's German money supply figures even further out of the 1992
target range, despite money market operations to mop up liquidity,
economists said yesterday.
Frankfurt dealers estimate at between DM10bn (Pounds 3.9bn) and DM20bn the
intervention needed to keep the French currency within the bands of the
exchange rate mechanism in the past two days. This has been carried out by
both the Bundesbank and the Bank of France, whose currency reserves have
come under substantial pressure.
The sharp fall in French monetary reserves comes in the wake of the run on
the currency holdings of the other weak ERM currencies in the past 10 days.
At the same time, the Bank of Italy is believed to have continued discreet
intervention to support the lira this week, in spite of the decision to
maintain a floating rate outside the ERM.
The Bank of Spain is estimated to have used up Dollars 15bn, or 20 per cent
of its Dollars 70bn currency reserves, to defend the peseta during the
period of currency turbulence.
Liquidity created by unprecedented D-Mark central bank sales throughout
Europe will expand further Germany's already fast-growing money supply.
Economists forecast an annualised expansion rate of more than 10 per cent
for M3, the broad monetary aggregate, this month after a higher than
expected 9 per cent for August.
'This means there will be no real scope for further interest rate cuts,'
said Mr Nigel Rendell, European economist at stockbrokers James Capel. 'Even
though the figures will be distorted, a further easing at this stage would
make a mockery of the Bundesbank's linking of policy to M3.'
A further ERM realignment, involving a D-Mark revaluation against the franc,
would enable the bank to cut rates, but the Bundesbank would probably also
want to see Bonn tighten fiscal policy.
Yesterday, the Bundesbank acted to drain funds from the money market, with
more expected today. The central bank has been offering currency swaps and
treasury bills at rates of 8.9 per cent for two days. It also extended
maturity periods for bills and swaps due yesterday. Dealers expected the
Bundesbank to offer four-day bills and swaps today to last beyond the
weekend.
Dealers estimated that the treasury bill sales on Monday and Tuesday took
around DM16bn from the market, with the currency swaps draining a further
DM10bn or more. The central bank did not offer a further securities
repurchase deal to replace the DM20bn falling due yesterday. Overnight rates
were down to less than 1 per cent last night.
'I doubt if they can sterilise the full effect of the intervention,' said Mr
Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets. 'We have to
expect very poor money supply figures'. Mr Rendell reckoned M3 could be up
by at least a net DM20bn this month compared with DM16bn in August and DM8bn
in July.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, gave a figure of DM60bn
for ERM support efforts up to last week. The further support of the French
franc has considerably added to this.
'The Bundesbank will be concerned at the scale of intervention, but will not
see it as the end of the world just because one month's figures have
jumped,' Mr Hubbard added. However, he said this could lead it to consider
'de-emphasising' its reliance on M3, as other economists have suggested.

FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: French franc proves a tough nut to
crack - German commitment to preserve the parity of the embattled currency
has yet to face ultimate test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, WILLIAM DAWKINS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been the French franc's turn to become the target of currency
speculators this week.
But events yesterday suggested that the embattled French currency will be a
tougher nut to crack than sterling or the Italian lira.
As the authorities in Paris, Bonn and Frankfurt stepped up their efforts to
support the franc, the tussle to maintain its position in the European
exchange rate mechanism crystallised into a struggle between market forces
and a number of powerful political imperatives.
The shock waves from a devaluation of the franc or its forced exit from the
ERM would be felt far beyond Paris, where such a move would mark a
humiliating end to the French government's franc fort policy. Failure to
hold the franc would deal a crippling blow to what is left of the EMS as a
zone of monetary stability in Europe and mark its final eclipse as a
building block towards greater European integration.
The French economy is fundamentally stronger than Britain's, or even
Germany's, leaving no economic reason for a franc devaluation.
French inflation has been below the German rate since June 1991, its hourly
wage costs are 16 per cent below those in Germany and it runs a tighter
control of its budget than its neighbour. France's budget deficit was 2.1
per cent of gross domestic product last year, as against Germany's 2.9 per
cent.
Franc devaluation would penalise a virtuous currency.
That the battle for the franc is qualitatively different from those last
week to prop up the British and Italian currencies was highlighted yesterday
by the powerful joint efforts of Germany and France to support the currency.
Not only did the Bank of France raise its important five to 10 day
repurchase rate by 2 1/2 percentage points to 13 per cent, the French
authorities then intervened continuously in the market throughout the
morning, buying francs, to support the currency.
In addition, in an unusual move demonstrating solidarity, the Bank of
France, the Bundesbank, the French finance ministry and the finance ministry
in Bonn issued a joint statement, declaring that there was no justification
for a change in the franc's parity.
Yesterday, these efforts appeared to be meeting with some success. Unlike
sterling the week before, the franc responded positively and immediately to
the central bank's decision to raise rates. Thus far, there has been no risk
of the currency falling below its floor.
'The difference between what is happening to the franc now and what happened
to sterling and the lira last week is that many people agreed that they were
overvalued. Both the Bundesbank and the Banque de France are solidly in
favour of holding the value of the franc,' said Mr Philippe D'Arvisenet, a
vice president at Banque Nationale de Paris, the leading state-owned bank.
However, dealers said that the franc could still end up being devalued in
the current very turbulent currency markets. They point out that:
The credibility of the EMS was severely dented by last week's suspension of
sterling and the Italian lira. 'The authorities in Italy and the UK
repeatedly promised that there would be no devaluation of their currencies,'
said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in
London. 'There is no reason why the market should believe the French when
they make the same claim.'
The financial risks involved in selling the franc are as small as they were
for sterling and the lira. A dealer could sell the French currency yesterday
knowing that there was some chance of a devaluation or EMS realignment and
less likelihood of the franc rallying strongly against the D-Mark.
France's foreign currency reserves are thought to be low. They were put at
Dollars 31bn excluding gold last week. Dealers believe that France may have
spent over half of this figure in recent days. 'I would not be surprised if
those reserves were now in single figures,' said Mr Hawkins.
Dealers also believe that there are limits to how much the Bundesbank will
be willing to intervene. The German central bank spent DM60bn supporting
sterling and the lira up to last week and, according to some analysts, has
spent an additional DM30bn supporting the franc this week. Overnight rates
in the German money market were as low as  1/2 per cent yesterday,
reflecting the colossal quantity of D-Marks sloshing around the system.
But the Bundesbank has so far made clear that it stands behind the franc.
After the weekend meetings of Group of Seven and EC finance ministers in
Washington, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, stressed that
he did not regard the franc as a candidate for devaluation.
He insisted that the French currency was fundamentally healthy and pointed
out that France had a lower inflation rate than Germany and that its level
of wage inflation was half the German level.
Currency speculators were 'not all-conquering', Mr Schlesinger said.
Speculation could only succeed when exchange rates were out of line, he
added. Yesterday this belief was reflected in the joint statement of the
French and German authorities which said that the central rates between the
franc and the D-mark 'correctly reflect the real situation of their
economies.'
The Bundesbank appeared to be putting its money where its mouth was
yesterday. Dealers said that it intervened to support the franc in the ERM
at levels above the mandatory intervention point - the first time in memory
that the German central bank had voluntarily added to its currency reserves
and so threatened to boost its already swollen money supply in that way.
However, the two countries' commitment to the franc has still to face the
ultimate test which is whether Germany would be prepared to cut its interest
rates to save the parity.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Mellor battles to save career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID MELLOR last night launched a last-ditch attempt to save his
political career after senior Conservatives signalled they would meet today
to consider his future in the cabinet.
In an unprecedented series of television interviews the heritage secretary
strongly denied allegations of impropriety in accepting hospitality from
wealthy personal friends. He said that his future as a minister had now
developed into a power struggle between Mr John Major and the editors of
some tabloid newspapers over who should decide the composition of the
cabinet.
In spite of growing unease within his party that Mr Mellor's position had
become untenable, Mr Major indicated that the minister retained his full
confidence.
The prime minister wrote to Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary,
rejecting any suggestion that Mr Mellor had acted improperly in accepting a
paid holiday in the summer of 1990 from Mrs Mona Bauwens, daughter of a
prominent Palestine Liberation Organisation member.
Mr Major said Mr Mellor's decision not to refer the matter to the then prime
minister was 'entirely consistent' with official guidance.
Earlier this week a High Court jury failed to deliver a verdict on whether
Mrs Bauwens had been libelled by a newspaper article about the holiday,
which coincided with the PLO's support for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Mr Mellor, whose position in the cabinet was undermined earlier in the
summer by revelations about his personal relationship with an actress, last
night claimed he was the victim of a tabloid campaign of vilification. He
insisted he would remain in office as long as he retained the confidence of
the prime minister and the Conservative party.
The heritage secretary rejected any suggestion that he had broken
ministerial rules. But his spirited and extraordinary defence did not dispel
the doubts among senior Conservative MPs over whether he can survive in the
cabinet.
The executive of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory MPs will consider Mr
Mellor's future when the House of Commons reconvenes today for an emergency
debate on the economy.
Some members of the executive indicated last night that they believed Mr
Mellor's position had become an embarrassment to the prime minister and the
Conservative party and that he should resign. They refused to predict the
outcome of today's meeting.

FT  24 SEP 92 / BAe share price plunges on news of 3,000 job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE'S share price fell 43 per cent yesterday after it
announced the closure of its historic Hatfield plant, the loss of 3,000 jobs
and a proposed joint venture with Taiwan to manufacture regional jets.
The move, part of a sweeping attempt to secure the future of one of
Britain's biggest manufacturing companies, was coupled with the announcement
of a Pounds 129m first half loss and a Pounds 750m write-off - to be taken
in the second half - on its regional aircraft operations.
BAe shares closed down 86p at 113p. Its market capitalisation of Pounds 426m
last night was less than the Pounds 432m it raised in a rights issue a year
ago. The share price collapse revived City speculation that the company
could now be vulnerable to a takeover.
The restructuring, including the proposed joint regional jet venture with
Taiwan Aerospace, was attacked last night by unions and opposition MPs as a
devastating blow for British manufacturing industry.
The move follows the arrival four months ago of Mr John Cahill, BAe's
chairman, who was charged with restoring the credibility and profitability
of the company which had been shaken by a top management crisis and losses
in its commercial aircraft, Rover car and property operations.
But the long-awaited restructuring package failed to impress the City, which
continued to express serious doubts over the future of the company and its
lossmaking regional aircraft operations.
Mr Cahill defended the rationalisation programme as 'the best way forward'
for the company, which lost Pounds 278m in its commercial aircraft
operations in the first half.
These losses, coupled with Pounds 31m losses at Rover, wiped out the Pounds
296m profits BAe made in its defence business.
The company cut its dividend for the first time by 5.9p to 3p. BAe is also
undertaking a capital reduction to cover the cost of its Pounds 750m
restructuring programme.
Although the company said its proposed joint venture with Taiwan would
protect jobs in the UK, the overall impact of the restructuring would lead
to 3,000 job cuts, including 2,060 at Hatfield.
The Hertfordshire plant was the home of the Comet and the Trident before the
BAe 146 regional jet.
Another 1,000 jobs will be lost at the company's Woodford and Chadderton
plants near Manchester under the restructuring, which will see all the
company's turbopropeller aircraft production concentrated at Prestwick in
Scotland.
BAe has already shed 4,500 jobs this year in its commercial aircraft and
defence activities hit by the effects of both the recession and cuts in
defence spending. The company is also expected to complete soon the sale of
its space and communications activities, which it no longer regards as core
businesses.
Although BAe's defence activities remain strongly profitable, City sentiment
was also hit by the company's failure so far to announce a long-expected
Saudi Arabian order for Tornado and Hawk aircraft.
Germany's decision to withdraw from the European Fighter Aircraft production
programme has also cast doubts on this project in which BAe is the leading
UK partner. But Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, suggested yesterday
the company could 'go-it-alone' if other countries dropped out.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Germany unites with France to defend the franc: Banks
intervene amid hectic trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY AND France yester-day forged a united front to defend the French
franc and the remains of the European Monetary System from renewed
speculative attack but were still unsure of victory after a day of intense
currency trading.
As the European exchange rate mechanism experienced another day of crisis,
France pushed its short term interest rates sharply higher and both the
German Bundesbank and Bank of France intervened heavily in support of the
franc. For the first time, the Bundesbank intervened within the official
margins of the ERM in support of another currency.
Strains were apparent elsewhere in the ERM as Spain reintroduced capital
controls to protect the peseta less than eight months after lifting them and
within a week of devaluing the Spanish currency by 5 per cent. The Irish
punt remained under intense selling pressure, while the Portuguese escudo
closed weak.
In London, it is expected that in today's emergency Commons debate on the
economy, Mr John Major, the prime minister, will step us his demands for ERM
reform.
The large-scale selling of the franc produced a bitter - even bloodthirsty -
response from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. 'During the
(French) revolution, such people were known as speculators and they were
beheaded,' he said. 'We must make the speculators pay . . . hit them where
it hurts - in their wallets.'
Several analysts suggested last night that France's foreign exchange
reserves were exhausted, but there was no official information to back these
claims. Currency dealers in London estimated that the Bank of France could
have spent more than FFr50bn worth of foreign currency, or more than half
its reserves, in recent days to defend the franc. Estimates of Bundesbank
intervention over the past two days ranged between DM10bn and 064DM30bn. The
Franco-German attempt to crush the speculation started at dawn yesterday. As
currency trading began in Paris, the Bank of France raised its five to 10
day repurchase rate from 10.5 per cent to 13 per cent, triggering a sharp
rise in money market rates. It was the first increase since last December in
the repurchase rate, at which commercial banks borrow short-term money from
the French central bank, often to fund currency dealings.
The central banks and finance ministries of France and Germany also issued a
rare joint statement stressing there was no justification for an EMS parity
change between the franc and the D-Mark. 'France and Germany will fight this
speculation, which is based on no economic fundamentals,' Mr Sapin said.
This verbal support was followed by more heavy intervention by both central
banks. The Bundesbank openly intervened to support the franc at levels above
its mandatory intervention point against the D-Mark for the first since the
ERM was founded.
By last night, the battle between the markets and the central banks seemed
evenly matched. The franc closed in London at FFr3.4120 to the D-Mark,
slightly stronger than on Tuesday but still close to its lower limit of
FFr3.4305. In early Far East trading it was quoted at FFr3.4065. However,
several analysts believe another Frenchinterest rate rise could be on the
way, perhaps in the central bank's intervention rate.
This rate, which was left unchanged yesterday, is the one that determines
French base rates which currently stand at 9.85 per cent. The Spanish
decision effectively to re-introduce exchange controls was to avoid another
interest rate rise.
Spain decided to force domestic banks to match loans to foreign investors by
depositing an equal sum, interest free with the Bank of Spain. The move
represented a humiliating climbdown for Spain which had hailed the removal
of controls earlier this year as an important step in its economic
integration with the rest of the European Community.
Yesterday it was reported that the European Commission in Brussels had
contacted the Spanish authorities to establish whether these capital
controls were compatible with EC single market laws.
The currency crisis has prompted Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury
secretary, to call on leading nations to examine global capital flows.
His comments came as the dollar opened at Y119.90 in Tokyo, a record Tokyo
intraday low.

FT  24 SEP 92 / At least 40 Tory MPs may defy Major on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AT LEAST 40 Tory MPs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
nearly twice the previous number - say they are ready to defy the government
over Maastricht, adding to Mr John Major's difficulties in his attempts to
deliver British ratification of the treaty.
With both the prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, facing
the toughest tests of their political careers today in a Commons emergency
debate, the opposition to Maastricht in Conservative ranks is strengthening.
The government is treating today's vote as a confidence motion, calling on
the House simply to support its economic policy.
Scores of interviews with Conservative MPs, including the most prominent
Euro-sceptics, do much to explain Mr Major's attempts to placate the
doubters over the treaty in recent days.
They show that antipathy to Maastricht on the government benches has grown
markedly since May, when the bill implementing the treaty received its
second Commons reading. In that vote, the number of Tories voting against
the government was pegged at 22.
There was relief for the government, however, as Labour's ruling body
explicitly ruled out supporting a referendum on Maastricht.
An amendment calling for a referendum was widely regarded as the most likely
way to bring about a government defeat during the passage of the Maastricht
bill, since support for it goes beyond the Euro-sceptic camp.
The Tories will be anxious to exploit signs that the Labour party remains
divided over its approach to Europe, even though the opposition avoided an
open split in approving a new policy statement.
Those Tories who voted with the government in May but are threatening to
oppose it now include Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 100-strong 92
group of Tory MPs, Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance
committee and Mr John Whittingdale, the MP for Colchester South and Maldon,
who is Baroness Thatcher's former political secretary.
The figure of 40, representing nearly one in five Tory MPs who are not in
government, comprises those who would not support the government if it
reintroduced the bill implementing Maastricht to the Commons unamended.
Another sizeable group of MPs expressed serious reservations and declined to
pledge unconditional support.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Bleak prospect for rural employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 150,000 rural jobs may be lost in the 1990s as a result of a
contraction in agriculture and industries that depend on farming, the Rural
Development Commission said yesterday.
The commission, which promotes rural development, says in its annual report
that the 'peace dividend' resulting from a contraction of defence resources
will also lead to job losses, especially in East Anglia - where nearly 2 per
cent of the population is US forces personnel and families - and the
south-west of England.
It says an estimated 14,000 families are homeless in rural areas and
homelessness is growing faster than in towns.
Rural services and facilities are under continued pressure, with a number of
village halls threatened by the cost of complying with new hygiene and
safety regulations.
Lord Shuttleworth, the commission chairman, says in his annual review that
the nature of the changes taking place in the countryside are still
insufficiently recognised.
The countryside cannot be maintained by denying change or ignoring the needs
of country people, he adds.
The report says employment in small business grew faster in remoter rural
areas between 1988 and 1991 than anywhere else in England but the recession
means many businesses are now struggling for survival.
The commission plans to expand its social programmes by more than 20 per
cent over the next three years.
It will provide funds to create land banks to speed the supply of
inexpensive housing, give grants to help village halls meet the costs of new
health legislation, and help national charities extend their services into
rural areas.
It is working on its Countryside Employment Programme to help to create new
businesses and jobs in three pilot areas suffering badly from job losses.
The commission has also expanded a programme to convert redundant farm
buildings. RDC, 141 Castle Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP1 3TP. Tel. 0722

FT  24 SEP 92 / Germany moves to protect jobs in east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German cabinet yesterday launched an emergency programme to prop up the
east's fragile industrial base and protect 400,000 jobs.
The scheme includes subsidised financing for foreign construction contracts
and the extension of export credit guarantees to barter deals with east
European customers who are chronically short of foreign exchange.
Bonn has also promised to double federal purchases from east German
companies and pay premium prices for goods and services. Most of the
increase is likely to come from the defence, interior and post ministries.
The main aims are to maintain the former GDR's export links with eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union and to open up new markets in western
countries.
However, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, who proposed the scheme,
was told it must be financed out of existing resources. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said on Tuesday that current annual transfers from the west of DM150bn
(Pounds 59bn) marked the limit.
Mr Mollemann had claimed earlier that his proposals would need more than
DM10bn a year. However, under the stern eye of the Bundesbank, the
government is committed to a public spending freeze.
Approval of the scheme coincided with an appeal for action from the
federation of German industry (BDI). The existence of the east's entire
capital goods industry - which accounted for 38 per cent of total industrial
sales - was in danger, it said.
Western companies, meanwhile, were concerned that falling production and
order intake in their factories signalled further economic weakening, the
BDI said. The effects of the sluggish recovery in export markets had been
exacerbated by a 10 per cent increase in unit labour costs since 1990 and
the recent appreciation of the D-Mark.
It was becoming increasingly difficult for them to contemplate investing in
the east.
A report from the respected DIW and IW economic institutes, based in Berlin
and Kiel respectively, said the eastern economy was still stuck in a deep
crisis. A poll of 2,500 industrial companies had shown around 60 per cent
suffering from lack of competitiveness.
The proportion rose to more than 80 per cent among companies still owned by
the Treuhand privatisation agency.
According to the economics ministry, 150 Treuhand companies employing
200,000, had been hit hard by the collapse of markets in the former Soviet
Union and east Europe. Their suppliers, employing a further 200,000, had
been similarly affected.
East German mechanical and electrical engineering and vehicle manufacturers,
which had expected to make up to 60 per cent of their sales in former Soviet
and east European markets, were in most need of help.
As an immediate measure, the government has agreed to auction more than
DM1bn-worth of unsold stocks to the highest bidder.
Any losses will be covered by the Treuhand.
It has also offered up to DM45m a year to subsidise loans to east German
contractors bidding for infrastructure contracts in Poland, Hungary and the
Baltic states.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum in the red after
exploration write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDE PETROLEUM, the UK independent exploration and production company,
announced a net loss of Pounds 5.48m for the six months to June 30. The
result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration
activities.
Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the
company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration
immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation
of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be
capitalised and depreciated against eventual production.
Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house'
between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and
successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups.
Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where
it drilled a dry hole.
Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a
'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds
11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m.
Mr Gourlay said that 'robust' cash inflow from operations of Pounds 26.7m
demonstrated Clyde's underlying strength.
Clyde hopes to increase production to about 39,000 b/d through development
of the North Sea Gryphon field, expected to get government approval by the
end of the year. It has also been buoyed by recent discoveries at Rhu,
offshore Malaysia, and a new exploration award in Syria.
Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was
suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending. Analysts do
not expect resumed pay-outs until Gryphon is well-established, in 1994 or
1995.

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Huntleigh improves strongly to Pounds 2.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRESS AT Huntleigh Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment
manufacturer, continued in the first half of 1992 with pre-tax profits
jumping from Pounds 932,000 to Pounds 2.35m, a figure almost 2 per cent
higher than the full-year outcome in 1991.
The interim dividend is more than doubled to 4p (1.75p), payable from
earnings ahead to 17.02p (7.02p) per share.
Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the board's policy was for the total dividend
to be at least 3.5 times covered.
The shares rose 38p to close at 718p.
Turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.8m), though Mr Schild said
that if the activities of the recorder division - now sold and providing an
exceptional credit of Pounds 120,000 - and the load cell joint venture were
stripped out, the increase would have been 50 per cent.
Mr Julian Schild, the chairman's son and finance director, said the profits
advance was derived from growth across all the company's markets. He
described this as 'unusual' - normally some grew as others slackened.
However, malpractice suits in the US - and increasingly in Europe - as well
as the financial necessity for hospitals to minimise patients' stays,
ensured that sales of Huntleigh's pneumatic mattresses to combat bedsores
continued as the engine of growth.
In more general terms, his father ascribed Huntleigh's strength to its
'narrow' product range and large volumes which allowed stocks and overheads
to be reduced.
That strength was maintained in spite of the adverse dollar/sterling
exchange rate.
Huntleigh is 56 per cent controlled by the Schild family and 60 per cent by
the family and board.

BRIERLEY Investments (BIL) today reported an 18.6 per cent increase in
after-tax profits to NZDollars 251.1m (USDollars 135.7m) for the year to
June 30, against NZDollars 211.7 last year.
Directors said this was largely due to a substantial lift in operating
earnings in New Zealand and through much lower interest and overhead costs.
In the UK hotel group Mount Charlotte recorded a NZDollars 6m loss compared
with a profit of NZDollars 78m last year. Total UK contributions were
NZDollars 321.1m against NZDollars 452.5m. This included the sale of the
motor group TKM to Inchcape for NZDollars 1,373m resulting in a profit of
NZDollars 160m.
During the year the company wrote off a total of NZDollars 156m - including
NZDollars 72m on its investment in Magnum Corporation, NZDollars 44m for
Ariadne Australia and NZDollars 20m on New Zealand properties which are to
be sold.
The operating profit before tax and minorities was NZDollars 354.8m against
NZDollars 303.7m, an increase of 17 per cent. Tax was NZDollars 55.3m
against last year's figure of NZDollars 50m.
Equity earnings showed a loss of NZDollars 36.6m compared with a profit of
NZDollars 21.1m last year.
Directors said the good results from Air New Zealand and Carter Holt Harvey
were offset by losses in Ariadne Australia and Magnum.
Sales revenue fell 24 per cent to NZDollars 4.31bn against NZDollars 5.71bn,
due to the sale of TKM during the year.
An unchanged final dividend of 5 cents, making 9 cents for the year, is
recommended.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Fed 'not pressed to relax policy'
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday denied reports that it had sought a private
undertaking from Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to relax
monetary policy last year as a condition for his appointment to a second
term.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, chief White House spokesman, said senior administration
officials had often called publicly for lower interest rates, but he denied
pressure was applied in private meetings. That would be inappropriate, he
said.
The denial followed a claim on Wednesday in the Los Angeles Times that the
administration had privately pressed Mr Greenspan 'for a commitment to pump
up the economy during 1992.'
The Fed was set up as an independent agency to prevent political control of
interest rate policy.
The newspaper said senior officials had held meetings with Mr Greenspan in
spring and summer last year to urge him 'to alter Fed policy in an effort to
reach specific growth targets during the coming election year.'
A Fed spokesman said Mr Greenspan had never committed the Fed to specific
economic growth targets.
Reuter reports: The US economy is improving slowly and prices are generally
stable, aside from a jump in lumber costs caused by Hurricane Andrew last
month, the Federal Reserve said in its latest national survey.
'Economic activity has been improving slowly in most of the nation, but the
pace of recovery has been uneven across regions and sectors,' the survey by
the 12 Federal Reserve banks said.
The report, known as the Beige Book, was based on information gathered
before September 15 and is the last one before the November 3 presidential
election, in which joblessness and economic weakness will be large in
voters' concerns.

The two leaders said their goal was bilateral free trade from the start of

FT  24 SEP 92 / UK, US to meet on air liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and US negotiators will meet early next month in a bid to speed up
talks on a new and more liberal air transport treaty.
Mr John MacGregor, the British transport secretary, met his US opposite
number, Mr Andrew Card, in Washington yesterday, and the two agreed to
accelerate the renegotiation of the 15-year old Bermuda II treaty which at
present regulates air traffic between the two countries.
The issue has been given added urgency by British Airways' proposal to take
a 44 per cent equity stake in USAir with a Dollars 750m (Pounds 438m)
investment, a proposal which must be approved by Mr Card.
Mr MacGregor insisted in Washington yesterday that the issues of
cross-border investment and air traffic liberalisation were entirely
separate. He pledged that, if the BA/USAir deal were approved, he would 'be
disposed to approve' a similar minority investment by a US airline in a UK
airline, but declined to tie the deal to freer access to British airports.
US air carriers, however, are not enthusiastic at the prospect of buying one
of the UK's small carriers; they want the British Airways deal to be linked
to removal of restrictions on capacity, gateways and pricing, allowing them
much broader opportunities to compete on European routes.
'Failure to require liberalisation of the existing air services agreement
with the UK prior to approving a BA investment in USAir would permit an
illiberal trading partner to obtain access to the US market without opening
its own markets to competition from US carriers,' said Mr Daniel Kasper,
director of the transportation practice at Harbridge House, a Boston
management consultancy.

<TEXT>
THE US has asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to rule
on how much the European Community must compensate trading partners for lost
exports due to EC subsidies on oilseeds.
The request for an arbitration panel - to be considered by Gatt's governing
council on September 29 - suggests the US wants a further breathing space
before unleashing its threatened sanctions against Dollars 1bn worth of EC
food and drink imports. Retaliation from Brussels would precipitate a
damaging trade war just as the two sides are hoping to finalise a deal on
farm trade, including oilseeds, within the Uruguay Round of global trade
talks.
Senior trade officials from the 'quad' countries - US, EC, Japan and Canada
 -met in Geneva yesterday to assess prospects for the round. Negotiators had
hoped for a deal in the 'window of opportunity' between the French
referendum on Maastricht and the US elections on November 3, unlocking the
round for completion early in 1993. This has now been clouded by the narrow
French Yes vote last Sunday and President Bush's poor showing in the opinion
polls.

FT  24 SEP 92 / Poor hit back at structural adjustments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRUCTURAL adjustment programmes imposed by the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund have brought disaster to the working poor of as many as 100
countries, according to representatives of non-governmental organisations in
Washington at a forum this week.
Part of the difficulty is that the stalled Uruguay Round has changed the
rules of trade for the poor countries, which have been forced under
structural adjustment to open their markets to a flood of cheap imports,
while the US, EC and other industrialised countries have refused to abandon
their subsidies, quotas and high tariffs.
This has produced trade distortions and a 'brutal' suppression of wages and
living standards, while governments have been forced by the bank to cut
their social programmes, according to Mr Doug Hellinger, executive director
of the Development Gap organisation.
'The markets aren't there for the poor countries,' he said, noting the
continued barriers to textiles and third world commodities.
The Development Gap, Friends of the Earth and three other groups brought the
NGOs to Washington this week to make their case against structural
adjustment during a forum which has been carried on cable television.
The NGO representatives described a growing gap between the rich and poor in
their countries, and rising bitterness and violence. They attributed the
fall in commodity prices to the farm export subsidy battle under way between
the US and the EC.
'It does not take a genius to see what has happened,' said Mr Martin Khor,
research director of the Consumers' Association of Penang and a co-ordinator
of the World Rainforest Movement. The favourite prescription for sick
economies - more exports - has spurred over-production, cut-throat
competition, a collapse of prices and exploitation of workers and natural
resources.
'Small enterprises, which can't compete against imported goods, are closing,
and the aid given them by the development banks is a drop in the bucket,' Mr
Hellinger said.
Ms Peggy Antrobus of Barbados, founder of the Women and Development
Institute, said that, after 13 years of economic adjustment, one-third of
the population in her country lives below the poverty line. Social services
have been cut by 40 per cent, health care has badly deteriorated and such
basic necessities as soap and bandages are often unavailable.
Ms Narda Melendez, co-ordinator of Asociacion Andar, a private development
group in Honduras, said 73 per cent of the population there was in poverty.
'We work in sweatshops outside the law,' she said. Children were receiving
less than half of their needed daily intake of calories.
The World Bank has yet to release its third report on structural adjustment
lending, presented to its board early this summer. The report recommended
that 'more attention' be paid to 'protecting the poor during adjustment'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, has come out in favour
of abandoning the Maastricht Treaty idea of currency union and instead
creating a union of Europe's strong currencies, Reuter reports from Zurich.
'Those countries which are willing and able to establish a currency union
with a common central bank and single currency should do so, not in 1997 or
1999 (as in the Maastricht Treaty) but in the near future,' he told the
Swiss weekly Weltwoche.
He said such a system - unlike the EC's monetary system - would no longer be
dominated by the Bundesbank but held together by a strong, common central
bank. Asked if this did not amount to a so-called 'two-speed Europe', Mr
Pohl said this already existed.
He said Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands were already in a
position to form a currency union, and added that Austria and Switzerland,
both outside the European Community but with strong currencies and political
stability, could also join.
Mr Pohl said recent upheavals, in which the pound, lira and peseta have left
the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) or been devalued, and the French franc
come under pressure, had strengthened the idea of a single European central
bank. A continuation of the current D-Mark-led ERM would become more and
more difficult as other countries' readiness to follow the Bundesbank waned
after the turmoil of the last week.
He said the treaty on currency union should be abandoned 'since it is too
ambitious, contains many discrepancies, and can't be implemented anyway
since the Danes' No (in a referendum)'.

FT  23 SEP 92 / High imports push trade gap to Pounds 1.2bn: Export volumes
flat - Call for fresh cuts in loan rates to stimulate housing market /
National Savings lowers its returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD IMPORT volumes pushed Britain's trade deficit sharply wider last
month, while sluggish world economic activity took its toll on export
growth.
Official figures yesterday showed that the underlying deficit on visible, or
merchandise, goods was at its worst level for two years after import volumes
rose to a record level and export volumes flattened off.
The overall deficit on trade in visible goods rose to Pounds 1.2bn last
month compared with Pounds 1.1bn in July. The current-account deficit -
which includes a projected Pounds 100m surplus on trade in so-called
invisible goods such as financial services, government transfer payments and
dividends - was Pounds 1.1bn in August, barely changed on July.
However, both figures benefited from a striking increase in Britain's
surplus in oil trade, which rose from Pounds 48m in July to Pounds 233m in
August, the biggest surplus since September 1990.
The underlying picture was much bleaker. Excluding oil and erratic items
such as precious stones, ships and aircraft, the visible trade deficit was
Pounds 1.7bn last month, its worst level for two years and Pounds 300m
greater than in July.
The latest figures from the Central Statistical Office will add to worries
that import penetration is too high in the UK. Britain has remained in
deficit with the rest of the world throughout the present recession in spite
of weak consumer demand.
Other CSO figures last week showed that the current-account deficit for the
first half of the year was almost Pounds 6bn, only Pounds 0.5bn less than
the Treasury's forecast for the entire year in the Budget.
Last week's sterling devaluation is likely to boost import prices in the
short term, but should eventually buoy exports as British goods become
cheaper to overseas buyers. However, an export boom might be stifled by
weakness in the economies of Britain's main trading partners.
A breakdown of the UK's trade by area shows that exports were down almost
everywhere in the latest three months. The value of exports to the European
Community fell by 4 per cent compared with the previous three months, and to
the US they were down by 1.5 per cent.
The three-monthly measures of the figures confirm that the underlying trade
gap is being widened by flat exports and continued growth in imports. In the
three months to the end of August export volumes, excluding oil and
erratics, grew by 0.5 per cent compared with the same period a year ago, and
fell by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous three months.
The same measure of imports shows that they grew by 7.5 per cent year on
year, and by 1 per cent quarter on quarter. The weakness in export volumes
was spread across most categories, although exports of basic materials,
capital and intermediate goods suffered particularly badly.
Import gains were also widespread. Volumes of car imports rose by 20 per
cent in the three months to the end of August compared with the same period
a year ago, while imports of consumer goods rose by 13 per cent. Imports of
chemicals were up by 9 per cent.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the 'yawning trade
gap' was evidence that the government's policies had 'failed Britain and
destroyed Britain's industrial base'.
He added: 'There is no precedent anywhere in our economic history for a rise
in imports during a recession. If imports go up while demand is on the
floor, Britain is in for a monster trade gap if recovery ever comes.'
The Treasury said the drop in export volumes was not surprising given the
slowdown in the main world economies.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Lenders plan 3/4 -point cut in mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies yester-day prepared to trim their mortgage interest rates
by about  3/4 of a percentage point in the wake of the latest cut in base
rates.
National Savings responded by cutting the returns on its variable products
by 1 per cent and withdrawing its fixed-rate products from sale.
Northern Rock, the 11th-largest building society, and Leeds Permanent, the
fifth-biggest, broke ranks with the rest of the industry by reducing their
rates yesterday.
Leeds Permanent's mortgage interest rate went down from 10.70 per cent to
9.95 per cent with immediate effect for new borrowers and from next month
for existing borrowers.
Northern Rock cut its rates from 10.75 per cent to 9.99 per cent. The
reduction will save a customer with a Pounds 50,000 mortgage about Pounds 55
a month.
The other large mortgage lenders indicated that they were contemplating
similar cuts in mortgage interest rates - but said they would wait to see
how the money markets settled before making a move.
Abbey National and Halifax, the two largest UK lenders, both indicated that
they would be making reductions, but declined to say when. Halifax said it
would 'wait to see how the money markets settle' before deciding what cut it
would make in its mortgage rates.
Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, said: 'The antics of
the last few days must have left people pretty angry and bewildered, so a
rate cut will go some way towards making them feel better.'
Some lenders said that they hoped there might be a second cut in base rates
before long, enabling them to lower rates even further in the near future.
Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest
society, said: 'We will almost certainly be making a cut of about  3/4 of a
percentage point. We hope that it will cause a revival in the market, but we
are also hoping that there may be a further 1 per cent cut which will bring
rates down to 8 per cent and enable mortgage rates to drop further.'
Mr David Roebuck, chief executive of Barnsley Building Society, said: 'At
last we have some good news for the beleaguered housing market. We can
expect lower mortgage rates to stimulate activity.'
A cut of  3/4 of a percentage point in mortgage rates will mean that
mortgage lenders have slightly widened the margin between their rates to
borrowers and those to investors, restoring them to a full 1 percentage
point above base rate.
That brings the margin on their lending back to where it was in February
when Abbey National trimmed its margins to  3/4 of a percentage point,
forcing other lenders to follow suit.
The latest round of cuts may not be equally good news for all types of
mortgage lenders. Societies now show signs of moving towards a new set of
interest charge bands for mortgages. The losers are likely to be first-time
borrowers and customers with very large mortgages who may find that the
discounts they have been offered up until now are largely eroded.
The rate on the National Savings investment account will fall from 8.25 per
cent to 7.25 per cent, as from October 6, and the return on income bonds
will drop from 9 per cent to 8 per cent, as from November 5.
The products withdrawn from sale from 5.30pm yesterday were: 38th issue of
fixed interest certificates; Series E Capital bonds; First Option bonds;
Issue C Children's Bonus Bonds; and the Yearly Plan.
New rates will be announced shortly. There will not necessarily be cuts of 1
percentage point across the board because of the tax-free nature of many of
the products.
The 5th index-linked savings certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent
plus inflation if held for five years, remain on sale.
The attractive rates offered by National Savings products aroused
controversy during the summer when building societies claimed they were
suffering outflows of capital because of 'unfair' competition. National
Savings promptly reduced the return on the First Option Bond and made
across-the-board cuts in August.
During the current financial year, National Savings has raised about Pounds
2.4bn, helping the government to fund the public-sector borrowing
requirement.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Relief for home owners welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEBUILDERS, mortgage lenders and estate agents welcomed yesterday's cut
in interest rates - but warned that it was only a small step in the right
direction.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder,
said that it would take much more than 1 point or 2 points off interest
rates to stimulate a recovery in Britain's depressed housing market. Tarmac,
which yesterday announced a Pounds 15m first-half pre-tax loss, said it
planned to cut the number of homes it builds by up to a fifth next year.
'Interest rate cuts, although important, will not on their own encourage
people to rush out and buy homes when they are concerned about whether they
might have a job in six months' time,' Mr Simms said.
'The government will need to introduce measures other than just interest
rate cuts if it wants to get confidence back in the housing market and
economy as a whole.'
The Building Employers Confederation said it was looking for a further cut
of 1 percentage point in base rates as soon as possible.
It said: 'Having freed itself from the ERM straitjacket, the government
should seize the opportunity of taking bold and positive steps to stimulate
the economy, beginning with the housing and construction sector.'
The confederation wants the government to raise the ceiling for mortgage tax
relief from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 and remove stamp duty from house
purchases.
Housebuilders have pointed out that the US housing market remains very weak
even though US interest rates have been cut to 3 per cent and mortgage rates
to 6 per cent.
Mortgage lenders, although encouraged by yesterday's reduction in interest
rates, also remain cautious about prospects of an early revival of the
housing market. They say prices are likely to stay depressed even when sales
pick up - such is the overhang of properties waiting to come on the market.
At least 70,000 repossessions are expected next year, in addition to 40,000
unsold repossessed homes on the books of the mortgage lenders.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, said: 'The best that can be expected is that house prices may
stabilise next year.
'People are not going to rush back into the market.'
Leeds Permanent, one of only two societies that pressed ahead with mortgage
rate cuts of 0.75 per cent yesterday, nonetheless described the cuts as
great news for borrowers and the housing market.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is due tomorrow to publish a
survey of estate agents which will show that the depression in the housing
market is deeper than ever.
It said: 'The cut in base rates will help relieve the pain for hundreds of
thousands of mortgage payers.
'It is a step in the right direction which we hope, as soon as
ant-inflationary policy allows, will be followed by further cuts.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / Societies log good savings figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES last month enjoyed their best month so far this year in
the savings market. More than Pounds 327m flowed into building society
accounts in the month, compared with an outflow of Pounds 325m in July.
The improvement came after the government twice lowered rates on National
Savings products in order to ease market pressures on the societies.
Although the August savings figure was the highest this year, it was still
well below the level usually regarded as normal, and Mr John Wriglesworth,
building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, warned that it
meant societies would continue to face difficulties with funding.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
welcomed the improvement, saying the figure was substantially higher than a
year ago. However, he warned that the September savings figure might be down
again because of payments for the final instalment of regional electricity
company share issues.
The mortgage side of the building society industry continued to languish in
August. Net lending was unchanged from July at Pounds 1.7bn, but new lending
 -loans agreed but not yet paid out - fell sharply to Pounds 2.4bn from
Pounds 3.4bn in July. 4bn.
The fall probably reflects the end of the temporary suspension of stamp duty
on August 12. Since then, societies say, mortgage lending has been extremely
subdued.
Societies now hope that the mortgage market will recover as a result of
yesterday's cut in base rates - although it will take some months for the
long-term effects of the recent money market turbulence and consumer
uncertainty about interest rates start to become clear.
The July net outflow of Pounds 325m was one of the worst for the industry
since September 1986, when there was an outflow of Pounds 673m as savers
withdrew money to take part in the flotation of TSB.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Industry wants fresh action on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY yesterday wel-comed the reduction in interest rates as a step
towards economic recovery but called on the government to maintain its
downward pressure on inflation.
Sir Michael Angus, Confederation of British Industry president, said the cut
was 'fully justified' by the weakness of the real economy and exceptionally
low inflationary pressures. He called for a freeze in the public-sector pay
bill and urged the government to give priority to capital projects.
The Engineering Employers' Federation also called for a shift of public
resources into investment and infrastructure, rather than into consumer
spending.
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the federation, said: 'The previous
reason for high rates, the danger of inflation, has not gone away.'
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, welcomed
the cut and urged Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to make a further
reduction of 1 percentage point as soon as possible.
Mr Lamont, he added, had to be tough on public spending in order to control
inflation.
The Federation of Small Businesses said rates had to be cut back to between
5 per cent and 8 per cent to revive the economy.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Germany casts shadow over fall in rates: Despite sterling's
ERM exit, Europe still affects the UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN OR OUT of the European exchange rate mechanism, Britain cannot ignore
Germany. That point was underlined yesterday in the hour after the
1-percentage-point cut in UK base rates, when the pound fell 1 1/2 pfennigs
on news of a large growth in the German money supply.
While the drop in UK credit rates to 9 per cent caused widespread relief
among politicians, mortgage holders and industrialists, the signs that
inflation in Germany is still far from subdued slightly damped expectations
about the scope for further cuts in borrowing costs.
That said, yesterday's reduction in base rates to their lowest level since
June 1988 would not have been possible were Britain still an ERM member.
That will no doubt cheer the large number of anti-ERM Tory backbenchers as
they listen to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in tomorrow's Commons
debate on the economy.
According to yesterday's announcement from the Bundesbank, the German M3
measure of the money supply grew 9 per cent in the year to last month on an
annualised basis, well above the central bank's 5.5 per cent target. That
signal that upward pressures on German prices remain strong will almost
certainly increase the resolve of the Bundesbank to keep high its
internationally important Lombard rate, so influencing the cost of credit in
most European countries, whether they are ERM members or not.
Even so, Mr Lamont now has the luxury - denied him since Britain entered the
ERM nearly two years ago - of deciding on UK interest rates almost totally
with reference to domestic economic conditions. Yesterday he showed his
determination to make utmost use of the opportunity.
Since Black Wednesday, when the pound suffered extreme turbulence on the
foreign exchanges and Mr Lamont suspended the UK's ERM membership, the
chancellor has had to keep only half an eye on the level of sterling.
Thus it was that Mr Lamont was able to shrug off sterling's mid-morning
fall, which saw the pound touch about DM2.52, before recovering to close in
London at DM2.5450, up  3/4 pfennig on the day - about 23 pfennigs below the
pound's DM2.778 lower limit applied during ERM membership.
The 9 per cent base rates are likely to cut the cost of mortgages for
virtually all Britain's 10m home buyers. They will also ease borrowing
conditions for tens of thousands of businesses. As a result, the move may
speed recovery from the UK's longest peacetime recession since the 1930s.
Mr Lamont decided on a cut during discussions with Mr John Major, the prime
minister. The final go-ahead was given after talks at 8.30am yesterday at
the Treasury between the chancellor and his senior advisers. They included
Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, Mr Andrew Turnbull, Treasury
monetary expert, and Mr Eddie George, Bank of England deputy governor.
Those people judged that the level of the pound, as it stood yesterday
morning, already reflected the possibility of a cut in base rates,
minimising the chances of a significant fall after the cut. Also, the signs
of severe weakness in the UK economy - which has appeared flat for the past
six months - fully justified an easing in credit policy. Inflationary
conditions in Britain, which have eased considerably during the past few
months of the recession, are thought to impose only a tiny threat to
economic stability.
The crucial question now is whether the direction of interest rates is
firmly down, or whether considerations related to German credit policy, plus
the requirement to maintain restraints on UK inflation, will hold up any
further moves to cut borrowing costs.
To keep up the spirits of Tory backbenchers, Mr Lamont will almost certainly
want to follow up yesterday's move with a further cut in rates later in the
year, possibly before the Conservative party conference which starts in
Brighton in two weeks' time. But Mr Lamont emphasised yesterday that the UK
remained committed to bearing down on inflation, and would put up borrowing
rates should signs of large inflationary pressures reappear.
Also the government cannot afford to ignore the exchange rate. If the pound
falls too far against the D-Mark, inflationary pressures might increase
because import prices would be higher. Assuming the government is paying
more than lip service to the goal of rejoining the ERM when market
conditions are more settled, Mr Lamont will not want the pound to fall too
far out of alignment with the German currency.
All that means, in the eyes of many economists, that Britain would be
ill-disposed to see sterling fall much beneath around DM2.5.
Against that, the continuing sharp pressures yesterday on many of the
remaining eight currencies in the ERM - including the French franc - added
weight to theories that the mechanism may soon have to undergo a fundamental
readjustment or even be scrapped altogether to take into account the recent
market turbulence.
If the ERM is not long for this world, Mr Lamont can be forgiven for not
spending too much time worrying about Britain's future place in it. On those
grounds, the constraints on further cuts in interest rates may be somewhat
less than they appear.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Riding the business rollercoaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSAN JACOBS gathered her disbelieving workforce around her last Thursday as
base rates hit 15 per cent and punched the new cost of money into her
desktop computer.
'Their eyeballs were coming out of their heads,' she says. 'Their first
concern was the impact on their mortgages, which was horrific. The effect on
the business would have been terrible and immediate, but I knew interest
rates like that just could not stick.'
Miss Jacobs is the managing director and part-owner of Trident Tubes, a
small, north-London-based company specialising in the repair and maintenance
of scaffolding. Jokes about shoring up the economy have been only too easy
in the past week - but she says a sense of humour has been essential.
For the past seven days she has joined countless companies on the
interest-rate 'big dipper', holding on tight and praying that the ride would
end safely.
With interest rates moving up from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and then down
to 9 per cent, she says she is in no hurry to repeat the experience. She is
naturally pleased that interest rates have ended lower than they started,
but says it is too early to calculate the damage such turmoil may have
inflicted on fragile business confidence.
Miss Jacobs, previously a financial consultant, started her company in 1989
when she tried to get some aluminium welding work done on her Triumph
Trident motorcycle. The prices quoted suggested the work was highly
profitable and she decided to open an aluminium scaffolding repair business.
She has no regrets, although the company has been suffering as scaffolding
hire companies - which are her core customers - have suffered in the
recession and cut costs. That has often meant them carrying out their own
repair work.
Some of Trident's customers have gone bust, although the company has managed
to keep bad debts to an absolute minimum. But in recent weeks - before last
week's traumatic events - turnover had started to rise as painters and
decorators won more business. The beginnings of recovery, she says, were in
the air.
Then came Black Wednesday: 'Fifteen per cent interest rates were obviously
not sustainable. Even so, we were preparing to work ungodly hours to muster
what business we could in the hope of at least standing still.'
Now Miss Jacobs hopes that the lowest interest rates for more than four
years will further stimulate business recovery. But she wants the government
to keep an eye on inflation and to rule out big cuts in interest rates.
'We tried that in the late 1980s and look where it got us,' says Miss
Jacobs. 'We do not need another boom. Business needs sensible, well-paced
reductions in the cost of money and, above all, continuing stability.'
She thinks cheaper money will help to maintain the investment levels needed
to keep the workshop efficient. There is also a chance that it will bring
nearer the day when she takes on one or two additional employees.
Miss Jacobs expects to end this week in a more optimistic mood than last.
'But business is still not sure what will happen next week, never mind next
month,' she adds.
'I expect conditions to remain erratic for the next few months at least. We
will have to watch and wait. Perhaps after Christmas things will be more
clear.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / A hard act to follow: The Bundesbank is a model, but
difficult to imitate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The central bank is fully sovereign in its relationship with the
government; it is responsible only to itself. We have a body which is
responsible to no one, neither to a parliament, nor to a government' -
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, 1956.
After the bruising, losing tussle against the D-Mark and the pound's
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism, the British government
is searching for a new economic nostrum. Can the German Bundesbank, the
bogeyman of the sterling debacle, provide, after all, a source of salvation?
In parliament, the press and the City, there is growing support for placing
British monetary policy in the hands of a reformed Bank of England, geared
to price stability, and guaranteed Bundesbank-style independence.
This could be the centrepiece of what Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
calls, with deliberate emphasis, a new 'British' monetary policy. He wants
to maintain a low inflation rate - but above all, as yesterday's 1
percentage point interest rate cut showed, Mr Lamont wants to end the
recession.
Britain and other countries can certainly learn from the experience of a
central bank which has vitally contributed to post-war German stability and
prosperity. As the institution which sets the direction of interest rates
throughout Europe, the Bundesbank has influence that runs well beyond
Germany's enlarged borders.
However, even if the government adopted the goal of an independent central
bank, building a British Bundesbank on the clay of Threadneedle Street would
be a daunting - perhaps impossible - task.
A combination of the Bundesbank's legal statutes and a succession of
tough-minded presidents has given the Bundesbank a unique reputation for
standing up to governments at home and abroad. It has shown craft,
professionalism and pragmatism in pursuing its statutory aim - the same as
that of the 1939 Reichsbank - of 'safeguarding the currency'.
All this has contributed to the bank's own powerful mythology - an important
reinforcement of its credibility on financial markets. Venerated for its
orthodoxy, vilified for its obstinacy, the Bundesbank is deity and demon
combined.
Last week's hints of a sterling devaluation by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, have made him - in the eyes of Whitehall, as well as
the British tabloid press - the villain of the currency drama. Mr
Schlesinger has been undiplomatic, but he has also been doing his job. Under
the 1957 Bundesbank Law, the bank has to guard the value of Germany's
currency - not that of anyone else's.
The Bundesbank is a product of German history: of this century's tortuous
cycle, twice played out, of war and defeat, inflation and recovery. Drawing
on traditions and personnel of the Reichsbank, the post-war central bank was
established in 1948 by the western allies as the Bank deutscher Lander. It
was independent from the German government primarily because, in 1948, there
was no German government.
In 1951, work started on transforming the Bank deutscher Lander into the
Bundesbank. After several years of tortuous deliberations, the 1957
Bundesbank Law centralised some aspects of the bank's decision-making. But
today's federal structure - above all, the regional make-up of the 18-man
policy-making council - is the basic result of post-war US efforts to break
up the centrally controlled apparatus of Nazi power.
The Bundesbank's anti-inflation track record makes it a model for many
nations. Yet the conditions which have fostered the Bundesbank cannot easily
be reproduced elsewhere. Even in Germany, the decision 35 years ago to make
money creation the responsibility of an independent institution caused a
political battle.
Chancellor Adenauer, who once summoned the Bank deutscher Lander council to
Bonn to try to forestall an interest rate rise, opposed the bank's
independence. The Bundestag, however, passed the law because the German
people had twice seen - in the 1923 hyperinflation, and again in 1945-48 -
how utterly politicians could wipe out the value of money.
The UK's experience of currency debauchery, by contrast, has been more
gradual. Perhaps only a country which has weathered Germany's traumatic
experiences can maintain a public consensus permitting unpopular monetary
policies to be run by unelected officials.
For Britain, the chastening lesson of the past two years of ERM membership
is that the post-war German consensus in favour of fiscal orthodoxy has
broken down under the financial strain of reunification. Yet the
Bundesbank's monetary orthodoxy - if anything, buttressed after the bank's
disagreements with the government over German monetary union two years ago -
remains as strong as ever.
The clash between large German public deficits and the Bundesbank's
anti-inflation rectitude accounts for high D-Mark interest rates over the
past two years, and hence Britain's ERM exit.
Even if the Bank of England were made independent, a future governor would
need considerable time before he could equal the stature of a Bundesbank
president. When he speaks, a German central banker combines the moral
authority of a high priest with the fire-power of a general. 'There can be
no hard currency without hard measures,' warned Mr Karl Blessing, the
Bundesbank's first president.
Both Mr Schlesinger and Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank's president
between 1980 and 1991, have done their best to play down the Bundesbank's
power. Recalling how the most celebrated of his predecessors, Mr Hjalmar
Schacht, twice president of the pre-war Reichsbank, carried greater weight
than many German chancellors, Mr Pohl would remark: 'The Bundesbank is not a
shadow government.' Mr Schlesinger says, with justification, 'Our
independence depends on our ability not to overstep our limits.'
The Bundesbank's power is indeed limited, in legal terms, to its ability to
raise and lower interest rates without taking 'instructions' from Bonn. In
other matters - including the fixing of exchange rates, where the Bundesbank
thought the D-Mark conversion terms in German monetary union were far too
generous - it can be overruled by the government.
The main reason for Mr Pohl's resignation last year was, indeed, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's failure to heed his advice on German monetary unification.
In the mainstream monetary policy area, the Bundesbank has defended its
ground with determination. The Reichsbank, by contrast (particularly after
1939), was almost totally subservient to Hitler.
Independence, however, has never been seen as a panacea. When the Reichsbank
was made autonomous from the German government in 1922, Mr Rudolf
Havenstein, the hapless Reichsbank president, wrote presciently: 'For
limiting inflation, today's autonomy of the Reichsbank is but a very small
expedient.' Next year, the consumer price index rose nearly 2,000
billion-fold.
In 1933, when Hitler took power, the Reichsbank was still nominally
independent. The Fuhrer brought in a man of his choice, Mr Schacht, as
president - paying off Mr Hans Luther, the incumbent, with the
ambassadorship to Washington.
Bloodied by political in-fighting though it may occasionally be, the
Bundesbank is an organism which governments fight at their peril. Three
chancellors - Mr Ludwig Erhard, Mr Kurt Georg Kiesinger and Mr Helmut
Schmidt - owe their downfall to the Bundesbank's stern monetary policies.
One example was the role of Mr Blessing in the 1966 eclipse of Chancellor
Erhard. A former Reichsbanker and Nazi party member who under Mr Schacht was
in charge of monetary union with Austria in the 1938 Anschluss, Mr Blessing
quickly found his feet - like many former Reichsbank functionaries - in the
new democracy.
After the Bundesbank's high interest rates helped topple Mr Erhard - a man
who had helped to foster Mr Blessing's post-war career - the one-time
protege admitted he had used 'brute force to put things in order'.
Although ensconced on Europe's monetary throne, the Bundesbank is not
without rivals who seek to pull it down. The EC's plan for economic and
monetary union (Emu) is not, as Lord Ridley, then UK secretary of state for
industry, remarked in 1990 with grandiose failure of perception, 'a German
racket designed to take over the whole of Europe'.
Rather, it is an attempt, led by France and Italy, to emasculate the
Bundesbank by subsuming the D-Mark into a single European currency. The
Bundesbank has long mounted a campaign to sabotage the plan. If, as a large
majority of German voters now appears to want, Emu does not happen, the
Bundesbank will not weep.
'We can very well live with the status quo,' was Mr Pohl's laconic comment
in 1989. Mr Schlesinger said frankly in 1990 that his country would have
neither the time nor the energy to carry out simultaneously German and
European monetary union. By the time that the 125th anniversary of the
Reichsbank is commemorated in the year 2000, the Bundesbank will surely be
there to join in the celebrations.

<TEXT>
'we will never devalue' - Lamont is a happy man. He can look at Germany's
dreadful figures for the money supply with the joy of someone gazing from
shore at a ship caught in a fierce tempest. He can commiserate with the
plight of all the passengers. He can feel quiet pleasure over Mr Helmut
Schlesinger's unwillingness to see sterling on board the ERM again. And,
above all, he can cut interest rates below the German level.
The chancellor says that yesterday's one percentage point cut in interest
rates was 'justified on fundamental economic grounds'. But he was unlikely
to say anything else. He also says he is determined to persist with the
policy of defeating inflation. 'If at any time I thought inflation was going
to pose a problem again,' he asserts, 'I would not hesitate to put rates
up.' But unkind folk may remember that this is the chancellor who said but a
week ago that he would do whatever was necessary to defend sterling within
the ERM.
What the chancellor says can be ignored. What matters far more is what he
does. After an effective devaluation of 8.4 per cent over the last week,
monetary policy has already been substantially loosened. Should the
government want to match rates of inflation elsewhere in Europe - still a
worthy goal - the case for further rapid loosening, though it can be made,
is not overwhelming.
It is because the government can adjust policy at will that it should be
particularly careful about what it does now. It should ask itself what
signals will be sent both to employers and to employees if it appears
absolutely determined to combine devaluation with monetary expansion. The
need to show such caution would be far less if the government were to
establish a convincing set of institutional changes for the control of
monetary policy. But, as it is, the chancellor seems enchanted by his new
freedom to run the country by the seat of his pants.
A damaged government presiding over a country with a plunging exchange rate,
a fiscal deficit of more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product and
underlying price inflation still around 4 per cent needs, like Caesar's
wife, to be above suspicion. This government is not. Yesterday's interest
rate cut - probably justifiable in and of itself - does nothing to remove
the doubts.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Smiling, not drowning: The UK chancellor's economic policy
is in ruins, but he has never seemed so cheerful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians are paid to be resilient.
But Mr Norman Lamont is setting new standards of cheeriness in the face of
apparent disaster.
Although his economic policy is in tatters and his credibility with the
markets and many Conservative backbenchers is seriously diminished, he has
never looked happier since becoming chancellor.
Mr Lamont's puckish - almost feline - grin was so much in evidence during
the past weekend in Washington that he was asked by journalists why he was
in such good humour. 'I always look on the bright side,' he said, adding:
'My wife said she had never heard me sing in the bath before.'
As yesterday's 1 percentage point cut in base rates shows, the chancellor
has some reason to feel pleased with himself. Now freed of the constraint of
the European exchange rate mechanism, he has been able to push the UK's
short-term interest rates below those of Germany for the first time since
the early 1980s.
The move is not without risk. Yesterday's sharp fall in sterling will have
done nothing to further the government's stated goal of low inflation.
But there is no doubt that UK monetary policy in the ERM has been too tight,
and this persuaded the Treasury and the Bank of England to sanction lower
interest rates. At the same time, Mr Lamont's main objective is to save his
political career. The rate cut could not be better timed in view of
tomorrow's economic debate in the Commons.
The suspension of sterling in the ERM has opened up other opportunities for
the embattled chancellor.
It allows him to play the Euro-sceptic card. In the Commons, Mr Lamont's
position is widely perceived as weak after last week's humiliation. But it
is far from hopeless so long as he can establish himself as the cabinet
spokesman for those Tories who are hostile to Europe.
His bid to grasp the intellectual leadership of the Euro-sceptics was
apparent in Washington, just hours after the news of the narrow majority for
the Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht.
On Sunday afternoon Mr Lamont had chaired a meeting of European Community
finance ministers with the aim of providing verbal support for financial
markets. He did his duty by the British presidency of the EC by reading a
statement in which the ministers said they were committed to the European
Monetary System 'as a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in
Europe'.
Seconds later, however, he was wearing his British hat and issuing a far
less enthusiastic statement about the EMS. 'As far the UK is concerned, we
have made clear that a number of important and fundamental issues will need
to be addressed before sterling rejoins the ERM,' it said.
His performance when answering questions was notable for the fluency and
passion with which he warned governments to heed public opinion when pushing
ahead with plans for European integration. The man who had frequently
appeared uneasy when expounding government economic policy in the months
ahead of last week's decision to float the pound seemed on much surer ground
when discussing the merits of a cautious political approach to Europe.
The press conference gave an insight into some of the frustration he must
have felt when negotiating the economic and monetary union part of the
Maastricht treaty. He had, he said, explained 'again and again and again' to
his European colleagues that governments must take account of the wishes of
the people of Europe. After the Danish No vote and the feeble French Yes,
the chancellor clearly felt that his political beliefs and instincts had
been vindicated.
What still has to be vindicated is the chancellor's belief that the UK
economy will recover from recession. He takes care these days not to spy
'green shoots of recovery' or prophesy 'recovery around the corner'. But he
is equally anxious 'not to overdo the gloom'.
On the plus side, he can point to a slight increases in non-oil gross
domestic product and retail sales in the second quarter and higher
manufacturing output in both the first and second quarters of this year.
Lower interest rates and a more competitive exchange rate following the
floating of sterling may now inject the so-far missing ingredient of
confidence.
After slogging through 22 months of grim economic news the thought that
Britain might be poised for recovery would explain Mr Lamont's cheerfulness.
But he will have to make sure that he does not unleash a bubble economy. For
bubbles only end in tears.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Divided France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER CAN a vote in France have been followed with such attention by the
rest of Europe as last Sunday's referendum. But to those who looked to
France to determine their future the French electorate returned a Delphic
answer, lending itself to opposite interpretations. Is the glass half full
or half empty? Is the Maastricht treaty alive or dead?
Time will answer that question. Meanwhile the French, by the way they
divided on this difficult question, have given a remarkable portrait of
themselves to their fellow Europeans, and to their own political class -
those trying to govern them now and those aspiring to do so in the future.
It is a portrait such that the task of providing them with leadership for
the years ahead might well daunt even the most ambitious.
That France should be evenly divided is nothing new in itself. As it
celebrates its 200th birthday this week, the French republic can look back
on a history of division into right and left, which have often been very
finely balanced. But the division revealed by Sunday's vote was quite
different.
Among political leaders, only Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front
took more than 90 per cent of his followers with him into the No lobby.
Eighty one per cent of communist supporters voted No; 78 per cent of
Socialist ones voted Yes. Sixty one per cent of Mr Valery Giscard
d'Estaing's UDF supporters (moderate conservatives) joined him in voting
Yes, while Mr Jacques Chirac could only get 41 per cent of Gaullists to do
so.
Those who voted Yes were older (especially the women among them), more
prosperous, above all better educated than those who voted No. Typically
they were white-collar workers, managers or members of the professional
middle class. People on low wages, farmers, artisans, shopkeepers and the
unemployed overwhelmingly opposed the treaty.
Such findings make the political conclusions from the vote very difficult to
draw. What they reveal - and it is a fair guess that other European
countries are not very different in this respect - is that the great social
and economic movements of our time are affecting different social categories
very unequally. Roughly half the population is doing well enough to feel
optimistic, and to see the rapid opening of France's economy and society to
outside influences and competition as an opportunity. The other half feels
it is being trampled on and left by the wayside, and seizes a chance to
shout 'stop'.
Everyone is saying that Europe has to hear the message from those who voted
No, and to take account of their views. Yet it is far from certain that
making European institutions simpler and more transparent, or slowing down
the process of European integration, or transferring powers back from
Brussels to national governments will actually make many of these people
feel better. Perhaps they will be cheered up, momentarily, by the landslide
defeat that President Mitterrand's Socialist party is all but certain to
suffer in parliamentary elections next March. But unless the material
benefits of increased trade within Europe begin to be felt by these
categories of the population, no merely political change is going to
reconcile them to their rulers.
Unfortunately, given the current performance of the German economy, and the
monetary policies that imposes on governments striving to achieve economic
convergence, there is little prospect of that happening at all soon.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl's task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THE turmoil in the currency markets, Mr Helmut Kohl's meeting with Mr
Francois Mitterrand to discuss the fate of the Maastricht treaty for a
European union looks like a case of rearranging the deckchairs on the
Titanic. But there is a difference: Mr Kohl is at least nominally in charge
of the iceberg. Is he able to change the course set by Bonn?
Yesterday's announcement that German broad money - the figure targeted by
the Bundesbank - grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent between the last
quarter of 1991 and August 1992 was a shock. The figure, up sharply from
July's 8.5 per cent, was both well above average expectations for an
increase of 8.1 per cent and still further above the target growth of 5.5
per cent for the year. With annual inflation widely forecast to be 3.4 per
cent in September, little suggests the Bundesbank will be easing again in
the near, or even the more distant, future.
The D-Mark has gained an effective trade-weighted appreciation of 2.3 per
cent since the beginning of last week, which will please the Bundesbank. It
has seen the ERM tree shaken and the Italian lira and sterling fall off. The
Spanish peseta has fallen onto a lower branch, while other currencies are
little more secure.
The ERM is, in effect, a casualty of the Bundesbank's war against what it
sees as a profligate German government. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, has made supportive remarks about the French franc.
But these do not ensure a change in the Bundesbank's behaviour, since it
regards the immediate monetary consequences of the DM 60bn (Pounds 24bn) in
foreign exchange intervention mounted this month with great distaste. France
may yet be driven to raise interest rates in a bid to defend the franc.
Is the Bundesbank satisfied? Probably not. The German central bank is
determined to prevent a German credit explosion. It knows that many
criticise its targeting of broad money. But the Bundesbank has good reason
to trust its judgment over that of its critics and will continue with its
policies so long as credit grows so quickly.
In the longer term, credit growth will slow. American experience in the
1980s with a not dissimilar combination of loose fiscal and tight monetary
policies suggests that the German exchange rate will ultimately depreciate.
A real depreciation of the D-Mark may also be required if east German labour
is to be re-employed. But considerable discomfort is bound to remain in the
short to medium term.
Responsibility for the discomfort lies mainly with Bonn's fiscal policies.
The rhetoric of the German government in favour of European political and
economic union has been matched by its indifference to the consequences for
Europe of its policies to deal with German unification. Until the German
government closes this gap, the project for European union will continue to
drift towards the iceberg, whatever initiatives Mr Kohl may devise with Mr
Mitterrand.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Credit Lyonnais profits fall in wake of provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank which has come under
criticism for its aggressive expansion strategy and loans policy, suffered a
sharp fall in net profits in the first half of 1992 following a steep
increase in provisions.
The collapse in net profits - from FFr1.6bn to FFr119m (Pounds 13.2m) -
triggered a profits warning from Thomson-CSF, the French electronics group
which is a significant minority shareholder in the bank.
Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson-CSF, warned that the company would not
meet its profits forecast for this year because of the shortfall from Credit
Lyonnais.
Thomson-CSF, which three years ago acquired its 15.5 per cent stake in
Credit Lyonnais in return for ceding control of Altus, its old financial
subsidiary, produced net profits of FFr2.35bn last year.
The shares of both Credit Lyonnais and Thomson-CSF were suspended yesterday
only to fall sharply when they resumed trading.
Credit Lyonnais' shares ended the day FFr42 down at FFr510 and Thomson-CSF's
shares slipped by FFr12 to FFr135.9.
This will be the second successive year of high provisions for Credit
Lyonnais. It raised provisions 85.6 per cent to FFr6.3bn in the first half
of this year and warned it would be forced to make hefty write-downs in the
second half.
Credit Lyonnais attributed the rise in first-half provisions to the problems
of its Dutch subsidiary and the Paris property market. Last year it saw net
profits slip to FFr3.16bn from FFr3.71bn, after doubling client risk
provisions to FFr9.5bn because of losses on loans to clients such as Mr
Robert Maxwell, the disgraced British media magnate.
The bank, which is chaired by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, also warned that its
second-half banking activities could be affected by the uncertain economic
environment.
Its net banking income rose 16 per cent to FFr24.4bn in the first half with
gross operating profits increasing 33 per cent to FFr6.8bn.
Credit Lyonnais's results mark the start of the interim reporting season for
France's big banks.
Although the aggressive Credit Lyonnais is seen as the most exposed of the
French banks, analysts are bracing themselves for increased provisions
across the industry because of the weakness of the Paris property market and
the sluggish state of the French economy.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Tarmac falls to Pounds 15m first-half loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest housebuilder, is to cut the number of homes it
builds by up to a fifth after one of the worst trading periods in its
history.
The company also intends to pull out of commercial property development and
to raise cash to reduce debts by selling more of its business.
The group, unveiling its proposals yesterday, said it had incurred a Pounds
15.1m pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year against an Pounds
18.2m pre-tax profit during last year's first half.
Tarmac's shares rose 8p to 78p after the company said it planned to pay an
unchanged interim dividend of 3p.
It also expected to pay a maintained final dividend resulting in a total
payment of 5.5p this year.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, welcomed yesterday's decision to reduce
British base rates by one percentage point but warned this would not be
enough to stimulate a UK housing market recovery.
The company intends to cut the number of homes it builds to between 7,000
and 7,500 next year from about 8,500 this year and 9,300 homes last year.
Tarmac, which would still be Britain's biggest housebuilder, expects to free
about Pounds 100m from capital employed next year by reducing its building
programme. The company also plans to run down its commercial property
division and to increase sales of non-core businesses.
Disposals have raised Pounds 100m this year and could reach Pounds 200m by
the end of this year depending on the sale for about Pounds 80m of
Econowaste, the group's waste disposal business.
Further disposals from the company's industrial products division could
raise Pounds 100m next year, says Tarmac.
This might indicate it is willing to sell its Ruberoid roofing business
acquired for Pounds 141m in 1988.
Mr Simms said disposals were expected to reduce gearing to less than 40 per
cent by the year-end. This compared with gearing approaching 60 per cent at
the end of June when net debt stood at Pounds 744m.
Three of the group's seven divisions incurred losses in the first half.
Commercial property lost Pounds 6.2m, Tarmac America lost Pounds 1.5m and
building materials excluding quarry products lost Pounds 2.7m.
Quarry profits fell from Pounds 24m to Pounds 13.5m; housing profits slipped
from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 7m; contracting profits fell from Pounds 10.7m to
Pounds 9.3m.

FT  23 SEP 92 / BAe to retain corporate jet division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace yesterday announced it would retain its corporate jet
business, reversing an earlier decision to sell a majority stake in this
profitable sector. The move came on the eve of the company's announcement of
its interim results.
The company apparently failed to secure a sufficiently attractive offer for
this business.
The City expects the company will report a trading loss of between Pounds
20m to Pounds 40m. In addition, it could write-off as much as Pounds 750m on
various problem areas, mainly its regional aircraft operations. Investors
are also braced for a possible dividend cut.
The company is also expected to sign a preliminary agreement with Taiwan
Aerospace on a joint venture on the future of its loss-making regional
aircraft business.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's new chairman, is also due to unveil a radical
restructuring as part of the company's recovery strategy.
BAe's announcement that it would maintain control of corporate jet
activities was timed to coincided with the start of the Dallas business
aircraft trade show.
BAe said last May it was transferring its corporate jet business into a new
company called Corporate Jets with a view to selling a majority stake in
this activity. However, it said yesterday that, after reviewing several
proposals, it had decided it was in the best interests of shareholders,
customers and employees to retain the business.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said yesterday he was pleased
uncertainty surrounding this activity had been lifted and 'we can now
concentrate . . on further improving our leading position in the market
place'.
BAe manufactures the 125-800 medium-sized twin-engined corporate jet and a
longer-range BAe 1000 at Chester with sales, design and engineering support
at Hatfield.
City analysts estimated the corporate jet business to be worth around Pounds
200m.
Beech Aircraft, the business aircraft subsidiary of Raytheon of the US, was
understood to have been interested in acquiring BAe's corporate business.
Dassault of France and Bombardier of Canada indicated this month they were
not interested.
Although the business continues to make money, BAe originally decided to
sell a controlling stake because of the substantial costs and risks of
developing future products.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Tesco's growth slows to 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS growth at Tesco slowed to 10 per cent in the first half of the
financial year as the UK's second biggest grocery chain ran into the brunt
of the recession.
Higher operating margins and contributions from 12 new stores enabled the
company to lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 251.8m but Tesco said there were
clear signs of customers cutting their spend. At the interim stage last year
profit growth was 22 per cent.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said: 'I have been in this industry for 30
years and I have never experienced trading conditions like this before.
Consumers have been shot to pieces. Confidence has absolutely gone and is at
zero in this country. The government has to try to regenerate confidence.'
In the 24 weeks to August 15, group sales, excluding VAT, rose 9 per cent to
Pounds 3.41bn of which 2 percentage points was generated from existing
stores and 7 points from new selling space.
Operating profits climbed 17 per cent to Pounds 234.9m as Tesco benefited
from improved productivity levels and the extended use of information
technology.
The operating margin climbed 0.5 percentage points to 6.9 per cent but
interest receivable fell from Pounds 29.4m to Pounds 16.9m.
Sir Ian said Tesco's sales performance was better than the industry average
with market share improving from 9.6 per cent in February to 9.9 per cent in
July. However, he conceded Tesco's sales increases might have lagged behind
those of its arch rival, J. Sainsbury. The average spend in Tesco's
superstores fell 3 per cent to Pounds 30 during the half-year.
The company said there had been a fall in food price inflation in recent
months to the present level of 1.5 per cent.
Sales were running 8.5 per cent higher with new stores contributing 7.5 per
cent and existing stores experiencing a 0.5 per cent volume decline. 'In the
short-term we do not anticipate any increases in current sales trends,' Sir
Ian said.
Staff productivity was sharply higher as the number of employees fell 3 per
cent to 85,081.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 9.04p. The interim
dividend was lifted 12.5 per cent to 2.25p.
Tesco said it served 500,000 customers each Sunday and was pressing for
total deregulation.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Accounting review brings mixed results: The first
company-by-company analysis of the impact of the forthcoming changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bright red document three inches thick has been causing a loud thump as it
landed on the desks of investment institutions throughout the City over the
past few days.
'Accounting Matters', a guide to the work of the Accounting Standards Board
(ASB), has emerged after six months of drafting in the London headquarters
of James Capel, the investment house.
In 26 sections it contains the first comprehensive attempt to quantify the
effect of changes in the financial reporting requirements being introduced
for the accounts of the leading 200 British quoted companies.
The analysis shows a picture of widespread change. It illustrates a
substantial alteration to cashflow multiples and reported earnings figures
generated by the new requirements. It also highlights the possible effects
of a number of other issues on the agenda of the ASB.
Capel's analysis emphasises the impact of the ASB's first financial
reporting exposure draft (Fred 1), likely to come into effect later this
year.
The draft will require companies to split out results of companies acquired
during the year, separate continuing and discontinuing activities, all but
abolish extraordinary items and show more clearly the profit or loss
generated by the disposal of revalued fixed assets.
One of the most important effects will be to increase sharply the volatility
of earnings, the firm argues. With extraordinary items all but abolished,
and those remaining included in earnings calculations, the figure will
become far more 'lumpy'.
It shows that at George Wimpey, for example, the 1991 reported loss per
share of 7.5p would be increased to 11.7p under Fred 1. At Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the inclusion as required by Fred 1 of the Pounds 65m
extraordinary charge shown in the 1991 results would have reduced earnings
per share from 34p to 16.9p.
The change reflects the ASB's desire to move the attention of readers of
accounts away from a single number - earnings - towards a wider range of
indicators of a company's performance.
But the firm suggests that readers will still want to refer to earnings, and
the new standard will generate a confusingly wide range of alternative
figures: the existing reported earnings; the new Fred 1 version; one
produced by the company smoothed over five years; and others generated by
different City analysts.
Capel itself will be publishing its version of the earnings figure, which
will use the Fred 1 method, but exclude costs of withdrawal from a business
segment, gains or losses from disposal of properties, and some other
'unusual items'.
The aggregate price earnings ratio for the FT-Actuaries industrial sector,
excluding oil, in 1991 would be 16.6 using Fred 1, 15.1 with the Capel
figure, compared with 15.7 using existing reported earnings.
Capel also says that while Fred 1 requires companies to separate the profits
generated during the year internally from those contributed by acquisitions,
analysts will still need to strip out organic growth for acquisitive
companies over a longer period.
Cashflow multiples are changing substantially as a result of the first
financial reporting standard on the cashflow statement, which became
mandatory for year-ends after March 23 this year.
Capel says its old cashflow per share figure based on the source and
application of funds statement no longer works. For example, over the period
1990-92, the difference between the old calculation and a new one based on
the cashflow statement is as high as a fall of 49 per cent in the case of
BICC.
Looking forward, the firm comments on a number of future standards. It warns
that proposals to amortise goodwill and to revalue regularly fixed assets
which are depreciated will be highly contentious.
In contrast to some recent attempts to make overall judgments on the state
of company accounts - notably Mr Terry Smith's book 'Accounting for Growth'
which caused considerable anger among some of the companies cited - the
Capel team says no general message emerged.
'This is not a scorecard,' said Mr David Gray, deputy head of research, who
admits that companies were sensitive about the firm's purpose in re-casting
the numbers. 'We tried to find some way of projecting our findings (into a
general set of rules) but we couldn't do it.'
The firm is generally positive about the work of the ASB, although it does
highlight several problems. 'The changes should give analysts more reliable
numbers and more background detail to work with and should ease the
interpretation of company accounts,' the document says.
Reaction to Capel's document has so far been muted.
Mr Ronald Henderson, finance director of BICC, said: 'The size of the tome
put me off. So much of what might change is still speculative. Most of the
issues highlighted could be established with a little research, but anything
that improves the clarity of accounts for readers is helpful.'
He stressed that he was 'broadly supportive' of the work of the ASB, but did
not believe it represented as much of a revolution as some commentators were
suggesting.
'I have to confess I haven't read it all,' said Mr Roger Woods, finance
director of George Wimpey. 'But it does show the need to focus on cashflow
per share and place less sole emphasis on earnings.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond price drop offsets UK
interest rate move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A SHARP decline in bond prices, lower car shares and a wave of computer sell
programs sent US stock prices tumbling across the board yesterday, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.98 at 3,280.85,
its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated
5 full points to 417.14, while the American SE composite dipped 1.73 to
380.99 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.58 to 583.00. Turnover on the New
York SE came to 187m shares.
Although news of a cut in UK interest rates provided the basis for a firm
opening to trading - analysts have argued that lower European interest rates
will spur growth in the US - a sharp fall in US bond prices more than offset
the positive effect of the UK rates move.
Long-dated Treasuries fell by more than a point, pushing yields back up
towards 7.5 per cent, in reaction to the unexpectedly steep 10.4 per cent
rise in August housing starts, calls from the International Monetary Fund
meeting in Washington DC for the US to lift its interest rates once the
recovery picks up, and stronger than expected department and chain store
sales
Equities were also troubled by computer sell programs, which exacerbated
weakness in a market already unsettled by a big decline in car shares.
The fall in the motor sector was prompted by securities house Wertheim
Schroder, which reduced its 1992 estimates for Ford (from Dollars 2.55
earnings a share to Dollars 1.45) and General Motors (from a 45 cents a
share profit to a 30 cents a share loss), and lowered its rating for
Chrysler from a 'buy' to a 'hold'.
The Wertheim analyst explained his moves by saying that Ford was troubled by
weak car sales in Europe, especially in the UK, that GM was losing market
share in a sluggish US environment, and that Chrysler's shares were due for
a revision in the wake of the stock's recent run-up.
Ford finished Dollars 2 3/8 down at Dollars 40 3/8 , GM Dollars 1 1/4
cheaper at Dollars 33 and Chrysler off Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 23 3/8 , all
after heavy trading.
Fingerhut dropped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 27 after warning that
third-quarter earnings would come in below analysts' expectations of between
39 and 42 cents a share.
General Mills slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 on news that
securities house Goldman Sachs had removed the stock from its recommended
list after the company reported weak restaurant business.
On the Nasdaq market, leading stocks were mostly lower in a blue chip
sell-off. Borland International receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 ,
Microsoft Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 3/4 , Amgen Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
67 1/2 and Sun Microsystems Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 30 1/8 .
Canada
AFTER losing ground in the morning, the Toronto market moved narrowly in the
afternoon around the lower levels, faring better than the Wall Street weak
performance.
Traders said that in recent days international investors had already grown
nervous over Canada's pending October 27 referendum on a constitutional deal
to keep the country united.
The TSE 300 index closed 17.2 lower at 3,402.8 and declines led rises by 348
to 209 after volume of 26.8m shares.
BP Canada withdrew its proposed secondary offering of 5.5m Royal Oak Mines
shares, citing last week's explosion at Royal Oak's Giant Mine and resulting
uncertainty surrounding Royal Oak. BP Canada lost CDollars  1/8 to CDollars
15 and Royal Oak 4 cents to CDollars 1.96.

FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese institutions
sidelined for holiday
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL-LOT purchases by investment trusts and foreigners complemented
arbitrage-related index buying yesterday, and the Nikkei average closed
firmer after light trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 216.48 at 18,282.72 after fluctuating on arbitrage-related
business, reaching a low for the day of 17,993.98 in the morning and a
subsequent high of 18,450.62.
Volume rose moderately to 280m shares from 237m, while advances outnumbered
declines by 569 to 379, with 184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks put on 10.65 at 1,366.16, but in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index softened 2.20 to 1,096.45.
Institutional investors remained inactive ahead of today's national holiday.
Financial institutions and corporations also remained on the sidelines ahead
of the September book closing for the first six months of the fiscal year.
Foreigners were seen buying large-capital issues such as steels. Traders
said foreign investors who had sold steel and shipbuilding shares were
covering their positions. Nippon Steel improved Y4 to Y304.
Aids-related speculative shares lost ground. Terumo, which surged on Monday
on reports that it had developed an anti-Aids substance jointly with a
university in southern Japan, receded Y60 to Y890 on profit-taking.
'Japanese brokers are having a hard time finding a new theme to follow
Aids,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Itoman failed to trade for the second consecutive day, and closed at an
offered price of Y188, down from Monday's offered price of Y268. Five Itoman
shares will be swapped for one share in the unlisted Sumikin Bussan, a steel
trading company of the Sumitomo group which Itoman will merge with early
next year.
Aoki, the construction company that will become a Nikkei index component
stock on Thursday, attracted heavy buying and climbed Y30 to Y580. Seika
rose Y14 to Y698 and Yaskawa Electric gained Y25 at Y535 on expectations
that the stocks will also be picked as index components.
Public works-related issues advanced on hopes of higher earnings due to the
government's additional fiscal spending. Nippon Road added Y40 at Y1,340 and
Sumitomo Cement Y7 at Y557.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 120.67 to 19,604.69 in volume of 21.4m
shares.
Roundup
MIXED sentiment ruled in the region yesterday.
SEOUL continued to lose ground on political worries, although the market was
supported by gains in Hyundai Group shares. The composite index dipped 2.38
to 519.16 in turnover of Won226.1bn.
Hyundai companies rose on rumours that credit sanctions imposed when Mr
Chung Ju-yung, the group's founder, announced that he was to enter politics
were to be lifted.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction rose by its daily limit of Won600 to
Won11,700 on speculation that the company may be able to bid again for the
contract to build the new Hong Kong airport.
TAIWAN rallied after Monday's fall, the index closing 42.85 up at 3,524.75
in turnover down to TDollars 14bn from TDollars 16.2bn. Hualon preferred
stock was one of the day's biggest losers, dropping TDollars 5 to TDollars
68.50.
KARACHI saw its steepest rise this year as investors scrambled to snap up
low-priced textile shares. The KSE 100-share index climbed 51.49, or 4.5 per
cent, to 1,193.96.
AUSTRALIA weakened on nervousness about uncertainty in European currency
markets. The All Ordinaries index slipped 10.8 to 1,520.8 in turnover of
ADollars 171.2m.
MANILA lost ground as Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell sharply in
overnight US trading. The composite index declined 14.50 to 1,396.15 in
turnover of 91m pesos.
PLDT lost 25 pesos to 970 pesos. Some analysts said investors were selling
common shares in preparation to switch to the forthcoming offer of preferred
shares.
HONG KONG saw little activity and the Hang Seng index ended 1.35 off at
5,740.18 in turnover of HKDollars 2.05bn.

FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok heartened by period of
political calm - Turnover has hit record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok's bulls paused for breath yesterday, after a frenzy of buying which
has generated record trading volumes on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and
pushed the SET index up 29 per cent since troops killed at least 50
pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of the capital in May.
Stockbrokers had been anticipating a mild correction this week, and
yesterday the index closed 5.33 down at 863.42 in turnover of Bt18.56bn
(Dollars 734m), following Monday's sharp rise in share prices in turnover of
Bt22.64bn, the highest in the history of the exchange.
Both foreign and local investors have been heartened by this month's
election results and the formation of a coalition government under Mr Chuan
Leekpai, the leader of the Democrat Party.
The coalition is fragile, but the killings in May so discredited the armed
forces and the political parties supporting them that Mr Chuan and his
allies were able to win the election and leave Thailand's recalcitrant
generals and corrupt politicians on the sidelines - for the time being at
least.
Even before the events of May, the Thai market was unsettled by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the Thai military coup of February 1991.
Mr Graham Catterwell of Crosby Research said yesterday: 'We have had two
years of instability and uncertainty. People have been itching, and waiting
for the skies to clear; the skies have cleared, so they are off.'
Foreign institutions, which had been underweight in the Thai market, have
been heavy buyers of Thai stocks in the past fortnight, although some have
begun to take profits from the bull run, while Thai speculators have piled
into their favourite counters in the finance and securities sector. Local
finance companies represent a leveraged bet on the market because higher
volume increases their profits.
The SET is growing week by week - a new unit trust and a leather company
made their debut yesterday - and the exchange's computer system, so far, has
handled the surge in volume without any significant problems.
Trading is scheduled to be paper-free by the end of the year, a move which
could make life difficult for foreign investors who sometimes hold shares
designated for locals by using nominees, instead of paying premiums for the
shares allocated to foreigners.
In theory, the ultimate beneficial owner should be disclosed in the
scripless trading system, but brokers have been assured that a way around
the problem will be found to satisfy foreign demand for Thai shares.
A new Securities and Exchange Commission is attempting to improve regulation
of the market, and the addition of a SET afternoon trading session, greeted
with a marked lack of enthusiasm when it was introduced in July, has proved
a success.
Forthcoming third-quarter results, particularly those of the increasingly
busy finance companies, could extend the market rally, but some brokers are
predicting a fall before the end of the year.
Mr Scott Klimo, director of Thai research for Smith New Court, commented:
'This rally around election time was really fully anticipated. There are a
lot of factors that are going to come together to push the market back down
before the year is out.'
Such problems include an abundant supply of office space which is likely to
hit overvalued property shares, the probability of disagreements within Mr
Chuan's coalition, and the possibility that Thailand's economic growth will
be lower than the officially predicted 7.6 per cent.
Opinions are divided on the extent to which transport and communications
bottlenecks within Thailand, and the economic woes of the country's main
export markets in America, Europe and Japan, will restrict Thai economic
growth.
Most brokers agree, however, that the shares of Thai companies in growing
service industries such as insurance and banking, and in
infrastructure-related businesses, remain good buys, and that Thailand is
still looking at least as attractive as the other markets in the region as a
prospect for 1993 and beyond.

FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rumours abound as German M3
grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL realities have intervened since the last time the German M3 money
supply figures came out, and a rise from 8.5 to 9 per cent in the August M3
growth rate - conventionally a bad indicator for interest rate prospects -
had less of an impact on bourses than might have been expected, writes Our
Markets Staff.
In Frankfurt, even after coming off the top, bund futures were actually
running 40 basis points higher in mid afternoon, at 90.74 for the December
contract, than they did in the morning.
This reflected rumours, subsequently denied, that the ERM might be suspended
but there was parallel, and more sustained talk of a Bundesbank rate cut. Mr
Werner Wanke, a partner of B Metzler in Frankfurt and a known proponent of a
German interest rate cut of two or three percentage points, said that the
cut would have to come this month to avoid severe consequences for other
members of the EMS.
PARIS was assailed in late trading by rumours of impending cuts in French
and German interest rates accompanied by a realignment of the ERM. The
improvement in sentiment was largely driven by strong futures and bond
markets where the speculation, officially denied, was for between a 0.5-1
percentage point cut in the key intervention rate. The CAC-40 index closed
6.75 higher at 1,832.81, off an intraday high of 1,849.19. Turnover was
FFr2.7bn.
Credit Lyonnais startled the market by reporting a massive drop in first
half net. The state-controlled bank also warned that debt provisions would
have to remain high for the remaining six months of the year, and its
certificates closed down FFr42 at FFr510. This affected Thomson-CSF, which
has a 15.5 per cent stake in the bank, and it closed FFr12.00 or 8 per cent
lower at FFr135.90.
Michelin fell FFr4.70 to FFr199.80 on first half figures which disappointed
some analysts and led to a number of downgrades.
FRANKFURT incorporated post-bourse losses from Monday and the DAX index
showed a fall of 23.52, or 1.5 per cent on the day at 1,550.34.
Volume crept up from DM4.6bn to DM5.2bn. 'We have a currency market, not an
equity market', said one dealer, reckoning that foreign investors who came
into German equities as a bet on the D-Mark took their profits yesterday.
The least liquid of the big carmakers, BMW, fell DM11.50 to DM525.50.
Meanwhile the big three chemicals, convenient avenues for international
investment, saw unusually big declines with BASF DM5.50 lower at DM209.50,
Bayer down DM8.20 to DM268.30 and Hoechst by DM6.50 to DM246.20.
MILAN also took in Monday's late losses as the Comit index dropped 10.69, or
2.8 per cent to 369.59. Lira weakness contributed, but dealers said that
there were also fears that a stiff budget containing L93,000bn of spending
cuts could end up being modified substantially or could exacerbate political
tensions.
ZURICH rose on lower interest rates, the SMI index closing 11.6 higher at
1,900.4 with banks topping the active list. UBS bearers added SFr7 to
SFr776, CS Holding put on SFr20 to SFr1,910 and SBC were SFr5 firmer at
SFr273.
Banks were also lifted by hopes that Swiss voters, in a referendum next
Sunday, would approve a revision of the Swiss securities stamp tax. The
change is designed to improve Swiss banks' international competitiveness.
AMSTERDAM remained relatively calm. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to
112.5. Elsevier continued its recovery, gaining Fl 3 to Fl 108 while DAF was
20 cents lower at Fl 17.390 as the market seemed uninterested in news that
it had held cooperation talks with a Japanese truck manufacturer.
MADRID failed to find a refuge from the battering it has ben subjected to in
the past week and the general index recorded another fall, down 3.22 to
207.56. Turnover remained strong at some Pta15bn. Utilities remained under
pressure with Union Fenosa down Pta28 at Pta437.
BRUSSELS saw strong activity in Delhaize which saw its shares shed 5.6 per
cent as its US division Food Lion fell to a year's low in New York. The
Bel-20 index fell 9.38 to 1,114.50 in turnover of BFr855m.
Delhaize closed down BFr90 at BFr1,600 in volume of 205,500 shares. Food
Lion reported poor third quarter results recently.
STOCKHOLM heard SE-Banken say that it had outstanding loans of SKr1bn to the
Gota group, which suspended payments to creditors last week. SE-Banken A
fell SKr1 to SKr11.50. Handelsbanken A touched a new year's low of SKr21.50
before recovering slightly to close SKr1.50 lower at SKr22.50. All in all,
the bank sector dropped more than 6 per cent as the Affarsvarlden index fell
9.1 to 736.0.
OSLO fell 2.3 per cent in spite of firmer North Sea oil prices and a cut in
domestic interest rates. The composite index ended 7.81 lower at 325.61 in
turnover of NKr222m. The industry index, which includes stocks linked to
North Sea oil, fell 12.74 to 577.42, Norsk Hydro losing NKr4.50 to
NKr141.00.
VIENNA eased two per cent as the market was depressed by German M3 data. The
ATX index was down 17.39 at 822.44.

FT  23 SEP 92 / People: Wading in to competition on ferry routes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of moves in the UK ferry industry will see Sea Containers' David
Benson, 48, promoted to the newly-created post of vice-president - Channel
and Solent ferry services in the run-up to the opening of the Channel
tunnel.
Benson (right), presently MD of Wightlink, Sea Containers' Isle of Wight
ferry operation, is a man worth watching. It was he who drew up Sea
Containers' headline-grabbing plans to bid for the franchise to run many of
British Rail's Network SouthEast commuter operations once the legislation
for rail privatisation has gone through.
Benson's previous incarnations include a 13-year stint at British Airways
and three years looking after the non-music activities of Richard Branson's
Virgin group. James Sherwood, Sea Containers' president, says he wants him
in this new post to strengthen management in the face of increasing
competition on the short sea routes to France.
Mike Aiken, the man who brought SeaCat to the Channel as vice president,
ferries and ports, remains in overall charge of Sea Containers' ferries
business. But Sherwood says the new appointment will free Aiken to spend
more time developing new SeaCat routes elsewhere in Europe and the rest of
the world.
Meanwhile, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has announced a successor to
Norman Corlett, the non-executive chairman who led the fight against the
recent hostile bid from Sea Containers. He is Juan Kelly (left), 61, who
recently retired as managing director of Shell International Marine.
A former president of the General Council of British Shipping and one of the
most distinguished figures in UK shipping, Kelly is joined by two other new
appointees: Brett Martin, who steps up from finance manager to finance
director, and Hamish Ross, md of Sea Containers Ferries Scotland, who joins
James Sherwood and Mike Aiken as non-executives by virtue of Sea Containers'
41 per cent shareholding in the company.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (11): A little less moonlight
 -Martin Dickson finds a state full of modern tourist attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE can be few better ways to appreciate the importance of tourism to the
Georgian economy than to enter the lobby of Atlanta's Marriott Marquis hotel
early one morning and gaze upward into its enormous atrium.
The floors recede upward into the ether in a series of serried, circular
balconies, their 1,674 rooms ready to disgorge the day's supply of
conventioneers (readily identified by their badges), business people and
holiday-makers.
Glass lifts, ribbed with lights, race up and down, giving a carnival touch
to the otherwise coldly impersonal feel of the building. Ranks of porters
stand by the checkin desk, ready to jump when needed
Tourism has been big business in Atlanta since the 1960s, when the city made
an effort to attract conventioneers by capitalising on its position as the
communications hub of the American South. The Atlanta Hyatt hotel - the
first, daring American exponent of the now-common atrium hotel design -
dates from then
Tourism is also an important money earner in the rest of the state. An
unusually wide range of attractions offer the holiday-maker the mountain
country of north Georgia, the beautiful ante-bellum towns of the piedmont,
the steamy romance of coastal Savannah and the state's fine beaches.
The 1996 Olympics will give a big impetus to the tourist industry, both
immediately - given the huge number of visitors the games will attract  -
and over the longer term, as television beams the state's attractions into
homes around the world, along with the athletic events.
One of the main reasons Atlanta was able to attract the Olympics is its
hotel capacity. This currently totals about 53,000 rooms, with another 9,000
or so expected by 1996. About 10,000 are in the city's downtown area, close
to Atlanta's main convention and sports centres, with another large complex
a few miles to the north of the city, in the very well-heeled suburb of
Buckhead.
But Georgia's tourism industry cannot afford complacency. The immediate
question is how fast the convention business is likely to grow over the next
few years, having been relatively flat while the US has been in recession.
Civic leaders express some concern over the appearance of some older parts
of downtown Atlanta - still a little scruffy, despite the recent building of
Underground Atlanta, an imaginative shopping complex, and the nearby
Coca-Cola Museum. These have helped restore some gloss to the older central
city.
That said, by the standards of most American cities central Atlanta is
relatively clean and well-maintained. But it is not a city for pedestrian
sight-seeing. As in most of the 'sunbelt' cities, the automobile rules - and
Atlanta lacks the dramatic character of New York or the obvious charm of San
Francisco, the cities which are its two big rivals in the convention
business.
Atlanta now ranks number three, but its Convention and Visitors Bureau says
the city hopes to overtake New York for the number two position.
New York may have been given a lift by this year's Democratic Party
Convention (as Atlanta was in 1988), but the bureau argues that New York's
high labour costs and hotel taxes are likely to drive business in the
direction of cheaper Atlanta.
Statistics certainly suggest continued expansion in Atlanta's convention
business: The number has grown from 1,200 in 1984, with delegate expenditure
of Dollars 449m, to 1,728 in 1990, with some Dollars 1.1bn of spending - and
the World Congress Centre, which is near downtown Atlanta and will form part
of the Olympic games complex, is booked for conventions and exhibitions to
beyond the year 2000.
The recent opening of the huge Georgia Dome, which stands nearby, gives the
city additional convention space, though this also doubles as the home of
Atlanta's football team, the Falcons, and as an entertainment centre. The
Olympic basketball and gymnastics events will be held here.
Atlanta dominates Georgia's tourism: 36 per cent of the Dollars 10.4bn spent
by visitors in 1991, according to a study for the state's Department of
Tourism. The northwest Georgia mountains region and the coastal region
centred on Savannah each contribute about 13 per cent. Atlanta's tourist
attractions are almost diametrically opposed to what you might expect in the
self-proclaimed capital of the south. There is little or nothing of the
moonlight, magnolia and southern ante-bellum romance associated with the
city in Margaret Mitchell's novel, Gone With The Wind.
There is, however, plenty of that elsewhere in Georgia - be it in Savannah,
with its old colonial squares and moss-covered trees, or in the graceful
ante-bellum towns of Athens, home of the University of Georgia, and in
Milledgeville, Georgia's former capital).
Atlanta's attractions are decidedly modern - a fact neatly symbolised in the
'Southern Heritage' section of a bookshop in Buckhead's big Lenox Square
shopping mall. Nestling next to Gone With The Wind is a copy of the Factory
Outlet Guide to the South - an up-to-the-minute analysis of bargain shopping
spots.
The city's new architecture is one of its appeals. A spate of building in
the 1980s has left a much more dramatic, post-modern skyline. The new IBM
tower in mid-town is particularly handsome, as is the nearby, widely praised
High Museum of Art, built on a smaller scale and in very different style.
The recently opened Coca-Cola museum (an uncritical monument to one of the
city's most celebrated companies) is largely devoted to exhibiting marketing
strategies down the generations. Children, surprisingly, may find it rather
boring - except for a final, magnificent room, where free Coke is dispensed
by glitzy machines which throw the liquid into an arc before it enters your
cup.
Nothing could be further removed from this commercialism than the Martin
Luther King centre, just east of downtown Atlanta. It honours the great
civil rights leader who was born in the city, and had his headquarters here
for much of the movement's existence.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (12): Sponsored fanfare has
begun - The 1996 centennial Olympic games offer an enormous marketing
opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGES of the Barcelona Olympics have barely begun to fade, but Atlanta is
already revving up for the 1996 games.
The official Olympic flag arrived in the port of Savannah on September 10,
and embarked on a glitzy train trip through seven more Georgian cities
before its final stop in Atlanta.
The aim of the trip was to raise interest in the games, but with the fanfare
so far, it would be hard to find a Georgian who is not aware - and proud -
that the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics will take place in his/her
home state.
In local minds, the award of the 1996 Olympics means Atlanta has arrived as
an international city. Ever striving to make its mark, it aims to stage the
biggest extravaganza of its history for the 1996 centennial games.
As a top US convention city, Atlanta has a proven capacity to handle large
crowds. It has over 53,000 hotel rooms in its metropolitan area, a number
which will climb to 62,000 rooms by 1996.
Mr Andrew Young, a former mayor of Atlanta and former US ambassador to the
United Nations, is co-chairman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games (ACOG: a private, non-profit corporation in charge of staging the
event). He says: 'There are conventions of 80,000 people in Atlanta and you
don't even notice.'
The city recently completed the construction of the Georgia Dome, a 70,500
seat stadium that will be the venue for the 1996 basketball and gymnastics
competitions. And it is planning to build a Dollars 207m Olympic Stadium
with a capacity to seat 85,000. The construction of these two venues in
downtown Atlanta, and the construction or improvement of facilities in
nearby Stone Mountain park, will mean that the most of the 32 Olympic events
will be concentrated within the city or at the park.
Equestrian and shooting events will be held at special facilities no more
than 33 miles away. Sailing events will be held in the Atlantic ocean off
the city of Savannah, and white water canoeing will take place in
Tennessee's Ocoee River.
Yet with all Atlanta's attractions as the capital of the New South, its old
fashioned southern hospitality and its fame as the cradle of the 1960s civil
rights movement, even some of the city's most enthusiastic promoters worry
that it will not measure up to Barcelona in terms of cultural history and
physically elegant gathering places.
Unlike the older northeastern US cities such as New York or Boston, Atlanta
is not a pedestrian setting. The summer's sweltering heat discourages much
walking. Its downtown area is mostly devoted to the indoor, non-recreational
activities of government and business, and the city boasts only one notable
crowd gathering spot, the Underground, a redeveloped 19th century remnant of
Atlanta before it was burned to the ground by General William T. Sherman
during the Civil War.
None the less, a pedestrian walkway connecting the main downtown Olympic
installations is planned. In total, the ACOG estimates that it will need to
spend approximately Dollars 1.4bn for construction and other operations - to
include a Dollars 100m host broadcasting facility. While the local
government officials are hoping to find Dollars 2.5bn for their wish list of
city improvements, the ACOG, which is not asking for any government funds,
says that it does not aim to redevelop the city.
Mr Young says he tells city leaders bluntly: 'Find a way to do what you need
to do with your own money.' ACOG estimates its revenues - including
television rights, corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and other marketing
income - at just over Dollars 1.5bn. The planned surplus of roughly Dollars
132m is to be donated for the support of amateur athletics.
The ACOG's plan for bringing in corporate sponsors seems a bit risky. It is
drastically cutting back the number of corporate sponsorships to 12, and
raising the price to the unprecedented level of Dollars 40m. Compare this
with the 1984 Los Angeles Games - the last time the Olympics were in the US
 -which had 35 sponsors at just Dollars 4m each.
But Mr Young and Mr AD Frazier, ACOG's chief operating officer, defend the
sponsorship strategy by saying that, unlike previous games, the marketing
possibilities of the Atlanta Games exceed those of the past.
'We are creating one of the most powerful marketing vehicles in history,'
claims Mr Young. The period during which sponsors will be able to use the
Atlanta logos and trademarks will be four years instead of the usual one to
two years, and the rights to the Atlanta games's symbols will be combined
for the first time with those of the US Olympic committee, making a double
package.
The exclusivity of being among the 12 sponsors - the ACOG calls them
'partners' - will provide greater exposure for companies. This has genuine
value: the Atlanta games will be held during US Eastern Standard time,
providing for the greatest amount of exposure for a North American audience,
according to Mr Frazier. (Some 80 per cent of the US population lives within
its Eastern and Central time zones.)
The ACOG also believes there will be greater interest in the 1996 games
because they mark the centennial of the modern Olympic movement. Already the
arguments have convinced three companies to hand over their Dollars 40m:
Nationsbank, Sara Lee and Home Depot. In addition, IBM has announced its
sponsorship, but it will contribute goods and services worth more than
Dollars 40m. Mr Frazier believes the Olympic 12 will all be lined up by
mid-1993.
All these marketing arguments will likewise be employed good reasons for
charging Dollars 500m for the US television rights.
NBC bought the Barcelona rights for Dollars 401m and, despite relatively
good ratings, still lost Dollars 50m on the operation. Nevertheless - even
with sporting events advertising in the doldrums - the sheer size of the
potential US audience may be too attractive to pass up. US broadcasters also
note that, unlike Olympic games held elsewhere in the world, North Americans
will be able to see the events live - an extra incentive to tune in.
For Atlanta - given that about 3bn people around the globe may expected to
see the games - it is a chance to get on the world map as never before.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: New levels of strain in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRAINS inside the European exchange rate mechanism heightened to new
levels yesterday as the stronger D-Mark pushed five ERM currencies close to
their floors against the German currency, writes James Blitz.
The Bank of France intervened heavily to support the franc when it was one
centime above its ERM floor, while the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish central
banks all came into the market to buy their currencies as they slipped
towards their respective floors against the D-Mark. The Dutch central bank
bought the Irish punt and the Danish krone for Dutch guilders, the second
strongest currency in the ERM grid.
In a rumour-ridden market, French and German financial officials were forced
to declare publicly that there would be no EMS realignment, but there were
strong rumours in the French market that a 3 per cent devaluation of the
French franc against the D-Mark was imminent.
The latest stage in the ERM crisis was triggered by a poor figure for M3
money supply in Germany, which rose to 9 per cent on an annualised basis,
from 8.5 per cent in July. The rise in the figure underlined that German
interest rates will not come down easily and that further intervention by
the Bundesbank to support ERM currencies, which has already run to DM60bn in
recent weeks, is unlikely.
The Bank of France's purchase of francs was not on the scale of the UK's
buying of sterling a week ago today, but there were widespread suggestions
that France has spent around half of its Dollars 31bn of foreign currency
reserves in recent days. In London trading the franc finished at FFr3.4260
to the D-Mark, against a previous FFr3.4150.
The weaker currencies in the system slumped even more sharply. The Spanish
peseta closed at Pta71.91 per D-Mark, compared to its ERM floor of Pta72.62.
The Irish punt was at DM2.6205, against a floor of DM2.6190. The Portuguese
escudo dropped to lows beyond Esc89 to the D-Mark, against a floor of
Esc92.33.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, said
yesterday's events made a near-term realignment very likely, with the D-Mark
revaluing against all currencies, and the French franc saving face by
appreciating against all the weaker ones. But the French central bank may
feel that if it surrenders its franc fort policy against the D-Mark, it may
take years to recover credibility. The alternative would be to raise
interest rates.
The chaos in Europe's monetary system had ripple effects across the globe
yesterday. The yen rallied strongly against the dollar, closing at Y121.15
from a previous Y123.70. Japanese investors were reported to be repatriating
their investments before the first half of Japan's fiscal year ends this
month.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Rates cut to 9%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling futures rallied sharply yesterday after the Bank of England
signalled a base rate cut to 9 per cent, with futures dealers pricing in
another percentage point reduction before the end of the year.
Rates in the sterling cash market also softened, with three-month money
ending at 9 1/8 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 9 1/2
per cent. Period rates traced a sharp, downward-sloping yield curve, with
one-year money finishing at 8 5/8 per cent on the offered side.
A cut in UK base rates had been expected after the UK's departure from the
ERM last week, and the cash market had priced in  1/2 percentage point
reduction on Monday night.
However, traders were divided over whether yesterday's cut would soon be
followed by more. Some paid heed to the comment from Mr Norman Lamont, the
UK chancellor, that being outside the ERM was 'not a free lunch', and that
there was still a battle against inflation to be fought. Others believed
that another cut could come before the Conservative party conference.
The rally in futures was partly driven by pressures on the French franc
inside the ERM for the fourth trading day. Some traders believe that if the
franc comes under further pressure, the Bundesbank may be forced to lower
rates at its council meeting on Thursday week. However, there was an
unsettling note from Germany, where the Bundesbank announced that M3 money
supply growth in August, its guiding light on interest policy, had risen
sharply to 9 per cent.
The December short sterling contract reflected these various trends, opening
at 91.57 but dropping to 91.45 on the back of the M3 figure. It later
rallied to close at 91.86 which, strictly speaking, assumes that 3-month
money by the year's end will be at 8.14 per cent.
The Bank announced that there would be an Pounds 800m shortage and that
discount houses wishing to use their borrowing facilities were invited to do
so at a 9 per cent interest rate.
The Bank bought Pounds 540m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and
Pounds 2m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, it lent
Pounds 270m at an interest rate of 9 per cent for seven days.

FT  23 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco fails to please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF figures from Tesco were below analysts' expectations and the
shares were held back by belief that the group will not fare as well as some
of its rivals in the second half of the year.
Many analysts downgraded the shares, in spite of an increased dividend, a 9
per cent rise in sales, and higher pre-tax profits. Most lowered full-year
forecasts by around 5 per cent to the Pounds 560m to Pounds 580m range.
Tesco's problem is its perceived comparison with Argyle and J. Sainsbury. Mr
Phillip Dorgan at Goldman Sachs said: 'In like-for-like sales, Tesco suffers
because its concentration of customers, in the C2 and DE bracket, has
suffered more from the recession. While the shares may look cheap at this
price, Argyll and Sainsbury do not look expensive.'
Nomura took a more positive view. Moving to a buy stance, analyst Mr Andy
Hughes said: 'If the economy begins to recover more quickly than forecast a
week ago, then Tesco will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the foods
sector. This is not a company that has lost its way overnight.' Tesco shares
eased a penny to 224p, Sainsbury climbed 19 to 456p and Argyll rose 9 to
335p.
Greycoat shock
Troubled property group Greycoat saw its share price more than halve at one
stage after announcing that it would not pay its promised final dividend.
The company cited its need 'to take a stringently prudent view with regard
to preserving the group's cash resources'. Analysts saw it as a sign that
the banks, whose credit lines are keeping the company alive, had taken a
firm line over the payments.
Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest commented: 'It is a sensible move
considering the company could not afford to pay a dividend in the first
place. But a lot of investors came into the company on assurances from the
board that the dividend would be paid. It will do nothing for the board's
credibility.' The shares, which opened at 21p, crumbled to 8p before
recovering to close at 14p, a fall of 7 on the day.
Queens Moat deal
Queens Moat Houses, which started the day at 39p, continued its volatile run
following an agency cross by James Capel at 32p. Dealers reported more of
the rumours about the financial state of the hotel group which first
surfaced last week, when they drove the shares down to 26p. At the beginning
of June, they stood at 90p.
Mr Mark Finnie at County NatWest said: 'There are a lot of nervous holders
of the stock; worries remain about both the level of debt and the direction
of the company.' Capel crossed 9m shares, taking the day's volume to 25m and
making the stock the second most heavily traded of the day. It finished at
33 1/2 p.
Tarmac up sharply
The housebuilding/contracting sector provided three out of the market's top
four performers, in Tarmac, Wilson (Connolly) and Taylor Woodrow, which
jumped 11.4 per cent, 10.9 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively after the
percentage point reduction in UK interest rates. Dealers said the cut,
although expected by the market, had 'introduced a note of optimism in a
housebuilding sector that has been totally bombed out for more than 18
months'.
The sector was already up and running from the outset as news filtered into
the market that Tarmac, one of the UK's biggest volume housebuilders, had
maintained its interim dividend - against most expectations that it would be
sharply reduced - and further cut back capacity in its housebuilding and
quarrying businesses. Two weeks ago Tarmac announced a heavy rationalisation
of its brickmaking unit.
Tarmac strengthened 8 to 78p on the news, amid frantic trading activity
which saw more than 27m shares change hands, the most heavily traded stock
of the day.
An agency cross at 263p a share proved the trigger for a substantial rise in
Wilson Bowden, which eventually settled a net 10 higher at 286p. Wilson
(Connolly) ended 13 up at 132p and Taylor Woodrow was 6 ahead at 65p.
Brewer Whitbread completed its 'beer orders' - the government instructions
to reduce its holdings in particular drinks groups - selling Pounds 45m
worth of investments and reinvest-ing Pounds 30m in other regional brewers.
The Whitbread Investment Company (WIC) reduced its holdings in Boddington,
steady at 174p on turnover of 15m, JA Devenish, a penny up at 240p, and
Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, off 3 at 210p. Beneficiaries of the WIC buying
spree included Vaux, 2 firmer at 165p, Whitbread 'A', 12 ahead at 436p, and
Allied- Lyons, up 12 at 636p.
The cut in UK interest rates triggered a surge in the clearing banks, where
National Westminster advanced 15 to 349p on 11m shares dealt and Lloyds 15
to 450p on 2.8m. HSBC climbed 13 to 409p.
The merchant banking and fund management areas attracted further
persistently strong support as equity markets continued to climb.
SG Warburg, whose shares have outperformed the rest of the merchant banks
and the wider equity market in recent weeks, shot up 14 to 511p amid vague
suggestions that the UK's leading merchant banking and fund management group
may well be on the receiving end of a merger proposal from one of the top US
investment banks.
Kleinwort Benson, whose securities business is thought to have performed
creditably during the recent turmoil in the markets, rose 14 to 284p.
Hambros gained 6 at 244p and Schroders 13 at 1228p.
Insurers shared in the general euphoria surrounding the UK equity market.
Sun Alliance moved ahead 7 to 287p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 9.7m
shares and Royal advanced 12 to 160p, both sustained by hopes that the
reduction in interest rates would minimise domestic mortgage indemnity
losses.
Preliminary profits in excess of the most optimistic forecasts and a higher
than expected dividend prompted good buying interest in Lloyd Thompson, the
insurance broker, which appreciated 15 to 222p.
A series of hefty individual trades towards the close left Willis Corroon 7
better at 192p.
Shares in the chemicals sector were among the best performers of the day as
investors took stock of the favourable currency movements towards the
export-led industry.
Hoare Govett yesterday moved from a neutral to an overweight stance on the
sector. Among the main movers, BOC surged 24 to 708p, Courtaulds 27 to 517p,
ICI 32 to 1187p and Laporte 25 to 556p.

FT  23 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities warm to interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE-POINT reduction to 9 per cent in the Bank of England's minimum
lending rate, followed by promises of mortgage rate cuts from one of the
largest UK house lenders, was welcome news in the stock market yesterday.
The response from equities was cautious at first, but sterling's relatively
favourable performance encouraged hopes that further base rate cuts could
follow soon. The FT-SE Index closed 25.9 up at 2,586.
The stock market displayed nervousness regarding both the signs of political
strains on the UK Conservative government ahead of tomorrow's debate in the
House of Commons, and also a rash of rumours of further impending
developments in ERM member currencies.
Share prices opened lower and the FT-SE Index was nearly 15 points off in
the first half-hour of electronic trading. But the Bank of England, in
contradiction to the previous day, made early signals in the London money
markets of its intention to cut rates.
When the news came, equities hung fire, advanced, and then slipped back as
dealers watched sterling's progress. At mid-morning, the currency watch
intensified following disclosure that the UK monthly trade deficit had
widened to Pounds 1.19bn in August, somewhat larger than had been expected
in the City of London.
However, while the burgeoning trade deficit was seen as a grim reminder of
Britain's economic problems, it was not seen as any immediate threat to the
chances of further cuts in base rates in the near future.
Encouraged by a batch of corporate deals in the brewery sector, and
suggestions that a bigger deal will unfold today, shares moved forward
strongly, the Footsie registering at best a gain of 38.3, with the 2,600
level less than a couple of points away.
The advance ran out of steam when New York opened and quickly dipped to show
a fall of 26 Dow points in London hours, in spite of news of a 10.4 per cent
increase in August housing starts, the largest rise for 19 months.
Seaq volume remained high, at 987.8m shares against 953.4m on Monday, when
retail, or customer, business worth Pounds 1.8bn continued to bear witness
to the weight of institutional investment in equities since Britain's move
from the ERM, which had been seen as opening the way for interest rate cuts.
Fund managers were yesterday turning their attention away from the
dollar-earners which starred in the equity market last week. Many of the big
names, including Glaxo and RTZ, gave ground and early gains in other
internationals were trimmed after Wall Street opened.
Investors were buying more strongly into the domestic, interest
rate-orientated issues, such as Sears, Kingfisher and GUS. Often the buying
took the form of block deals as shares found ready purchasers across the
full range.
Although substantial funds have already flowed out of government bonds and
into equities, further switches in strategies are expected following
meetings this week at leading securities firms.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets sensed early that the Bank of England would cut UK
lending rates yesterday and institutions continued to buy the stock index
futures, writes Terry Byland.
The December FT-SE contract closed about 10 points above the fair value
premium to the cash index, which allows for dividend flows and financing
costs and was re-estimated at about 42 after yesterday's rate cut. Business
in the December future declined to 11,862 contracts.
In later dealings, the contract extended its gain as sterling rallied
strongly against the D-Mark to the accompaniment of suggestions that some
form of ERM realignment was hatching in the currency arena.
Locals, or independent traders, played a less dominating role as the running
was taken up by institutions evidently seeking to position themselves ahead
of the gains expected in the underlying stocks. Nicholas Knight of Nomura
Research now expects the Footsie to reach 3,500 by December.
In traded options, business slipped to 43,383 from Monday's 44,058. The
FT-SE contract traded 13,604 against 19,998. The list of active contracts
was led by the Euro FT-SE with 3,058 deals.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's war on oil industry
corruption - Attempts to stem the losses resulting from abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russian authorities have declared war on corruption in the oil industry, the
country's key earner of hard currency - but their struggle is made both
easier and more difficult by parallel attempts to introduce a market
economy.
Abuses, some new, some longstanding, range from fiddles by refinery and
railway officials to state-owned producers' use of foreign partners to get
money out of the country instead of handing it over to the government.
Capital flight is estimated at more than Dollars 2bn a year, while bribes
paid to lower level Russian officials for facilitating irregular exports of
oil and oil products exceeded Dollars 100m in the first half of this year.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's anti-corruption commission,
says 500,000 tonnes (3.5m barrels) 'disappeared' in the second quarter of
this year.
The losses are seen as particularly alarming against a background of
plunging output (down to 398m tonnes this year from 460m last year) and
declining export revenues, a result of years of half-baked economic reforms
and neglect by recent governments.
More importantly, the present government needs to protect itself from
accusations that market reforms begun in January have unleashed chaos and
must be slowed down.
'The danger is that instead of moving forward and trying to pick up speed
for change, you say let's wait and try to impose order on a non-functioning
system,' explains one official. 'It takes hundreds of steps to create a new
system. You can't do it overnight.'
The corruption is not new: it was no accident that one of the new
government's first steps last winter was to re-register all export licences
 -corruption was so rife civil servants had issued licences for exports
worth double the country's annual output.
But the replacement of Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the radical oil minister, by a
more old-style manager, and delays in freeing the oil price show the
temptation to hesitate in the no man's land between the
administrative-command system and a market economy which does not yet exist.
'There is no market environment although there are market aspirations. The
vacuum is filled by malpractices, corruption, and disillusionment,' says
Prof Yevgeny Khartukov, head of the Moscow-based World Energy Analysis &amp;
Forecasting Group.' He says that this is compounded by sheer ignorance among
managers of how to behave any differently.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new deputy prime minister responsible for energy
policy, who professes puzzlement 'about what is meant by corruption', says
that 'in the past everything was so centralised that producers did not get
involved in this'. But in reality, the corruption has become decentralised.
Where a once monopolistic Soviet oil ministry used to get kickbacks for
awarding contracts to one firm or another, now individual directors and
local officials, who have the right to sell a fixed percentage of oil
output, are playing by their own rules.
'Before the corruption was more systemic because of the degree of fear and
supervision which used to control individuals. Now that the lid has been
taken off, people are behaving in different ways,' says Mr Jules Kroll, the
head of a western consultancy which has helped track down money stolen by
Third World dictators.
The struggle against corruption has so far yielded slim results. There have
been a few arrests at oil refineries, and investigations of oil producers
who sell oil cheaply to commercial businesses for kickbacks deposited in
foreign bank accounts. Russian commercial companies also pay bribes to
regional authorities and oil companies to sell their export quotas for them.
In its work for the Russian authorities, Kroll Associates has found 'dozens
and dozens of foreign bank accounts . . . where the recipients or their
relatives are being rewarded for the allocation of raw materials at
favourable prices or arrangements'.
These include accounts in Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Monaco,
France, Britain and the US. The amounts vary from Dollars 50,000 to others
'where we see activity in excess of Dollars 1m at any point in time . . .
these amounts are not static'.
Although Mr Kroll declines to name specific firms or banks which hosted the
funds, Mr Gurtovoi says that even a top institution like Deutsche Bank has
found itself the unwitting home to ill-gotten gains. He also says that a lot
of money was stashed away in bank accounts in Houston, a city familiar to
many Russian oilmen.
The joint ventures set up as the main form of foreign investment since
President Mikhail Gorbachev came to power are also being systematically
investigated and their right to export oil freely has been suspended: they
now have to use state-owned intermediaries. Although none have been
prosecuted - partly because the government is anxious not to frighten off
potentially bigger foreign investment for the future - authorities have
evidence that some are guilty of dishonest practices.
One example of abuse in collusion with the joint venture's Russian partner
is deliberately underestimating an oil well's output so that a joint venture
can take out more oil as a reward for increasing output.
But until Russia can develop an adequate legal framework and some political
stability, it will find it difficult to avoid foreign firms cutting corners
as a reward for their risk in coming in the first place.
And until the oil manager has the right incentives not to divert resources
away from the state or his enterprise, he will go on doing so. As one
official explains, a Russian oil manager 'earns as much as the stipend of a
student in the West while his western counterparts make millions of
dollars'.
'He thinks of what he will leave his children. His enterprise may produce
more oil than say Mobil or use equipment as sophisticated as theirs. But
nobody has ever heard of his enterprise outside the Soviet Union and he
won't get bank loans unless he attracts a foreign partner.'
The collapse of the Soviet Union in December has also played a big role in
the present crime wave. While the old system limped on in a system of closed
borders, it has turned out to be a catastrophe in present conditions.
This is because once oil is smuggled across what Mr Chernomyrdin called
Russia's 'permeable borders' to outlying republics like Ukraine and the
Baltics, there are no KGB border guards to stop it going further afield.
Mr Ivan Sardak, deputy chief of the Interior Ministry's economic crimes
department, wants Russian criminal legislation banning the unlicensed export
of oil outside Russia.
The only way he can prosecute cases of unlicensed exports at present is to
prove that bribes were paid to ease the transaction - 'but this is very
difficult because you need to have documents showing that bribes were paid.'
While a simple solution would be to seal off Russia's borders and charge
world prices to other republics, this has proven politically and
economically difficult because of the highly integrated nature of the former
Soviet economy.
Another problem remains a lack of co-ordination among various Russian
authorities and their foreign colleagues in fighting the corruption.
In the end, however, any struggle of this kind in a country where most
people are on some kind of fiddle will fail unless it is accompanied by root
and branch reform.

NALIN Industries, one of the biggest refiners of crude palm oil in Malaysia,
has been placed in receivership. Nalin, whose majority shareholder is the
Indian Birla merchant family, has been hit by tighter operating margins as
Malaysia's crude palm oil refining capacity has rapidly expanded in recent

Malaysia's refineries now have a processing capacity of more than 10m tonnes
a year, though supply is only 6m tonnes. Nalin's total debt is estimated at

FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia's commodity exports
to rise by 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CANBERRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of Australia's commodity exports is forecast to rise to ADollars
47.3bn (USDollars 34bn) in 1992-93, 8 per cent higher than the previous
year.
The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics, based the forecast on the lower value of the Australian
dollar, which it put at an average 72 US cents in 1992-93.
Top exports in 1992-93 are forecast to be coal (ADollars 7.1bn), gold
(ADollars 4.2bn), wool (ADollars 3.6bn) and iron ore (ADollars 2.9bn). Mr
Paul O'Mara, Abare's manager for economic policy analysis, said prices of
Australian wool and beef would rise during the year. Wheat, coarse grains
and sugar prices would fall because of forecast higher world grain and sugar
production.
Mr O'Mara said the net value of farm production during the year was expected
to be ADollars 1.5bn, up 3 per cent from the previous year but still well
below the average of around ADollars 4bn in the late 1980s.
Australia's gold output will stay high at over 238 tonnes in calendar 1992
and decline only slightly to 234 tonnes in 1993, according to Abare.
'These relatively high production levels reflect the effectiveness of the
Australian industry in addressing the joint problems of cost pressures and
low spot prices,' Abare said.
The bureau expects world gold prices to average USDollars 350 a troy ounce
in 1992, a decline of 3.3 per cent from 1991.

Applications to trade futures contracts on jet fuel and world cotton were
approved yesterday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US
futures industry regulator.
The jet fuel contract will be traded at the New York Commodity Exchange
(COMEX), which plans to launch the product in early 1993. The contract will
be for physical delivery of 1,000 barrels of fungible aviation kerosene,
Colonial Grade 51 to the US Gulf coast.
Until now, only the New York Mercantile Exchange had offered US energy
futures. Nymex is the biggest marketplace for such products. Comex boasts
the world's largest market in gold and silver futures.
The world cotton contract will begin trading October 1 at the New York
Cotton Exchange. The exchange's existing contract covers just American
cotton.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farm deal clears hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The modest relief package for small French farmers the European Commission
unveiled 36 hours before Sunday's referendum in France on the Maastricht
treaty cleared a large hurdle yesterday, as EC farm ministers passed it on
to the special agriculture committee of the 12.
Hard-pressed small dairy farmers in central France, who also keep 'suckler'
cows for beef production, should as a result get additional premium payments
worth about sterling 100m.
The move follows a Commission pledge to review anomalies unresolved when the
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was agreed in May. But it followed
a pre-referendum plea to the Commission from French agriculture minister
Louis Mermaz to soften the impact on France of six measures in the reform,
and was timed to soften farmers' hostility to the treaty.
The Commission is looking at one further concession to France's demands, for
producers of durum wheat, which is used for making pasta. CAP reform
abolished the 25 per cent premium over ordinary wheat payed to these
farmers, except in designated 'sensitive areas'. Two further areas in
southern France are expected to be added to this list.
The Commission view, shared so far by the farm ministers, is that these
measures do not cut across the reform, and should not slow down its
implementation. After yesterday's meeting, Mr John Gummer, agriculture
minister of the UK which currently holds the EC presidency, underlined that
'there is no going back on CAP reform.'

RUSSIAN oil prices could be fully floated by the end of 1993, according to
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Asked when oil prices would be freed to world levels, he told the
Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'This won't happen in the nearest future.
Perhaps by the end of 1993 . . . and it will be a gradual raising of prices
in stages under the control of the state.'
President Boris Yeltsin last week more than doubled the price of crude oil
to 4,000 roubles (Dollars 20) a tonne in a bid to revitalise the country's
crisis-ridden energy sector.
Debts between enterprises have soared since January as prices have been
raised. The fuel and energy complex was owed 525bn roubles while it owes
others 386bn roubles, Mr Chernomyrdin said. More than 20,000 perfectly good
wells were idle, resulting in a loss of 280m barrels of oil a year.

GOLD rallied late on the London bullion market as rumours swept the currency
markets of a possible ERM suspension or realignment. Dealers said Australian
producer selling had emerged around Dollars 350 a troy ounce as the weakness
of the local currency was making sales an attractive proposition. A clutch
of LME warehouse stock increases helped to send base metal prices lower from
the outset. Three-month COPPER was unable to regain the Dollars 2,420 a
tonne support level, and by the close a test of Dollars 2,400 was on the
cards. London COCOA closed down from from an earlier one-month high, which
had been prompted by chart-based buying. Dealers said there was definite -
although not significant - origin selling on forward positions. Analysts
Landell Mills Commodities estimated a 188,000 tonne deficit for 1992-93,
sharply above last week's Gill &amp; Duffus forecast of 25,000 tonnes. Robusta
COFFEE closed down but above support levels after profit taking following a
technically driven five-month high of Dollars 826 a tonne for the November
contract. 'It looks as though its gone far enough at the moment unless we
get some constructive news from the ICO,' one dealer said.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gloomy outlook for world sugar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLOOMY outlook for world sugar prices emerged yesterday from two London
commentators.
ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, expects world sugar production in
1992-93 to hit record levels for the second consecutive year. Its first
estimate for next season puts production at 116.95m tonnes, up 1.2m tonnes
on 1991-92. Allowing for optimistic consumption figures, Man predicts a
surplus of 3.44m tonnes next season, compared with a revised estimate of
4.77m tonnes this season.
However, Man points out that this season has seen tight availability of raw
sugar for export in spite of the large overall surplus. Next season, it
expects the international trade surplus to be more evenly balanced between
raw and white sugar. 'With a potential trade surplus of some 2.7m tonnes,
lower prices are expected.'
GNI, the London futures broker, yesterday suggested that nearby New York raw
sugar prices could fall as low as 6 cents a lb. It cited bearish news of
higher Thai exports; of large amounts of Argentinian sugar on offer which
could provoke Brazil to defend its market share; and rumours of a price war
between India and China. In late trading yesterday the New York March
contract was 8.69 cents a lb.

This would make the mine one of the largest in Australia and enhances the

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (6): Clinton is in with a
chance - State's moderate voters can make or break a presidential bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR more than three decades, the only Democratic presidential candidate that
has won the backing of Georgia's voters was its native son, Mr Jimmy Carter.
But this year Georgia is up for grabs.
It is considered a crucial swing state for both candidates because its
moderate-to-conservative Democratic voters are the kind that can make or
break a presidential bid. And despite its inclinations toward Republican
presidents in the past, many political observers believe that Mr Bill
Clinton, who is leading in the polls, has a chance to win it this year .
An all-Southern Democratic ticket and an economy still in the doldrums help.
'Clinton goes into this with the solid support, perhaps 80-90 per cent, of
the black vote,' says Mr Charles Bulloch, professor of political science at
the University of Georgia. 'If Clinton gets 40 per cent of the white vote,
he can carry the state.'
Some 77 per cent of Georgia's registered voters are white, and voter turnout
has generally run about equal for blacks and whites. Complicating matters
for the Republicans, Mr Ross Perot is on the ballot in Georgia. Although the
effect of his presence is not clear, white conservative Democratic support
for Mr George Bush could be diluted.
Mr Clinton is also benefiting from the enthusiastic support of Georgia's
Democratic governor, Mr Zell Miller. Governor Miller gave a keynote address
for Mr Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, and since then has
campaigned energetically in Georgia and, on occasion, stood in for Mr
Clinton at campaign events in other southern states.
As elsewhere, the faltering economy appears to be working against Mr Bush. A
recent Atlanta Constitution opinion survey indicated that the economy was
considered the most important issue and that 70 per cent of those polled
disapproved of the way Mr Bush was handling it.
This economic discontent could help bring a shift in some state contests,
too. Republicans, always a small minority in the Gerogia state assembly and
senate, are not expected to increase their presence greatly, and a number of
more liberal Democrats may be elected - thanks in part to redistricting.
Yet, like many states where one large city dominates, the traditional split
in Georgia has been the more rural state in opposition to Atlanta. In recent
years, the division has also taken on a racial aspect as more black
legislators have been elected from Atlanta. Blacks dominate the political
leadership of the city and this contributes to the feeling, according to Mr
Bulloch, that 'Atlanta is a different breed of cat from the rest of the
state'.
But leading legislators from rural areas, such as Mr Tom Murphy, the Speaker
of the House, realise that the economic health of the state depends on the
robustness of Atlanta. Finding money for the 1996 Olympics, however, is
likely to put this understanding to the test.
Atlanta has had a black mayor since Mr Maynard Jackson won election in 1973.
He served two four-year terms and was succeeded by Mr Andrew Young, the
former US congressman and ambassador to the United Nations, who also served
the limit of two consecutive terms. Mr Jackson was then re-elected in 1989.
But blacks' political ascendancy in Atlanta has not meant (with a few
exceptions) alienation of the city's white power structure. Rather, black
political leaders and white business leaders have forged an unusually strong
and workable alliance.
This has been the product in part of a tradition of white liberalism in
Atlanta dating back to the turn of the century and partly, more recently,
the pragmatic attitude of business towards a largely black labour market.
Other factors have been the presence of top black universities, the
existence of a strong black middle class and the fact that Atlanta was the
cradle of the civil rights movement, with its prominent leader Rev Martin
Luther King, an Atlanta native.
The city's remarkably amicable race relations are rooted in this alliance of
the black and white elites. According to Mr Young, for the past 30 years
leaders of the black community and the chief executives of Atlanta's most
important companies have been meeting privately once a month in a group
called Atlanta Action Forum. Mr Young says that racial problems still exist,
but 'we have a tradition of sitting down and working them out' .
Nonetheless, Mr Michael Lomax, the influential black chairman of the Fulton
County commission, says the dominant cultural divide remains between blacks
and whites. When affluent blacks can choose to live anywhere, they still
form black enclaves, he says. 'There's a kind of civility here that doesn't
admit a lot of acrimony. The problem with civility is that it hides
substantial problems.'
But Mr Lomax, like other top black politicians, has support from white
voters and white businessmen. And, in a city whose ethic is primarily
commercial, the goal - colour aside - is to get ahead. In Atlanta, he says,
'there is no idea that's so dear that it can't be compromised for a good
deal'.
More deals of all kinds may have to be cut as the city of Atlanta, with just
394,000 people, is becoming swamped by the more populous, wealthier and
conservative suburbs. Metropolitan Atlanta is now considered 18 counties
with about 3m people and many believe that the political challenge of the
futures is the welding together of a new unified regional government.
When that idea, now widely discussed, is put on the political agenda, it is
expected to ruffle the city's racial harmony. Blacks oppose it because,
while it could make economic sense, their political influence would be
diminished. However, some larger governing amalgation - short of the full 18
counties - may yet arise. Mr Lomax, who chairs the Atlanta Regional
Commission's committee now considering the region's future, says of the city
(which lies within his county): 'It's got the name and it has a symbolic
role, But in terms of defining the direction of the economic engine called
Atlanta, it does not.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (5): Middle towns in good
shape - In a difficult climate the second-tier cities are holding their own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a cursory first glance, Macon's boarded-up shopfronts and downtown
dilapidation, to say nothing of the decrepit warehouse at the end of the
town's main street, suggest little in the way of economic prosperity.
But peer more closely at Macon, about 85 miles south-west of Atlanta, and
the picture changes.
While the town has not matched the growth rates seen recently in Atlanta, it
has a well-diversified industrial and commercial base, better-than-average
unemployment rates, and - over the past couple of decades - has established
a good record for attracting new investment.
All this is typical of Georgia's 'second-tier' cities. Although each has
individual characteristics, towns such as Augusta, Macon, Savannah, Columbus
and Albany can look back on the 1980s with some satisfaction. According to
Mr Dean Albert Niemi, writing in the monthly Georgia Trend magazine, total
personal income in the five cities over the past decade grew by 101.8 per
cent, 92.2 per cent, 82.3 per cent, 78.8 per cent and 70.8 per cent
respectively.
That failed to meet the growth rates seen in Atlanta, with the result that
the state's largest city generated 52 per cent of Georgia's personal income
at the end of the decade, compared with 47.9 per cent at the beginning.
Nevertheless, against Atlanta's rapid expansion, the second-tier cities have
made an admirable effort to hold their own.
These towns also appear to be weathering the tougher climate of the 1990s in
reasonably good shape.
Macon demonstrates how the general diversity of 'middle' Georgia's economy
helps. On the minus side, the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center has a
strong influence on the area, and jobs - in line with the overall reduction
in US defence spending - have been declining here recently.
In 1991, when Warner Robins was reckoned to have a total economic impact on
middle Georgia of around Dollars 2.1bn (through salaries and the purchase of
goods and services), the base employed around 18,620 people. That compared
with 19,988 in the previous year and 20,631 in 1985. The decline was
concentrated in civilian employment; the military base employed around 2,000
people less in 1991, than it did four years earlier.
But other big employers in the area have offered stable, even expanding,
prospects. The largest in Macon itself is Brown &amp; Williamson, the tobacco
manufacturer which is owned by Britain's BAT Industries and employs around
29,500 people.
Other leading corporations range from a division of Weyerhaeuser, the West
Coast-based pulp and paper company, which makes stuffing for nappies, to
Geico, the large insurer which moved back office operations to Macon over a
decade ago, and Charter Medical, the hospital management company, which is
headquartered in the town.
Aerospace companies, such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, are another
feature of the area - a spin-off from the Robins base. Given the defence
spending cuts and retrenchment in the commercial airline market, this might
appear to be a bearish influence on the local economy.
But even here the picture is not one of unmitigated gloom. Locals point out
that corporate restructurings have sometimes benefited relatively low-cost
plants in Georgia, at the expense of facilities elsewhere in the nation.
For example, following internal bidding, some of the work being carried out
at McDonnell Douglas's Columbus, Ohio, plant - which the defence group
recently announced would close - is scheduled to be relocated to the Macon
region. One local businessman predicts that 1,000 jobs could be added over
the next year.
Clearly, however, new industry has been wooed and it has not always come
cheap. Officials at the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce recount the tale
of one New Jersey manufacturer, who was promising a mere 250 jobs but
produced a heady Dollars 7.5m incentive list as his price for relocating. In
spite of these formidable demands, officials say they still believe he will
move to the middle Georgia area - implying that at least some of the terms
have been met.
Of all the second-tier towns, Macon is perhaps most closely affected by the
expansion of Atlanta itself. Locals are ambivalent about the impact. Some
suggest that having the larger city's facilities within a 90-minute drive
attracts executives who want to operate in a cosier environment than Atlanta
can offer. Others argue that some businesses have found the Atlanta hubbub
more convenient and cold-shouldered Macon as a result.
Savannah, further south and on the coast, has a slightly different tale. It
shares, Macon's industrial diversity. Locals estimate that the town supplies
around 100,000 jobs and supports some 80,000 families. Yet the largest
manufacturing employer is Gulfstream Aerospace, the upmarket corporate jet
manufacturer, which provides around 3,275 jobs, followed by Union Camp
Corporation, the paper products company, with 3,200. Fort Howard Paper
Company is third with just 1,000.
Tourism, however, is a much bigger factor - partly because of the city's
geographical location and partly because of its historical roots. It is
reckoned that Savannah gets over 5m 'visitors' a year, of whom perhaps half
are tourists (as opposed to visiting relatives, for example). These tend to
fall into two categories: either older tourists attracted by the town's
history, or families driving south to Florida and Disneyland, in need of a
'stop-over' city.
Either way, the arrivals pump almost Dollars 600m into the local economy and
provide around 16,500 jobs. Here, recession has taken a toll: the downturn
in the economy has dented the industry nationwide and Savannah has endured
small declines in the number of visitors and the money they spend. But at
least the upmarket nature of these tourists has provided some insulation and
there are hopes that the 1994 Olympics will also publicise the town's name
and reputation. Savannah is to host the yachting events.
Perhaps the town's most important success story, however, has been the
growth of the Port of Savannah, which is under the control of the Georgia
Ports Authority. Garden City Terminal, about 7 miles west of the centre of
Savannah, now houses a six-berth container port, where business has been
growing recently. In the year to end-June, for example, the facilities saw a
13 per cent increase in containerised cargo to 3.85m tons. Some projections
suggest that this figure could total around 6.4m tons by 2000.
Already, growth has been encouraged by the construction of a Dollars 70m
bridge over the Savannah River offering an enlarged 185ft of vertical
clearance. A further improvement should come from the dredging of a 42-ft
channel up the river this year.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (4): Still the south's
staging-post - Nikki Tait finds the city's historic role as a hub little
changed since the mid-1800s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE ONE look at a map of the United States, and Atlanta's role as a
communications centre becomes obvious. The city stands at a staging-post
between Florida and the mid-west, and at the end of the Appalachian
Mountains' swing down the eastern seaboard.
This geographical advantage has given import to Atlanta ever since its
formal founding in 1837. During the Civil War the city became a main
distribution point for troops and supplies; after the south's defeat, it was
the federal headquarters for the 'Reconstruction' effort.
In 1866, shortly after the Civil War ended, four railroads - the Macon &amp;
Western, the Georgia Railroad, the Atlanta &amp; West Point, and the Western &amp;
Atlantic - converged at the town.
Over a century later, although different modes of transport dominate, the
picture remains remarkably similar.
Three important highways intersect in Atlanta, making the city a main
trucking and distribution centre. Interstate 75 runs north-south, from
northern Michigan to Miami; 1-20 runs west-east, from western Texas to South
Carolina; and 1-85, which runs parallel to the Appalachians, links Richmond,
Virginia with Montgomery, Alabama.
Today, however, Atlanta's most reknowned communications role is probably as
an air operations centre. In terms of aircraft landings and take-offs, its
main Hartsfield International Airport ranks fourth in the world (after
Chicago's O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles International Airport).
In terms of passengers handled, Hartsfield drops a couple of places in the
rankings; overtaken by Tokyo's Haneda airport and London's Heathrow. But in
1991, in spite of the US airline industry's problems, Atlanta handled 37.9m
passengers - only a shade below Heathrow's 40m.
And Hartsfield still claims to provide the world's largest passenger
terminal complex, capable of handling up to 75m passengers once its new
international concourse is built.
Such boasts notwithstanding, there is no question that a little of the sheen
has been rubbed off Hartsfield's gloss in recent years.
During the 1980s the picture was remorselessly upbeat. The new Hartsfield
terminal opened in 1981 and although it weathered its share of consumer
gripes - the robotic voices on the 'people-mover' and the unimaginative
concessions - traffic was generally on the rise and Hartsfield proved a
functional success. In 1990 it handled 48m passengers and 790,000 take-offs
and landings: an average of over 2,000 a day.
Part of this growth came from the expansion of Delta Air Lines, which has
its headquarters in Atlanta and uses Hartsfield as its foremost hub. Today,
Delta is generally regarded as one of the nation's three 'mega-carriers,'
but during the 1980s it was laying the foundations for this role.
It expanded in part by acquisition - including the purchase of the West
Coast-oriented Western Airlines - but also by the building and developing
facilities at its Atlanta base. Gleaming hangers, a new (as-yet-unopened)
reservations building, and a state-of-the-art cargo facility all stand as
testament to this policy.
Unfortunately, two events in the 1990s have had an adverse impact on the
airport's fortunes. The first is the general economic recession, which has
depressed the level of air traffic both on the business and the tourist
fronts.
This has meant problems for Delta, compounded by the carrier's decision to
purchase the transatlantic routes of Pan Am - an acquisition which has
proved hugely difficult to integrate.
The carrier recently announced 'downsizing' moves - including a 5 per cent
cut in its workforce - and has already reduced its previously-ambitious
capital spending plans for the rest of the decade.
The second was the demise, in early 1991, of Eastern Airlines, the only US
carrier besides Delta to use Atlanta as a hub. The grounding of Eastern
planes threw thousands of people out of work in the city. Today, almost two
years later, empty Eastern facilities still give a ghostly aura to parts of
the airport.
The combined result of these events was a sharp drop in traffic at
Hartsfield last year. The number of passengers using the airport fell by 21
per cent; take-offs/landings slumped by 25 per cent. This year has shown
little improvement: the increase in aircraft operations during the first
half of 1992 was less than 5 per cent, and the rise in the number of
passengers only about 3 per cent.
Eastern's failure also left the airport with a pressing practical problem:
33 spare gates on one of the four concourses. Interestingly, despite
Atlanta's attractive geographical position, no airline showed itself anxious
to snap these up, and concourse B became largely 'dark' as a result. Aside
from a handful of gates which were recently re-employed by Trans World
Airlines, these are still on the market.
The Atlanta Airport Commission admits that the chances of leasing these to a
single occupant are slim, but it remains optimistic that renewed future
expansion by carriers at Hartsfield will finally produce takers for the
gates on a piecemeal basis.
The slow take-up of the Eastern gates has caused critical fingers to be
pointed at Delta. Atlanta, say the critics, is 'Deltaland,' and other
carriers have veered away from the airport because of its entrenched
position.
Travellers, meanwhile, objected angrily when the surviving airline raised
prices in the wake of Eastern's demise (Eastern had been aggressively
cutting fares in its final months).
Delta has heard the arguments many times. It does not dispute its dominant
position at the airport: it currently accounts for about 80 per cent of all
passengers boarding at Atlanta, compared with less than 60 per cent in 1990.
The airline does, however, point out that much of this is traffic which is
simply 'hubbing' through the airport (that is, passengers coming in on one
flight and switching to another). Its share of passenger traffic which
originates in Atlanta is closer to 30 per cent - and it claims that the bulk
of these passengers have the choice of another airline.
The net result is to leave the airport commission still talking of growth in
the years ahead, but at much more modest rates. The building of the fifth
concourse, for international flights, is still on, scheduled to open in
1994.
At present the fifth runway project is still being assessed for its
environmental impact. And there is some consideration being given to a
'second airport' project, although one official describes this as being 'on
the back-burner'. In the meantime, the expansion of cargo facilities
continues apace, with a new perishables/equine centre coming on stream.
Finally, in the era of high-tech communications, Atlanta has become
something of a centre for telecommunications and associated industries.
BellSouth, the largest of the 'Baby Bells' resulting from the AT&amp;T break-up,
is based in Atlanta, while AT&amp;T also retains a significant presence in the
city.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (8): Carter's heavenly pennies
 -Barbara Harrison discovers a rich Atlanta - and a poor one, too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JIMMY CARTER, the former US president, has become known in the 12 years
since he left the Oval Office for doing good works. Many of the most notable
of these have been international. But now he is turning his considerable
energy and prestige to the city of Atlanta.
Almost a year ago, Mr Carter called for the creation of The Atlanta Project,
a non-profit, public and private initiative that aims to alleviate the pain
of poverty and its associated ills, including drugs, crime, juvenile
delinquency, violence, homelessness and despair.
While the Atlanta Project intends to confront American society's most
intractable problems, Mr Carter seems undaunted.
He believes that with some donated resources and considerable volunteer
effort, measurable progress toward resolving these problems can be made and
a sense of community can be restored. And while some have called the project
Quixotic, he has inspired many others to believe in it.
The Atlanta Project, which is expected to be launched formally on October 1,
Mr Carter's birthday, now has some 100,000 applications from volunteers and
over Dollars 11m in cash pledges from corporations and individuals.
According to Mr Dan Sweat, the co-ordinator of the project, a new
fund-raising drive next month is expected to raise the remainder of the
project's five-year cash needs of Dollars 18.5m.
Many more donations have been made through 'in kind' goods and services,
including those of Mr Sweat, president of the CF Foundation, and other
corporate executives who are on loan. Mr Sweat and others run the project
out of the Carter Center, which houses the former president's library and
various other international projects in which he is involved.
As a measure of the project's popular support, it expects to raise some
Dollars 100,000 through a campaign called 'Pennies from Heaven' using
canisters to collect the coins. The project's plan of attack is to undertake
specific projects for the worst problems in 20 of Atlanta's poorest
neighbourhoods.
In each of the 20 'clusters', as they are known, local neighbourhood
activists will direct volunteers and draw neighbourhood residents into the
project as participants.
Mr Sweat says Mr Carter's appeal for the project has struck a nerve. 'That
nerve has to do with the sense of hopelessness, frustration and despair
which has been building in the people of America for a number of years.'
He also says that, while it is possibly a less noble motive, many in the
business community are concerned about how Atlanta will look to the world
when it is in the spotlight of the Olympics in 1996. Indeed, it would be
impossible to try to hide the city's social problems during the Olympics,
particularly because some Olympic installations will be in some of the
poorest neighbourhoods. 'We are going to be judged in this city - not by how
well we stage the Olympic Games, but by what's being done for the poor,'
says Mr Sweat.
While Atlanta has gained fame in recent years as a top business relocation
choice and one of America's most liveable cities, it has a stunning amount
of poverty and crime threaded in between its glistening towers.
The city has a higher proportion of families with incomes below 50 per cent
of the average national poverty level than any other city in the US except
Newark, New Jersey.
Georgia ranks as the top state in the nation for infant mortality and 17 per
cent of the newborns at the downtown Grady Hospital are born to mothers who
use cocaine.
While nearly 12 per cent of the public housing units remain vacant, Atlanta
has between 12,000 and 15,000 homeless.
Atlanta is one of the highest crime rate cities in the US and in the past
five years juvenile drug cases have risen by 1,700 per cent in Fulton County
(where the city is located).
These are some of the reasons why Mr Carter talks about two Atlantas, a rich
one and a poor one. It is these two Atlantas which he wants to bring
together through his project. The former president, who volunteers a week of
his time every year to build houses for the poor with the Habitat for
Humanity organisation, says that if the social divide between rich and poor
Atlantans can be bridged, personal contact will melt fears and resentments
and build compassion, understanding and ties between neighbours.
His only fear of failure for the project, he says, is the failure to try.
Yet critics say that the project has raised expectations so high that it
cannot possibly fulfil them. If it works, however, Mr Carter hopes it will
become a model for other cities around the country.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (9): Affordable housing helps
/ Relocation Profile of UPS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Parcel Service (UPS), the world's largest parcel delivery company,
has had four homes in its 85-year history.
It began in Seattle as the American Messenger Service; moved to New York in
1930; shifted up the Long Island Sound in 1975 to the plush suburb of
Greenwich, Connecticut. Then, last year, it relocated to Atlanta.
The decision to move south has been attributed in large part to the
all-too-familiar failings of the New York area. UPS employees found that
housing in the Greenwich area had become hugely expensive and their
willingness to relocate from other offices to the company's headquarters was
dwindling. The time taken in making travel connections in New York City
itself - getting to either John F Kennedy or La Guardia airport, for example
 -was wasteful.
There was, moreover, an intensifying dichotomy between UPS's plain image,
and the sumptuous area in which the corporate headquarters was housed. UPS,
a private company owned largely by its employees, has nutured an egalitarian
culture. Executives travel coach class, for example, and everyone eats in
the same cafeteria. Greenwich, with its yacht-packed marina and manicured
lawns, is usually viewed as a home of Wall Street bankers and corporate
big-wigs.
UPS's search for a new headquarters was masterminded at the highest levels
within the company - and amid a good deal of secrecy, lest employees became
unsettled. It also called on the services of a specialist 'site-selection'
consultancy which, with top management, drew up a shortlist of three cities:
Dallas, Baltimore and Atlanta.
Today, UPS attributes the choice of Atlanta to a handful of different
factors. First, the Georgia city seemed to address many of the problems
which had occured in Greenwich. Housing, for instance, was still affordable
 -and in fairly good supply, In addition, the physical characteristics of
the region bore some resemblance to New England, suggesting that employees
would not feel hopelessly displaced.
Second, UPS was looking towards moving into a community where, although it
would be a big corporation, it would not be the dominant employer.
Third, the city scored fairly highly in terms of 'quality of life' issues.
And finally, like many other companies moving to Atlanta, UPS saw the city's
communications as an immense advantage.
UPS has been expanding heavily in Europe recently; it reckons that its
managers take 18,000 'flight segments' a year. The large and extremely
convenient network of flights available from Hartsfield International
Airport looked like an invaluable asset.
Once announced, the choice proved popular with employees. UPS says that
about 96 per cent of its managerial staff elected to move and 60 per cent of
its administrative employees. This worked out at about 700 people
altogether. Today, the delivery company employs about 1,150 people in the
Atlanta headquarters, compared with about 1,000 in Greenwich.
Not everything was perfect, however. UPS still does not have a single head
office building; it splits its operations between leased space in four
separate buildings. A new headquarters is scheduled to be constructed - if
all goes according to plan, this will open in 1995. Only then will UPS's
move south be complete.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (7): Style is
self-appreciation - Atlanta aims to be one of the top international business
centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING seems quite so essential to Atlanta as 'boosterism'. The Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce even claims to have conceived the first ever promotion
plan for a US city, back in 1929.
Almost every Atlantan boasts of the city's attractions, from its can-do
attitude and the low cost of doing business, to its warm southern
hospitality and mild climate. And Atlanta's ambitions are hardly humble.
'We want to be considered one of the top five international business
centres, alongside London, Paris, Tokyo and New York,' said Mr Jerry
Bartels, president of the Atlanta Chamber. 'That's our own self-image and
self-expectation.'
The city's unabashed self-appreciation is not without a grounding in
reality. It has scored the top rankings in business relocation surveys,
including Fortune magazine's 1991 survey, 'The Best Cities for Business',
and Ernst &amp; Young and the International Association of Corporate Real Estate
Executives' 'Reshaping America' study earlier this year.
That it is a magnet for corporate relocations is without doubt. It attracted
1,403 new companies between 1983 and last year, according to the Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce.
Of those, 339 companies were foreign. These relocations have created some
500,000 jobs, giving Atlanta, justifiably, a sense of being a boom town.
The city's primary attractions for business include:
A pro-business public-private partnership;
Excellent transportation, including Atlanta's Hartsfield airport, one of the
world's largest and second busiest a rail hub, two deep sea ports and a good
highway system;
Modern telecommunications, with more fiber optic connections than any other
US city;
A low corporate tax rate of 6 per cent, charged only on revenues made in the
state, and
Housing costs are relatively low.
'We are the city of value,' said Ms Judith Webb, spokeswoman for the Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce. But concerns exist about the quality of Georgia's
workforce.
This is underlined by the fact that half of the employment growth since the
early 1980s has been imported, non-Georgia labour.
The state consequently offers a labour training programme called 'Quick
Start,' which will train a workforce specifically to meet a company's needs.
It also offers incentives to companies that raise the skill levels of the
their employees.
And yet, attractions and incentives aside, the boom days appear to be over -
at least for now. Since 1990, when the US recession began and the economic
pinch began to be felt in Europe and Japan, the pace of investment and
relocations has begun to slow.
The number of project announcements dropped in 1990 to 260 from 407 in 1989
and to 195 in 1991.
KPMG Peat Marwick also found that foreign investment in Georgia, much of
which is in the Atlanta area, fell in 1991 for the first time since the
company began tracking it in 1984.
The cumulative amount invested by foreign firms - firms at least 50 per cent
owned by foreign investors - in Georgia dropped to Dollars 7.5bn from
Dollars 8.6bn in 1990.
Some two thirds of the decline came from 12 companies that were bought by
American firms. The survey covered 737 firms, or about 90 per cent of the
foreign firms operating throughout Georgia.
Yet, while fewer new foreign companies relocated to Georgia last year,
nearly half of those surveyed expected to invest further this year, with the
total amount to run to Dollars 1.5bn.
Atlanta hopes that the award of the 1996 Olympic Games will provide a new
burst of interest in the city, particularly from foreign companies.
It is particularly keen to attract more corporation and non-profit
association headquarters. At present, 13 of the Fortune 500 service
companies and nine Fortune 500 industrial companies locate their
headquarters here.
But, as testimony to its status as the business capital of the south, 422 of
the Fortune 500 industrial companies have offices in Atlanta, as do 80 of
the 100 largest commercial banking companies.
Mr Wayne Gantt, the top economist with Interstate/Johnson Lane, a regional
brokerage house, believes that Atlanta is the place to be.
'From Florida to North Carolina, this will be the best market in the United
States. Per capita income is rising here more than anywhere in the nation,
and there's great infrastructure and immigration of population,' he said.
Such is the praise of Atlanta that Mr Bartels says companies coming to look
at the city for possible relocation come with high expectations.
They are greeted, however, by a phalanx of well versed economic development
officials.
The Chamber of Commerce, the state's Dept of Industry, Trade and Tourism,
the city and, notably, Georgia Power, the state's major electricity
supplier, all co-operate in the effort to persuade companies to choose
Georgia. Georgia Power even has a video briefing room where visiting
executives can call up an impressive amount of information on any site,
building or community in the state.
Ms Becky Blalock, Georgia Power's manager of facilities relocation, said the
energy company has a Dollars 14bn investment in the state that it doesn't
want to go to waste. 'We try to do what we can to keep the economy going,'
said Ms Blalock.
And this seems to be the rule that Atlantans live by.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Tesco customers trading down in recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR IAN MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, vigorously countered suggestions that
the grocery chain's newest stores were trading below expectation.
But he accepted that its customers were conspicuously trading down as a
result of the recession.
'We have opened 12 new stores this year and they are among the best we have
ever opened,' Sir Ian said when presenting Tesco's interim results
yesterday.
There was, however, widespread evidence of customers buying less expensive
foods.
'We have more customers in the younger age groups - between 25 and 40 - who
by and large have been affected worse by the recession than the senior
citizens,' he said.
Tesco intends to open 13 more stores in the second half, although its
opening programme is developing at a slower rate than mapped out at the time
of its Pounds 572m rights issue in February 1991.
Sir Ian said this reflected problems of winning planning approval at
individual sites rather than any change of policy. 'There is absolutely no
change in the strategic direction at all,' he said.
Tesco ended the period with 401 stores and trading area of 11m sq ft. Next
year it will add 900,000 sq ft of selling space.
Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to be about Pounds 730m.
During the half year the company spent Pounds 317m, of which Pounds 266m
went on new store developments.
Mr David Reid, finance director, said: 'Opening new stores in a recession is
a lot harder than before and the returns across the industry are coming down
a bit, but they can afford to come down.'
The company was also affected by the sharp fall in prices for many food
items. Over the past three half-year periods the grocery industry's
like-for-like sales increases have fallen from 4.1 per cent to 3.1 per cent
to 1.5 per cent. Price deflation for fruit and vegetables this summer was a
'staggering' 18 per cent, Sir Ian said.
The fall in the value of sterling may halt the deflationary pressures as 25
per cent of Tesco's goods are imported. However, the company does not expect
a rapid change in the position and has already bought-forward currencies
until Christmas.
Tesco noticed a sharp increase in the demand for multi-save items and
introduced a number of 'value lines' in many stores. However, sales of some
high-value lines such as sandwiches, fresh ready meals and champagne
increased substantially.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Next displays strong improvement to Pounds
8.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT, the fashion retailer, continued its recovery with a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 8.3m in the first half, compared with just Pounds 200,000.
The advance in the six months to July 31 came from slightly reduced turnover
of Pounds 212.6m (Pounds 219.7m) as the group further reduced its peripheral
activities. The figures were helped by Pounds 2m (Pounds 500,000) of
interest received.
Next again beat most expectations - as it did with its 1991-92 pre-tax
outcome of Pounds 12.3m - and the share price rose 3 1/2 p to close at 102
1/2 p.
Next Retail turned an operating loss of Pounds 1.9m into a Pounds 4.1m
profit. The result was struck on sales up from Pounds 125.1m to Pounds
138.4m. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said the high street stores, excluding
clearance, increased sales by 13.6 per cent.
The total number of shops fell from 348 to 316 under the policy of closing
loss-making outlets and rationalising neighbouring outlets. The clearance
operation was cut back to only six shops.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said that strong stock control and 'short,
sharp' end-of-season sales had greatly reduced the surplus. The group had
traded for 23 of the 26 weeks without discounting.
Next Directory improved its operating profit to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.4m),
on flat sales of Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 42.7m), through better control of
stock and other costs.
Excluding Club 24, the credit operation that has been one of Next's problem
areas, the amount of cash held rose to Pounds 114m, compared with Pounds
106m at the year-end. The balance sheet was restored last year through the
Pounds 167.5m disposal of Grattan, the mail order group.
Repayment of Eurobonds next month will take Pounds 87m cash.
Club 24, which at one stage had debt of more than Pounds 330m, contributed
Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 38.9m) to sales but had no impact on profits. Mr Jones
said the group was withdrawing from providing funds for the credit service
offered to other stores. Instead it would manage the accounts for a
commission.
By next year the switch should be complete, leaving core borrowings of about
Pounds 20m. Club 24 could then be brought back on to the balance sheet.
Meanwhile, about Pounds 10m of unused provisions would lead to an
exceptional credit in this year's accounts.
Earnings per share rose to 2.01p (nil). An interim dividend of 0.5p (nil) is
declared.
COMMENT
Next's customers - 'young women aged 18 to 80' as Lord Wolfson puts it  -
have given the shops the benefit of the doubt after the dark era, responding
nostalgically to the return of the old style. Hence its good performance in
a highly competitive market. Even more impressive is the resilience of the
men's wear side, which accounts for 30 per cent of sales. Some price
reductions and an embracing of the idea of popular appeal, rather than
exclusivity, have helped keep the men happy, while the former plethora of
women's lines has been rationalised. There is scope for further margin
improvement as the management sticks to its recovered knitting. Upgraded
profit forecasts of about Pounds 26m give a prospective p/e of more than 16,
on a 10 per cent tax rate that should last another couple of years. While
there is still some running in the recovery story, most of it is in the
share price.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Development costs leave Comac lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Comac Group, the Hertfordshire-based computer
consultancy, fell from Pounds 186,500 to Pounds 44,000 in the first half of
1992 despite a halving of the net interest costs to Pounds 22,000, against
Pounds 56,000.
The USM-quoted company blamed the Pounds 50,000 costs of an aborted
acquisition, taken as an exceptional charge, and the costs of strengthening
the overseas activities, from which benefits did not show in the period.
Turnover was Pounds 4.91m (Pounds 5.27m). Earnings per share were 0.44p
(2.01p). Again there is no interim dividend but directors were confident of
being able to recommend a final.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norish, the Co Monaghan-based food services group, reported pre-tax profits
of IPounds 1m (Pounds 1m) for the six months to June 30 - a rise of some 11
per cent on the comparable IPounds 903,000.
Despite the recession, the UK stores - which are now almost entirely
consumer goods based - achieved high occupancy and good returns; the group
was actively seeking to expand in the UK, directors said.
Turnover fell to IPounds 4.87m against IPounds 7m last time, which included
a contribution from the now-sold trading assets of the distribution
business.
The interim dividend is held at 4.47p, payable from earnings of 7.95p (7p)
per share.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Skoda smoothes out the bumps -
Ariane Genillard examines the car manufacturer's new bearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKODA Automobila, the Czech car company in which Volkswagen of Germany is
building a 70 per cent stake, expects to break even this year, thanks to
rising productivity and higher sales.
Volkhard Kohler, vice-chairman, said that after a bumpy ride in its first
year, when a loss was recorded, the venture would break even in 1992 and
make profits from next year.
Plans were well advanced to raise a Dollars 1.2bn syndicated loan which
would be used to finance the start of an DM8bn investment programme designed
to double production capacity to 460,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s.
Existing capacity of 200,000 is expected to be fully utilised this year,
compared with 172,000 in 1991. This is partly a result of higher
productivity, with the company making 860 cars a day, compared with 560
earlier this year.
Improved productivity has resulted mainly from organisational changes as the
venture's capital expenditure programme has got into gear.
Some DM60m (Dollars 40m) was invested in the Czech plants last year, with a
further DM300m planned for 1992, mainly for the construction of a new paint
shop. Investment next year is expected to reach DM1.04bn and will peak in
1994 with an estimated DM1.6bn, falling to DM1.3bn in 1995.
Domestic sales, down to 27,000 cars in 1991, are expected to reach 85,000
this year, boosted by the launch of an upgraded 'Sport-Line' model and
tariff changes which have made imported cars more expensive.
Skoda has also increased sales to Germany, mainly to the eastern provinces
where the appetite for cheap cars is growing. Exports to Germany, are
expected to reach 60,000 this year, representing more than 60 per cent of
the company's exports to EC countries.
The joint-venture's two-year tax holiday is due to end in 1993, when Skoda
will be subject to corporate tax of about 45 per cent.
But the effective tax charge is expected to be minimal, thanks to
depreciation allowances on its increasing capital expenditures and the
five-year tax loss carry forward allowed under the new tax code.
Meanwhile, a question mark still hangs over the future of the remaining 30
per cent stake in the joint-venture owned by the Czechoslovak government.
Credit Suisse First Boston, which structured the original deal, under which
Volkswagen bought a 31 per cent stake in Skoda for DM620m in April 1991
rising to 70 per cent by 1995, is currently working on the sale of the
government's stake.
At Volkswagen's insistence, the terms of the joint venture make it
impossible for the government to sell its shares directly to the public.
Instead, investors, both local and foreign, will probably be offered shares
in what will still be a government-controlled investment fund which will
house the shares.
Investors will probably be offered dividends but not voting rights, which
will remain with the fund, although the details are still being finalised.
Once the decision is taken to proceed with the sale, however, shares in the
fund are expected to become among the most sought-after assets in
Czechoslovakia.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Michelin's return to profit
fails to satisfy the bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre-maker, yesterday announced a turnround
approaching FFr2bn to report a net profit of FFr820m (Dollars 162m) in the
first half of the year against a FFr1.06bn loss a year earlier.
The improvement came mainly from savings following 11,400 job losses and a
reduction in stocks to 23 per cent of annual sales by the end of June (from
26 per cent of turnover a year earlier). Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere,
finance director, said Michelin will have lost 16,000 jobs by the end of
this year, when the lay-offs will be complete.
The turnround was 'more than satisfying', he said, though all Michelin's
main competitors had also improved their performance this year. However, the
stock market had expected a bigger recovery, and Michelin's share price
price fell by FFr4.7 to FFr199.8 as analysts revised down their full-year
profit forecasts.
Michelin's improvement came on a sluggish tyre market, with volume sales up
by a mere 3 per cent. It managed to increase prices for replacement tyres in
the second quarter by between 3 per cent and 7 per cent in Europe and
slightly less in North America. Michelin does not divulge prices of new
tyres supplied to car-makers.
Group turnover rose by 5.6 per cent to FFr34.8bn from the first half of
1991, or by 8 per cent adjusting for currency changes, on which operating
costs were steady at FFr32.88bn. Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere said: 'For the
coming months, we continue to expect small growth in the world tyre market.'
The group had held its 20 per cent share of the world tyre market but lost
unspecified market share in North America because of the closure of two
out-dated factories belonging to Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre-maker which
Michelin bought two years ago. However, Michelin planned to increase
production capacity there to compensate, added Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere.
A capital increase this year could not be ruled out, but Mr Bourdais de
Charbonniere noted the stock market 'recently has not been encouraging'.
Michelin has in the past hinted that it would make a rights issue as soon as
its performance had recovered.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Valeo rises 63% on weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VALEO, the leading French maker of car components, yesterday reported a 63
per cent rise in net profits to FFr408m (Dollars 75.55m) in the first half
of the year, from FFr250m in the first six months of 1991.
Like Michelin, the French tyre-maker which unveiled a sharp earnings
recovery yesterday, Valeo owes much of the improvement to lower production
costs and finance charges in a poor economic climate.
Demand from the car industry continues to be weak, reflected in an 8 per
cent rise in turnover from FFr10.3bn to FFr11.1bn over the same period.
Operating profits after finance charges rose by 64 per cent to FFr702m.
However, Valeo booked FFr218m in restructuring costs in the first half as it
intensified its cost-cutting drive in the face of tough international
competition.
Investments, by contrast, rose by 25 per cent to FFr708m, reflecting the
completion of an electronics plant in France, an engine cooling plant in
Italy, and a UK factory to make climate controls.
This spending came out of cash-flow, but Valeo still managed to reduce its
debts by FFr685m over the period, to FFr2.26bn by the end of June, which
represents 30 per cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pinault in offer to Printemps
shareholders

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the acquisitive French retailing group, has offered to buy out the
minority shareholders in Au Printemps, the department store chain for which
it mounted a controversial partial bid last year. The offer of FFr780
(Dollars 154) a share is significantly less than the FFr1,105 originally
offered.
The first bid, which transformed Pinault from an industrial company
dominated by timber interests into one of France's foremost retail concerns,
ran into controversy when Au Printemps' minority shareholders complained at
being excluded from the deal between Pinault and the Maus-Nordmann family
that controlled Au Printemps.
The new offer, which is worth just over 70 per cent of the original bid,
seems to confirm the minority investors' concern. Pinault yesterday claimed
it was impossible to compare the price of the two transactions, given that
the first offer involved buying a 66.6 per cent controlling holding in Au
Printemps.
Pinault also said the new price reflected the current market value of Au
Printemps shares, which were suspended yesterday morning at FFr650 pending
the announcement. Pinault's shares were suspended, too. The shares of both
companies will resume trading today.
Meanwhile, Pinault is trying to complete the sale of its old industrial
interests to reduce the debt incurred by the Au Printemps deal and other
acquisitions, including that of the Conforama chain of furniture shops.
Pinault last month sold Isoroy, one of its original timber businesses, to
Glunz, the German timber products group.
Casino, the French supermarkets group which recently took over by Rallye,
one of its main competitors, returned to the black in the first half of 1992
with net profits of FFr23.4m against a net loss of FFr8.3m in the interim
period last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading private commercial bank, is
set to become owner of the Gota group, a holding company that owns the
country's fourth-largest bank, Gota, and two smaller banks.
Five years ago, SEB lent Skr1.1bn to Gota AB, the holding company, and in
return acquired 100 per cent of the shares in Gota Bank as a security.
On September 9, Gota Bank announced credit losses for this year would reach
SKr8bn, double its previous estimate, adding that operating loss for 1992
would be SKr3bn to SKr4bn.
Last week, Gota group suspended all payments to creditors because of funding
problems after revealing liabilities of SKr3.5bn.
In response, the Swedish government promised to guarantee Gota Bank's
commitments to private individuals, companies and other creditors. But it
added it would not guarantee the obligations of Gota, the holding company.
It is now probable that SEB will seek the SKr1.1bn in loans made to Gota
from the state. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive of SEB, said last night
that the most important consideration for the bank was to secure the return
of the Skr1.1bn it lent to Gota.
Gota Bank is owned 100 per cent by Gota, the holding company, which is owned
by the large Swedish insurance conglomerate Trygg-Hansa SPP.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rand Mines to split into four
units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAND MINES, which in the past year has been transformed from a diversified
mining group into a coal mining business with some marginal gold mines and
exploration interests, is putting its operations into four independent
business units: coal; property; gold and exploration; and platinum.
The South African company last year consolidated its successful coal mining
interests in Witbank Colliery and renamed it Randcoal. This company and Rand
Mines Properties are already listed in Johannesburg. It has now applied to
list the other two units, Goldco and Platco, on the Johannesburg stock
exchange.
Analysts suggested the impetus for change came from Barlow Rand, Rand Mines'
controlling shareholder, which lost patience with its subsidiary's
unsuccessful diversification away from its core coal business.
In the past year Rand Mines has sold its:
platinum interests to Impala Platinum;
vanadium operations to Vanadium Technologies;
chrome business to Samancor;
forestry operations to Sappi, and;
granite mineral rights to Genmin.
Analysts suggest there is not much left in the gold and platinum operations.
Rand Mines retained a shareholding in Barplats, its platinum company, but
had to take on millions of rands in debt in the process.
The company manages four struggling and marginal gold mines -
Blyvooruitzicht, Durban Deep, East Rand Proprietary Mines and Harmony - but
has reduced its shareholding in each below 10 per cent.
Mr Derek Cooper, managing director of Barlow Rand, said the restructuring
would enable the different businesses to be evaluated on their merits
without the confusion of cross-subsidisation. Secondly, respective
managements could now clearly focus on their businesses without the
distraction of other, in some case, unrelated activities.
'Thirdly, it allows investors, including Barlows, to take a view on each
business and scale their investment accordingly,' he said.
Mr Cooper stressed, however, 'this is not the precursor of an unbundling of
Barlow Rand'.
Barlow Rand has set up a new division, Barlow Rand Mineral Resources, which
will contain the restructured mining interests and Pretoria Portland Cement.
The restructuring had been well signalled, and Rand Mines' share price ended
unchanged at Pounds 6 yesterday.

BRAMALEA, one of the three key property companies of Toronto's
Edper-Bronfman group, suffered a nine-month loss of CDollars 34m (USDollars
27.80m), or 38 cents a share, and warned that a further big write-down would
be taken in the fourth quarter.
Bramalea, caught in the North American property crisis, owns residential and
commercial properties and a large land-bank. It would not say how big the
fourth-quarter write-down would be, but analysts estimate it at CDollars
400m to CDollars 500m.
The company has proposed a five-year restructuring designed to reduce total
debt from CDollars 4.5bn to CDollars 2bn and has already sold assets and
written down some carrying values.
Its bankers have agreed to defer principal and interest payments on land and
other non-revenue producing assets, but holders of CDollars 524m of secured
debentures are resisting a plan that would pay them in equity and give them
almost 50 per cent ownership.
Bramalea's revenues totalled CDollars 589m in the nine months, down 4 per
cent from a year earlier. The company reported a profit of CDollars 4.3m, or
2 cents a share in the 1991 period.
Trizec, which owns 72 per cent of Bramalea, warned that its own 1992 results
would be adversely affected by the Bramalea write-down. Trizec's nine
months' consolidated earnings were CDollars 10.4m, against CDollars 45.6m,
on revenues of CDollars 1.04bn, against CDollars 1.03m.
Carena, the third Edper-Bronfman property company, will also be affected
since it owns 23 per cent of Bramalea through Trizec.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: US biotech industry heads for
maturity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIOTECHNOLOGY companies are accelerating rapidly towards commercial
maturity, according to a comprehensive annual survey of the US biotech
industry released yesterday.
The Ernst &amp; Young report shows that industry's total revenues rose by 28 per
cent in 1991-92 to Dollars 8.1bn - product sales accounted for Dollars 5.9bn
and the remaining Dollars 2.2bn came from licence fees and collaborative
research income.
The 1,200 biotech companies covered spent a total of Dollars 4.9bn on
research and development (42 per cent more than the previous year) and made
a net loss of Dollars 3.4bn.
But Mr Steven Burrill, Ernst &amp; Young's US director for high technology
services, predicted that the industry's sales would rise quickly enough to
bring it to overall profitability within two or three years. 'We see the
industry on its way to an enormous revenue base - Dollars 100bn worldwide by
the end of the century,' he said.
'In this past remarkable year we have seen both euphoria and disenchantment
in the public financial markets for biotechnology stocks,' the report says.
Euphoria pushed the total market capitalisation of the biotech industry up
from Dollars 35bn in September 1991 to a peak of Dollars 60bn at the end of
year; then regulatory setbacks for a few well-publicised biotech drugs,
combined with a swing back to cyclical stocks on Wall Street, pulled the
sector's capitalisation back down to about Dollars 50bn.
Ernst &amp; Young point out the entire biotech industry is valued at slightly
less than Merck, the largest US drug company, whose market capitalisation is
Dollars 60bn.
Twenty biotech-derived drugs and 600 diagnostic products are on the market,
including Amgen's Neupogen which had first-year sales of Dollars 230m. The
industry has a further 135 drugs in human clinical trials and 21 awaiting
Food and Drug Administration approval.
Although human drugs dominate the sector, Ernst &amp; Young says 'ag-bio' is set
to emerge as an area of rapid growth, led by biological pesticides and
genetically engineered crops.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard both have launched new
aggressively-priced, high-performance PCs aimed at corporate buyers.
However, reflecting the cut-throat competition in the PC market, AST
Research, a leading clone maker, matched and in some cases undercut IBM and
H-P prices with new models of its own.
IBM launched 12 new models in its PS/2 Premium line and announced a new
warranty service.
H-P claimed its new PCs were cheaper than comparable products from Compaq
Computer and provide more features than similarly-priced PCs from Dell
Computer and AST.
IBM has called for redemption on November 21 of all Dollars 1.2bn
outstanding of its 7 7/8 per cent convertible subordinated debentures due
November 2004. It also called for redemption on November 14 of all Dollars
250m outstanding in World Trade Corp 10 1/4 per cent notes due November
1995.
The 10 1/4 per cent bonds will be redeemed at 101 per cent of principal plus
accured interest, and the 7 7/8 per cent bonds at 101.575 per cent plus
accrued interest.

MITSUBISHI Materials, the Japanese metals refiner and manufacturer, has
announced the acquisition of Lefo-Formenbau, a German maker of dies for
injection moulding.
Lefo is to be wholly acquired for DM8.4m (Dollars 5.60m). It supplies
equipment to the European power tool, electrical components, and audio and
visual cassette industries.
Mr Takehiko Mizugai, managing director, said the acquisition 'will permit
Mitsubishi Materials to respond to European demand with greater efficiency'.
Investment by Japanese manufacturers in European operations slowed last
year, but there remains strong interest among larger companies in strategic
acquisitions of smaller manufacturers.

secret is out

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank whose financial results have long been
a closely-guarded secret, has finally been revealed as the most consistently
profitable firm on Wall Street, making a pre-tax profit of Dollars 1.15bn in
the 1991 fiscal year.
The figure was revealed in this week's edition of Investment Dealers'
Digest, a US financial magazine, which obtained a copy of a memorandum
distributed by the firm over the summer to potential investors in a Dollars
400m issue of debt securities.
Goldman is the last big privately-owned partnership on Wall Street and as
such is not required to publish its financial statements.
Its position at or near the top of most Wall Street league tables means it
has long been one of America's most successful investment banks, and thus
known to be extremely profitable.
However, the degree of financial success revealed by the memorandum has
surprised some analysts. The Dollars 1.15bn earned in the year to last
November was well ahead of the pre-tax profits of rivals like Morgan Stanley
and Salomon, while figures for the years 1987 to 1991 also showed the firm
outstripping its rivals.
However, in the first six months of the current year it made Dollars 662m,
down 12 per cent on the same period of 1991 and below both Salomon and
Merrill Lynch.
Its revenues for the half year, net of interest expenses, came to Dollars
1.91bn, down from Dollars 1.96bn. Revenues from market-making and principal
transactions - investing for the firm's own account - came to Dollars 1.5bn,
down slightly from 1991. Commissions and fees totalled Dollars 410m.

JARDINE MATHESON, the diversified Hong Kong trading and investment company,
yesterday posted a 12.4 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 151.8m in
the six months to June 30 from Dollars 135.1m in the same period last year.
Profits were struck on a 12.6 per cent rise in turnover to Dollars 3.8bn
from Dollars 3.38bn. The directors declared an interim dividend of 3.7 cents
a share, up 9 per cent on the 3.4 cents last time.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, underlined the advantages of the company's
geographical spread and the strength of its balance sheet. He said these
gave the board confidence that satisfactory results would be achieved in
1992.
Although the company's results were broadly in line with predictions, there
was surprise at the better-than-expected performance of Jardine Pacific, the
core of the restructured Jardine Matheson.
Earnings for the subsidiary rose - mainly because of the strong performance
of its motor vehicle offshoot - in spite of a weak performance in Japan,
where the recession affected profits.
The company said Jardine Pacific's financial services and security divisions
performed well, but engineering and construction - of which its
half-ownership of Gammon is the core - performed less well.
JIB Group, the company's UK-listed insurance broker, made Dollars 19.3m in
the first half. Unfavourable market conditions and the as yet unresolved
problems at Lloyd's will mean that full-year profits are likely to fall
short of earlier hopes, the company said.
Jardine Fleming, its joint venture brokerage, increased its operating profit
during the first half. Funds under management grew 8 per cent to Dollars
10.5bn at June 30.

<TEXT>
ELSWICK, which sold its bicycle business last year to focus on print and
packaging, reported a 70 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.72m and restored dividend payments.
The improvement reflected a 21 per cent increase in operating profit for the
six months to July 31 to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.85m) and a 39 per cent
reduction in interest payment to Pounds 511,000 (Pounds 835,000).
Profits last time were depressed by losses of Pounds 465,000 from
discontinued businesses. The main one was Falcon Cycles, sold in December.
Sales of continuing businesses were up 5 per cent at Pounds 28.5 (Pounds
27.1m or Pounds 31.9m with discontinued businesses).
Mr Bill Cross, chairman, said the results reflected the resilience of its
core printing and packaging activities.
There is an interim dividend of 0.15p (0.22p). No final dividend was paid
last year. Earnings per share were 0.63p (0.41p).

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: WIC raises Pounds 50m via reduction of
brewing portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHITBREAD Investment Company, an investment trust 49.9 per cent owned by
Whitbread, the brewer, yesterday raised about Pounds 50m through the placing
of shares it controlled in several brewing and pub groups.
It was forced to reduce the number of public houses under its control to
comply with the government's beer orders which come into effect on November
1. These were introduced after the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report on the industry.
Mr Robin Farrington, WIC's chairman, said that two thirds of the Pounds 50m
raised was immediately reinvested in large international drinks companies to
spread its portfolio.
Under the terms of the beer orders companies have to reduce their stake in
brewing and pub groups to below 15 per cent.
However, because Whitbread holds a 49.9 per cent stake in WIC which in turn
holds a 29.9 per cent stake in Whitbread, the combined maximum shareholding
of both companies in any one brewer and pub group is set at 21.2 per cent.
WIC sold 6.9 per cent of Boddington, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group,
and 18.9 per cent of Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based brewer.
Whitbread, which distributes Marston's beers and has a long-term supply
agreement with Boddington, took advantage of WIC's move to take its
shareholding in both companies to 8.8 per cent. WIC is left with 12.3 per
cent in the two companies bringing Whitbread and WIC's combined shareholding
to 21.1 per cent.
WIC also sold 3.3 per cent of JA Devenish, the West Country-based pub
operator, which was bought by Whitbread. WIC had to bring its Devenish
shareholding down to 11 per cent because both WIC and Whitbread have a stake
in Boddington which owns 19.5 per cent of Devenish.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Core activities shore up Hays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the business services group, saw pre-tax profits edge ahead by 1 per
cent to Pounds 57.4m in a year which it said had seen no measurable sign of
improvement in the British economy.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, gave yesterday's base rate reduction a
cautious welcome: 'It will obviously help, but recovery is not going to
happen overnight - people will be cautious for some time.'
The group said strong performances by its core distribution and commercial
activities in the year to June 30 had offset a further fall in profits
suffered by the personnel business, which specialises in recruiting
accountancy staff.
The personnel division's operating profits fell from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds
4.8m and accounted for only 8 per cent of total operating profit, compared
with 20 per cent last year.
The distribution businesses increased overall operating profits by 16 per
cent to Pounds 33.5m. New business with large retailers helped increase
contract distribution's profits by 64 per cent. However, the recession's
effect on high street sales cut profits from the removal and home delivery
operations.
Hays Chemical Distribution increased operating profits by 9 per cent. Mr
Frost said that reflected the impact of management changes and a new
computer system, which had improved stock controls and enhanced margins.
The commercial businesses, providing office support services, increased
operating profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 20.8m. Hays said Britdoc and Data
Express, its overnight mail services and parcel delivery companies,
performed well against strong competition.
The group spent Pounds 52.3m on acquisitions, the biggest being its purchase
in June of FRIL, a French food and drinks distributor. Mr Frost said: 'We
are actively looking for further acquisitions in continental Europe and the
UK.'
Hays generated Pounds 24.7m in cash and raised Pounds 34.6m from the placing
of 19m shares at the time of the FRIL deal. In spite of investing Pounds 28m
in a dedicated distribution complex being developed for Waitrose at Milton
Keynes, gearing fell from 22 to 21 per cent.
In April the group sold Traveldoc, a document delivery service aimed at the
travel industry, because of continuing uncertainty about the European
regulatory environment. The disposal accounted for most of an extraordinary
item of Pounds 1.3m, the rest being associated with the sale of a stationery
company.
Earnings per share rose to 10.33p (10p). A final dividend of 3.1p makes a
4.6p (4p) total.
COMMENT
The Hays business philosophy - of its distribution, commercial and personnel
businesses comprising a three-legged stool - is looking a little lopsided
after the toll which recession has taken of the recruitment market. However,
the plunge in personnel operating profits from Pounds 19m to Pounds 4.8m in
just two years also gives some measure of the scope for recovery. The
performance of the commercial and distribution activities continues to
impress in the flat domestic market and Mr Frost is confident that the
French acquisition will enhance earnings. Forecast pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 72m put the shares, down  1/2 p yesterday at 184p, on a prospective
multiple of just over 15. At that level they look a sound long-term recovery
play.

<TEXT>
LLOYD THOMPSON, the London market insurance broker, yesterday announced a 28
per cent increase to Pounds 14.4m in pre-tax profits for the year to June
30, a result heavily against the trend for the sector.
The final dividend is 3.95p increasing the total by 24 per cent from 4.5p to
5.6p, helping to stimulate a strong rise in the company's share price, which
closed up 15p at 222p.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 12.36p (9.95p). Turnover also
increased, from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 36.6m, although this figure was
diminished by the weakness of the dollar, the currency in which 80 per cent
of the group's brokerage income is earned.
However, the group used currency hedging to attain an average exchange rate
of 1.75, and Mr Ken Carter, chief executive, said he was confident that the
recent heavy foreign exchange fluctuations would not impact on next year's
results.
Mr Carter attributed the company's success, compared to a sector which has
been battered by bad news in recent weeks, to cost control and high
retention of clients.
He also pointed out that Lloyd Thompson is a wholesale and reinsurance
brokerage, without the heavy exposure other UK brokers have to the US retail
business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Wolsten-holme Rink, the Lancashire-based metal powders
maker and supplier of products for the printing industry, showed a 35 per
cent improvement, from Pounds 1.24m to Pounds 1.68m, in the six months to
end-June.
Mr Tony Rink, joint chairman, said the advance had been achieved despite a
fall in turnover to Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 27.5m) and was mainly the result of
a recovery in the part of the business which supplies international printing
ink manufacturers. Profits had also been helped by the acquisition last year
of PCO, which had performed well, he added.
However, no improvement had been seen in trading conditions in the UK. Sales
in the printing supplies business had fallen and bad debts were still a
significant problem.
An improved interim dividend of 6.5p (6.3p) is declared, payable from
earnings of 14.4p (11.8p) per share.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat to pass dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Greycoat, the property investment company, yesterday fell by a
third from 21p to 14p when the company passed its preference dividend and
rescinded its recommendation to pay a final dividend.
The group blamed its decision on a slowdown in the property market over the
summer, which delayed completion of sales.
Any payment of dividends would have had to be financed by property sales,
since the company's net rental income is only sufficient to cover its
interest costs. By passing the dividend the company saves Pounds 6.7m,
including advance corporation tax.
'Prudence dictated that if they are to have any chance of survival, they
should not pay a dividend. They need every penny they have got,' said an
analyst.
The company, which has debts of Pounds 390m, said it is pursuing an
aggressive programme of property dis-posals to reduce gearing of 180 per
cent to less than 100 per cent. So far this year, it has sold Pounds 70m
worth of property.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said that although the property market had not
completely dried up, purchasers had delayed making decisions over the
summer.
The final dividend of 2.9p per share, which was announced on July 23, was
due to be put to the annual meeting tomorrow and be paid on October 1.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced exceptionals cut Southern
Newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Newspapers, the regional newspaper group which faced the threat of
a bid battle between four potential suitors a year ago, reported annual
pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.01m against Pounds 8.61m.
The pre-tax line for the year to June 27 was struck after a Pounds 168,000
(Pounds 5.89m) surplus on disposals of investments.
The sharp reduction was partly offset by lower interest costs of Pounds
580,000 (Pounds 1.77m), reflecting strong cash flow which enabled it to
eliminate all bank debts and end the year with cash reserves of Pounds 5.3m.
A cost reduction programme introduced last year - including a 5.5 per cent
cut in staff numbers to 1,646 - helped operating profits climb to Pounds
7.23m (Pounds 3.9m).
The improved operating figure was struck despite turnover dipping from
Pounds 71.4m to Pounds 69.5m.
The fall mainly reflected a decline in advertising revenues, partly offset
by improvements in circulation, contract printing and other revenues.
Earnings per share fell to 20.10p (26.75p). The final dividend is raised
8.25p, making a total of 11.25p (10.5p).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 3.53m) was mainly incurred
in preparing a submission to the Monopolies Commission.
This held a three-month investigation into whether a takeover by Trinity
International Holdings, Emap, Pearson (owner of the Financial Times) and
Reed International would be against the public interest.
The four groups were cleared to bid but decided against when the shares rose
to 330p.
Yesterday Mr James Sexton, chief executive, said that since July - when the
four groups were free to look at Southern - there had been no contact.
'We are not in discussions with anyone,' he said. 'It is our intention to
remain independent.'

<TEXT>
AIRBREAK LEISURE Group, the USM-quoted tour operator, could be 47.07 per
cent owned by Champion Holdings, a private Cyprus-based leisure company, by
September 25 if Champion exercises options agreed on September 18.
Last November, Champion started to build - via a share subscription for a
total Pounds 2m - its current 12.85 per cent stake.
However, it can lift its stake to 42.12 per cent if it exercises options to
buy up to 13m shares from Airbreak directors for Pounds 1 per block of
shares.
The Takeover Panel has said that, because the exercise price is de minimis
no obligation to make a full takeover is triggered.
If the proposed sale of Sunsail International, which Airbreak acquired for
up to Pounds 8m in January, goes through, Champion can then further raise
its stake by acquiring - also for Pounds 1 - the 2.2m shares owned by Mr and
Mrs CRC Gordon, who came to Airbreak with Sunsail, as part of their exit
deal.
Champion is owned by Mr Takis Shacalis, who was a non-executive director of
Airbreak between January 16 and September 7.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Costings are tight in an ageing market -
Maggie Urry considers the opportunities in the nursing home sector as the
government changes the rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE and expanding market serviced by a fragmented industry would seem
the ideal combination for companies within it to grow. The nursing home
sector appears to offer just such an opportunity.
There has to be a catch, though. Next April the entire system of government
provision of care for the elderly will change when the National Health
Service and Care in the Community Act comes into force. The industry is
apprehensive about the changes, if only because few of the details have been
worked out yet.
The cost of long-term care for the elderly and chronically ill is estimated
at more than Pounds 6.5bn a year. Yet the top ten companies have only 4 per
cent of the market.
Operators of nursing homes, which mainly cater for elderly people needing
nursing care and are distinct from residential homes, foresee more customers
as people live longer.
Mr Ron Reid, finance director of Takare, the leading quoted company in the
sector, said: 'You cannot fundamentally change the demographics. There is a
surplus of patients which is set to rise.'
As well as rising demand, there is some reduction in supply. Mr Pat Carter,
chief executive of Westminster Health Care, a large nursing home operator
which is planning a flotation, said that the NHS had been closing expensive
long-stay hospital wards. As more hospitals gained trust status, the
pressure to save money by closing more would increase.
He added that a number of local authority-run homes, which had been exempt
from registration under the old system,would now have to conform to
standards which some would not meet.
More than a quarter of people aged 85 and over live in some form of
institution. Within 10 years, demographers estimate, there will be an
increase of 400,000 people over 85. needing another 100,000 places if the
same percentage applies.
At the same time the number of informal carers, often the daughters of the
elderly, is falling as more go out to work, increasing demand further.
The market currently offers about 550,000 places, according to Laing &amp;
Buisson, a consultancy firm which specialises in private healthcare.
From April 1 next year patients who cannot afford to pay for themselves will
be assessed by local authority social services departments rather than
receiving income support from central government.
There is some fear that local authorities will try to care for more people
at home, rather than putting them into a nursing home. However, the nursing
home companies believe the cost of caring for ill people in their own homes
is greater than in a nursing home.
There is also concern that local authorities will try to cut the rates which
have applied. The Department of Social Security at present pays income
support of Pounds 270 or Pounds 280 per week, depending on how ill the
patient is, which goes to the home operator. Patient's also receive some
pocket money.
The low cost companies, such as Takare, WHC and Quality Care Homes, can make
a profit at these levels, and could survive at lower rates which would drive
higher-cost homes out of business. They have concentrated on new homes where
efficiencies can be built in rather than on converting rambling Victorian
houses which are expensive to run.
Another concern of the operators is that patients, and their relatives,
should still be given choice over which home they go to. Mr Duncan
Bannatyne, managing director of QCH, believes this is a vital issue. QCH's
homes run at an occupancy rate of 99.3 per cent, and have waiting lists.
High occupancy is essential if a home is to make a profit at the social
security rates. If people can choose which home they go to they will pick
the one they perceive as best.
There is the cushion that existing patients will still be entitled to income
support until they die. In homes catering for the elderly, this may give
operators two years over which the changes will come into full effect.
The quoted nursing home groups expect to survive these changes and look
ahead to the growth expected over the next few years. Mr Reid said: 'We
expect, whatever the outcome of the reforms, to emerge at least as strong as
before.'
From an investors point of view the fast growth in the market is tempered by
the demand of the companies within it for capital. Yet companies which have
attempted to combine nursing homes with other unrelated activities have
generally diluted the growth or even failed to make headway in the sector
and pulled out.
Takare has made a number of equity issues and raised money through
debentures to fund its fast rate of expansion. However, since it came to the
stock market in 1988 earnings per share have also risen sharply, from 2.85p
to 10.1p in 1991.
As the companies grow it should become easier to fund expansion from
cashflow.
Mr Carter of WHC believed that as the industry becomes more established the
long term debt market would develop financial instruments tailored to
nursing homes, reducing the need for equity issues.
Despite the uncertainty likely in the run up to next April's changes, the
longer-term outlook for efficient nursing home operators would appear
bright.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cantors restructures and attacks rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANTORS, the Sheffield-based retail furnishing group, yesterday announced a
capital restructuring along with a 17 per cent setback in annual profits.
Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said the decision to enfranchise the A
non-voting ordinary shares reflected the reluctance of certain investors,
including institutions, to invest in companies with such capital structures.
Holders of the ordinary shares, which currently represent 7.3 per cent of
the equity, will receive a compensatory 3-for-2 scrip issue resulting in the
issue of 1.5m shares - 9.9 per cent of the enlarged capital.
The company also proposes to cancel and repay the 5.25 per cent cumulative
preference shares at par.
The statement accompanied results for the year to April 25 which showed
pre-tax profits down to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 2.53m) on turnover ahead some 11
per cent to Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 57m) - a 'creditable' performance in
difficult economic conditions according to Mr Cantor.
Efforts to improve margins and control overheads had been offset by
unavoidable increases in occupancy costs, particularly from 'upward only'
rent reviews.
'If rents were able to reflect economic reality and not some Alice in
Wonderland fantasy, they would reduce in recession, lowering overall costs,
allowing price reductions and encouraging consumer spending,' he said.
The final dividend is maintained at 3p, holding the total at 4p, covered 2.5
times by earnings of 10.01p (12.72p) per share.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Fittings loses Pounds 1.02m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH FITTINGS Group yesterday reported its second successive half yearly
loss but is paying a token interim dividend as an indication that it has
reached its nadir and will return to profit by the end of the year.
The group, which distributes valves, tubes and fittings, manufactures and
hires high pressure water products, and distributes non-ferrous metals,
yesterday announced a pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 of Pounds
1.02m compared with a profit of Pounds 1.71m in the 1991 first half.
The group's position deteriorated during the second six months, however, and
it posted a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.96m for the full year after heavy
exceptional items relating to the cost of cutbacks and provisions for its
water business hire fleet of vehicles.
The latest deficit, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 622,000
(Pounds 374,000) relating mainly to redundancies and property disposals,
came on turnover reduced to Pounds 40.4m (Pounds 42m). Fully diluted losses
per share were 3.48p compared with earnings of 5.37p. However, Mr Brian
Stanton, chief executive, said 'the company should run into profit in the
second half.' An interim dividend of 0.5p (1.375p) is declared.
In July 1991 shareholders subscribed to a Pounds 7.13m rights issue aimed at
reducing debt. Although gearing at the end of 1991 was announced as 61 per
cent, against 77 per cent a year earlier, this figure could have been
understated. Current gearing, reflecting the diminution of shareholders'
funds, is 75 per cent.
Problems have not been solely related to depressed markets for the group's
products. It is still negotiating with insurers about compensation for
thefts of Pounds 1m in its non-ferrous metals division and coping with a
Fraud Squad investigation into the affair which came to light in January.
It has also been coming to terms with its own internal accounting and
putting in place a system which will accurately reflect the value of stocks
and progress of sales.
Mr Cecil Buckett, the new finance director, said the latest figures did not
hide anything. But Mr Michael Borlenghi, the new non-executive chairman,
pointed to illusory accounting in the past when he warned that 'the
directors believe that the disclosed results for the six months ended June
1991 may not reflect a true comparison with those for the half year to June
30 1992.'
The arrival of Mr Borlenghi and Mr Buckett, coupled with the decision that
Mr Stanton should concentrate on his chief executive role, have been the
most obvious signs of a management shake-up throughout the group.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is examining the possibility of a Europe-wide levy
on blank cassette tapes and audio and video equipment.
But UK officials believe that, after yesterday's meeting of internal market
ministers, the Commission will not go ahead with tabling a formal proposal.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner responsible for the single market,
asked ministers at the meeting how they might react to a levy.
A number of countries are said to favour harmonisation. Germany, France and
the Netherlands already have levies, which are supposed to help compensate
performers for the widespread illegal taping of pre-recorded cassettes.
But other countries, including Britain and Italy, voiced objections.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency, is strongly opposed to a levy which
it thinks would be superfluous and impossible to administer.
A Commission official said Mr Bangemann was aware of the sensitivity of such
plans, but added: 'We just want to keep in touch with member states'
opinions.' The scope of existing levies varies in different member states.
The Commission wants to avoid distortion in cross-border trade after
internal EC barriers come down on January 1 1993.
Separately, ministers waved through directives which will harmonise national
legislation on homoeopathic medicines.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S three main trade union confederations yesterday began the first of a
series of regional four-hour general strikes in an attempt to force the
government to soften the impact of higher taxes and social security cuts
proposed in the 1993 budget.
The decision to go ahead with the strikes came despite a meeting on Monday
between union leaders and Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister. Mr Amato
appears determined to take a tough line with the unions over demands for
changes in the budget.
The strike in Tuscany, called by the CGIL, CISL and UIL, was widely
observed.
However, it revealed the growing divide between moderates and militants in
the CGIL, the largest confederation formerly dominated by the communists.
Mr Bruno Trentin, the CGIL leader, was barracked and bombarded with coins
and tomatoes at a mass meeting in Florence by a well-organised group of
demonstrators accusing him of betraying the trade union movement.
Mr Trentin has only just been reconfirmed as CGIL secretary-general after
handing in his resignation at the end of July to head off criticism for
signing an agreement with the government and employers abolishing the system
of indexed wages.
In the past few days he has been walking a tight-rope, appeasing grass-roots
protest over government austerity measures and backing the prime minister
out of a sense of national solidarity.
Since the budget was outlined last Thursday a number of industrial centres
have witnessed spontaneous stoppages. The regional stoppages running until
September 29 could foreshadow a national general strike to force the
government to water down measures capping pensions, limiting the
availability of public health care and freezing public sector employment.
The government, anxious to head off a possible taxpayers' revolt, said
yesterday that all those suspected of involvement in the country's growing
bribery scandal could have their assets seized, Reuter adds.
'It wouldn't be good to show bribery suspects appearing to be escaping while
people are being asked to pay more taxes,' said a government source. More
than 70 politicians and businessmen are being held in connection with the
public works contracts scandal which began in Milan in February and has
spread to all mainstream political parties. Sanctions for those caught up in
the so-called Tangentopoli scandal were published in the Official Gazette
and now become law.
Leaders of the opposition Northern Leagues, which made big gains in last
April's general election, have called for the rich northern regions of Italy
to stage a taxpayers' revolt.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Prison violence tops French agenda: As the dispute with jail
staff drags on it is becoming increasingly bitter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS morning, the French Justice Ministry plans to hold a meeting in Paris
to discuss the increasingly bitter prison officers' dispute. Unfortunately
for its hopes of negotiating a settlement, one of the biggest groups of
prison officers' unions will not be there.
The Union Generale des Federations de Fonctionnaires, whose members include
jail staff, announced on Monday that it would boycott today's meeting. Other
unions will doubtless follow suit, as they did last week when they walked
out of a national negotiating meeting at the Justice Ministry.
After last week's setback, the French government has been trying to break
the dispute area by area. So far it has had little success. The strike is
now in its 12th day. Sixty of France's 182 jails are at a standstill and the
remainder are affected by stoppages, go-slows and demonstrations.
Conditions within the jails have deteriorated rapidly. Family visits have
been cancelled, as have exercise periods. Some inmates have been unable to
wash. Catering services have been disrupted.
Riot police and military squads have been sent in to restore order at dozens
of jails. Night after night dramatic television footage shows prisoners
rioting on roof tops, dangling burning rags through their barred cell
windows and rampaging in jail yards.
Until this week the prison dispute competed with the Maastricht referendum
for the headlines. Now the referendum is over, the government is under even
greater pressure to tackle what is probably the most pressing problem on its
domestic agenda.
The catalyst for the current dispute was the murder 12 days ago of an
officer at Clairvaux high security jail during a shoot-out in which seven
armed inmates escaped.
The Clairvaux killing followed a similar incident last month when an officer
at Rouen jail died after being attacked by a convict in a cell.
The government managed to end the first dispute by agreeing to the prison
officers' demands for more staff and better security. But the Clairvaux
shoot-out confirmed warders' worst fears about deteriorating security
standards in France's jails and the strikes and stoppages erupted again.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, and Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice
minister, immediately offered a formal review of the whole prison system.
They also promised to provide funds to improve security for prison staff.
But, this time, the government's softly-softly approach was not enough to
assuage the warders' fears.
Prison staff have good cause to be frightened. The murders at Rouen and
Clairvaux were part of a stream of violent incidents in France's overcrowded
jails. This month alone there have been two heists in which helicopters
landed on prison roofs to whisk away would-be escapees. One succeeded, the
other did not.
The latest Paris-Match magazine features a picture of a Clairvaux inmate
toting a pistol which, he claimed, was smuggled into the prison for him.
The French government last week underlined the severity of the problem by
launching an official investigation into the illegal trafficking of arms in
jails.
The violence is the product of the steady growth of the prison population,
which has more than doubled in size over the past 20 years to 50,000
detainees crammed into jails built for 45,000. The system is run by 18,000
prison staff at a ratio of one officer to every three inmates.
Prison staff claim that this ratio is too high given that the overcrowding
problem has been aggravated by an increase in jail violence. This reflects
the rise in violent crime and also the sharp increase in the number of
long-serving inmates since the French abolition of the death penalty in
1981.
The official report into the Clairvaux shoot-out described the prison
population as 'angry, desperate and ready for anything'.
Faced with this explosive situation, the prison officers' unions are asking
the government to hire 2,500 more staff. The government has created 530 new
jobs since the Rouen killing and has promised to more, pending completion of
the review.
But after the collapse of last week's negotiations the government invoked
its power to suspend striking warders who, as public servants, are not
allowed to strike.
The prison unions are refusing to resume negotiations until the suspensions
are rescinded. The government has responded by saying that it will not give
in to threats.
In the meantime police unions are protesting against the use of their
members in prisons, local police cells are filling up with detainees and
conditions within the jails are worsening, thereby increasing pressure on
the government to end the dispute.

FT  23 SEP 92 / EC laws 'causing big water bills'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL legislation by the EC has caused water bills across Europe to
soar and most Europeans now pay more for water than North Americans,
according to a report published yesterday.
The survey of 1992 water prices in 12 countries by National Utility Services
(NUS), a consultancy firm, comes after months of debate between the UK water
industry and its regulators over rises in water bills.
European water companies are now facing the burden of complying with EC
environmental legislation on drinking and bathing water standards passed in
the 1980s, and in many cases part of the costs has been passed to
households.
The highest jump in 1992 water prices was in Belgium, according to the
report, which calculates that the price of water rose by 48 per cent. That
outstripped increases in the Netherlands and Norway of 22 per cent, and of
12 per cent in the UK.
In that year, Canada and the US saw rises of only 8 per cent. Increases in
France, Finland, Germany, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland were even
lower, and Australia saw a rise of only 0.3 per cent.
However, countries which have suffered high price rises do not always have
the most expensive water, says NUS. Of the countries surveyed, Germany has
the highest prices at just over 78 pence per cubic metre.
The report comments that 'the modernisation of eastern Germany has
contributed to the high prices and it is likely that water prices will
continue to rise sharply'.
Germany ranked ahead of Australia at 72 pence, Belgium at 67 pence, France
and the Netherlands at around 60 pence, and the UK at 54 pence. The US,
Norway and Canada, with prices between 19 pence and 25 pence, were the
cheapest.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA plans to create a national regulatory body independent of the central
bank to oversee its burgeoning securities markets which have frequently been
hit by turmoil.
Nie Qingping, chief of the stock market regulation division of the People's
Bank, China's central bank, told Reuters in Hong Kong that a Securities
Management Committee would soon be established. It would be fully
independent of the People's Bank and have independent authority to regulate
China's stock markets.
There are two stock markets in China, one located in Shanghai and the other
in Shenzhen special economic zone to the north of Hong Kong. Chinese cities
from Dalian in the north to Guangzhou in the south are competing for the
central government's approval to open a third exchange.
Nie said the committee would be modelled on western regulatory bodies, such
as the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Its central task would be to
bring measured development to China's financial markets.
'The most important thing is to build on what we have in Shanghai and
Shenzhen and to continue improving the way the stock markets perform,' he
said.
In August the city of Shenzhen was overrun by 1m would-be investors who
rioted when they were frustrated in buying application forms to participate
in new share offerings. Allegations of official corruption were widespread,
leading senior municipal officials to make public self-criticisms.
China's accounting guidelines are elementary, although Chinese companies'
desire to raise foreign capital has meant adoption by some of international
accountancy standards.
In July, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission, the corporate
watchdog, issued a warning to potential investors in Chinese quoted
companies. It reminded them that little investor protection existed in China
and that Chinese companies were not required to register a prospectus with
regulators in Hong Kong.

Xinhua predicted a younger look for China's leadership. 'The congress will

are expected to be elected into the new CPC Central Committee,' it said.
The Central Committee sets out the party's course between congresses. The

FT  23 SEP 92 / Car output fall worst since 1974
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese car industry, which has been the leading force in the world
industry for most of the last decade, suffered its worst month since 1974
last month, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.
Output in August fell by 12.7 per cent from the year before to 790,678 cars,
the largest annual fall since 1974 at the height of the first oil shock when
production plunged 16.3 per cent that August.
Car makers are facing a problem of overcapacity as domestic demand dips and
investments in new plant, which were planned during the boom of the late
1980s, come on stream.
The stall in the industry casts a shadow over much of the rest of
manufacturing.
Production of passenger cars fell by 11.2 per cent to 595,826 units, the
worst decline for five years. Larger models which had resisted the recession
succumbed in August registering a 3 per cent fall.
Mini-car production fell by 11.5 per cent to 45,158 units and truck
production declined by 17.4 per cent to 190,932 units.
Output at Honda and Nissan fell over 20 per cent. At Nissan a 25 per cent
drop in domestic sales and a 16 per cent drop in exports was only slightly
offset by a 7 per cent increase in overseas production.
Toyota contained the cut in its production to 12.4 per cent and Suzuki
Motors raised output largely because production last year was at an
unusually low level.

<TEXT>
SPECTATORS queued for seats yesterday for the opening act of the Tokyo
Sagawa Kyubin trial, billed as the event that will topple the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party or as just another Japanese political farce.
Two former executives of Tokyo Sagawa, the parcel delivery company, are on
trial for breach of trust, having allegedly caused damages of Y95.2bn
(Pounds 435m) to the company by offering illegal loans to gang-run
businesses. A third man, the former president of a gang-linked property
company, faced similar charges.
But the real interest is whether the hearings will implicate leading
officials of the LDP, as Tokyo Sagawa was a prominent donor of political
funds and, according to prosecutors yesterday, acted as an intermediary
between the party and Inagawa-kai, the gangster group.
Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's self-proclaimed 'kingmaker' and head of the
party's largest faction, has admitted receiving Y500m from Mr Hiroyasu
Watanabe, former Tokyo Sagawa president and one of the three defendants
yesterday.
Prosecutors referred several times yesterday to a leading member of the LDP,
and without naming Mr Kanemaru, it was clear that they were referring to
him, a point made on Japanese news broadcasts last night.
In their opening address in the Tokyo district court, the prosecutors
alleged that a certain leading politician had received a substantial amount
of money from Tokyo Sagawa.
The prosecutors also referred to an incident in 1987, when the leading
politician allegedly sought the assistance of Mr Watanabe, through his
friendships with gang members, in silencing extreme-right groups, which were
then running a noisy and embarrassing campaign against the LDP.
It was clear that the prosecutors were putting pressure on Mr Kanemaru, who
quit as vice-president of the LDP last month, to either admit that he had
violated political funding laws or to at least submit himself to formal
questioning over the issue.
Since conceding that he received the Y500m, Mr Kanemaru has stayed at his
Tokyo home and refused to visit the prosecutor's office. Meanwhile, his
lawyers have negotiated with the prosecutors over whether a written
statement would suffice or whether he must appear in person.
The unusual stand-off suggests that the prosecutors may be content to pursue
Mr Kanemaru over the donation, but will leave unexplored some of the more
damaging allegations about the LDP's gang links. Even if the 'kingmaker' is
found guilty of that violation, he is liable to a maximum fine of only
Y200,000.
A more severe punishment faces Mr Watanabe and Mr Jun Saotome, former
managing director of Tokyo Sagawa, both of whom pleaded not guilty. However,
the third defendant, Mr Munenobu Shoji, former president of Hokusho Sangyo,
the gang-linked property company, admitted the charges.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Domestic economy shows no growth in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Japanese domestic economy was virtually stagnant in the second quarter
of this year, according to a clutch of official figures published yesterday.
Domestic demand did not grow between April and June, with only net export
growth and income from investments abroad pushing the economy to meagre
growth, according to figures published yesterday by the Economic Planning
Agency.
The stagnation in the domestic economy was confirmed by a government survey
of household spending in July which found the average household spent
Y347,025 (Pounds 1,570), unchanged from the same month last year.
Japan's gross domestic product grew by 0.2 per cent and gross national
product by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, only because the weakness of
the domestic economy was offset by external factors.
Economic growth in the short-term hinges on government spending and export
performance.
Growth in domestic demand was just below zero because higher government
investment, which rose by 7 per cent from the first quarter and a modest
upturn in the housing market, offset a 2.4 per cent cut in corporate
investment, a 20.5 per cent reduction in the rate of growth of inventories
and stagnant personal consumption.
Increased real net exports contributed 0.3 per cent to the overall growth
rate. However the growth in net exports was in large measure a reflection of
the weakness of the domestic economy because imports fell by 4.8 per cent, a
steeper decline than exports which were 3 per cent down.
The other external source of growth was income from investments abroad which
contributed 0.1 per cent of the GNP growth rate.
Domestic demand may have continued to be flat over the summer according to
the household spending survey by the Management and Co-ordination Agency
which found average household spending, before adjusting for inflation, rose
by 1.5 per cent in July compared with a year before. With official estimates
of inflation running at about 2 per cent, this means real spending is likely
to have fallen.
Spending on housing rose by about 2.9 per cent mainly because of rent
increases. Parents' spending on their children's education has been
protected from the recession, with a 3 per cent increase. However one sign
of how deep the downturn is starting to bite into family budgets was a 4.9
per cent fall in spending on shoes and clothes and a 0.4 per cent cut in
spending on food.
Spending is falling even though the Japanese 'salaryman' is yet to suffer a
significant cut in his income. Incomes for salaried workers rose 6.3 per
cent in the year to July, compared with a 1.8 per cent cut in incomes for
manufacturing workers mainly because of lower bonuses and less overtime.

<TEXT>
MR Harshad Mehta, the 'Big Bull' broker at the centre of India's worst
financial scandal, was freed on bail of Rs1m (Pounds 20,700) yesterday after
110 days in jail, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Justice M L Dudhat of the Bombay High Court ordered Mr Mehta released after
his lawyers claimed he was being detained illegally in the Dollars 1.2bn
scandal.
Supporters of the 37-year-old brash and flamboyant broker, who was India's
highest personal taxpayer before his arrest in June, burst into applause as
the judge ordered the release.
Mr Mehta - who faces eight separate charges of currency violations, fraud
and bribery - has become something of a cult figure as the broker who helped
fuel India's most dramatic rise in share prices.
Following his arrest, posters appeared on buildings in Bombay and Calcutta
supporting Mr Mehta. He claims he was being unfairly singled out to take the
blame for the scandal involving leading banks and securities traders. In an
interview published yesterday, Mr Mehta claimed that 80 per cent of trading
in the Indian securities market violated central bank regulations.
His release is expected to boost the Bombay stock market, which crashed
following exposure of the scandal in April.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Taiwan sidles in as Fujian heeds Deng's call: Angus Foster
visits Xiamen special economic zone and reports on how it is making ground
on Shenzhen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JANUARY Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, chose to relaunch
economic reform from Shenzhen, the special economic zone across from Hong
Kong. But his call to 'be bolder still', a fitting symbol for the end of of
China's three-year austerity programme, was equally felt further up the
coast in Fujian, the province which looks out onto Taiwan, and in its own
special economic zone of Xiamen.
Industrial output in Xiamen increased 14 per cent in the first half of the
year, slightly below Shenzhen. But Xiamen has always been a poor relation
and Shenzhen was able to rely on Hong Kong's infrastructure.
Like Guangdong before it, Fujian is being transformed by overseas Chinese
investors who are finding their own countries no longer compete in
processing and labour intensive industries. Taiwanese companies are
increasingly visible, following their government's 1987 decision to allow
indirect investment in China. Fujian appeals because the same Chinese
dialect is spoken and more than half of Taiwanese people claim it as their
ancestral home.
Lu Gongnan, chief of the Xinglin investment zone near Xiamen, said one in
four of the zone's 50,000 urban population works for a foreign investor and
20 more factories - making products for export ranging from garments to
computers - are being built.
Xiamen officials say their policy of liang di, yi gao, or keeping wages and
charges low and quality high, is attracting foreigners. According to
businessmen, average wages of 350 renminbi yuan (Pounds 36.50) a month for
factory workers and 1,000 yuan for technicians are about 10 times less than
in Taiwan. Industrial land prices, which are fixed by the government at 140
yuan a square metre, are several hundred times lower.
Foreign investment totals are sketchy because some investors hide their
place of origin for political or business reasons. Actual investment also
often falls below promised investment. Hong Kong companies are still
probably the largest investors in Fujian, but some are fronts for Taiwanese
seeking anonymity. Mr Han Qinghai, at Xiamen University's Taiwan research
institute, estimated Taiwan has invested Dollars 1.2bn in Fujian, half of
which is in Xiamen, and Dollars 3.6bn in China as a whole. A fair proportion
is probably speculative.
China's renewed emphasis on reform has helped increase Fujian's project
approvals for the first half of the year by 300 per cent to more than
Dollars 1bn. In Xiamen, approvals are up 75 per cent, to bring total
promised foreign investment to Dollars 1.2bn. Along the coast, Fuzhou, the
provincial capital, Quanzhou, an emerging port and Putian, self styled as
China's 'shoe city' because it is home to Nike's Taiwanese sub-contractors,
are all registering double digit economic growth and even higher foreign
investment. Fuqing, recently approved as a foreign investment zone, may also
take off if Mr Liem Sioe Liong, an Indonesian Chinese, goes ahead with
reported plans to invest in infrastructure and industrial projects.
The central shopping district of Xiamen has started to resemble those in
Guangdong. Hotels built for foreign investors are sometimes full. Graduates
are once again leaving prized jobs in government ministries for the private
sector.
Rapid economic growth is bringing familiar problems. Investors complain
Xiamen's infrastructure is not keeping pace with the changes. Many factories
are sending goods by road to Shenzhen, even though it increases transport
costs 30 per cent, rather than use Xiamen's congested port.
Taiwan's underground gangs are also believed to be investing in Fujian.
Several Xiamen residents said they fear new-found commercialism is
undermining traditional, socialist values.
Neither have China's old problems been solved. Mr Deng's call for bolder
reform will again switch attention away from the woefully inefficient state
owned sector. In Xiamen, this accounted for 40 per cent of industrial output
last year, and a higher proportion of government revenues, but continues to
make unwanted products.
Wage inflation has increased to 10 per cent, although wages in
foreign-invested factories are kept lower by importing workers from poorer,
inland provinces. Nevertheless, most economists agree China's urban
inflation rate, which topped 40 per cent in the late 1980s and contributed
to the Tiananmen Square protests, will emerge as a problem again.
But two trends, which again mirror developments in Guangdong, suggest Fujian
is undergoing lasting, structural adjustment. Foreign investment is moving
away from the hub of Xiamen in search of better incentives or lower wages.
Second, investment has started to flow into tertiary industries like finance
and leisure. Eight foreign banks, mainly from Hong Kong, have established
branches in Xiamen. Citibank and Dai-ichi Kangyo have representative
offices. Taiwanese banks are still prohibited from dealing direct with
China.
Two foreign-invested golf courses are being built and foreign funds,
especially from the Philippines, have flowed into the still poorly developed
private real estate market. One official, decrying this 'real estate fever',
said private land prices have risen by 500 per cent in some areas,
reflecting the market's inefficiencies as well as a renewed taste for
speculation.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UN burden too heavy, says Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations risks being saddled with too heavy a burden of
intervention and peace-keeping as the nations of the world were trying to
build a stronger system of collective security, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British
foreign secretary, told the United Nations General Assembly yesterday.
Mr Hurd, current president of the European Community's Council of Ministers,
said governments should realise that the new emphasis on collective
peace-keeping and peace-making would require restructuring of armed forces
and 'a massive increase' in the funds which the UN and its humanitarian
agencies would require from member states. Moreover, these new demands were
being made at a time when many member states faced severe budgetary
problems.
Expressing full support both for the ideas put forward by Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general, in his 'Agenda for Peace' earlier this
year, and US President George Bush's latest initiative to strengthen the
UN's peace-keeping work, Mr Hurd said that 'preventive diplomacy' was the
best way to deal with the world organisation's increasing work-load.
The UN secretary-general should be ready to make full use of his powers to
draw the attention of the Security Council to any matter which in his
opinion might threaten international peace and security. Greater use was
being made of fact-finding missions and the EC wanted to encourage this.
Mr Hurd said preventive deployment of troops might take place to deter
aggression or conflict between states.
Supporting Mr Boutros Ghali's proposal for a peace-keeping reserve fund, Mr
Hurd said that, at the end of August, the EC had provided 40 per cent of
contributions collected for various new peace-keeping operations since the
end of the last General Assembly.
Russia yesterday proposed installing 'hot-lines' between the world's
capitals and UN headquarters, regular intelligence briefings for the
secretary-general and greater use of fact-finding missions to enhance the
United Nations capacity to head off conflicts, Michael Littlejohns reports
from New York.
In a speech to the General Assembly, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign
minister, said that when political means failed 'force may and should be
used' to separate the warring sides.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Patten hint on airport finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, hinted yesterday he was losing
patience over finance for the colony's airport project, Simon Holberton
reports. Hong Kong's main Chinese and English language newspapers have
carried reports that China would reject Mr Patten's revised financing plans
for settling the six-month dispute.
Mr Patten said that it was not possible to work indefinitely on new plans
for China to consider. One which maximised Hong Kong's ability to raise debt
had been rejected and now an alternative means of funding the HKDollars
167.3bn (Pounds 12.7bn) project was in doubt.
The reports, believed to emanate from a senior official of the Xinhua News
Agency in the colony, said China objected to using funds from land sales for
the project.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Adjusting the numbers to meet new standards
 -The effect of the change in accounting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIGURES in the accounts of many leading quoted British companies will
change substantially as the proposals of the Accounting Standards Board
(ASB) are put into place, according to a detailed analysis released by James
Capel.
Reported earnings, cash flow multiples and unconsolidated subsidiaries are
among the factors which will change most. Others likely to be affected under
existing proposals will concern companies with intangible assets on their
balance sheets and goodwill as a significant proportion of net asset values.
The firm already sees signs of change. It estimates that about half of the
leading quoted companies have already adopted the first financial reporting
standard, which deals with the cash flow statement and became mandatory for
financial year ends after March 23 this year.
Capel is calculating a cash flow per share figure based on the net cash
inflow from operations shown in the cash flow statement, adding returns on
investment and the servicing of finance, excluding dividends to ordinary
shareholders, and subtracting tax paid.
That includes capitalised interest and explicitly excludes cash generated
from asset disposals. The result is to cause a substantial change from the
cash flow figures Capel has traditionally produced using the old source and
application of funds statement.
The old statement gives British Petroleum a cash flow of Pounds 3.1bn and a
cash flow per share of 58p in 1991, for example. The new figures are now
Pounds 2.6bn and 48p respectively.
The second financial reporting standard introduced by the ASB ratifies
changes in the 1989 Companies Act which deals with subsidiaries. The
standard generally tightens the requirement for groups to consolidate
companies even if they own less than 50 per cent of the equity.
Capel says Rothmans, Boots and BOC have already disclosed subsidiaries which
were previously treated as associated companies. Based on the last set of
accounts for Next, including its credit card subsidiary Club 24, would
increase liabilities on the balance sheet from Pounds 447m to Pounds 801m.
Fred 1, the ASB exposure draft on the structure of the profit and loss
account, will bring about a number of changes, notably generating far more
year-by-year variation in reported earnings by effectively abolishing
extraordinary items.
It will also have the effect of reducing the scope for companies to take
profits on disposals through the profit and loss account. Capel cites Taylor
Woodrow, which has included in its disposal profits a transfer from the
revaluation reserve, so that it is effectively writing the property back
down to original cost before calculating disposal profit.
In the case of the company's 1991 results, releasing a revaluation reserve
of Pounds 19.1m had the effect of reducing pre-tax losses from Pounds 21.8m
to Pounds 2.7m. That will no longer be possible if Fred 1 becomes a standard
as planned later this year.
Gazing into the crystal ball at future ASB standards under discussion, Capel
identifies a number of issues which will cause substantial changes in
financial reporting for manycompanies
Goodwill: it says its 'best guess' is that the ASB will try to adopt the
common international practice of capitalising goodwill as an intangible
asset and amortising it over its useful life, but possibly without
systematic write-offs.
Since goodwill was required to be disclosed in the mid-1980s, it shows that
it has grown to represent up to 400 per cent of the net asset value of
Carlton Communications, 310 per cent for Emap, 300 per cent for Williams and
280 per cent for GrandMet.
It stresses that it is very unlikely the ASB would make its rulings
retrospective, but illustrates the impact of change. If goodwill was
amortised over 20 years as a proportion of earnings per share, it would be
as high as 159 per cent for Burton, 95 per cent for Cookson and 81 per cent
for Carlton
Intangibles: the ASB is considering whether intangible assets such as brands
should be included on balance sheets, and if so, how they should be valued.
This still only significantly affects 12 companies, with Reed International
the most important: intangibles of Pounds 1.67bn represent 122 per cent of
the net asset value of the group.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits: which are being reviewed by
both the ASB and its urgent issues task force. Companies with significant
possible liabilities include Shell at Pounds 350m-Pounds 520m, BP at Pounds
170m-Pounds 250m and Unilever at Pounds 140m-Pounds 190m.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate advances 7% to Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE depressed property market, Brixton Estate, the investment and
development company, turned in pre-tax profits ahead 7 per cent at Pounds
12.6m for the six months to June 30.
The bulk of the company's revenue comes from letting its properties; rental
income was up 9 per cent at Pounds 24.9m.
'The vacancy rate for the company's property portfolio remains at about 7
per cent, and in the City of London, which is probably the most difficult
area, I am pleased to report that all of our buildings are fully occupied,'
said Mr Harry Axton, chairman.
Earnings per share were up to 5.64p (5.2p) and the interim dividend is
increased to 3p (2.9p). Mr Axton plans to retire as chairman after next
year's annual meeting. He is succeeded by Mr Douglas Gardner.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brake Bros edges ahead to Pounds 7.12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Brake Bros yesterday rose 21p to 370p as the supplier of frozen
foods to the catering trade announced pre-tax profits up 2.5 per cent to
Pounds 7.12m in the first half of 1992.
The advance was struck on turnover ahead 22 per cent, from Pounds 103.5m to
Pounds 126.4m.
Mr Frank Brake, managing director, said that the margin slippage derived
mainly from recent acquisitions - Midfish, WH Hooper, Everfresh and London
Larder - which contributed about Pounds 13m to the turnover increase but
little to profits.
Mr Brake said that Everfresh and London Larder, which had taken the group
into chilled foods, had contributed about Pounds 7m to turnover. So long as
the more complex and regulated handling can be overcome, he said, margins in
chilled foods should be higher than in frozen.
Since the UK acquisitions, Brake has spent a little over Pounds 4m on two
French frozen foods companies in March and August - its first venture across
the Channel.
Mr Brake said that it was the group's policy to understand that market and
expand the operation first, before moving into other territories.
Acquisitions, Mr Brake said, were financed by cash resources and borrowings.
The latter rose from Pounds 2m to Pounds 6m giving gearing of 15 per cent.
Net interest charges rose to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 259,000).
During the half, the group spent Pounds 4.2m on new cold stores and
distribution facilities in Somerset, which started operations in July, and
Hertfordshire, opening in the autumn. Some Pounds 1.4m went on the motor
fleet, Pounds 1.3m on the development of food processing facilities, and
Pounds 700,000 on a satellite depot in Bodmin, Cornwall. In all, capital
expenditure totalled Pounds 9.1m.
Operating profits increased some 7 per cent to Pounds 7.68m (Pounds 7.21m).
To partially redress the balance between the interim and final dividends,
the former is lifted 12 per cent to 1.85p (1.65p), payable from earnings of
10.3p (10.1p) per share.
COMMENT
Underlying sales growth of about 10 per cent suggests that Brake is picking
up market share, possibly from some of the smaller operators which are
finding things hard in a tough market made yet tougher by recent barrages of
new safety regulations post-Currie. It has performed well against the
market. Its diversification appears prudent and unhurried: in chilled foods,
it has taken a careful approach, waiting for the expected higher margins to
come through; and in France much the same story. Forecasts for the full year
range from Pounds 16m to Pounds 16.3m, giving earnings of between 23.3p and
23.8p and multiples of 15.5 to 15.8. If the market has moved away from
recovery plays and the earlier fall in its share price was overplayed, then
the shares are looking cheap. However, as a defensive stock and compared
with the grocery multiples, they look dear.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TT moves up 10% to Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the industrial holding company, managed to increase interim
pre-tax profits by 10 per cent in spite of its UK dependence.
Profit rose from Pounds 6.77m to Pounds 7.47m on turnover static at Pounds
78.6m. Operating profit advanced by 3 per cent to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds
8.54m), while interest costs were reduced to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 1.77m).
Although the group is noted for its acquisitiveness - and is having talks
with loss-making AB Electronics - these figures were virtually unaffected by
recent purchases.
Magnetic Materials, finally acquired this summer after a hostile bid fell
short last year, is expected to have a neutral effect on the second half.
Before that, the last significant acquisition was Crystalate, a maker of
electronic components, in 1990. Mr Nicholas Shipp, director, said further
improvements had been achieved by continuing to weed out low margin
business.
Although there was no divisional breakdown, the industrial division, which
includes Crystalate and last year accounted for 62 per cent of sales, showed
the best growth.
A slight improvement was achieved by the packaging division. Beatson Clark
increased efficiency with the help of new plant. Building services, a much
smaller operation, suffered falls in both sales and profit.
Mr Shipp said that after a share placing that raised Pounds 6.88m, and
expanded the equity by about 5 per cent, gearing fell below 20 per cent at
the half-way stage. At the year-end it was 25 per cent on net debt of about
Pounds 17m. The MMG acquisition had added Pounds 7m to debt, taking gearing
into the high 20s.
The group currently holds stakes of about 7 per cent in both AB Electronics
and ML Holdings, a manufacturer in aerospace and electronics. Talks with the
latter were not active.
Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 6.9p (6.5p). The interim dividend is
2.4p (2.2p).
COMMENT
It is no mean achievement for an industrial company with nearly three
quarters of its sales in the UK to keep profits and earnings per share
moving ahead. Yesterday's 1p rise in the share price to 198p looks a bit
churlish and does little to recover the ground lost since the late May peak
of 239p. The explanation seems to lie in anticipation of more paper being
issued for the next acquisition; in a quibble about the gearing position
(eventually accounting standards might dictate that the Pounds 10m of
preference shares are treated as debt); and in doubts about the quality of
the product portfolio. The first and third questions are partly answered by
TT's track record in turning acquisitions round, which includes dealing
ruthlessly with poor-margin turnover. The accounting change is some way out
and would affect many. Pre-tax profit is forecast to rise to Pounds 16.2m
for the full year, compared with Pounds 14.6m. On a prospective p/e of 12.5,
the shares look moderately priced. Although acquisitive mini-conglomerates
are not to everyone's taste, there looks to be scope for an improved rating.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Moratorium agreed on nuclear dumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on a new international treaty to curb sea pollution finally
ended yesterday in Paris with an agreement for a 15-year moratorium on
dumping radioactive waste.
The Convention on Marine Pollution will be signed later this week by the 12
countries bordering the north-east Atlantic, which had been sharply divided
until late on Monday night over the radioactivity issue.
Britain and France, which need to decommission old nuclear submarines and
power stations in the next two decades, retain the right to dump low and
intermediate radioactive waste in the sea after 2007.
But they must continue to study land-based alternatives and report the
results every two years from 1997 to the other signatories - Belgium,
Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
After 15 years, Britain and France would still not be able dump radioactive
waste without discussing it with other signatories and producing studies
assessing the potential harm to people and marine life.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday: 'There is not yet any
proven land-based alternative and it may be that disposal at sea will
represent the best environmental practice.'
The alternatives of demolition and storage might also present health risks,
it had commented earlier.
A solution to the impasse on Monday, when Finland, Iceland and Spain were
set on a permanent ban, came when the UK agreed to extend its original offer
of a 10-year ban to 15 years.
Mr Bob Edwards of Greenpeace France, the environment pressure group, said:
'In the end the UK and France made the right decision, although we still
think they should have accepted a permanent ban.'
The rest of the treaty, which has been overshadowed by the nuclear issue,
includes commitments to reduce discharges of other toxic substances and
heavy metals, with the aim of eventually eliminating some of them.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'The convention has
shown some limited progress, but I am alarmed that there are no timescales
agreed for the reduction of polluting materials.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / Zero to 130,000 in weeks: The implications of Nissans' rapid
production of cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NISSAN car assembly plant at Sunderland will reach its planned full
production of 130,000 Nissan Micra cars a year by mid November, only 14
weeks after the first Micra was completed.
The Japanese car maker says that is the fastest production build-up for a
new model achieved in the motor industry in Europe.
Nissan's rivals Honda and Toyota start up their first European plants in
coming weeks - also in the UK. Nissan lags behind Toyota and Honda in north
America and behind Toyota in Japan, but it has stolen a significant march on
its Japanese rivals in Europe.
While Honda and Toyota will still be feeling their way at their Swindon and
Derby assembly plants next year with slow rates of climb in output, Nissan
is planning to raise its UK production to 270,000 cars in 1993 from 175,000
this year and 125,000 in 1991.
European car makers are watching the development of the Pounds 900m
Sunderland plant with a mixture of fascination and trepidation. Nissan is
setting new standards for productivity and efficiency, which are unmatched
in the European industry and already bear comparison with some of the best
plants in Japan.
Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), claims
that 'on quality we are as good as any volume car plant in Japan. On
productivity we are around the middle of the Japanese league table, but we
are in the top half.'
International comparisons of car plant productivity offer a minefield of
complications - no two plants are the same, model specifications differ
widely and the level of integration in the manufacturing operation can vary
hugely.
But, step by step, the motor industry is becoming more used to shared
definitions for the 'hours per car' expended in the production process.
Whatever the argument over details, Nissan's claimed achievements are
alarming for its European competitors.
Mr Gibson says Nissan requires 12.5 hours per car for its Primera large
family car and 10.5 hours for the new Micra supermini. The hours measure
so-called direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and
assembly parts of the operation, a group of processes that are becoming
established as a standard definition in measuring car plant productivity.
However car makers differ on how they measure hours in their own plants, the
size of the competitive gap is startling for European producers trying to
catch up on Japanese rivals.
Mr Gibson says the 'best of the Europeans' need about 20 hours a car for the
Primera's competitors - such as the Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Sierra, Peugeot
405 and Volkswagen Passat. The average in Europe may be closer to 30.
The start-up of production of a second car range at Sunderland shows that
Nissan's European facilities are much more sophisticated than the
'screwdriver plant' once feared by the European industry.
In addition to a fully fledged car plant with metal stamping, body welding,
paint shop and final assembly, the Sunderland site includes engine machining
and assembly, an aluminium casting plant and a plastics blow moulding plant.
Nissan's workforce has climbed to 4,600, but the total at the site,
including suppliers for components such as seats and some pressed metal
parts exceeds 6,000.
Component suppliers have begun to cluster around the facility - Nissan lists
27 automotive suppliers in the north-east of England, compared with three
when it arrived in 1986. The proximity of suppliers allows Nissan to take
'just-in-time' supply of components to the plant a stage further to what it
calls 'synchronous supply' - some parts are only delivered to the assembly
line just as they are needed.
For example, supply of carpets for the Micra has been cut to a stockholding
of just 10 minutes - carpet pieces are delivered by Sommer Allibert, the
French supplier, from its nearby plant to the Nissan assembly line in
sequence for fitting to the correct model. There are only 42 minutes between
the part being ordered to it being made, delivered and fitted to the car.
Nissan claims that Sunderland has shaved its average inventory for
European-originated parts to 1.6 days, five times better than the next best
in Europe and well ahead of the industry average of 20 days. The target next
year is to get the figure down to one day.
All carmakers are buying a growing share of components from outside
suppliers, but the Nissan plant is already at a high level, with 75 per cent
of the cost of the car going on outside component makers.
Nissan expects to spend Pounds 850m in Europe next year on component
purchases - compared with Pounds 240m worth of components (including freight
and insurance) to be bought largely from suppliers in Japan. Transmissions,
engine blocks and fasteners are the most important items still imported from
Japan. Nissan's component purchases in Europe have climbed from Pounds 220m
in 1990 to Pounds 575m this year.
It now has a network of 195 suppliers in Europe of which only 12 are wholly
owned Japanese companies or joint ventures with Japanese producers.
The Micra will have a European content - by the government's formula of
factory gate price minus the value of non-European components - of more than
80 per cent.
The original Micra design concept came from Japan, but Mr Gibson claims that
more than half of the design and development for the car to be built and
sold in Europe was carried out by the company's European R&amp;D operation and
Nissan expects that by 1996-97 about 60 per cent of its forecast European
passenger vehicle sales (cars, four-wheel drive leisure vehicles and
multi-purpose vehicles) of 700,000 will be built in the UK or Spain. It
forecasts that vehicle sales this year will be 550,000 to 560,000.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Ford's short-time working extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, Britain's leading vehicle manufacturer, is to extend short-time
working at its three British assembly plants at least until the end of next
month in response to disappointing sales in the UK and weakening demand from
export markets.
It has also reduced output at its assembly plants at Saarlouis and Cologne
in Germany as well as its Spanish plant at Valencia, while extending
short-time working at its Belgian plant at Genk.
The company has already warned that it sees no sign of improvement in UK new
car demand and 'no indication of any real recovery before mid 1993.'
It has also lowered sales forecasts for several other markets including
Italy, Spain and France. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain,
yesterday welcomed the cut in UK interest rates as 'a prudent first step'.
The reduction should 'help to stabilise consumer confidence after the
turbulence of last week', he said. Further cuts would be welcome if they
could be achieved 'without triggering too rapid a fall in sterling'.
Ford's assembly plants at Dagenham, Essex, and Halewood, Merseyside,
together with its Southampton van plant, have been on short-time working for
much of the time since the summer shutdown. The plants will in effect move
to three-day weeks next month.
Ford of Britain said yesterday that about 10,000 workers in the UK would be
affected by the cuts next month which would reduce production by about
12,000 vehicles.
For four weeks from the end of this month, Ford will work a four-day week at
its Halewood plant, which produces the Escort-Orion range, by eliminating
the single Friday shift. There will be no output in the final week of
October.
At the Dagenham plant, which produces the Fiesta and which has been
exporting more than half of its output, the plant will be on a three-day
week for five weeks from next Monday.
In the UK, Rover has also introduced a four-day week on its Rover 200/400
assembly line at its plant in Longbridge, Birmingham, until the week
beginning October 26, cutting production by 7,000 cars. Mini and Metro lines
are on a three-day week until November, cutting output by 4,000 cars.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Two in three mothers work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST two thirds of women with dependent children are in work or seeking
work, according to the 1991 General Household Survey, released today.
The survey shows that single people living on their own account for more
than a quarter of households in Britain, and that 70 per cent of parents
with children under five use some form of child care.
The figures are among preliminary results from the survey released today by
the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys.
The survey, the most authoritative guide to households in Great Britain, is
based on interviews with 19,229 adults in 9,955 households.
The size of the average household in Great Britain has decreased from 2.91
in 1971 to 2.48 last year. That has largely been caused by the increasing
numbers of single-person households, up from 17 per cent in 1971 to 26 per
cent last year.
The growth in one-person households is caused partly by the ageing of the
population: just over 60 per cent of these single-person households
consisted of an adult aged 60 or over.
The most common type of household is a married or cohabiting couple with no
dependent children - 36 per cent. A quarter of households consist of two
adults with dependent children and 9 per cent are single-parent families.
The average number of children in homes of all types with dependent children
has remained stable throughout the 1980s at 1.8.
The proportion working or seeking work among women of working age with
children has increased from 49 per cent in 1973 to 63 per cent last year.
The increase is even more marked for those with a child under five: up from
27 per cent in 1973 to 47 per cent last year.
The survey shows the importance of child care for families with children: 28
per cent of parents with children aged between five and 11 used some form of
child care during the year, including school holidays and term time. For
those with children under five, the figure was 70 per cent.
The commonest form of child care for children under five is nursery school
(21 per cent), followed by unpaid family and friends (20 per cent), private
or voluntary schemes (14 per cent) and a paid child minder or nanny (9 per
cent). Only 1 per cent used child care at work.
Ownership of consumer durables has continued to rise in spite of the
recession, according to the survey.
The biggest year-on-year rise was for compact disc players - 27 per cent of
British households owned one last year, up from 21 per cent in 1990. There
were further surges in ownership levels for video recorders and microwave
ovens: 68 per cent owned a video (64 per cent in 1990) and 55 per cent a
microwave (50 per cent in 1990).
Ownership remained static for cars (67 per cent), washing machines (87 per
cent) and televisions (98 per cent). However, there was a further switch to
colour TVs from black and white (down from 5 per cent to 4 per cent).
There was a small, but not statistically significant, rise in the number of
households owning a personal computer - from 20 per cent in 1990 to 21 per
cent last year.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Abu Dhabi issues documents in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce In-ternational, said yesterday that it had released
19,000 important BCCI documents to US investigators and had invited US
officials to visit Abu Dhabi in the next two months.
The pledge of co-operation - which Congressional critics claimed was part of
a public-relations campaign by Abu Dhabi aimed at deflecting past criticism
 -comes days before the expected publication of a long BCCI report by
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who has led Senate
investigations into the collapsed bank.
Abu Dhabi is also keen to make its case ahead of the publication of Lord
Justice Bingham's BCCI report in the UK.
However, the government of Abu Dhabi is not giving the BCCI documents to US
investigators. It is merely allowing the authorities to view the documents,
which are being held at the Washington Embassy of the United Arab Emirates.
Photocopies will not be permitted.
Among those who had previously claimed that Abu Dhabi had failed to provide
adequate co-operation in the BCCI case were the offices of Mr Kerry and of
Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney who last year brought
fraud charges against the bank.
Although Abu Dhabi has claimed it was 'the single biggest victim' of the
BCCI fraud, it is understood that its role has been under investigation by
Mr Morgenthau's office. Robinson, Lake, Lerer &amp; Montgomery, the Washington
public-relations firm that speaks for Abu Dhabi, said the documents were
being made available to officials of the US Department of Justice, the
Federal Reserve Board and the office of Mr Morgenthau.
Senator Kerry criticised Abu Dhabi's use of Robinson Lake in March because
Mr James Lake is also deputy manager of the campaign for the re-election of
President George Bush.
Senator Kerry has called on President Bush to dismiss Mr Lake, who serves as
a US adviser to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the key
investment vehicles used by Sheikh Zayed Sultan Nahyan to retain majority
control of BCCI.
Mr Lake's office dismissed Senator Kerry's criticism as 'election-year
politics' yesterday and denied that there was any conflict of interest in Mr
Lake's helping to manage the Bush campaign while being paid to represent
BCCI's biggest shareholder.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Accountant admits BCCI paper leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTANT working on the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into the
collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International leaked a highly
confidential document to make money by insider dealing, an Old Bailey jury
heard yesterday.
Mr Mark Braley, who had been seconded from Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte for
the BCCI probe, admitted supplying a paper relating to Control Securities, a
company central to the SFO's investigation, to his co-defendant Mr Bernard
Lynch, a freelance accountant.
Mr Braley agreed this had been 'thoroughly wrong', but denied that he had
ever intended to undermine the SFO's investigation by leaking the document.
He and Mr Lynch both deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice by
interfering with SFO files and passing on information relating to the
inquiry.
The paper, which outlined the SFO's lines of inquiry into the company, was
the most sensitive material available to him and he was prepared to leak it
for financial gain, Mr Braley told his counsel, Mr Vivien Robinson QC.
However, he was unaware Mr Lynch would make the paper available to The Times
newspaper. When, subsequently, Mr Braley took part in the raid on the
offices of Control Securities, he felt 'absolutely sick', he said.
He had not intended to prejudice the SFO investigation, he told Mr Robinson.
When he made an offer to Mr Michael Barrett, a solicitor acting for Mr Syed
Akbar, a former BCCI official arrested in connection with the SFO inquiry,
to 'contaminate' and 'deface' evidence, that had not been his intention but
part of a bluff, he said.
He had thought Mr Lynch, who had made contact with Mr Barrett, was working
for the SFO on a 'sting' operation to catch the solicitor.
Mr Braley was questioned by Mr Timothy Langdale QC, prosecuting, as to why,
in discussing BCCI at all with Mr Lynch, he had broken specific orders from
his SFO superiors not to discuss the inquiry with anyone outside the inquiry
team.
He had thought that was part of his job as an investigator, Mr Braley
replied. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, then the SFO director, had asked staff to
carry out more informal interviews, since too many had been carried out
using the SFO's Section 2 powers, which compel interviewees to give
evidence.
He had thought from that that talking to Mr Lynch was acceptable, but now
agreed he had been 'very wrong', he told the court.
The trial continues today.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Labour calls for banking review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party called for a thorough review of banking regulations
yesterday once the results of the inquiries into last year's collapse of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) are published.
A 600-page US Senate report on the BCCI affair is due to be published today
and is expected to be sharply critical of the role of the Bank of England.
A report by Lord Bingham into whether BCCI was supervised properly by the
Bank and the government is now likely to be published in the week beginning
October 19, when parliament reassembles for normal sittings - well after the
date originally set for publication.
It, too, is expected to be critical of the Bank's performance. Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, is to make a statement to MPs when the report, or as
much of it as possible, is published. The government has consistently said
it will not make public any part of the report that might prejudice criminal
trials.
Yesterday's move by Labour is an attempt to ensure that even if the Treasury
is not heavily censured by the Bingham report, ministers do not escape all
responsibility for the affair. It also forms a further element in the
opposition's attack on Mr John Major's record as chancellor before he became
prime minister.
Labour claims that when Mr Major answered an emergency question on the
inquiry in July last year, he promised to report personally to the Commons.
'I shall publish the inquiry and then answer for it before this House,' the
prime minister said then.
'Mr Major has hidden behind Mr Lamont for far too long: it is high time he
learnt to carry the can.
'We will not stand for his ducking behind Mr Lamont yet again,' Mr Alistair
Darling, an opposition treasury spokesman, said yesterday.
He said that confidence in the UK banking system had been severely eroded.
Ministers should immediately set in motion a review of the working of the
Banking Act 1987, to ensure that 'regulation under the Bank is not a paper
exercise but provides a guarantee of effective regulation and protection for
customers and investors alike'.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (1): Centre of attention -
Atlanta and the state of Georgia are among the US's most dynamic centres.
Recession has meant job losses, but the award of the 1996 Olympics reflects
continuing confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next four years much of the commercial and political life of
Georgia, and its capital Atlanta, will be dominated by the fact that in 1996
Atlanta will play host to the Olympic Games. For a brief few weeks it will
become the centre of global attention.
It is a measure of how far Atlanta has come in the past 30 years -
economically, politically, socially and culturally - that its bid for the
games was successful. in the 1950s it was but one of several large,
provincial cities in the backward and racially divided American south.
Today it is the undisputed economic capital of the region, with a well
deserved reputation for harmonious race relations. Its post-modern skyline,
huge airport, efficient motorway network, underground railway and shopping
malls have made it the pre-eminent symbol of the economic rise of the 'New
South'.
But the coming of the Olympics also points up several intertwined social and
political problems facing both the metropolis and Georgia. And the games
highlight the distance Atlanta yet has to travel to the goal it proclaimed
for itself a decade ago - that of becoming the 'next great international
city'.
This is a vague concept, but its essential ingredients would appear to
include the economic dynamism, self-assured character, cultural
sophistication and global communications links necessary to attract foreign
investors and overseas visitors in huge numbers.
There is no doubting Atlanta's economic dynamism. The metropolis boomed
uninterruptedly from around 1977 to 1990 as the south-east enjoyed growth
much faster than the national average, thanks to migration from other parts
of the US, lower resource and labour costs and its spanking new
infrastructure.
The region is now emerging with painful slowness from a severe, 18-month
recession. Still, most economists expect both Atlanta and Georgia to enjoy a
growth level in the 1990s somewhat better than the national average even
though the boom times of the 1980s may not return.
The communications infrastructure of the metropolitan area is also
impressive, as befits a city which has been careful to remember it owes its
origins to a felicitous geographical position, at the foot of the
Appalachian Mountains, making it an important 19th century railway centre.
Arguably the most crucial single factor in the post-war Atlanta boom was the
city's recognition that it needed to reinforce its position as a
communications hub by repeatedly expanding Hartsfield airport, now one of
the largest and most modern in the world.
To that has been added a system of freeways and a fibre optic
telecommunications network that could prove as important to the city in the
21st century as air transport has been in the 20th.
Culturally too, Atlanta has come a long way. Its sky-line is now one of the
more architecturally interesting in the US; it has numerous fine
restaurants; the permanent collection in its High Museum of Art, opened nine
years ago, may not be of the finest, but its periodic exhibitions are
stimulatingly original.
None of this means Atlanta can yet rival New York, Chicago or Los Angeles in
sophistication. But time and money may eventually do the trick. What is more
in question is Atlanta's personality and self-assurance, an issue underlined
by controversy over the cartoon mascot the city has chosen as its Olympic
symbol - a jolly, worm-like blue blob.
Its promoters say the blob has the advertising advantage of being able to
assume myriad different shapes. Opponents argue that this is precisely its
weakness: it reinforces Atlanta's image as a faceless, money-grubbing centre
and fails to project what remains of its distinctive southern character.
Some observers argue that the city's doubts about its own character and
purpose are revealed by its tireless self-promotion and its sensitivity to
outside criticism. 'Atlanta is still trying to overcome an inferiority
complex of being southern,' says Professor David Sjoquist, of Georgia State
University. 'It always wants the biggest and the best.'
Paradoxically, however, it is Atlanta's achievement in defusing that
greatest of historic southern problems - the race question - which
constitutes one of its most important defining characteristics and
achievements.
Relations between the races are almost certainly far better here than in any
other American city of comparable size, north or south.
This is not to say that all is sweetness and harmony. The races do not mix
much socially and there is constant stress between the black politicians,
led by Mayor Maynard Jackson, who run the predominantly black inner-city
core of Atlanta and the whites who run the predominantly white, wealthy
suburbs to the north and east.
But Atlanta's black politicians and white business elite realised as far
back as the 1940s that racial co-operation was a key to economic growth.
The relative liberalism of the city's (but not the state's) white power
structure during the civil rights struggle of the 1960s, which had Atlanta
as its base, was also crucial in drawing outside investment to the region.
Hence the slogan, 'the city too busy to hate'.
The partnership has been helped by Atlanta long having a large, black middle
class and the nation's greatest concentration of black institutions of
higher learning. This, coupled with its liberal racial attitudes and growing
economy, has made the city a mecca for ambitious blacks throughout the US.
However, Atlanta's core contains the same problems of black deprivation as
other American cities, with the usual attendant drugs and crime. Atlanta
regularly competes for the title of 'murder capital of the US' although the
small size of the city, relative to the surrounding suburbs, means such
statistics over-dramatise the problem.
There is a danger, then, of Atlanta becoming a city permanently divided into
a white/black college-educated middle class and an underclass.
It is, however, characteristic of Atlanta's can-do attitude that it is
attempting a hugely ambitious solution to the problem, being closely watched
for possible national lessons. This is former president Jimmy Carter's
Atlanta Project, which aims to mobilise tens of thousands of volunteers to
tackle inner-city problems
The plight of the ghettoes is one of the most important confronting Atlanta,
but there are others. They include a potential shortage of water supplies
and a need to improve the quality of its primary and secondary education.
The city's once frosty political relationship with rural Georgia, which
still dominates the state legislature, is now more harmonious: the rest of
the state better appreciates the economic benefits of a metropolis
containing only 37 per cent of Georgia's population but generating over half
its personal income.
But there remains a danger that a lack of political co-operation between
Atlanta's black centre and white suburbs will hold back much-needed regional
planning on issues such as transport, water and air quality.
In this, as in so many other areas, the formidable preparation still needed
for the 1996 Olympics will provide an important test of Atlanta's maturity
and resolve.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to groan at Tarmac's decision to pay an unchanged dividend. It is
also wrong. Maintaining an annual payout which costs Pounds 40m certainly
looks rash in the face of zero profits this year and perhaps only Pounds 25m
in 1993. But the profound shake-up now under way - aimed at positioning the
group's assets for the 1990s and getting the balance sheet under control -
means that earnings will in any case be largely irrelevant for at least the
next two years. Paying the dividend out of the cash flow from disposals
might not seem prudent either - but given that the group is being shrunk it
is not unreasonable for shareholders to be handed back a part of their
stake.
It is late in the day, of course, but the evidence suggests that Mr Neville
Simms, the new chief executive, really is now in charge. Chopping back the
housing division is as important symbolically as it is financially. One
suspects, moreover, that the determination to put businesses on the block
will not necessarily stop with industrial products and building materials.
None of this disguises the fact that the trading outlook in most of Tarmac's
businesses is grim, and that sector overcapacity will not quickly be
resolved. It will be 1994 at the earliest before there will be serious
earnings growth from the shrunken core. Meanwhile, though, a 9.4 per cent
yield provides reasonable support. While there is still no case for being
overweight in the builders, Tarmac looks as good a way as any to gain
exposure to the sector.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Tesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco's interim results showed it has pulled out the stops to keep profits
moving forward, but the market is unimpressed. Indeed, with sales growth
slowing, Tesco's focus on productivity improvements and staff restructuring
could be a sign of a company on the defensive. Sainsbury and Safeway are
likely to report sales, volume and earnings growth well ahead of Tesco in
the current half.
The intriguing issue remains why Tesco has been hit harder by the recession
than the other two big food retailers. In part this could be because its
customer base is more affected by the downturn than the others, as the
company says. But that may reflect a fundamental weakness in Tesco's
position. Sainsbury has a secure position as the market leader, especially
in the south. It also has a quality image and inspires strong customer
loyalty. In an increasingly competitive market Sainsbury seems likely to
come out on top. Yet in the Midlands Tesco is losing sales to the discount
retailers and has had to respond by offering cheaper lines. By fighting on
two fronts Tesco risks blurring its image and pleasing neither of its
audiences.
While the recession has uncovered the difficulties, recovery will not end
them. Discount food retailing is now an established and growing force.
Returns from new superstore openings will continue to edge lower as the
market saturates. Unless Tesco can get sales moving again, this year's fall
in its rating may endure. The market has a good record of spotting weakness
in the food retailing sector.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cynical view of yesterday's base rate cut is that it was timed to
distract attention from a particularly poor set of trade figures. Doubtless
the government is glad to have got the cut away with scarcely a murmur from
the exchange markets. Perhaps that leaves room for further reductions, but
the spike in index-linked gilts shows the financial markets are not
oblivious to the inflationary risk. And the trade figures point to caution
down the road.
The most obvious explanation for the weakness of manufacturing exports and
strength of imports in the run-up to the ERM crisis - that the exchange rate
was overvalued - is also the least likely. There was precious little
complaining from industry on that score. The trend could mean some
flickering of recovery in which case the devaluation was less necessary than
it seemed. That would be borne out by the August retail sales, but
contradicted by survey evidence and other indicators. Or there could be a
structural weakness, whereby even a recession-bound Britain is forced to
supply itself abroad.
In that case, recovery will quickly make the trade figures worse in spite of
the devaluation, and not just because of the infamous J-curve effect. From
the new year there will be an unnerving information vacuum while the
statisticians adjust for the European single market. By then worries about
Britain's trade performance could keep sterling under pressure, upsetting
interest rate hopes.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Earning credibility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Capel's research into the implications of forthcoming accounting
changes is all the more authoritative for its workmanlike approach.
Companies have little room to quiver with rage at its findings, even though
these reveal an extraordinary impact - to coin a phrase - on published
earnings per share. Last year's earnings figure at Courtaulds Textiles would
fall by nearly half to 19.1p if the new approach were applied. British
Aerospace would have reported a loss of 43p instead of 27.2p.
Ideally the volatility of earnings figures under the new regime should cause
the market to take a more considered look at the full picture. In practice,
investors may want to establish a common yardstick for valuing shares
relative both to the market as a whole and to other companies in the sector.
The operational cash-flow figure may help. At least it is undistorted by
differences in depreciation policy. But the most likely outcome, as Capel
suggests, is that companies will iron out fluctuations in stated earnings by
publishing a 'normalised' figure as well.
The danger is that this would leave us where we started. There is no reason
to assume that company-normalised earnings figures would be any less suspect
than those declared at present. Brokers could produce normalised figures
independently but the market could not cope with a plethora of figures.
Besides, as we have been reminded by the debate over the status of research
that has followed the controversy at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, it is open to
question how far broker estimates would be likely to stray from a
company-set norm.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Manx officials let insolvent bank trade on, report says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISLE of Man treasury officials failed to monitor the Savings and Investment
Bank (SIB) and allowed it to trade while insolvent for at least 16 months
before it crashed 10 years ago, according to the Chadwick report published
yesterday.
They then refused to co-operate with Mr John Chadwick QC, who had been
ordered by the Manx High Court to investigate why the bank collapsed owing
Pounds 42m to 3,000 depositors, most of them local savers. His report
appeared after six years of legal delays.
In 1989 SIB depositors went to the Privy Council - the ultimate court of
appeal for the Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency. Their claim
of negligence could not proceed because the council ruled that the
government had no legal duty of care towards depositors. Mrs Frances Harper,
a Douglas resident who lost Pounds 20,000, said yesterday: 'This absolutely
stinks.
'If we had been able to have this report when we sued the Manx government,
we might not have lost our case at the Privy Council. Justice delayed has
been justice denied,' she said. It was only after a new Manx government was
elected in 1986 that fraud squad investigations began into the bank crash,
but charges against eight owners, managers or agents were dismissed in 1990
because of the delay in bringing them.
Only Pounds 8m of the bank's Pounds 44m of loans has been recovered.
Depositors have had a return of 27 1/2 p in the pound from the liquidators
but are seeking compensation from the Manx government.
Mr Miles Walker, the Isle of Man's chief minister, is planning ex gratia
payments to depositors of up to Pounds 5,000, but Mrs Harper described the
amount as a 'pittance'.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Ratification of Maastricht urged: Paris and Bonn stress
commitment to monetary and political union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand gave
their firm commitment at a mini-summit in Paris yesterday to ensuring that
European monetary and political union should not be halted.
After the two-hour meeting, Mr Kohl said on German television: 'For me and
for the president it is clear. We want the ratification of Maastricht. The
process must not be stopped. We want to expand but also deepen the
Community.'
However, both leaders refused to say, or to let their officials say,
anything about the content of the talks. The meeting has fuelled rumours of
a Franco-German initiative following last Sunday's narrow French vote of
approval for the Maastricht treaty, and of possible currency realignment.
German officials said Mr Kohl would discuss any plans with other government
heads before anything was finalised.
The chancellor is to make a full statement on the Maastricht treaty to the
German Bundestag on Friday, and has cancelled a week-long trip to Asia in
October to attend the European Community London summit and to work on the
issues involved.
French and German officials stressed that yesterday's meeting should be seen
as the start of the run-up to the mid-October EC summit in London, which the
leaders of France and Germany hoped would produce important clarification -
but not re-negotiation - of the Maastricht treaty. Downing Street confirmed
last night that the summit had been fixed for October 16.
The news black-out on yesterday's meeting may have been partly due to a
desire to avoid the impression that the German and French leaders are
ganging up on Mr John Major.
They recognise the UK prime minister's increasing difficulty of squaring his
back-bench difficulties over Maastricht with his responsibility as current
president of the EC to orches-trate further ratification moves.
However, the other reason for their secrecy is that the two leaders have
little new to say. Part of the 'clarification' of Maastricht - designed to
ease popular fears about the treaty creating an autocratic super-state - was
set in train at the June EC summit.
Paris and Bonn also believe the London summit should stress the need to
reinforce democratic control of EC institutions, and to widen Community
membership, say officials in both capitals. The Elysee Palace said yesterday
that Mr Mitterrand would be convalescing for the next three weeks after his
prostate cancer operation.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration clashed with the head of the International Monetary
Fund yesterday over how to revive the world economy and restore order in
financial markets.
Welcoming delegates to the IMF/World Bank annual meeting in Washington, Mr
Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, called for lower world interest
rates, arguing that this was the best route to increases in investment,
productivity and living standards.
'When interest rates remain high for whatever reason, the returns on
investment stay sterile in the banking system', he said. He was responding
to a call on Monday from Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and
chairman of the IMF's policy-making interim committee, for an increase in US
interest rates.
However, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director took a diametrically
opposite position to Mr Brady, calling on Germany and the US to take
immediate steps to cut their budget deficits but warning against a premature
relaxation of monetary policy.
'Some will tell you that it could be safe now to relax monetary discipline
and so give a boost to activity . . . but this would be the most serious
mistake we could make today.' It was the weakness of fiscal and structural
policies that had undermined confidence, caused high long-term interest
rates and hindered growth, Mr Camdessus said.
'I urge prompt action to ensure speedy and lasting fiscal consolidation in
the US and Germany. I would also recommend firm fiscal action in other
European countries, most notably Italy', he said.
Firm action to reduce deficits was sensible despite signs of a hesitant
world economic recovery. 'Any further postponement of fiscal retrenchment
out of concern for possible short-term effects on activity would contribute
to a worse environment,' he added.
On the other hand, 'credible action to reduce budget deficits would improve
confidence, lower inflationary expectations and produce a downward
adjustment of long-term interest rates. All these would more than offset any
short-term contractionary impact,' he said.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (3): The loan rangers - Martin
Dickson meets the region's bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN you visit the Atlanta office of Mr EP 'Bud' Gould, chairman of the
Trust Company of Georgia, you are likely to be offered a drink of Coca-Cola.
Not coffee; not tea nor any other beverage. Mr Gould is quite particular
about his Coca-Cola, which is proferred to you in a bright red container
bearing the drink company's logo.
The gesture is a small but significant pointer to the long-standing ties
between Georgia's largest banks and local industry.
For the Trust Bank, part of the SunTrust regional bank holding company,
underwrote the first issue of Coca-Cola stock back in 1919. It still owns
Coke shares, now worth some Dollars 1bn, which it acquired in lieu of a
commission for the flotation.
Tradition alone, however, will not get you very far in today's intensely
competitive Georgian banking business, which has undergone a radical change
in the past decade as the banking industry of the American southeast has
consolidated and as Atlanta's commercial success has attracted a substantial
number of foreign banks to the city.
Moreover, while Atlanta has long been the banking capital of the
southeastern region - which is a large net importer of capital - that title
is now being challenged by North Carolina, because two of Georgia's biggest
banks have merged with institutions which have their headquarters in that
state.
That said, much of the region's commercial business remains in Atlanta - as
indeed does the region's Federal Reserve Bank.
One of most distinctive features of Georgia's main banks is their financial
strength - at a time when much of the US banking industry has seen its
balance sheet ratios hit hard by recession and a bust in the commercial
property market.
Two of the three - Suntrust and Wachovia - rank among the best 10
super-regional banks in the nation in terms of return on equity and
non-performing asset ratios.
The third, the aggressively expansive Nationsbank, is not too far behind in
these areas; it now ranks as the fourth largest bank in the nation, with
assets of Dollars 110bn. (That compares with Suntrust's Dollars 34bn and
Wachovia's Dollars 33bn.)
This strength stems in considerable part from Atlanta's banking traumas in
the mid-1970s, when a property crash produced severe losses. Mr Raymond
Riddle, president of Wachovia Bank of Georgia says: 'The banks learned a
very difficult and painful lesson. Our real estate philosophy since then has
been to select the very best developers, and limit ourselves to people we
knew and understood.'
Atlanta's banks were therefore very cautious lenders during the city's 1980s
property boom, unlike some insurance companies and banks from New York and
abroad, which are now nursing painful losses from Georgia's real estate
slump of the past few years.
This history goes some way to justify the Atlanta banks against the
criticism that some of them have been persistently overcautious in their
lending patterns, and remain so. Certainly, the strength of the banking
system ought to help the city as it emerges from recession.
Nevertheless, Mr Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University, says: 'The banks are acting in their
lending activities almost as if they went bust. They are very tough.'
Mr Ratajczak also points out that Georgia's current tax system is a
substantial disincentive to the growth of a investment portfolio management
industry in Atlanta. If the system were to be changed, he says, it could
give a significant kick to the relatively small local insurance industry.
The banking industry began to assume its current shape after 1977, when a
law was passed which allowed Georgian banks to expand outside their home
county and buy up other Georgian banks. The result was a wave of
consolidation within the state.
In 1984 a much more significant takeover wave rolled forward when 11
southeastern states agreed among themselves to permit banking takeovers
across state lines. This rapidly resulted in the emergence of some of
America's first so-called super-regional banks.
Trust Bank acquired businesses in Florida and Tennessee and became Suntrust.
North Carolina-based First Wachovia and First National Bank of Atlanta
agreed to merge, and later acquired South Carolina National.
In 1989 the North Carolina-based NCNB made an unsuccessful hostile bid for
the Atlanta-based Citizens &amp; Southern - the largest bank in Georgia - which
merged instead with Virginia-based Sovran Financial. However, troubles with
Sovran's property portfolio so weakened C&amp;S/Sovran that NCNB was able to
launch a second, successful bid in 1991. It renamed the entire group
NationsBank, a symbol of its wide ambitions.
All this has left SunTrust the only one of the Big Three Georgian banks with
headquarters in the state. The bank tries to exploit this, as an attraction
for business.
Banking competition in Georgia has been increased by the chartering of some
150 new small banks in the state since the early 1980s, and the arrival of
more than two dozen foreign banks. The foreigners have been allowed to
operate in Georgia since 1976, but are forbidden from taking deposits or
offering retail services. Specialising in large loans to corporate
customers, they offer companies an alternative to the regional banks and,
for deals above local banks' lending limits, to the large New York money
centre banks.
(Less conventional were the lending practices which in 1989 led to a scandal
which enveloped the Atlanta office of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. It
was revealed to have funnelled billions of dollars in unauthorised credit to
Iraq, which bought arms with them.)
The foreign banks have keen rates and large sums of money to offer the
Atlanta business community, but some of them have found it so hard to make a
reasonable return in the southeast, given the competition and overheads,
that they have left the market.
Mr Gould, at Suntrust, says: 'Everyone has to price differently, compete
harder, grow a little less rapidly than they'd like to because of the
heightened competition.'
