FT  02 JUL 92 / Technology: Anti-noise devices drown out competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking for the quiet life? The din of the diesel engine and the whine of
the air conditioning fan can now be silenced electronically using 'noise
cancellation' technology that is rapidly finding a broad range of commercial
applications.
Electronic or 'active' noise cancellation systems analyse undesirable, low
frequency noises in a chosen environment. The noise reduction system
produces an equal but opposite wave, called 'anti-noise', which cancels out
or reduces the unwanted sound. The concept of 'anti-noise' was discovered in
the 1930s, but commercial use had to await the microprocessor and cheap
computing power used to analyse sound.
The first commercial applications of the technology are in industrial
settings. NCT Muffler of Stamford, Connecticut, a subsidiary of Noise
Cancellation Technologies, this week took its first order, for 50 electronic
silencers, which electronically silence noise from blowers, vacuum pumps,
compressors and other internal combustion engines. An added benefit of the
noise cancellation systems is that they also make the equipment more fuel
efficient and improve worker safety.
The first of NCT Muffler's silencer systems have been installed in a wire
manufacturing plant that uses industrial vacuum pumps to unload bulk product
from railway cars.
Noise cancellation may find a much broader market in the vehicle industry,
where it can be used to quieten car engines - to the benefit of those
outside and inside the vehicle. Noisy buses, trucks, farm equipment and
generators are also potentially important applications. NCT General Systems,
another subsidiary, is working on noise reduction systems for fans used in
household appliances.
The most appealing applications of this technology are being pursued by NCT
Personal Quieting. These include personal headsets that block out offensive
noise without affecting a person's ability to hear speech, warning signals
or music. Unfortunately beyond the scope of this technology, it seems, is
the ability to selectively block some voices while leaving others audible.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Technology: Ceasefire a vain hope in PC war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a great time for personal computer bargain hunters. Almost every
day, it seems, another PC manufacturer slashes its prices. During the past
month, the cost of many popular models has fallen by as much as 30 per cent.
What is behind these price cuts and how much longer can the turmoil in the
PC market continue? Theories on what ignited the PC 'price war' abound.
Compaq Computer's recent launch of a new range of low-cost products has been
widely cited as the first volley. In the UK, International Business
Machines' move to establish a subsidiary to sell industry standard 'clones'
under the Ambra brand name is also likely to place downward pressure on
prices.
Yet the root causes of the PC price battle lie with the proliferation of
Asian-built PC 'clones' and radical changes in the distribution channels
that deliver PC products to end users. The onslaught of Asian competition in
the PC market has long been anticipated by US and European manufacturers,
but it only materialised on a large scale recently.
That was because the primary distribution channels for PCs were controlled
by established manufacturers. PCs were sold either directly to the end user
by a computer manufacturers' sales force, or through third party 'dealers'
who were given strong incentives in the form of discounts and advertising
support to remain loyal to established suppliers.
Enter the computer 'superstore'. Selling PC's like cornflakes, or any other
'commodity' product, superstores advertise 'special discounts', bundle
hardware and software, and place brand name computers alongside their own
'generic' lower-priced products bought in bulk from unheard-of and mostly
Asian manufacturers. Along with 'direct' selling, by telephone or mail
order, superstores have fractured traditional PC sales channels, providing
new entrants with an opportunity to penetrate the market.
Former market leaders now face competition from a raft of Asian clone
manufacturers, as well as from ambitious US and European companies. Lacking
well recognised brand names, these new entrants have chosen to compete on
price, drastically undercutting the 'big name' PC makers. Hyundai, of Korea,
last month slashed prices of its US PC products by 40 per cent and began an
aggressive telemarketing campaign.
Dell Computer, a pioneer of direct marketing whose success during the past
two years has demonstrated the importance of new distribution channels, has
this week announced deep discounts and in the US will offer a new range of
cheaper PCs aimed at the 'price sensitive' segment of the market.
IBM, Compaq Computer and other long-time market leaders are being forced to
respond. Yet even as they do so, cheap clones are getting cheaper.
Ironically, the companies that for so long dominanted the dealer channel are
now facing the challenge of adapting to selling through superstores and mail
order, following in the footsteps of their upstart competitors.
In this turmoil, the customer is the winner. Sales volumes are soaring in
the US and picking up in Europe, according to industry executives, but few
are celebrating the market revival, which has been accompanied by a sharp
reduction in profit margins and mounting concern about cost cutting.
One consolation for US and European manufacturers is that it is difficult
for their aggressive competitors to maintain a cost advantage. Automation
has reduced the labour costs of PC manufacturing. Today it costs little more
to build PCs in Scotland or Silicon Valley than it does in Singapore or
Taiwan.
The price cutting cannot go on for ever, although industry executives expect
the trend to continue for several more months. Ultimately, the PC must cost
slightly more than the sum of the components it contains, but this too is a
moving target. Prices of microprocessor chips, the 'brains' of a PC, are
tumbling as Intel, the leading supplier, fights off a band of new
competitors who are offering their own versions of the Intel chips.
New technology will ultimately halt the PC price slide. Multimedia
capabilities including video and sound, as well as improved communications,
are going to make today's cheap PCs look like yesterday's left-overs. Buyers
will be drawn to consider the features, rather than merely the price, of a
personal computer. That, at least, is what the PC industry is hoping.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Management: Batman returns with a vengeance - A
multi-million dollar promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Batman Returns opened two weeks ago to mixed reviews and the best box office
returns in Hollywood's history. Warner Bros, the Hollywood arm of Time
Warner, may not have been able to control the critics, but the studio has
carefully orchestrated the marketing of the movie and related merchandise in
the hope of producing yet another money-making machine.
The scope for Bat-products seems limitless. There are hundreds of licensed
goods including T-shirts, Batman tortilla chips and cereal, radio-controlled
Batmobiles, talking Batman toothbrushes and, reportedly, a leather Catwoman
chair.
The studio hopes to repeat the money-making performance of the first Batman
film which brought in Dollars 251m in US ticket sales and about Dollars 500m
in related product sales. Merchandise was even more lucrative overseas,
garnering about Dollars 800m in sales compared with a more paltry Dollars
140m box office take.
By all accounts, the phenomenal success of the first Batman movie, which set
box office records in 1989, caught Warner unprepared. The hype started
months before the movie opened and by the time of the first public
screening, Batman T-shirts could be found on the streets of every American
city and fashionable New York teenagers sported hairdos featuring the
Bat-logo. An estimated Dollars 200m worth of merchandise was sold before
opening night.
'We gave a licence to anyone with a bolt of black cloth,' Dan Romanelli,
president of Warner's merchandise arm, is fond of saying when describing how
the company ended up with about 19 T-shirt licensees for the first film.
This time, the Batman merchandising machine kicked into action years in
advance. Master T-shirt licences were granted in 1991 to only two companies
 -Shirt Shed and Signal Apparel. The licences extend for two years beyond
the movie's release. Kenner has a master licence for toys for the second
movie, with exclusive rights to make most of the toys associated with the
sequel, such as Catwoman and the Penguin. Warner will not reveal how much it
reaps from licensing, but studios generally get about 10 per cent of the
gross sales.
Warner also started discussing links with hotels, soft drink manufacturers
and fast food chains well in advance. MacDonald's, Coca-Cola and Choice
Hotels came on board, adding more than Dollars 50m to Warner's coffers and
providing essentially free publicity for the film through their ad
campaigns. Warner is expected to spend about Dollars 20m on its own
advertising.
MacDonald's, whose history of movie tie-ins includes Hook and The Little
Mermaid, has revamped its packaging to fit in with the Batman theme to an
unprecedented degree. There are Batman french fry bags and MacDonald's soft
drink cups come with Bat-disc lids that double as flying discs. 'With the
movie trailers, the toys and the theme parks, it's amazing how well marketed
it is,' said one industry executive. 'Everyone knows about Batman.'
Warner also took a different approach to the movie's publicity this time,
waiting until last month before unleashing the trailers and ads for Batman
Returns. 'There was a definite design to this programme,' said an industry
executive. 'Everything came down the pipe very close to release.'
There is method in Warner's delay. The studio is launching an animated
Batman television cartoon series in September and hopes to keep the movie's
momentum going until then. There will, of course, be more merchandise linked
to the cartoon characters.
With this in mind, Warner has been trying to avoid Batman overkill in an
attempt to keep consumer interest alive through to the important Christmas
retail season. 'Movies have roughly a six-month window of opportunity before
people move on to the next thing,' said one industry source.
Warner may be keeping a tighter rein on Batman marketing, but the studio
still has to contend with the problem of counterfeiters. The studio
estimates that in addition to the 20m licensed T-shirts sold last time,
counterfeiters sold another 10m. This time, Warner has taken a tip from the
credit card industry and issued Batman hologram labels to mark the genuine
Bat-articles.
The company, which filed hundreds of copyright infringement suits for the
first film, has also hired law firms around the country to stamp down on
counterfeiters. In New York, it is employing Dennis Cavanaugh, a former CIA
officer and now a lawyer at Selverne &amp; Flam, to co-ordinate a team of
part-time investigators who prowl the streets for fakes.
In spite of the safeguards, Warner is bound to lose money to counterfeiters.
Nor is there any guarantee that Batman Returns will bring in the same
returns as the first film. Ticket sales, while extremely strong, started to
trail in the second weekend.
Lisbeth Barron, an analyst at SG Warburg in New York, expects Batman Returns
to have US box office sales of about Dollars 195m and another Dollars 125m
abroad. Warner is expected to receive about 53 per cent of the box office
gross. She also expects merchandise sales to be lower than the original.
'The novelty effect is not there for this one, although the
characterisations are as interesting as the first time round.'
However, with total film production and marketing costs at about Dollars
80m, Warner should easily be in the black on the US release.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Management: Space invaders brought back down to earth -
French media buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The murky world of media-buying in France received a jolt on June 16 when
the French newspaper La Tribune leaked details of a draft report by the
Conseil de la concurrence, the government agency equivalent to the UK's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission which investigates commercial monopolistic
abuses.
The Conseil has been investigating many aspects of the French advertising
market for the past two years.
The result has now been circulated to as many as 70 advertising networks,
media-buyers and media owners, all of whom have been asked to comment within
the next two months. The Conseil then intends holding hearings with
companies concerned early in 1993.
What will follow is open to question. Many working in the advertising world
both in the UK and France believe that the Conseil will eventually rule
against a number of practices now operating in the French advertising
market, estimated to be worth Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.3bn) annually.
The central complaint by the Conseil is the utter lack of transparency in
the French media-buying business.
It is common knowledge that companies involved in media-buying purchase
large volumes of display advertising space in print, radio and television
and in return receive considerable discounts from media owners.
The sole activity of some companies such as Carat, the biggest single
pan-European operator, is media-buying, while others who offer all
advertising services have formed themselves into 'clubs' for media-buying
activities
The discounts - which may vary between 20 per cent and 50 per cent,
depending both on the volume bought and how far in advance of publication or
broadcast date - are rarely passed on to the advertiser.
But even that is speculative, since those who know the scale of the
discounting - media-buyers and media owners - refuse to disclose it, usually
on the grounds of commercial confidence. The Conseil appears to be arguing
that far from being a necessary trade secret, non-disclosure is unfair.
The Conseil has also ruled that, until it has drawn up a final report in
1993, those involved in the media-buying market are forbidden to comment on
the matter.
However, that does not prevent everyone involved from engaging in furious
conversations whenever possible.
According to the head of one leading international advertising network with
considerable interests in France, the Conseil's draft report has already
been misunderstood as an attack on the supposed monopolistic position of
some media-buyers.
'That is untrue. There are no anti-trust problems because no single
media-buyer has anything like 25 per cent of the market. Even Carat hopes to
achieve only 12 per cent this year, he said.
'It's more an issue of malpractice, particularly the issue of double-billing
 -you get one bill from TF1 showing you have paid 80 per cent of the
advertising rate and you show your client a bill saying you have paid 100
per cent. It's disgraceful, but everyone does it because not to would mean
being less competitive. I am convinced that such practices will not be
around in three years' time.'
Simeon Galpert, finance director of The Birkdale Group, the UK marketing
services agency, believes the problem is more complex, since it is unclear
what the media-buying business actually is.
'If you go to a French magazine and buy 5,000 advertising pages for the next
year, naturally you get a big discount, since you are taking a risk that, a
year from now, you will not have sold all those pages.
'A 20 per cent discount is not big enough to be in the risk-broking
business. You could say that the advertiser should be getting some of that
discount but, after all, he is not the one taking the risk.'
Whatever the rights and wrongs, a basic question remains. Why have
advertisers not taken action to cut out the middle-man, the media-buyer? The
answer is that some may be planning to do just that.
Once Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestle, Ford and other advertising giants latch on to
the idea that there is little to stop them negotiating directly with media
owners, the days of fat profits for some media-buyers may be numbered.
Perhaps that is one explanation why the letter of intent signed on February
15 by Maurice Levy, chairman of the French advertising network Publicis-FCB
Europe, to join Omnicom and WPP in The Media Partnership media-buying club,
and which was scheduled to be put into operation by March 31, now appears to
be in suspended animation.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: East meets West as auditing history is
made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HASHI SYEDAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PIECE of accounting history was made recently when the signature dried on
the audit report of AKP Sovcomflot, a Russian shipping company, believed to
be the first former Soviet enterprise outside banking to be fully audited to
international standards.
It may come as a surprise that it has taken this long. But in the chaotic
dash towards market economics in the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), accounting reform has not been a top priority. Although the big
accountants were some of the first western firms to tap into the Soviet
Union, much of their work has been with joint ventures - mostly through the
western partner - or as consultants. Apart from Sovcomflot, only joint
ventures and one or two banks have so far managed - or deemed it necessary -
to produce audited accounts in a meaningful form.
The practicalities of the Soviet accounting system were as much shaped by
communist rule and the needs of a command economy as any other aspect of
economic or social life. Mr Andrew Cunningham, a partner at Moore Stephens
and part of a UN task force on accounting reform in the former Soviet Union,
says the raison d'etre of accountants was entirely different to their role
in the West.
'In the West the chief accountant is usually the most knowledgeable person
about the state of a company's affairs,' he says. 'He will know everything
going on in the business. That's the last thing you want in a centralised
system - you want your accountants to be thick and unimaginative.
'It used to be that all accounting records needed to show was whether
production targets had been met and what resources were used in the process.
If you were a tractor factory, all the centre wanted to know is did you
produce your 2,000 tractors and what materials did you use, end of story.'
He says there was no concept of profit, no concept of bad debt (or indeed of
security, since all debts were effectively backed by the government) and no
concept of return on capital. In short, the basic measures of performance in
a market economy were irrelevant and unavailable. Everything that was
recorded was done so on a purely cash basis. If an enterprise owed money,
but had not paid it, it was simply ignored.
Cunningham believes that the contrast with western accounting is so great
that without reform, the former Soviet Union 'hasn't got a prayer'. Any
company wanting to borrow in western financial markets will get short shrift
from banks if it cannot provide meaningful information about the state of
its business, he points out.
For companies wishing to privatise, audited accounts are even more
important. More basic still, says Cunningham, how can any company introduce
basic financial disciplines or plan for the future without meaningful
accounting records set up to measure performance and profitability?
It is Mr Cunningham's signature which lies on Sovcomflot's audit report. The
company was set up by the Soviet government six years ago as a vehicle for
modernising the huge but ageing merchant fleet. It is owned by the Russian
Ministry of Merchant Marine and various ship operators in the CIS states.
Head office is in Moscow with international subsidiaries scattered around
the globe.
Sovcomflot's decision to be audited was taken for two reasons: to speed its
path to becoming fully westernised, and to show the creditors of the
offshore subsidiaries the state of the parent company. There is no
requirement for an international audit in the CIS and the accounts are not
publicly available. But they will not be entirely comfortable reading. They
show a net worth of Dollars 800m, a fleet worth Dollars 2bn, and a loss of
Dollars 53.4m after extraordinary items. They have also been qualified,
because of the company's exposure to possible bad debts from its creditors.
Moore Stephens, which specialises in shipping, has been working for
Sovcomflot for several years. In 1990 it produced a set of western-style
accounts for the company as a first step to a full-blown audit. But despite
the groundwork that had gone into the company - and the fact that parts of
Sovcomflot were used to western business methods  - it was still a big leap
from drawing up accounts to auditing them.
One example concerns currency. Most of Sovcomflot's transactions were in
dollars, so it made sense to produce a dollar audit. But at which exchange
rate? Until the beginning of this year, there were two kinds of roubles, one
which was notionally convertible and another totally non-convertible. The
accounting records were not set up to identify them separately, but the two
differ by a factor of more than 60. On top of that, the non-convertible
rouble was devalued by Boris Yeltsin's government on January 2 this year,
two days after the end of Sovcomflot's accounting period. The auditors chose
the devalued rate for the non-convertible, and the December 31 date for the
convertible currency.
Hard and soft roubles also featured in disentangling the web of loans and
debts between Sovcomflot, the Ministry and the various state shipping
companies. When all were part of one giant central machine, it did not
matter. Now that Sovcomflot is acquiring an identity in its own right -
separate from the Ministry and with independent shareholders - it has become
a central issue.
On a more practical level, Sovcomflot's location in a ministry building
meant a standard government day from 9am to 5pm that threatened to double
the time required for the audit.
'There's a totally different work culture,' says Mr Christopher Chasty,
partner in charge of the Sovcomflot job. 'Office workers aren't used to
overtime. But with four Moore Stephens staff in the Moscow Savoy at room
rates of Dollars 340 a night, Sovcomflot was keen to press on.'
Special permission was granted for the auditors to stay late. Even then they
ended up on one occasion discovered at midnight by the Ministry's ominously
titled Head of Protocol, who presented his business card, handed round
Russian brandy, and then politely but firmly escorted the foreigners from
the building.
In spite of the problems faced by Sovcomflot, auditing accounts for a
shipping company is relatively straightforward. The enterprise's main assets
are ships - 90 complete, and another 40 in the process of being built -
which are international commodities and easy to value. A manufacturer making
products for the local market, by contrast, would be far more difficult to
audit, Chasty argues. No one has yet seriously tried to put a value on
stock, work-in-progress or machinery in old CIS enterprises.
To make matters even more complicated, accountancy as a profession doesn't
really exist, Cunningham says. There are economists, who are academics, and
there are accounts staff who are basically clerks and bookkeepers. In a very
status-conscious society, the accounts staff are well down the social
ladder, and generally not a company's high fliers.
'Gleaning information which they are not used to providing is very
difficult,' says Chasty. 'You have to explain exactly the reason you want
certain information. If your questions aren't specific, they can't answer.'
Training a new breed of accountants is a mammoth task. At the beginning of
this year Russia adopted a new Chart of Accounts, a basic accounting
document drawn up by the UN task force. But events have moved so fast that
the task force is already working on its replacement.
'If they want a market economy,' says Cunningham, 'they have to have market
accounting.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / Retailers urge property shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to reform 'outdated, unjust property laws' was launched yesterday
by the Property Market Reform Group, a newly formed retailers' pressure
group.
The group, which is backed by retailers including Clarks, Thorntons and
Etam, is pressing for changes in commercial property leases. It says the
traditional lease, which lasts 25 years and has upward-only reviews, has
caused inflation, bankruptcies and a deepening recession in the high street.
The launch of the campaign coincides with a report on the flaws in the
commercial property market by the Adam Smith Research Trust.
The report, by Professor John Burton of Birmingham Business School, says the
rigidity of retailers' property costs has 'produced a situation of
nightmarish crisis in many components of UK retailing'.
The chief trouble identified by Prof Burton is that rents are not being
pushed down as a result of falling retail profits. That is preventing a fall
in retailers' costs, which in turn stops them from cutting prices and
tempting customers.
'The rent review process constitutes an institutionalised, legally induced
form of cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces,' the report
says.
It calls for changes to the process by which rents are agreed - the existing
mechanism of resolving rent disputes should be replaced, perhaps by an
enlargement of the Lands Tribunal - and recommends the abolition of
confidential clauses in rent reviews to give greater market transparency.
It calls for the cancellation of upward-only clauses in commercial leases
and says responsibility for rent payments should not remain with the
original tenant if the lease is assigned to another tenant.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown calls for EC-wide vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMUNITY-WIDE referendum on constitutional proposals reached on the basis
of majority voting was suggested yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal
Democrat leader, as one possibility for decision-making on the future of
Europe, Alison Smith writes.
He suggested that in the longer term the EC might want to move towards more
qualified majority voting and away from unanimity, with the proviso that
decisions should be supported by a majority in the European parliament and
by an EC-wide referendum. That route would prevent a single country from
being able to veto change, while securing a greater democratic endorsement
of any changes that were agreed.
An overall threshold of perhaps 60 per cent or 65 per cent would be needed
to approve changes, and there would also have to be some way of ensuring
that the smaller countries were not simply outvoted.
Mr Ashdown will take up the theme today, in a speech to European Liberals
and Reformists in Copenhagen, saying such a referendum might follow a
European constitutional convention, already proposed by the Liberal
Democrats.
Yesterday he also called on Mr John Major to take a tougher line with Tory
Euro-sceptics, by putting a motion to MPs before the summer, so that
parliament as well as the government could reaffirm its commitment to
Maastricht.

FT  02 JUL 92 / BT pilot scheme allows operators to work at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PILOT scheme allowing some BT directory inquiries operators to work from
home was launched yesterday in Inverness, Scotland. The scheme is unique,
according to BT, because operators will be able to keep in touch with each
other and their supervisors via videophones.
The year-long experiment is intended to demonstrate to other businesses the
potential of 'teleworking' - working from home using modern
telecommunication systems, including computers and modems. BT itself has no
plans to introduce wide-scale home working for its staff.
Most teleworkers have so far tended to be professionals and those such as
management consultants who for much of the time do not need to be based in
an office. Now BT hopes to demonstrate that other groups of workers,
particularly those doing highly structured and easily monitored tasks, are
also suitable candidates for teleworking. Mail order, ticket agency and
credit checking businesses, for example, could benefit, BT said.
The 10 operators who are working from home are being equipped at a cost of
Pounds 17,000 for each prototype home workstation. Videophones give them
direct contact with supervisors and also allows them to communicate
informally with each other and their colleagues in the main BT centre in
Inverness during breaks. At the end of the working day, the equipment folds
down to the size of a small dining table and is locked.
The experiment is being run by BT's laboratories at Martlesham, near
Ipswich. Mr Mike Gray, head of the laboratories, said BT estimated that more
than 2m Britons could be working from home for at least three days a week by
1995.
'We want to develop the support systems to ease the change in lifestyles.
This experiment is unique. Nowhere in the world has anyone ever used
electronic mail and videophones in this way,' he said.
The effects of working from home, including any feelings of isolation, will
be monitored by Aberdeen University's psychology department.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents BT operators, said it
had been fully involved and the volunteers would suffer no loss in pay or
conditions.
Mrs Shona McGougan, one of the 10, said working from home would save her a
25-mile round trip to work each day.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock warns on role of successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Neil Kinnock warned Labour MPs yesterday that his successor as party
leader should not be forced to devote as much effort as he had to internal
reorganisation but must be allowed to 'accentuate the positive'.
He backed implicitly as swift a review as possible of the party machinery
after the general election defeat. His successor should be seen as winning
for the party, not within the party, he said.
At the same meeting, Mr Roy Hattersley, outgoing deputy leader, said the
party had spent so much time on internal reform and making clear what a
Labour government was not going to do that it had had neither the time or
the opportunity to set out what it stood for.
In spite of concern by some Labour MPs that the party's election inquest
would prove too superficial, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and favourite
to win this month's leadership election, wants any reform of Labour's links
with trade unions completed by the 1993 autumn conference.
Mr Smith is adamant that policy changes should not be rushed.
Mr Kinnock, in what may have been his last speech as leader to the
Parliamentary Labour party, said that 'years of denigration' of the party by
the Tory media had contributed to Labour's defeat.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories face rebellion on stamp duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is facing a possible backbench rebellion when the Labour
party uses next week's finance bill debate to propose an extension of the
eight-month 'holiday' on stamp duty.
Several senior Tory MPs, including some former ministers, have put their
names to a Commons motions calling for a temporary continuation of the
scheme or the abolition of the tax.
In total, the two motions have so far been signed by 62 MPs, and the number
of Tory signatories is well above the government's majority of 21.
Labour frontbench spokesmen said yesterday that the opposition would propose
keeping the concession in place for a further six months beyond the present
deadline of August 19.
Labour argues that ending the concession would have a negative effect, even
though the scheme has not really worked in reviving the housing market or
construction industry so far.
The move will hearten Labour MPs disappointed that they have so far caused
the government few tactical difficulties at Westminster, in spite of the
Tories' reduced majority.
Even if some Tories stop short of defying the whips, the debate is expected
to embarrass the government by highlighting the lack of recovery in the
housing market.
The government's decision to lift the point at which the 1 per cent levy
becomes payable, from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 250,000, was announced in
December as part of the government's measures to help home buyers.
One government whip admitted that Labour's decision might cause some
difficulty, although he thought the whips had managed to persuade some of
the Tories who had signed the motions.
Sir Malcolm Thornton, Tory MP for Crosby, has made clear that he will press
for a statement of intent from the government before the Commons disperses
for the summer in a fortnight's time.
Discussion of the finance bill in committee finished yesterday, and it is
due to be debated by the Commons as a whole early next week.
MPs who argue for a continuation of the scheme point out that as it has not
worked yet, the cost to the Treasury has been less than the Pounds 420m
estimated when the concession was announced.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Poised for a Euro-googly - David
Gardner takes nets with the players in Major's team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR, manager of the British cricket team which yesterday started
hosting the sixth-monthly Euro test series, is likely to enjoin his players
to pitch the ball up and play the straightest of bats.
He wants an efficient rather than a flashy team - the spiv element in UK
cricket largely excludes itself because it doesn't like playing Continentals
anyway. He believes that dogged pegging away will win the Maastricht Ashes,
and make the UK part of the heartland of Euro cricket.
The shock decision by the Danes, the only Nordic cricket players, to
withdraw from the event has raised real doubts about its future. It has also
meant postponing the UK team's objective to widen the competition by
teaching cricket to other Norse and Alpine people, who they think will want
to play by UK rules, thereby tilting the competition Britain's way.
The British team thinks that if they ban bouncers and beamers - under the
'subsidiarity' rule change which says the ball should be bowled at the
lowest level possible - then the Danes will be back.
Douglas Hurd, the captain, will set the tone. Nobody observing his
head-prefect-like, slightly owlish air could doubt that he knows a sticky
wicket as well as a Balkan quagmire. Or that he knows the value of a dead
bat in these long-drawn-out Euro games, which invariably end in draws.
The stolid and solid Hurd has as his counterpoint the virtuosity of Tristan
Garel-Jones, his vice-captain. A tricky fast bowler, moving the ball both
ways in the air and seaming it off the pitch, Garel-Jones then comes on as a
spinner, dishing up right-handed googlies. These are so well disguised that
his own side have trouble reading them.
Norman Lamont, the well padded wicket-keeper, will be a lugubrious presence
behind the stumps during the series. He stands up to the wicket to prevent
them from grinding up his free-market pitch with their French-made studs.
Very few extras will get by him. When batsmen from Spain, Ireland, Greece
and Portugal are at the crease they can expect Lamont and Hurd to crowd them
with fielders and give little away. These so-called 'cohesion' teams get up
the British nose - they want to start games with their score already opened
to help them catch up with the better established teams. Watch Lamont's face
when he discovers that, as host, he will probably have to lump this.
One of the fielders crowding the bat will be Michael Howard. He has put in
some astonishing performances at silly point, his permanent grin distracting
batsmen's concentration. He supplements this by bowling an inflexible line
at leg stump, and bringing up the tail end with a dead bat.
Another close fielder will be newcomer Gillian Shephard, given Employment in
the slips, where Howard was such a star. She shows promise but is inclined
to say 'howzat' and fling the ball in the air before she has it safely in
her hands.
In the middle order comes John Gummer. He is what is known in the trade as a
good, solid rubbish bowler, so-called because since they do not know which
way the ball will bounce, neither does the batsman, who may get out carting
long-tosses to square leg. Gummer will provide some needle in the series:
his crease-side manner makes the hair stand out on the neck of the Irishman
in the all-Europe team, the agricultural slogger Ray MacSharry.
Michael Heseltine, finally, a gentleman rather than a player who fields
languidly, could also provide some sparks. Some team mates suspect he
fraternises too much with the adversary, muttering in Franglais about Le
Plan and so on.
Spectators will watch closely the change in the British team's attitudes
towards Jacques Delors, captain of the Euro all-stars. Previously they
blamed him for succeeding bodyline series which they claim brought the game
into disrepute, provoking Danish withdrawal from this series.
Cricket writers in the UK have accused Delors of all manner of other
infringements: taking a guard of three legs at the crease with a
suspiciously big bat they call Federasty, wearing double-width pads known as
Competences, and using a runner, usually Helmut Kohl or Francois Mitterrand
of the German and French teams.
But after the Viking team decided that any more bouncers would tear their
helmets off, Delors has ordered his team to bowl at the lowest possible
level. Nonetheless, only those new to Euro cricket think that is the end of
bodyline.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd to visit Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, announced in the Commons yesterday
that he will visit Hong Kong from July 26 to July 28.
Replying to demands for action to extend democracy in Hong Kong before it
reverts to Chinese control in 1997, he made clear that decisions about the
election to be held in 1995 were some way off.
Mr Hurd said Mr Chris Patten, setting out later this week to take up his
post as the last British governor of the colony, would be undertaking
wide-ranging consultations.
When Mr Patten had weighed up the different views he would advise the
government. Mr Hurd emphasised that he would not be announcing any decisions
about the 1995 election during his visit.
Responding to a charge by Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West,
that the UK government was distancing itself from the democratic movement in
Hong Kong, the foreign secretary said the government hoped to ensure
arrangements made for 1995 continued after 1997.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office junior minister, stated that the total
number of people in Hong Kong eligible to vote in the legislative council
elections in September 1991 was 3.7m of whom 1.9m registered.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Slack still growing in companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of companies operating at less than full capacity is increasing
and export orders are shortening, according the latest quarterly survey of
Bradford Chamber of Commerce, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The chamber says fortunes have been mixed and there is no firm evidence that
the recession may be ending.
The survey, of one in eight businesses, shows improving balance figures  -
the difference between the proportion reporting improvements and declines -
in home and export orders and in deliveries.
There was a weakening in the proportion of businesses reporting growing
export orders - from 32 per cent to 29 per cent - and the chamber says that
is cause for concern. Only 23 per cent of the 217 respondents are at full
capacity, a deterioration of 3 percentage points on the quarter.
Interest rates remained the most important factor in need of improvement.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Political Notebook: The return of Tina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Europe that is causing the noise in the Conservative party at the
moment. It is the economy that threatens the real damage.
There is no shortage of risk over Maastricht. Mr John Major's efforts to
keep Britain on the European train might yet be derailed by the wrecking
tactics of Tory Euro-sceptics.
One or two of the irreconcilables have begun to whisper darkly (and
unrealistically) of a direct attack on the prime minister's leadership.
Across the channel, the Danes, or the French for that matter, might kill the
treaties on monetary and political union.
Mr Major, though, is not condemned to inaction. The EC presidency gives him
the opportunity to demonstrate again his talents for striking bargains that
satisfy his European partners and appease his party.
It is the economy that holds the more dangerous 'if'.
Most Conservative MPs believed their pre-election claims that victory would
provide the final ingredient for economic recovery. Three months on, they
have become bemused and uneasy about the stubbornness of the recession.
The anecdotal evidence in their constituencies - from bankruptcies,
unemployment and house prices - confirms the aggregate indicators that have
prompted the Treasury to scrap its forecast that the economy will grow this
year.
Ministers as well as backbenchers suspect that, come the autumn, Mr Norman
Lamont's Budget forecast of a 1 per cent rise in national income in 1992
will be replaced by an embarrassing acknowledgement that output is at best
flat.
Suggestions that recession might yet turn into slump are no longer dismissed
with quite such breezy confidence.
The concern is shared in the highest reaches of the government. 'Pretty
awful' and 'dangerous' are just two of the grisly descriptions of the
short-term economic outlook offered during the past few days by cabinet
members.
In that, Mr Major is impotent. It is not possible to negotiate an end to the
recession.
Anything but the smallest cut in interest rates would jeopardise sterling's
place in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Nor, with the public-sector deficit
heading towards 5 per cent of national income, can he afford to relax fiscal
policy.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, has warned his colleagues that
political tranquillity cannot this year be bought with still more public
money.
Nor is there much inclination elsewhere in the cabinet to cut and run by
slashing interest rates and effectively ditching the ERM. It may well be
that Mr Lamont and one or two others were never great enthusiasts for fixed
exchange rates, but the chancellor is strapped to the ERM mast as tightly as
anyone.
So is the prime minister. For all the recent speculation that another rift
is opening up between the Downing Street neighbours, Mr Major is fully
committed to the policy. The prime minister and chancellor will never be
soulmates but neither can afford to lose his nerve.
To devalue now, they judge, would be to throw away the sacrifices of the
last two years. The opportunity to realign the economic and political cycles
would be lost. To recall a phrase, There Is No Alternative.
There is a positive side to the coin. Mr Major has time on his side. He has
also a medium-term political perspective. For him, the raison d'etre of the
ERM is not that it will bring down inflation but it will then keep it down.
The prize is to be a permanent one, the end of boom to bust.
The message, though, is not getting through to the back benches. Tory MPs
instinctively are unsettled by inaction. Mr Lamont is widely criticised for
not reassuring them.
They cannot understand that stamp duty is to be reimposed on a dead housing
market. The prospect of a bloody public spending round does not help.
The greatest danger for Mr Major lies in the elision between the depth of
the recession and his alleged pro-Europeanism. As Baroness Thatcher and some
others would have it, her successor has gone soft on Europe and the ERM is
stifling the recovery.
As yet, the link has only limited resonance. But Europe and the economy have
proved an explosive mixture. Tina never was a comfortable companion.

UK HOUSE prices fell 0.5 per cent last month after rising briefly in April

An average house cost Pounds 55,671 in June, Pounds 253 less than in the

It appears that an improvement may still be some way off in spite of signs
of greater activity in the market after the election.
Nationwide said many people were still delaying moves because of fears over
job prospects and financial security.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Merged firm to be 16th-largest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAKER TILLY, the UK's 17th-largest accountancy firm by fee income, is to
merge with Milne Ross, a medium-sized practice based in the south-east, in
September.
The combined firm - to be called Baker Tilly - will have fee income of more
than Pounds 30m this year, with 76 partners and 448 professional staff in 17
offices. It will become the 16th-largest firm in the UK.
The merger is the second between medium-sized firms in recent weeks,
following one between Stoy Hayward and Finnie last month, and comes at a
time when firms are coming under increasing competitive pressure during the
recession.
The Milne Ross office in central London will close, while its other offices
in Kingston upon Thames, south London, and Swindon, Wiltshire, will become
part of the Baker Tilly network. The Milne Ross name may still be used in
some circumstances.
Mr Martin Rodgers, chairman of the Milne Ross management board, will join
the existing Baker Tilly management team, while Mr Alan Vause will become a
member of its committee controlling partnership issues.
Both firms said the merger was for strategic reasons. They said
profitability was likely to be up this year on last year.
Mr Clive Parritt, national managing partner of Baker Tilly, said his firm
wanted to expand its coverage in the south-east and welcomed the fact that
many Milne Ross partners are relatively young and will be able to help
support its compliance work. Mr Martin Rodgers, chairman of the management
board at Milne Ross, said his firm wanted to expand its international
coverage and add new areas of service such as insolvency and consulting.
Two of the 19 Milne Ross partners will not join the combined firm. Mr
Raymond Fear, the former senior partner, has said he wants to consider
alternatives to working in an accountancy practice.
There was no payment as part of the merger arrangement, and partners from
both firms will be comparably re-munerated when the merger takes place.
Milne Ross billed Pounds 6.5m last year, while Baker Tilly billed Pounds
25.8m, up 0.8 per cent on the year before.
The Glasgow office of Finnie which merged with Stoy Hayward last month, has
decided not to join the enlarged practice. The two partners in the office
made the decision earlier this week.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Warburgs voted top research firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG Securities has retained the title of top stockbroking research
firm in this year's Extel Financial Survey of Investment Analysts.
James Capel, which for many years until 1990 was consistently top, has
slipped to third place, followed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and Kleinwort Benson
Securities.
There are signs that the fund managers polled for the survey believe that
the quality of stockbroking research, criticised in the past, is beginning
to improve. However, half the managers surveyed still feel that the research
does not contain any creative or original ideas.
According to the survey, which covers 126 management companies handling
Pounds 560bn of investments, fund managers are making themselves more
independent of brokers' research and are more likely to be in direct contact
with the companies in which they invest, or might invest.
However, there has also been an increase in the use of so-called 'soft
commission' arrangements in which stockbroking commissions are used to pay
for services. Such 'softing' is practised by 79 per cent of the large
segregated pension fund managers.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Coopers pair get private hearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISCIPLINARY hearing of two accountants accused of a conflict of
interest over their role in the administration of Polly Peck International
is to be held in private in spite of pressure to admit an observer, it
emerged yesterday.
The action raises questions about the ability of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to be seen to be acting fairly in one of
the most important and prominent disciplinary hearings to be held in recent
years.
Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, and Mr Michael Jordan, head of the firm's insolvency arm,
are due to defend charges on July 27 in front of a hearing of the
professional-conduct panel of the institute.
They face accusations that they breached the institute's ethical guidelines
in accepting the appointment in October 1990 when during the previous three
years there had been 'a continuing professional relationship' between
Coopers; Polly Peck, the fruit-to-electronics group; and Mr Asil Nadir, its
chairman.
Mr Douglas Llambias, a member of the Institute Council and of its
disciplinary committee, called in May for disciplinary hearings on matters
of public interest to be conducted with greater openness.
But his request to attend the Polly Peck hearing as an observer has been
turned down by the disciplinary committee, which says its bye-laws prohibit
outsiders from watching proceedings.
Mr Ian Plaistowe, president of the institute, said yesterday that he was
concerned that natural justice should be done, and that individuals should
feel free to speak out at hearings without their views being reported
out-side.
He said allowing public access to hearings might jeopardise proceedings.
However, he said the institute was now considering opening its disciplinary
procedures to public scrutiny so far as their fairness was not called into
question, and it would debate the issue at its council meeting in August.
'If we are to maintain public confidence in the effective-ness and fairness
of our disciplinary systems, then they must be made open to the public,' Mr
Llambias said yesterday.

FT  02 JUL 92 / EC drive stepped up by City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN plans to use its six months of EC presidency to step up its campaign
to bring the European central bank to London.
Sir Brian Jenkins, the lord mayor of London, who is leading the City's
campaign, said yesterday he would keep up the struggle in spite of the
weekend call by 10 of Britain's 11 EC partners to place the bank in Bonn.
'I'm sure it's not over,' he said. We will press on and pursue what we've
been doing so far.'
Government officials said Sir Brian's message would be supported by
ministers, who will be shrugging off the vote in favour of Bonn at the
indecisive Lisbon summit.
Sir Brian's drive is being given strong backing by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, who is sticking to his view that the
operational arm of the bank at least should be in London.
Sir Brian said Germany was trying to make acceptance of Frankfurt or Bonn as
the bank site a condition of Germany's willingness to take part in economic
and monetary union (Emu). 'The Germans will only opt in (to Emu) if they get
the bank,' he said.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Pay disclosure 'has improved'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE British companies are disclosing more information about how much they
pay their directors, but most still fall short of the recent Cadbury
committee guidelines, according to a study published today.
The report produced by Monks Partnership, the remuneration advisers and
consultants, also shows that top directors' pay increases in industrial
companies slowed last year to an average 8.4 per cent from 11.4 per cent in
1990.
In the financial sector, directors' pay increased by an average 8.9 per cent
compared with 14.5 per cent a year earlier. But the study also shows that
more than a quarter of top directors saw their remuneration fall in the past
12 months.
Although three quarters of FT-SE 100 companies disclosed that they had a
remuneration committee as recommended by the Cadbury report on corporate
governance, only seven met all the guidelines. They were British Gas; Tesco,
the supermarket chain; British Airways; SmithKline Beecham, the
pharmaceuticals group; Guinness, the international drinks group; TSB Group,
the banking group; and Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group.
Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt, managing director of Monks, said: 'Improvements in
the disclosure of top pay have been evident over the past two years . . .
For companies with turnovers of over Pounds 2bn, the percentage of
organisations exceeding the legal minima governing disclosure has risen from
30 per cent in 1989 to 54 per cent last year.
'But there is still a long way to go. As this report shows, only seven of
the FT-SE 100 do all the things Cadbury recommends on pay - and the Cadbury
guidelines are not particularly onerous.
'We argue that much of the criticism . . . over directors' pay might be
avoided if they took proper steps to show how pay awards arose and the
relationship between bonus payments, salary increases and company
performance.'
According to the study, based on analysis of more than 1,200 annual reports,
directors of oil, chemicals and pharmaceuticals companies enjoyed the
biggest total earnings increases at 17.9 per cent.
Mr Vernon-Harcourt said that pay increases generally remained above the rate
of inflation. 'Top directors' pay tends to be a lagging indicator in a
recession. It comes down more slowly than the pay of the workforce as a
whole. By the same token, we have found in previous recessions that it also
rises more slowly when the recovery begins.'

<TEXT>
MR BOB BORZELLO, who submitted more than 125 complaints against the press to
the Press Council, is to try to take the Press Complaints Commission to
judicial review.
Mr Borzello has instructed solicitors Stephens Innocent to begin proceedings
against the commission - which succeeded the Press Council  - because it
will not in most cases accept 'third party' complaints. The commission,
which adjudicates on breaches of a Code of Practice, usually accepts
complaints only from those directly affected.
Mr Borzello, chairman of graphic arts company Camden Graphics, has
specialised in complaining about alleged derogatory references to racial or
social minorities.
Mr Mark Stephens, of Stephens Innocent, says the PCC is being unfair over
third-party complaints. He believes every breach of the code involves a
significant issue of public interest.
Lord McGregor, commission chairman, said Mr Borzello's lawyers had been in
touch, but added: 'We are not going to change our ways at all.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / NI parties agree talks with Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN IRELAND'S politics moved into uncharted territory last night when
unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to negotiations with the government
of the Irish Republic.
British and Irish ministers are also to start talks on relations between the
two countries, including possible replacements for the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement.
The breakthrough, brokered by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, adds a rare momentum to all-party talks on the province's future
which have taken place, off and on, for more than a year.
It follows a 'talks about talks' meeting in London on Tuesday, where Irish
ministers met hardline unionists for the first time since partition in the
1920s. Even moderate unionists had not negotiated with the Irish government
since the 1973 Sunningdale conference.
With participants maintaining confidentiality, it is unclear to what extent
unionists and nationalists have agreed on proposals for devolution in the
province - the subject of the first 'strand' of the present talks which have
been taking place in Belfast for nine weeks. The Irish government was
excluded from strand one.
There may be an embryonic deal on a devolved assembly for the province with
a 'panel' that would form a quasi-cabinet. But details of the assembly's
powers and the composition of the panel would be highly symbolic for
unionists and nationalists.
Lack of progress in 'strand one' prevented, until yesterday, Sir Patrick
from announcing the second and third strands - on relations between north
and south Ireland and between London and Dublin respectively.
As late as the weekend, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Unionist party, was insisting that later stages could not start until
agreement was reached on a devolved government.
However, Sir Patrick appears to have persuaded unionists not to block a
start of 'strand two'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Bar may seek simpler fraud law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR is expected to call on the government to introduce a simple offence
of fraud based on the old English common-law offence of cheating among other
measures to simplify long and complex fraud trials.
A committee set up to look at long fraud hearings after the collapse of the
second Guinness trial in February is also expected to recommend improvements
in pre-trial procedures putting the onus on the prosecution to present the
defence with a list of facts that can be agreed before trial. It is also
expected to recommend a formal system of plea or sentence bargaining.
The committee, chaired by Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, remains split on whether to
recommend abolition of jury trial in serious fraud cases. If it recommended
change, its preferred solution would be for such cases to be tried by a
judge and two lay assessors, as recommended by the Roskill fraud trials
committee.
Mr Roberts said the bar was anxious for the government to address long fraud
trials before the next round of big cases arising from the Polly Peck, Bank
of Credit and Commerce International and Maxwell scandals.
The government promised an urgent review of serious fraud trials after the
collapse of the second Guinness trial, but now appears happy to leave any
changes until after the Law Commission and the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice have reported next year.
The Law Commission has since 1987 been considering replacing the common-law
offence of conspiracy to defraud in England and Wales with a simple fraud
offence. Mr Roberts said the Bar believed it was absurd that two people
could be convicted of conspiracy to defraud for doing something for which
one of them could not be convicted for doing alone.
A simple common-law offence of fraud would give prosecuting authorities
greater flexibility in dealing with white-collar crime, he said.
With the present system of statutory offences, the prosecution is one step
behind offenders all the time, because a new statutory offence has to be
brought in to tackle each new issue as it arises.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Merchant of Venice appears in Rose Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERCHANT of Venice comes today to Rose Court, the empty office block
built over the remains of the 16th-century Rose Theatre in Southwark, south
London, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The development first came to the attention of Shakespeare admirers three
years ago when some of the UK's best-known actors staged a vigil to prevent
the developers from bulldozing the theatre's remains.
That caused delay and embarrassment for the developers. Rose Court's
Shakespearean connections are now promoted as a selling point, but the
157,000 sq ft building, which belongs to PosTel, the Post Office and
Telecommunications pension fund, has been unable to attract a tenant.
In February the developers cut the asking rent from Pounds 35 to Pounds 40 a
sq ft to Pounds 25 a sq ft.
The Merchant of Venice will be performed by Theatre Set Up, a travelling
company, in association with the National Trust, for guests involved in
business, property and the arts.
The performance will mark the 400th anniversary of the rebuilding and
extension of the Rose Theatre stage by the owner and impresario Phillip
Henslowe.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Van Gogh sold for Pounds 1.32m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VAN GOGH picture of a branch of almond blossom in a glass, executed at
Arles in 1888 and measuring only 19cm wide, was sold to a Japanese dealer
for Pounds 1.32m at Sotheby's on Tuesday.
The work may not be as bold, famous or expensive as Sunflowers, but its sale
double the estimate was a fillip to a market which is still struggling to
produce fresh, high-quality works of art.
This highly decorative study had not been seen on the market since 1909, or
exhibited since 1924.
There is no shortage of top-quality works on paper, however - or of
collectors keen to acquire them. Another success of the sale was a
pencil-and-gouache drawing by Egon Schiele of his wife Edith, sitting in a
black-and-white striped frock made from his atelier curtains. This
exceptionally large sheet of 1915 was secured for a record Pounds 572,000 by
Dr Rudolf Leopold,the notable Viennese collector, whose Schiele drawings
were shown at the Royal Academy last year.
The Schiele drawing of a girl in a blue dress and green stockings came from
the same source. It also soared over estimate to sell for Pounds 253,000.
The last year or so has seen record prices at auction for drawings by
Matisse, Gauguin, Millet and Daumier.
Monet's 'Les Alpes Vues du Cap d'Antibes', which again had been in private
hands for some years, sold on target for Pounds 715,000. Half the 61 lots on
offer failed to find buyers. The sale totalled Pounds 6,508,700 with 48 per
cent bought in.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Whitehall aims to protect tea ladies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEA ladies and messengers were described in a Whitehall department's
response to the Citizen's Charter unit as core services that could not be
subjected to market testing.
That reaction is one of the reasons that Mr William Waldegrave, the public
services minister, is considering the publication of a league table showing
how far government departments have met the targets for market-testing their
functions.
The aim of market-testing is to ensure that the costs of providing services
internally are clearly identified, so that they can be compared fairly with
the private sector, instead of being obscured behind a global figure for
overheads.
Although the overall mood of the Downing Street seminar on the Citizen's
Charter, chaired by Mr John Major just over a week ago, was positive, senior
ministers were said to have been disappointed by departmental consideration
of how to move forward on market-testing and contracting out.
Almost all departments were said not to have reached the targets set for
market-testing, and Sir Peter Levene, the part-time head of the prime
minister's efficiency unit, has started a fresh round of discussions with
officials intended to put more pressure on departments to take the
initiative more seriously.
If the results of that are still unsatisfactory, then a series of
ministerial meetings with Mr Waldegrave will be set up.
Officials made clear that there would have to be several qualifications to
the rankings, to take account of how far a department had already contracted
out services and which of the remaining areas could not be contracted out.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Bidder pulls out of Channel 5 race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Entertainment Channel yesterday formally decided not to bid for the
Channel 5 licence.
The company formed by Mr David Frost, the television presenter, and Mr
Jeremy Fox, the independent producer, said on Tuesday it would continue to
explore a possible bid for the new channel. The company had suffered when
two potential shareholders, TV-am and Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily
Telegraph group, decided not to go ahead.
Yesterday Mr Fox, who would have been chief executive of the channel if the
company had won the licence, decided against making a bid.
The main reason for the decision was the growing realisation that the
programmes they could afford to produce would not be good enough to persuade
sufficient people to buy the new aerial that will probably be needed in most
parts of the country to receive a clear picture.
The decision means it is now increasingly likely that only one significant
bid will be received by the Independent Television Commission when bids
close on Tuesday, and that it will be the minimum of Pounds 1,000 a year.
The bid, now being led in effect by Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of
Thames Television, will be in the name of Channel 5 Holdings. This new
company takes in both the investors and the concept associated with Five TV.
That is based on a core of programmes transmitted nationally but
supplemented by local programmes opting out of the national output.
The shareholders include Sony Pictures and CanWest, a Canadian-based
international broadcaster.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Suggestions of fraud and malpractice dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has been cleared of any suggestion of fraud or malpractice
by the committee of inquiry set up under the chairmanship of Sir David
Walker.
But in the report submitted to the insurance market's governing council
yesterday morning, Sir David criticises the standards of some market
professionals. He says the care and diligence of a number of members'
agents, managing agents and active underwriters fell 'materially below best
practice'.
He calls for new regulations to ensure fairness in the allocation between
syndicates of Names.
He also calls for a system of peer review, meaning that those in the market
constantly monitor one another's standards of practice to raise quality.
Sir David emphasises that the existing weaknesses in the market are not
significantly caused by the regulations under which Lloyd's is governed.
The Walker committee was established in February to examine allegations that
so-called external Names were disproportionately placed on syndicates that
lost most.
The report says that the 'catastrophic losses' sustained in the 1988 and
1989 underwriting years can be wholly explained in terms of commercial
factors and judgments.
It says the losses sustained on so-called LMX - London market excess -
business were not confined to Lloyd's syndicates but were also experienced
by a number of corporate reinsurers.
The report says: 'We do not find the developments of the LMX spiral to have
been improper or to have been distorted by conspiracy or mis-feasance.' It
adds that confidence in the market can be rebuilt, and recommends reforms
that could be undertaken within the existing framework of self-regulation.
It calls for action to restore the capital base and to create the conditions
under which corporate capital could be introduced, as the Lloyd's task force
suggested earlier this year.
It says, however: 'We believe that there is need to underpin the duties of
members' agents under the law of agency and existing Lloyd's bye-laws with
further and specific conduct of business regulations designed to ensure
fairness in syndicate allocation and to promote standards of advice and
protection for Names comparable with those for private investors under the
Financial Services Act.'
Lloyd's said yesterday: 'The council has considered (Sir David's) report and
welcomed it. Several of its recommendations - including the call for peer
review - accord with its own current thinking. There is obviously much to be
learned from his committee and we will apply these lessons vigorously.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / Names trapped in a spiral of disaster: A group of more than
4,000 Lloyd's Names heard yesterday that they would soon have to pay a
further Pounds 307m to meet losses from disasters they helped to insure
against in the late 1980s. Richard Lapper describes the LMX spiral, which
produced the losses, and tells the story of Gooda Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1980s, companies and syndicates in the London insurance market
developed a highly profitable business based on the sale of reinsurance
policies to each other.
The business was built on two simple concepts: large catastrophes such as
hurricanes are expensive when they occur, but they happen infrequently.
The insurance professionals who developed what became known as 'the spiral'
also recognised that because the resources that would be needed in the event
of a catastrophe were huge - the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in July 1988
cost Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 737m) - a way had to be found to spread the risk
as widely as possible. But the method conceived as a means of spreading risk
rebounded badly.
Instead of diversifying the losses, the spiral served to concentrate the
damage in a relatively small corner of the London insurance market. Names -
the individuals whose wealth backs the market - face huge losses as a
result.
At Lloyd's, the biggest of those syndicates have been devastated by some of
the biggest losses recorded at the insurance market - nearly half the Pounds
2.06bn loss reported by the market in 1989.
The spiral was a high-risk, high-reward business. It was also potentially
lethal. Names needed to be 'richer than God' to take part in the spiral,
said Mr Jim Payne, a leading reinsurance broker. But thousands of Names
whose total wealth amounted to little more than a suburban house were sucked
in.
There was a massive inflow of Names to the market after 1985, drawn into
Lloyd's by the prospect of easy money.
The overcapacity increased competition and depressed premium rates. Some
underwriters became complacent. 'They wrote business as if the big one was
never going to happen,' one agent said.
The spiral worked like this: an insurance company insured a large number of
houses in the UK and wished to protect itself against the risk of storms,
such as the ones in October 1987 that laid waste swathes of the south-east
of England.
The insurance company insured all losses up to Pounds 100m. Brokers
operating on its behalf devised a reinsurance programme that might reinsure
losses exceeding Pounds 100m.
That would be be only one of many similar exposures re-insured on the London
market. A way had to be found to spread the risk in the event of a number of
disasters happening during the same period.
Companies and syndicates would divide risks into layers. One typical
programme might insure all losses from Pounds 100m up to, say, Pounds 150m.
That slice of risk would, in turn, be divided into layers of say Pounds 2m
each. Each of those layers would in turn be divided up and offered for
reinsurance to syndicates and companies.
But the spiral did not stop there - in fact, it had only really begun.
Reinsurers would now seek to offset some of the risk they had assumed.
This is called a retrocession market - the reinsurance of reinsurance.
The reinsurer who might already have participated in, say, a dozen
reinsurance transactions, would seek to buy cover in order to offset his own
overall exposure to catastrophe loss. Those retrocession programmes would
again be layered and so on. The retrocession markets became known as London
Market Excess or (LMX).
The effect was to create a chain or spiral of reinsurance arrangements in
the market, with many syndicates and companies cropping up at different
points in the chain - sometimes as reinsurers assuming risk, sometimes as
reinsurers ceding risk to another reinsurer.
That high-risk and fragmented market helped to improve cashflow because of
the time taken to collect hundreds of small reinsurance claims.
Reinsurers at the top of the spiral were paying claims from a loss at the
Avondale shipyard in the US nearly 12 years after an incident which gave
rise to losses of more than Dollars 100m, even though the owner of the
shipyard and the vessels were paid soon after the event.
Confidence among spiral reinsurers was fuelled by the infrequency of large
claims between 1970 and 1987. Catastrophe reinsurers produced good profits,
and many new Names were attracted to these syndicates.
Warnings from professionals that this was a high-risk market were ignored.
Names were encouraged in some cases by a number of agents anxious to
increase their own income - itself based on fees and profit commissions
charged to Names.
Setting premium rates had been at best 'haphazard', said Mr Martin
Rodney-Smith, whose company has recently completed an investigation on
behalf of affected Names. But in this soft market, arbitrage - the
exploitation of price imperfections - became rife. Underwriters could
reinsure a set of liabilities for one price then reinsure the same
liabilities for less, pocketing the difference. 'Making a turn was the
easiest way to make money,' said one successful spiral underwriter.
Spiral business was extremely attractive business for brokers, who earned 10
per cent commission on any deal. But the market was blown apart by several
catastrophes in the late 1980s.
As the market became more efficient in processing claims, the spiral speeded
up and underwriters were called upon to pay claims faster.
Underwriters who did not have to pay out for five years after hurricane
Alicia in 1983 were faced with huge claims for hurricane Hugo in September
1989 barely a year after the event.
The disasters exposed a big structural weakness at Lloyd's. Syndicates -
annual joint ventures of Names - exist only for a year, so they cannot build
up reserves to cover losses from future years.
Lloyd's syndicates are obliged to distribute profits earned in the good
years, leaving Names with the responsibility of building up their own
reserves. Few appear to have done so.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW THE SPIRAL WORKS AT LLOYD'S
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1 A large direct insurer issues 2m homeowner policies, averaging Pounds
50,000 - total exposure Pounds 100bn. It receives a total premium of
Pounds 250m.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The insurer buys excess loss reinsurance covering a total exposure of
Pounds 225m. This is spread among five reinsurers, each of which
receives Pounds 5.4m in premium. A broker places the business with each
reinsurer and earns a commission of 10 per cent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Those reinsurers buy excess loss reinsurance - or retroinsurance -
covering a total exposure of Pounds 175m. They pay premiums of Pounds
486,000 to 25 separate reinsurers. Again a broker makes 10 per cent on
each deal.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. These reinsurers buy their own excess loss reinsurance - or
reinsurance of retrocession - to cover Pounds 137.5m in exposure.  This
is spread among a further 125 reinsurers, each of which receives Pounds
43,740 in premium and takes on exposure of Pounds 1.1m. Yet again a
broker makes 10% on each deal.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Leaked details of report spark angry reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON, ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSIDENT Lloyd's Names and some other observers of the insurance market
reacted with surprise and anger yesterday to reports that the committee of
inquiry set up by Sir David Walker appeared to have dismissed allegations of
fraud.
Newspaper reports of the inquiry findings - which were considered by the
market's ruling council yesterday but were not made public - indicated that
Lloyd's was cleared of fraud and malpractice. But the inquiry criticised the
standards of some professionals and the process by which some Names were
allocated to syndicates.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, renewed his call for the government to
launch an official inquiry into Lloyd's and described the Walker report as
'a whitewash'.
Mr Clive Francis, chairman of the Syndicate 334 Names Association, said: 'It
would appear that Sir David Walker has confirmed the worst fears of all the
Names out in the sticks that there has been materially sharp practice at
Lloyd's'
Mr Claude Gurney, an outside Name who has helped to call an extraordinary
general meeting at which the council will be criticised, said: 'If there is
negligence and malpractice, either the council has covered it up, which is
very serious, or they were not aware of it, which is even more serious.'
Mr Andrew Grossman, the outgoing chairman of the Distressed Names
Association, said he believed the 'ultimate judgment' would be made in one
of the actions in US courts. He said he was not completely surprised by the
conclusions of the Walker report. 'I am disappointed because I think it
means that there is no immediate official remedy. It is a reflection of the
inadequacies of investor protection as applied to Names, and many of these
Names were clearly in need of protection.'
He added: 'Basically Lloyd's is exempt through an accident of history.'
Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, said: 'I understand that
David Walker has strongly criticised agents on grounds of negligence. In
that case obviously one applauds that. He says there were no grounds for
fraud in the spiral, but I should like to see Sir Patrick Neil's comments on
that.'
Sir Patrick's report on whether there was fraud in the spiral is due in
August. Mr Benyon said the Walker report's comment that there was nothing
improper in the development of the LMX spiral was 'astonishing'.
He said: 'You have got thousands of people herded on to these disastrous
syndicates by negligent agents who are the responsibility of Lloyd's. Of
course it was preventable.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Future of the European Fighter: Lighter and cheaper mean
easier to shoot down, says UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE EFA is dead; let's make a lighter aircraft.' That, in a nutshell, is
how a British defence official yesterday interpreted Germany's rejection of
the Pounds 20bn four-nation programme.
But, echoing the position of both the government in London and British
Aerospace, he quickly pronounced as unworkable the proposal by Mr Volker
Ruhe, the German defence minister, to build a cheaper and lighter version of
the aircraft. Britain, the other leading partner with Germany in the
European fighter project, considers the Ruhe plan flawed on both military
and industrial grounds.
Although the UK, together with Spain and Italy - the junior partners in the
programme - are prepared to discuss the German proposal, they are expected
to try to use the talks to persuade Germany to reconsider.
While the three other partners accept that there is no longer a threat from
the combined forces of the former Warsaw Pact countries, they insist that
the Atlantic alliance now faces a multi-faceted and less foreseeable
security risk.
One of the biggest risks, they argue, is the increasing number of
sophisticated weapons falling under the control of smaller and potentially
unstable nations and the deployment of highly capable Russian fighters such
as the MiG29 or the Su27 in a growing number of countries.
'Russia has already exported many of its very sophisticated aircraft to a
significant number of countries, including Third World countries like Iraq,
Iran and North Korea,' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said
yesterday.
Any alternative to the EFA would still have to provide the four air forces
of the partner countries with a modern combat aircraft capable of winning
any engagement against the equivalent of a MiG29 or Su27. Such a fighter
would be required to engage multiple targets, be extremely agile in both
subsonic and supersonic flight, and have very high rates of climb and
acceleration.
A smaller version would inevitably have a lower capability, carrying less
fuel and fewer weapons.
UK defence officials believe such an aircraft would be likely to be defeated
in combat and therefore not worth investing in.
It would be feasible technically to incorporate EFA technology into a
smaller aircraft.
However, preliminary studies suggest that the current development effort in
EFA, whose cost is now nearing Pounds 8bn, would not be directly applicable
to any new fighter aircraft programme and would largely have been wasted.
The proposal would mean:
The seven EFA prototypes now at final assembly would have to be scrapped;
New prototypes would have to be built and the partners would have to start a
new design from scratch;
The EJ200 engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, MTU of Germany, Fiat and
ITP of Spain would have to be redeveloped;
Radar, electronic warfare and flight control systems being tailor-made for
the fighter would also have to be scrapped or redesigned.
Any plans for a new aircraft would seriously delay the current development
programme started in 1988 and scheduled to be completed in 1999.
New feasibility studies, project definition and other negotiations between
the partners could take between five and eight years, delaying the
replacement of ageing aircraft in the four air forces.
Germany has suggested that its smaller EFA2000 project could involve other
countries, including possibly France and Sweden. This would imply that both
those countries would be prepared to scrap their own principal military
aerospace projects: the Rafale fighter in France and the Gripen JAS-39 light
multi-role aircraft in Sweden.
There has been no evidence so far that either nation would be prepared to do
anything of the kind.
France orginally pulled out of European collaboration on a new fighter in
1985 because it wanted an aircraft optimised for naval and ground attack
roles rather than the EFA's primary air-to-air defence role.
Rafale's unit production costs, which have been formally quoted by the
French government to Germany, are understood to be higher than for the EFA.
German and British studies also rate the French aircraft below the European
fighter in air defence operational capability.

TENS of thousands of Algerians took to the streets yesterday to mourn their
murdered head of state, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, write William Dawkins and
Francis Ghiles in Algiers.
A grief-stricken crowd gathered outside the presidential palace as mourners
filed past Mr Boudiaf's coffin in the hours before his funeral at Algiers'
main mosque. Women ululated as a green army truck bearing Mr Boudiaf's
coffin left the gates to move slowly towards the Djema Khebir mosque.
Some demonstrators blamed the recently banned fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) for Mr Boudiaf's assassination on Monday.
Others in the crowd chanted: 'Chadli assassin', accusing former President
Chadli Bendjedid, forced out of office in January. This echoed Algerian
press reports that the killing might have been organised by senior
politicians with much to fear from Mr Boudiaf's crusade against corruption.
The poor central area of the Casbah was almost deserted and shops pulled
down their steel shutters in respect.
Four hours later, the official news agency APS said the killer, whom it did
not name, was a sub-lieutenant in the country's counter-espionage unit. He
was on security duty to protect Mr Boudiaf, APS said. It gave no indication
whether was a Moslem fundamentalist or had other motives.

AUSTRALIA'S slow recovery from recession is showing signs of stalling,
putting increased pressure on the government to cut interest rates again,
writes Emilia Tagaza in Canberra.
Three sets of indicators published yesterday indicate that growth will fall
short of the government's annual target of around 4 per cent between 1992
and 1995.
Building approvals fell in May by 4.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted on the
previous month's figures. The fall followed moderate rises in March and
April.
New car registrations also fell nearly 4 per cent in May. This was the
second successive monthly decline, despite the reduced sales tax on cars
introduced by the government last February.
The May current account deficit rose 20 per cent on the previous month's
shortfall to ADollars 1.1bn (Pounds 440m), seasonally adjusted. This was the
highest monthly deficit since November last year. The increase was due
mainly to a 5 per cent fall in exports.

FT  02 JUL 92 / General strike called to oust de Klerk government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S largest trade union grouping yesterday called for a 'general
strike of unprecedented proportions' beginning on August 3.
The move is the latest and potentially most serious of a series of 'mass
action' measures adopted by unions and other anti-apartheid organisations,
designed to force President FW de Klerk to concede majority rule.
Police, meanwhile, fired shotguns and plastic bullets at black
anti-government demonstrators in central Cape Town. Several people among the
4,000 protestors were wounded. A section of the central city area was
blocked for about three hours.
Mr Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions (Cosatu), told a press conference yesterday: 'We are determined to
remove this government from power.' Cosatu is a close ally of the African
National Congress (ANC). 'Millions of people are going to force them (the
government) out of power.'
Cosatu has in the past demonstrated a capacity to organise one- or two-day
stayaways. But plans to impose a strike of longer duration will have to take
into account the country's high unemployment rate, and a weak union
structure in many industries and many parts of the country. The critical
factor will be the political mood at the time the strike is called. If the
parties to the constitutional talks, currently in stalemate, are back at the
negotiating table, Cosatu may have to reconsider its tactics.
Efforts to break the stalemate continued yesterday, both at home and abroad.
President de Klerk continued the process of introducing an international
dimension to a resolution of the crisis by adding three more foreign legal
experts to the Goldstone Commission, the judicial inquiry into township
violence, including Professor Philip Hayman, director of the Harvard Law
School Center for Criminal Justice.
The ANC has called for an international inquiry into the recent Boipatong
massacre as one of its conditions for the resumption of constitutional
talks.
The possibility of a European Community role surfaced last night, amid
growing speculation that Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, would
lead a troika of community ministers on a fact-finding visit by the end of
July or early August.
Further efforts are also under way in Dakar, Senegal, where Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, told reporters at the
summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) that chances were
increasing that the UN would step in. 'It can be as a UN observer, which we
have already done. It can be as a UN mediator. It can be a fact-finding
mission.'
The South African issue would be raised at the UN security council, possibly
on July 17, Mr Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president, said in Harare last
night. Speaking on his return from the OAU summit in Dakar, he said he
expected African states to call for the council to send an observer team.
South Africa's participation in the Barcelona Olympics and other
pre-arranged international sporting events can go ahead as planned, the
African National Congress said yesterday. 'The decision will remain under
view,' said the ANC press statement, which warned that unless the country's
political crisis is resolved, it 'will consider a halt to all tours'. This
cautionary note did not disguise the fact that the ANC, for now at least,
has declined to use sport as a weapon. But the ANC said events already
scheduled should only go ahead if athletes wore armbands with the slogan
'Peace and Democracy'. Visiting sports teams should visit the massacre site
of Boipatong.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Lowering the oil flag: The Venezuelan search is on for
foreign partners in the production of crude
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S decision to allow private companies to produce oil from a series
of inactive fields is not only an important break with the past but also the
first concrete example of private capital investment in the oil production
sector since the country's petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976.
Mr Alirio Parra, energy and mines minister, announced on June 19 that Royal
Dutch/Shell and smaller companies from Japan, the US and Venezuela would
invest Dollars 720m (Pounds 390m) over the next 10 years to produce crude
from five groups of inactive fields.
The private companies are assuming the entire financial risk - no oil, no
return. How much they earn will depend solely on the volume of oil produced
because even though they are spending money on production infrastructure,
they will not own the crude. All output will be turned over to subsidiaries
of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.
Shell's return to Venezuela as an investor in the oil sector is not without
irony. When all private oil companies were nationalised 16 years ago,
Shell's operation was second only to Exxon's. Both companies had to wait
more than a decade for their claims to be settled with the government.
It was President Carlos Andres Perez, waving the banner of nationalism, who
ordered the state takeover of foreign oil companies during his previous term
in office. Now, he is supporting PDVSA efforts to open petroleum sectors
such as exploration, production and refining to foreign capital.
However, while Venezuela is only encouraging foreign capital in its oil
industry, the state company has invested well over Dollars 1bn since 1983 to
purchase full or part-ownership in oil refining and distribution systems in
Europe and the US.
The agreements covering the inactive fields, due for signature this month,
are what PDVSA executives hope will be the first in a series of new
investments by international oil companies. Private concerns have invested
for many years in Venezuelan petrochemicals; large sums are flowing into the
sector. But petroleum and natural gas have been out of bounds until now.
In late 1990, PDVSA announced a large natural gas liquefaction project in
eastern Venezuela, in partnership with Exxon, Mitsubishi and Shell. Studies
of the Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn project are continuing, but no large
investments have yet been made, and its fate hangs on natural gas prices
worldwide. Venezuelans are keen to sell their liquefied natural gas in the
US.
Since Mr Perez took office for the second time in early 1989, PDVSA has also
been encouraging other joint ventures with international oil companies in a
variety of areas, including exploration, production and refining.
The state company has the world's largest proven reserves of heavy and
extra-heavy petroleum, and is stressing what it calls 'strategic
associations' with international companies to produce and refine heavy oil.
Despite Venezuela's strong interest in heavy oil, foreign companies consider
it uneconomical while there are abundant light and medium-grade crudes
available from the Middle East. PDVSA is in the midst of a multi-billion
dollar capital investment programme which must be funded not only by
internal cash flow, but also by export credits, loans and equity from
abroad.
Mr Perez and many other former proponents of a fully-national industry have
understood the need for foreign capital and loans if PDVSA is to grow and
remain competitive.
The company today remains well managed and profitable. The political
instability resulting from an unsuccessful military uprising last February
has not affected operations so far.
However, its capital investment needs are being squeezed by lower than
expected oil prices and a high tax bite (82 per cent of operating profits)
by a government addicted to petroleum revenues.
Last year, taxes on PDVSA provided the central government with more than 70
per cent of total revenues.
To cope with its capital shortage, PDVSA has reduced investment this year
and delayed or prolonged some large projects. The company also is seeking
funds on international capital markets.
A subsidiary, Corpoven, recently gave a mandate to CS First Boston to raise
Dollars 300m to finance the expansion of a natural gas plant. This year, two
US banks tried to raise money for PDVSA, but company officials said they
decided the placements would be too costly and the efforts were dropped.
News reports of popular protests, demands for the resignation of Mr Perez
and other symptoms of political instability have affected investors'
perceptions.
PDVSA has external debts of Dollars 2.16bn and loans from Venezuelan banks
totalling around Dollars 923m. The company will need borrowed money to
finance most of its investment programme this year and next.
Capital outlays last year were Dollars 3.7bn. Before the cuts, this year's
figure was projected at well over Dollars 4bn.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Brady looks to G7 for commonsense solutions: The US approach
to Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, was in fine form as he briefed
reporters on next week's Munich summit of the Group of Seven industrial
nations.
Running through the main economic items on the agenda - support for Russian
reforms, the flagging momentum of world growth and the stalled Uruguay Round
trade talks - his manner was that of a plain-spoken businessman looking for
commonsense solutions.
A top priority for the US, he said, was to agree measures to strengthen
global growth. He implied this was central to all else the G7 leaders might
want to achieve. Reform efforts in the former Soviet republics, for example,
would be easier if they occurred against a backdrop of buoyant world growth.
He did not quite say 'I told you so' but he was evidently gratified that the
risk of a global slowdown was now widely recognised. 'We're talking about a
communique that's going to enthusiastically support the concept of a growing
world,' he said.
He indicated this would mark a sharp departure from previous summits and IMF
meetings, when US demands for more stimulative policies had been poorly
received, raising doubts about Mr Brady's ability to read the mood in
foreign capitals.
He said the US would press for lower interest rates worldwide but that the
summit was likely to focus on fiscal measures to support growth. Ignoring
the US's decade of record budget deficits, he indulged in a headmasterly
review of German and Japanese policies.
Plainly trying to put pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
ahead of the summit, he lavished praise on the Y7,000bn-Y8,000bn (Pounds
29bn-Pounds 33bn) fiscal stimulus proposed at the weekend by Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party. He said it could potentially have as big an impact
as the historic stimulus announced in 1987, which signalled a shift from
export-led to consumer-led growth.
As Mr Brady spoke, however, the LDP plan still had not been endorsed by Mr
Miyazawa or the Japanese cabinet.
Turning to Germany, Mr Brady declined to say he was satisfied with Bonn's
fiscal policy. But he welcomed recently-announced steps to curb the German
budget deficit.
Without a hint of a smile, he suggested that President George Bush's 1990
budget agreement with Congress had shown the world how to achieve lower
interest rates. Fiscal restraint in the US, he said, had allowed the Federal
Reserve to cut short-term interest rates from over 8 per cent to 3.75 per
cent. Other countries could achieve lower interest rates if they, too, put
their fiscal houses in order.
On Russian reforms, Mr Brady casually admitted that summit leaders were
likely to agree a rescheduling of the Dollars 65bn external debt of former
Soviet republics even though negotiations between Russia and the
International Monetary Fund on a standby programme of economic reforms
remain bogged down. This will set a precedent because debtors are invariably
expected to agree a tough programme of reforms with the IMF before gaining
the benefits of a rescheduling deal.
Mr Brady must have been aware his bland statement would increase pressure on
IMF negotiators to accommodate Russia. The main hurdle, according to a
senior Canadian official, is Russia's belief it deserves different treatment
from small Third World borrowers obliged to accept numerous detailed
conditions on loans. The Russian view seems to be that a broader commitment
to economic reform should be sufficient in the case of a major world power
such as Russia.
The Uruguay Round trade negotiations were 'enormously complicated' but
absolutely vital, Mr Brady said. In 35 years on Wall Street, he had found
that the complexity of negotiations increase geometrically according to the
number of participants. However, waving a dossier of papers detailing the
importance of exports for US growth and jobs, he suggested the US was ready
to step up efforts to achieve progress in the talks. If he could wave a
magic wand over any one issue at the summit, it would be trade. Achieving
freer trade would be among the most important goals for the international
community in the post-Cold War era.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Saudi banker indicted in NY over BCCI case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEIKH KHALID Bin Mahfouz, chief operating officer of the National
Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia (NCB), the largest commercial bank in that
country, was indicted in New York yesterday on charges that he and an
associate had schemed to defraud depositors, regulators and auditors of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).
The US indictment, announced by Mr Robert Morgenthau, district attorney for
Manhattan, alleges that Sheikh Khalid and Mr Haroon Kahlon, a London-based
associate, fraudulently obtained more than Dollars 300m from BCCI depositors
and other customers.
Mr Morgenthau said the Dollars 300m was obtained as part of a scheme that
involved Sheikh Khalid acting with Mr Agha Hasan Abedi and Mr Swaleh Naqvi,
former chairman and chief executive of BCCI respectively, who were
themselves indicted on fraud charges last year. The scheme was enacted, the
indictment says, in 1985-91 and involved more than Dollars 1bn in
transactions by Sheikh Khalid and NCB.
The indictment, which is a diplomatically sensitive matter because of the
prominence of the Bin Mahfouz family in Saudi Arabia, states that NCB is
controlled by that family. The bank itself has not been charged.
Last night Mr Lawrence Smith, an executive at the New York branch of NCB,
who said he was a spokesman for Sheikh Khalid, released a statement in which
the Saudi banker declared his innocence. He stated he was 'astounded' by the
'completely unwarranted' indictment.
The statement said Sheikh Khalid had suffered 'huge losses' from BCCI and
had co-operated fully with all investigators. He rejected, 'in the strongest
terms possible, any suggestion of involvement in any wrongdoing.'
NCB announced in May that, after discussions with the Bank of England, it
had decided to close its London branch 'in an effort to rationalise
operations and cut costs.'
Mr Morgenthau said he had received co-operation from both the Bank of
England and the British Serious Fraud Office in the Bin Mahfouz
investigation.
The New York prosecutor said a decision had not been made on whether to
freeze the Bin Mahfouz family's US assets. NCB controls a New York operation
that last year had about Dollars 500m of assets.
Mr Morgenthau said that BCCI, in 1986, needed fresh capital and that Sheikh
Khalid invested in BCCI and became a BCCI director. The prosecutor said his
investigation had discovered that Sheikh Khalid's investment in BCCI was
later 'secretly withdrawn, which resulted in a gross misstatement of the
true financial picture' of BCCI.
The secret accord led to Sheikh Khalid's sale of his BCCI shares in 1988,
along with the sale in 1989 of a separate shareholding in Credit and
Commerce American Holdings (CCAH), the holding company that owned First
American bank in the US. At least Dollars 300m of the payments to Sheikh
Khalid came from BCCI's own funds and were falsely recorded as BCCI loans.
But BCCI's auditors and regulators, including the Bank of England and New
York state banking supervisors, were led to believe that Sheikh Khalid
continued to be a major BCCI shareholder until April 1990, according to the
indictment.
Mr Morgenthau said negotiations are under way in London for Mr Kahlon either
to surrender in the US or face UK arrest and extradition proceedings.
Sheikh Khalid and Mr Kahlon face up to four years in prison and up to
Dollars 600m of fines in the US.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Miyazawa promises growth effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, promised President George
Bush yesterday that he would lead an effort to strengthen economic growth in
Japan so as to draw in more US exports.
Mr Miyazawa, during his first official visit to Washington as premier, said
he expressed his determination to maintain sustained growth in the Japanese
economy. If current measures do not have sufficient effect, he said, 'I will
examine the situation and undertake every possible means, including
substantial additional fiscal measures.'
Mr Bush noted previous agreements giving US industries access to Japan's
Dollars 9bn computer market and its Dollars 27bn paper market. 'Still, I
feel we have more to do,' Mr Bush told Mr Miyazawa. 'I want to mention
continued interest in access to your markets for automobiles and auto
parts.'
Mr Doug Paal, a US National Security Council official, said a senior group
of US officials would report by August 1 on progress made by US car and car
parts industries on increasing exports to Japan, in line with agreements by
Mr Bush and Mr Miyazawa in January. He said the news might not be good
because Japan's economic recession has slowed demand for US products.
Mr Bush pleased his visitor by reaffirming US support for Tokyo's position
that it will give no large-scale aid to Russia before a Russo-Japanese
territorial dispute is resolved. Japan insists that Russia return a group of
Far Eastern islands it has occupied since 1945. US officials said, however,
the issue was not a factor in the Dollars 24bn international aid package
planned for former Soviet republics, mostly Russia.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Ceasefire strains both sides in city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE have been repeated breaches of the Sarajevo ceasefire agreement, even
yesterday as relief supplies started arriving in the besieged city, despite
assurances by both sides in the battle for the Bosnian capital that they
will honour any accord.
Both sides have different reasons for breaking it.
The Bosnian Territorial Defence units, under which the Moslem, Serb and
Croat defenders are grouped, believe that only military intervention from
outside will stop the Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army from
dividing the city on ethnic lines.
They point out that the Serb forces, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, and General
Ratko Mladic, already control large sections of western Sarajevo after
repeated bombardment.
The Moslems, who make up 43 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina's population,
also argue that outside military intervention alone will guarantee them
security and autonomy against moves by Serbia and Croatia to divide Bosnia
between them.
Croatia and Serbia control a third of Bosnia each. The rest is being
fiercely contested by Serb and Croat forces, with Moslem civilians and
fighters caught in the middle.
In these circumstances, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, has
difficulty persuading his supporters to accept a lasting ceasefire. He
himself believes it would allow the Serb irregulars to consolidate control
of areas in and around Sarajevo they already hold.
The Serbs, for their part, have withdrawn their heavy artillery equipment
from the airport, after much United Nations pressure and US threats of
intervention. Mr Karadzic has ordered his men to honour another ceasefire.
Despite this latest promise, Serb units continued yesterday to bombard the
suburb of Dobrinja.
Dobrinja, an ethnically mixed complex of high-rise flats south-west of the
centre, is strategically important for the Serbs as it gives direct access
to the airport.
That is why Serb irregulars have besieged Dobrinja for the past 60 days.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Sweden likely to cut corporate tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S non-socialist government is expected today to back a proposal to
cut the country's corporate level of taxation from 30 to 25 per cent from
January 1 1993, in a move designed to encourage foreign and domestic
investors in Sweden and adapt the tax system to that of the European
Community.
Speaking to a Financial Times conference in London yesterday Mr Urban
Backstrom, under-secretary of state at Sweden's Ministry of Finance, also
revealed that Sweden would have to cut its current value added tax level
further. It is already to be reduced from 25 to 22 per cent for January 1
1993 and will have to fall to 19-20 per cent over the next few years to come
into line with EC practice. 'We simply cannot have a rate which greatly
exceeds the rate prevailing in continental Europe,' he said.
In his address to the conference Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's industry
minister, said the government's new competition laws, to be announced this
autumn, would force public sector welfare authorities to compete in the
market for the purchase of any services they are expected to provide, in
what promises to be a comprehensive shake-up of Sweden's welfare state.
Mr Westerberg said the government, elected last October, intended to stick
to its current programme of deregulation and tax cutting despite the
country's economic difficulties.
He also said the next Swedish state-owned company to be privatised would be
announced next month. This follows the Swedish Steel, in May. Mr Westerberg
said the government intended to privatise only state-dominated commercial
companies which were operating already in a competitive market, and no state
monopolies would be sold. Instead, he said, the public utilities would be
turned into corporate entities and their areas of operation deregulated and
opened to competition, and then they would be privatised.
Mr Peter Wallenberg, Sweden's leading industrialist, told the conference
that he 'really wished more foreigners would find it worthwhile to acquire
Swedish companies, thus further enhancing the internationalisation of the
country's economy and at the same time giving Swedish industry the
opportunity to find solid partners abroad with whom it could develop itself
further'.
However, he defended strongly Sweden's current system of A and B share
ownership which enables companies such as those in the Wallenberg sphere to
maintain control with a small equity stake but dominant voting rights.

FT  02 JUL 92 / French ready to approve Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French referendum on whether to approve the Maastricht treaty, fixed
yesterday for September 20, is likely to secure a solid majority in favour,
according to the latest public opinion poll.
The poll, published in the Figaro newspaper, points towards a 60-40 majority
in favour of Maastricht, which is consistent with the trend of previous
opinion polls.
But the most encouraging feature of the survey, from the government's point
of view, is that only a small minority of voters intend to use the
referendum as a platform to express their opinions of President Francois
Mitterrand and the government.
The government's main fear has been that the referendum on Maastricht would
turn into a plebiscite against Mr Mitterrand, whose unpopularity still
stands at rock-bottom in the opinion polls.
The Figaro poll still leaves a large margin of doubt, since 23 per cent said
they would not vote, and 17 per cent gave no reply. Of the remainder, 37 per
cent said they would vote 'yes', and 23 per cent said they would vote 'no'.
But over two thirds of the sample (68 per cent) said that the electorate
should vote in terms of the construction of Europe, and only 21 per cent
that the referendum should be used as an opportunity for passing judgment on
Mr Mitterrand.
The official campaign for the referendum will last only two weeks, starting
on September 6. But knowing that the opponents of the treaty will be
campaigning against it throughout the summer, the government is launching a
heavy information campaign starting next week.
One million copies of the Maastricht treaty, together with an eight-page
explanatory leaflet, will be available in town halls throughout France, as
of next Monday.
At the same time, 300,000 copies of an explanatory brochure, entitled
'France at the Heart of Europe - Understanding Maastricht', will go on sale
in news kiosks at FFr10 (Pounds 1) apiece.
A second printing of 1m copies of the treaty, together with the accompanying
leaflet, will later be made available in departmental prefectures, as well
as in holiday resorts.
Finally, at the start of the official campaign, the government will
circulate a copy of the treaty to every single voter.
The French government plans to freeze defence spending in real terms during
the next three years, according to the medium-term defence programme it
approved yesterday.
The army will be cut from 280,000 troops now to 225,000 in 1997.
The cost of nuclear deterrence will be reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per
cent of the budget, partly by shelving the Hades short-range
surface-to-surface missile, partly by postponing modernisation of the
land-based intermediate missile force, and partly by reducing the patrol
levels of the submarine nuclear missile force.

to Bull, the loss-making French computer maker, Alan Cane writes.
Sir Leon is expected to announce today that he has approved the cash
injection, needed for restructuring costs and to help Bull rejuvenate its
technology. Bull is state-owned, with France Telecom, IBM and NEC holding
small stakes.
Mr Heseltine told Sir Leon that to allow state aid to some companies while
others, including the UK's ICL, went through the costly restructuring
process using their own resources, undermined EC competition policy.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Truckers in France help bring about second day of chaos
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFFIC again came to a standstill throughout France yesterday as lorry
drivers staged their second day of protest against the government's
clampdown on dangerous driving.
The truckers' road blocks, together with continuing demonstrations by French
farmers, caused chaos. Deliveries to shops and factories were disrupted.
Shops in Lyons are running out of fresh food. Tourists were trapped at the
channel ports, unable to proceed to their holiday destinations.
There were lengthy tailbacks of cars and lorries at the borders with Spain
and Italy. Emergency telephone lines into traffic information centres were
saturated with calls from desperate drivers.
On a radio programme Mr Jean Louis Bianco, minister of transport and
housing, accused the truckers of 'holding the French hostage'.
This provoked uproar among an invited audience of lorry drivers, one of whom
shouted 'We are not gangsters' at the minister.
Truckers sealed off the centres of Lyons and Limoges with barricades. The
main motorways north and south of Paris were cut off by road blocks and the
ring-road around the capital was jammed with traffic.
In some areas lorry drivers joined forces with groups of militant French
farmers, demonstrating against the European Community's agricultural
reforms, to stage 'Operations Escargots' by driving convoys of trucks and
tractors at a snail's pace along main roads.
The lorry drivers are protesting against the new rules on dangerous driving
which came into force yesterday. Under the new system drivers are awarded
six points on their licences. If they commit an offence they will lose a
certain number of points. Drunk driving counts for three points, and
speeding or driving through a red traffic light counts for two.
Once a driver has lost six points he automatically forfeits his licence and
must wait at least six months to get it back. Truckers claim that, as
professional drivers, they should be allocated extra points, otherwise they
will risk losing their licences - and livelihoods. Taxi drivers have also
been campaigning against the changes, with a one-day taxi strike in Paris
last month.
So far the French government, anxious to reduce the accident rate on French
roads - which claimed 9,600 lives last year, twice as many as accidents on
UK roads - has remained adamant. Mr Georges Sarre, secretary of state for
transport, said the new points system was 'not negotiable'.
Mr Sarre said he would initiate an inquiry at the end of this week into the
progress of the new system which, he said, could lead to 'some
modifications'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / French troops pave way for Sarajevo aid: Three aircraft land
125 commandos - 1,200 Canadians are on the way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRENCH troops flew in to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo yesterday to
enhance security at the airport ahead of a big international relief
operation.
Three aircraft carrying a total of 125 battle-hardened commandos landed at
the airport and more French troops will arrive there later this week.
A small United Nations force has had a tenuous hold over the airport since
last Monday, when Serb irregular forces and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army
agreed to end a blockade.
About 1,200 Canadian UN troops with 80 armoured personnel carriers are on
the way to Sarajevo by road from Croatia to assert control over the airport.
But they have been slowed by minefields and skirmishing between local ethnic
militias.
The UN will need to bring in other troops to replace the Canadians, who are
based in Croatia as part of the UN peace-keeping operations in sector west,
a UN-protected region in central Croatia.
A UN spokesman said Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, had
asked Egypt and former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent
States to send forces under UN auspices to help guard the airport,
presumably taking over from the Canadians.
The Egyptians and CIS troops, with the French, would form a three-nation
force of about 1,000. 'The French are certain, but the others have still to
be confirmed,' the UN spokesman said.
The first humanitarian aid has already been distributed in Sarajevo, which
has been under siege by Serb forces for 86 days.
Local inhabitants yesterday had their first taste of fresh water for many
weeks after UN troops delivered 27 tonnes of supplies to three charities
representing Moslems, Serbs and Croats, Bosnia's main ethnic groups.
The aid was delivered by risky visit by President Francois Mitterrand of
France to Sarajevo last Sunday.
But UN officials and locals warned that any upsurge in the fighting could
jeopardise the entire relief operation.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, one of the leaders of the Serb irregulars, promised to
court-martial anyone who broke the ceasefire.
A western diplomat dismissed the statement, issued only to international
newsagencies and not to the Serbian media, as 'a public relations exercise
and not done in good faith'.
The besieged suburb of Dobrinja was yesterday again attacked by Serb
irregulars.
In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, the federal Yugoslav presidency yesterday
named a Californian businessman, Mr Milan Panic, as the new prime minister
of the remnants of the country, which consists just of Serbia and Montenegro
now that other republics have declared independence.
Mr Panic is president of the Los Angeles-based international pharmaceutical
company ICN.
He is expected to try to smooth relations with Washington, which has been a
fierce critic of Serbia.
But US diplomats said it was unlikely Mr Panic could retain his US
citizenship.

BRITAIN is sending a Hercules transport aircraft today to help bring
humanitarian aid to the 300,000 starving people of Sarajevo, the besieged
capital of the breakaway Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
The British flight is part of a big international effort to get food and
medicines to the city, under siege from Serb irregular forces for nearly
three months. Canadian troops are nearing Sarajevo by road to secure the
airport, at present under tenuous United Nations control.
The Hercules aircraft was due to leave at 9am for the Croatian capital of
Zagreb with supplies of food. The aircraft will be placed under UN control.
In the Lords last night, Baroness Chalker, the foreign office minister,
announced that Britain would also airlift vehicles to ensure that supplies
did not lie undelivered at Sarajevo airport.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, arrived in London last night
for talks today with Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, on the Yugoslav conflict.
Meanwhile, in Washington, President George Bush ruled out unilateral US
intervention in Bosnia.
But Mr James Baker, secretary of state, said the US was ready to move
swiftly to get a UN Security Council resolution authorising use of force if
necessary to end fighting in the republic.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Call for new Lloyd's regulator: Proposals may lead to
insurance market's integration into City's supervisory framework
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN eagerly awaited report into the management of Lloyd's of London will
today recommend a new framework to manage and regulate the troubled
insurance market.
The report, by Sir Jeremy Morse, the chairman of Lloyds Bank, suggests that
regulation should be separated from the day-to-day administration and
business planning of the market.
A second report by a committee headed by Sir David Walker, former chairman
of the Securities and Investments Board, the investment watchdog, dismisses
allegations of fraud or malpractice by Lloyd's but criticises the way in
which many Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting in the
market - were funnelled into the high risk spiral reinsurance syndicates.
The two reports could go some way to quelling concerns in Parliament about
allegations of malpractice at Lloyd's, although dissident Names last night
attacked Sir David's conclusions.
The Morse report recommends that a proposed regulatory board would be one of
two new executive bodies governing the market, along with the existing
Lloyd's council which has faced criticism in the wake of record losses.
While the recommendations leave intact the system of self-regulation
codified by the 1982 Lloyd's Act, they could pave the way for the future
integration of Lloyd's into the City's regulatory framework.
The Walker report, which was also considered by the Lloyd's council
yesterday, concerns the specialist 'spiral' reinsurance market - in which
Lloyd's syndicates combine with insurance companies to reinsure each other's
exposure to catastrophe loss.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the
biggest group of loss-making Names, said he 'was disappointed but not
surprised' by the report. Sir David had 'apparently concluded that the
spiral was not improper. We will want to know why', Mr Doll-Steinberg said.
More than 4,000 Names who were members of some of the worst performing
spiral syndicates will learn this week that they face a further cash call of
Pounds 307m to meet losses from 1989 and earlier years.
Cash calls on members of the same syndicates made since April 1991 already
amount to more than Pounds 365m. GW Run Off, an agency, is now managing the
Gooda Walker business, following its liquidation last year.
According to the agency's chairman, Mr Ralph Sharp, Gooda Walker's gross
claims (before reinsurance recoveries) in 1989 amounted to about Pounds
890m. Net losses for the year - which has been left open - amount to Pounds
491m. But a further deterioration on the 1989 year 'cannot be ruled out', Mr
Sharp said.
The Morse proposals are broadly in line with the conclusions of a market
task force which presented a wide ranging programme of reform in January.
The task force's proposals on governance and regulation were initially
rejected by Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, who described the
ideas as 'codswallop'.
Sir Jeremy's committee was appointed to re-examine the proposals following
strong pressure from Lloyd's agents and underwriters.
Sir Jeremy is understood to recommend a reduction in the size of the
council, its numbers falling from 28 to 14.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Investors spurn Telegraph's Pounds 84.5m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY, RICHARD GOURLAY, TERRY BYLAND and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 84.5m share issue by The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK
newspaper group, has been spurned by private investors, raising doubts about
a number of other forthcoming issues.
When the public offer closed at 10am yesterday, applications for only 3m of
the 13m shares available had been received. The other 10m shares will be
taken up by underwriters. Another 13m shares had already been placed with
institutional investors.
The shares are now expected to trade at a discount to the 325p issue price
when dealings begin next Wednesday.
In part, the failure reflects the fall in the stock market in recent weeks.
Before the Telegraph outcome was announced, the FT-SE 100 yesterday had
fallen 27.3 points to close at 2,493.9, its first finish below 2,500 since
the general election on April 9.
The index has fallen nearly 9 per cent from its peak of 2,737.8, achieved on
May 11.
The lack of interest in The Telegraph's shares, after the last-minute
cancellation in June of the flotation of GPA Group, the aircraft leasing
company group, is expected to put pressure on other share issues in the
pipeline.
Last night Del Monte Foods International, the processed fruit manufacturer,
said it was delaying its planned flotation until early next year. It had
looked at floating the company as early as November.
A planned flotation of 3i, the venture capital group, had already been
postponed.
Advisers to MFI Furniture Group, the retailer, last night were setting the
price for its flotation. It is due to be announced today and is now expected
to be well below earlier indications of up to 145p, possibly in the 120p to
125p range.
The biggest imminent share issue is the sale of 330m shares in Wellcome, the
drugs group, which was expected to raise about Pounds 2.8bn for the Wellcome
Trust, the medical charity. Advisers to the Trust said last night: 'The
Telegraph is an entirely different cup of tea to Wellcome.'
Investors had particular concerns about The Telegraph's issue. They said the
price, valuing the company at Pounds 435.5m, was too high and they were
concerned that the company would still be controlled by Mr Conrad Black's
Canadian-based Hollinger Group, which retains a 68 per cent stake.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph, said the issue probably
went 'as well as it could have done in the circumstances'. He said: 'It is
always a problem with professional investors to invest in a company with a
majority stake.' But Mr Cooke said the company was not raising money itself,
and he expected 'quickly to establish a good track record with investors'.
He said he did not feel the pricing of the issue 'made any difference',
adding that Mr Black had been reluctant to sell below 325p as that was the
price at which he had bought shares from other investors in recent years.
Mr Nigel Higgins of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising The Telegraph,
said: 'We are disappointed but philosophical.' Since the issue was priced
last week the stock market had fallen, he said, and brokers had cut profit
forecasts for other companies in the media sector.
Mr Higgins said the outcome showed that 'clearly the retail market is
nervous at the moment'.
The Telegraph, whose flagship daily newspaper has a circulation of more than
1m, had expected its readers to apply for shares. However, only 5,655
applications were received for the public offer.
About 100 of the group's 1,044 employees applied for 250,000 shares.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Recession deepens for builders as output stays low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in Britain's construction industry appears to be deepening
almost daily, with forecasts yesterday of a further sharp fall in output
this year.
The National Economic Development Office delayed publishing its forecasts
for a week in order to revise its figures to take account of the
deteriorating conditions in the market.
According to the joint forecasting committee of Nedo's construction industry
sector group, the value of construction output, measured in constant 1985
prices, will fall by a further 6.5 per cent this year. Previously the
committee had forecast that output would fall by 5.5 per cent this year.
Last year UK construction output fell by 9 per cent.
The committee - with representatives from construction companies, mortgage
lenders, building material producers and building unions - said the
industry's recovery, which had been expected to start next year, would not
take place until 1994, when it is forecasting a 3 per cent rise in activity.
An increase, however, would depend upon a number of planned projects going
ahead, including the Jubilee Underground line extension threatened by the
failure of the Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands.
The forecasting committee said that falls in repair and maintenance work,
which tend to be closely affected by house sales, have been much greater
than expected. This had led it to increase its forecast for the fall in
output this year.
Housebuilders have reported that the housing market has faltered in recent
weeks after a brief flurry of activity following the general election.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said yesterday: 'After a better
start to the year, sales in May and April were very poor.'
Just as worrying was the separate publication of a survey of architects'
order books, which showed that new commissions during the first three months
of this year had fallen by 19 per cent compared with the final three months
of last year.
The Royal Institute of British Architects, which conducted the survey, said:
'Architects come at the beginning of the construction process. No
commissions means no work for contractors.'
Worst affected has been the office construction market, which has been
squeezed by recession and previous over-development.
Nedo is forecasting a 25 per cent fall in commercial construction, mainly
offices and shops, with a further 10 per cent fall next year. Industrial
output is expected to fall by 3.5 per cent in each year. Private
housebuilding is expected to show a small increase in output this year
following big falls since 1988.

FT  02 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises above
16,000 on short-covering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in short-term interest rates prompted investors to cover short
positions, and the Nikkei average rallied above the 16,000 level for the
first time in four days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei put on 373.34, or 2.3 per cent, to 16,325.07. Weak futures
dragged the 225-issue average down in the morning to the day's low of
15,731.83. Small-lot index buying and bargain hunting lifted the index in
the late afternoon to the session's high of 16,326.07.
Volume remained low, at 200m shares, down from 219m. Rises outnumbered
declines by 668 to 259, with 165 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained 22.78 to 1,258.98, but in London trading the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 4.40 to 993.26.
Futures traders, encouraged by the fall in the overnight call money rate,
covered short positions, prompting index-linked buying in the cash market.
Small-lot bargain hunting by investment trusts and foreign investors was
also seen. However, traders said there was little real buying interest.
High-technology issues were purchased by bargain hunters. Toshiba, the day's
most active stock, appreciated Y13 to Y660 and NEC rose Y49 to Y873.
Construction shares, which plunged on Tuesday on worries about large loan
guarantees, recovered on short-covering. Nishimatsu Construction rose Y64 to
Y979 and Sato Kogyo Y73 to Y783.
Isetan, having fallen some 20 per cent in the previous three days on rumours
of financial problems at its leading shareholder, rebounded Y250 to Y1,850
on individual buying.
House Food Industrial dropped Y260 to Y2,040 on reports of problems at its
financial subsidiary. The leading food group said it planned to transfer its
stockholding in the financial affiliate to another company in the group,
thus removing it from its consolidated balance sheet.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 124.72 to 18,813.74 in volume of 11.8m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO HAD a limited effect on the region. Taiwan and Bangkok were closed for
bank holidays, the latter to reopen with extended working hours today.
Trading at Bombay remained suspended.
HONG KONG finished at another record high, boosted by expectations of an
easing in credit. The Hang Seng index climbed 30.83 to 6,134.75 and turnover
leapt to HKDollars 4.43bn from HKDollars 3.46bn.
In spite of Monday's sharp downward correction, most brokers said the
underlying tone remained solid, regarding the tumble as the product of
futures settlement, and profit-taking following last week's strong rise.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index firmed 3.0 to 1,647.7 as disappointing
economic statistics for May rekindled hopes for an interest rate cut.
NEW ZEALAND closed steady, investors holding back ahead of tonight's
government budget, even though no surprises are expected. There was strong
buying in some second-line stocks as institutions started a fresh financial
period.
The NZSE-40 index edged up 1.41 to 1,522.06. Turnover was NZDollars 22.4m,
including some Dollars 7m for Robt Jones Investment shares. The property
company announced a NZDollars 132.9m annual loss after the close on Tuesday,
but the shares held yesterday at 21 cents.
MANILA retreated on profit-taking. The composite index shed 31.72 to
1,524.09 and turnover fell to 237.27m pesos from 521.18m. The market was
shut on Tuesday for the inauguration of President Fidel Ramos.
Only mining issues posted gains, pushed up by a nine-month high for copper
prices.
SEOUL was kept in a tight range by falling customer deposits. The composite
index eased 0.05 to 551.98 in turnover of Won189.6bn (Won172.7bn).
KARACHI fell on political unrest in the troubled Sind province, the KSE
index closing 24.11 lower at 1,520.90 after a local holiday on Tuesday.

FT  02 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Defensive tactics rule as
bourses slide again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses were weaker yesterday in uncertain trading, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Strategists said that the shift from cyclical to defensive stocks, tested in
London recently and apparent this week in continental Europe, was a tactical
ploy,
In Germany, said Mr Horst Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, the
cyclical/defensive move is a fact, but follows from people taking profits
where they can. Cyclicals have been the mainstay of the German equity
market's outperformance this year.
Mr Richard Davidson of Morgan Stanley in London says that, in general,
cyclicals have lost momentum for three additional reasons:
that European recovery is not coming through;
that interest rate cuts are not happening in Europe; and
that the dollar is on the slide.
Morgan Stanley offers an alternative strategy, in a 1990s prospect of
disinflation which Mr Davidson defines as 'manageable' inflation rates
between zero and 4 per cent as distinct from deflation, or a negative
percentage.
The bank says that the long-term outlook is a 3 to 3 1/2 per cent inflation
rate in Europe, and that the losers in this environment would be companies
which have relied on price increases to boost their revenues. The winners
would be those which could grow their revenues from volume and market share
gains, or those which could rationalise their cost structures to improve
profit margins.
This has some surprising results. A classic defensive industry, banking, is
split. Morgan Stanley's chief strategist, Mr David Roche, likes UK banking
which demonstrates that high variable cost companies (the service sector)
stand to gain from disinflation because they can cut the workforce and keep
labour costs low. However, he says, most continental European banks 'do not
seem to understand how to rationalise'.
FRANKFURT offered a limited extension of Tuesday's trend with falls in a
limited number of blue-chip cyclicals, and gains in defensive stocks.
The DAX index rose 3.63 to 1,756.26 after a gain of 1.72 to 695.33 in the
FAZ at midsession. Turnover eased from DM5.7bn to DM5.5bn.
Cyclical fallers included BMW in carmakers, down DM7.50 to DM582.50 as
Volkswagen recovered a little; Continental, the tyremaker, DM3 lower at
DM257; Degussa in basic materials, DM6.50 lower at DM338.50; and Linde in
engineering, down DM12.50 at DM819.
Among defensives, there was a DM12 gain to DM2,296 for Allianz, the insurer,
and one of DM3.20 to DM256.50 for Commerzbank. Utilities also improved, led
by Veba with a DM5 rise to DM339.50.
Among special situations, Asko said it would remain suspended today although
shareholders heard a lot of bad news yesterday, in heavy provisions against
investments, a 1991 loss and the omission of the dividend.
PARIS fell for the fourth successive day, but in derisory turnover of just
FFr1.6bn. Dealers feared that the market would remain depressed until the
referendum on the Maastricht treaty, which has been set for September 20.
The CAC 40 index ended down 19.71 at 1,880.92, its lowest close since
February 14.
LVMH fell FFr115 to FFr3,766 on news that turnover growth at its luggage
subsidiary Louis Vuitton had slowed in April and May and by a newspaper
report describing difficulties in the champagne sector.
Alcatel Alsthom, ex-dividend, was a net 50 centimes better at FFr636 while
Lafarge, also ex dividend, dropped a net FFr2 to FFr330.90.
MILAN fell for the sixth consecutive session as the Comit index closed 3.41
lower at 450.75, its lowest level since February 12, 1988.
The market's depression was deepened by Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli's
remarks to shareholders on Tuesday that he did not expect any substantial
recovery in the group's fortunes until late 1993. Fiat closed L73 down at
L5,215 and reached L5,135 later.
Kleinwort Benson this week added Italy to its list of 'buys', recommending
that long-term investors should start looking at it again. It says that the
market has failed to appreciate that attitudes have changed, for example,
that most of the old, and tainted, names have disappeared from government.
Among other stocks, Italgas recouped L7 to L2,790 after Tuesday's weakness
while Pirelli fell L33 to L1,256.
AMSTERDAM was undermined by the afternoon fall in London, as the General
Tendency index fell 1.0 to 122.6. Hoogovens lost another Fl 1.50 to Fl
47.80, for an 11 per cent fall since Friday. Fokker lost Fl 1.40 or 4.4 per
cent to Fl 30.30 although it denied a press report that a cash crisis was
holding up Fokker's planned partnership with Germany's Dasa.
MADRID sank to a second consecutive 1992 low, the general index losing
another 2.86 to close at 235.45. Volume was thin at less than Pta11bn.
Dealers were worried that yields could rise at the Spanish treasury's
multiple bond tender today. Constructions, again, and metals posted the
sharpest declines with Cubiertas Pta500 lower at Pta7,280 and Asturiana Del
Zinc Pta800, or 30 per cent lower, at Pta1,850.
OSLO fell 1.7 per cent to a new 1992 low, led down by the insurer UNI
Storebrand after a report that the company was close to technical
bankruptcy. The all-share index fell 7.07 to 395.97 in turnover worth
NKr572m. Most of the turnover was in Forenede options, after the Finance
Ministry gave Gjensidige permission to buy the company.
UNI Storebrand tumbled even though the company denied the report in the
business daily, Dagens Naeringliv. Its A shares closed NKr5.5 lower at
NKr31.
COPENHAGEN saw the suspension of Hafnia, at the request of the company
pending an investigation into irregularities concerning options to purchase
shares in a local bank, writes Hilary Barnes. The all-share index fell 1.09
to 320.26 in turnover of Dkr125m.
VIENNA fell to a five-month low, following weakness in the state-controlled
utility Verbund. The ATX index eased 7.02 to 935.11, the lowest since
January 14.
Verbund closed down Sch9 at Sch478 in active trade, while OMV slipped Sch7
to Sch867 after the government said that it would welcome Verbund taking a
20 per cent stake in the oil company OMV, itself 72 per cent owned by the
state. Austrian Airlines closed at a new low for the year of Sch2,049, down
Sch45.
ISTANBUL finished a volatile session, up for the eight straight day at a new
five-month high, although profit-taking erased most of a 146-point surge
which came in the first 15 minutes. The 75-share index closed at 4,442.60,
up 35.37 points and the highest since February 10.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The better finish to the Australian selling season has given much needed
encouragement to wool buyers. Some believe it presages latent demand which
will emerge when the new season starts on July 28. Early offerings will be

BASE METAL prices on the LME closed mixed as technical reactions against the
recent uptrend hit some markets. Dealers said the continued absence of
significant fundamental developments left many markets looking overbought,
although buying support was eventually attracted by price dips. Three-month
COPPER slid to a low of Dollars 2,400 a tonne against a background of news
that Poland's government hopes to avert a copper mine strike. But chart
support and caution as Asarco labour talks are still taking place prevented
a breach of this level. Nymex PLATINUM futures returned to session peaks at
midday after the largest labour organisation in South Africa threatened a
general strike for August 3, sparking worries that mine production will be
disrupted in South Africa, analysts said. London COCOA futures extended
recent gains as origin sellers continued to stay away. A test of Pounds 600
a tonne is now expected for the September contract. New York raw SUGAR
futures were lower in all months at midday as concerns over supply tightness
continued to dissipate after Tuesday's expiration of the July contract.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada set to impose ban on
Atlantic cod fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA IS expected to impose an 18-month ban today on all cod fishing off
the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, together with a massive aid package
for the 20,000 fishermen whose livelihood is threatened by the moratorium.
The ban, which follows years of scientific study and gradually dwindling
catches, is the most drastic action so far in efforts to restore one of the
world's richest fishing grounds. Last month, the European Community agreed
to suspend cod fishing for the rest of this year in international waters off
the Grand Banks.
Canadian fishing boats had a northern cod quota of 135,000 tonnes this year.
In addition, the EC had awarded its trawlers a 27,000-tonne quota in the
area.
According to local reports, the ban will apply to Canada's entire 200-mile
fishing zone off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, and will remain in
effect until at least the end of 1993.
The crisis in the east coast fishery has soured relations between Canada and
the EC in recent years. Ottawa blames foreign trawlers, especially from
Portugal and Spain, for the decline in the cod stocks. There is evidence
however that other factors, including unusual bands of cold water blocking
fish migration and over-fishing by Canadian boats, have also contributed to
the problem.
The government aid package to be announced today by Mr John Crosbie, the
fisheries minister, could cost as much as CDollars 500m (Pounds 220m).
It will include early-retirement incentives for older workers and
short-term, make-work projects to enable fishermen and processing plant
workers to qualify for unemployment insurance.
Aid will also be provided for retraining, and to help fishing communities
maintain boats and other equipment.
Cod fishing is the mainstay of Newfoundland's economy. The province, which
is one of the poorest regions of North America, already has an unemployment
rate of almost 20 per cent.
The two biggest east coast fishing companies, Fishery Products International
of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia's National Sea Products, announced a
rationalisation of activities last week which will have the effect of
lowering FPI's dependence on cod and increasing its shrimp business.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bidders line up for Irish zinc
deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUCTION for Europe's second-largest known zinc-lead deposit, at Lisheen,
County Tipperary in Ireland, is coming to the boil.
Two big mining groups, Minorco and Outokumpu, together with Ivernia West,
the small Irish exploration company which discovered the deposit, have
agreed to bid jointly for the 52.5 per cent of Lisheen put up for sale by
Chevron, the US oil concern.
Industry analysts suggest the stake, which has already attracted at least 50
potential purchasers, is likely to fetch between USDollars 50m and Dollars
80m but executives of the three bidding companies insist this is too high.
Ivernia owns the other 48 per cent of Lisheen and says it has the
pre-emptive right to match any bid by a third party. Minorco, the overseas
investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, and
Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, are substantial shareholders in
Ivernia, with 16.9 per cent and 24.3 per cent of its equity respectively.
If their joint bid is successful, it will be funded by Minorco and
Outokumpu, which will each own 25 per cent of Lisheen with Ivernia having 50
per cent.
Ivernia recently revealed that reserves at Lisheen had been uprated to
18.38m tonnes containing 13.4 per cent zinc, 2.4 per cent lead and 38.7
grammes of silver a tonne, putting it second only in Europe to the nearby
Tara lead-zinc mine at Navan (wholly-owned by Outokumpu).
Exploration continues and Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director,
suggests the final ore reserve could be well over 20m tonnes. He says that,
if all goes well with planning applications and development work, a Lisheen
mine might start up in mid-1996.
'By the time we start production we will have spent USDollars 150m,' says Mr
Hough.

Officials said the exchanges, in Sapporo, Niigata, Kyoto, Hiroshima and
Fukuoka, would accept listing applications from today. They expect to see
the first listing on the new section by the end of this year.
The listing criteria will be the same as for the new second section of the
Osaka Securities Exchange, which requires companies to have at least 1m
shares outstanding and at least 300 shareholders at the time of listing.
At present, companies that want to list on the ordinary sections of the
regional exchanges must have at least 2m shares outstanding and 400
shareholders. Stricter profit and dividend criteria also apply.
Japan has eight stock exchanges, Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya plus the five
regional exchanges.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Launch set for Italy's first
futures market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S first futures market will start trading between July 10 and July 15,
according to officials at the Bank of Italy.
The Mercato Italiano Futures (MIF), the Italian futures exchange, was
originally scheduled for launch in the first half of 1992, but technical
problems have delayed the start-up, according to dealers.
Instead of trying to create an exchange from scratch, the Italian government
bond futures market is being added to the existing screen-based system used
for trading the underlying bond market.
The Telematico system, started in 1988, helped revive interest in the
Italian bond market, which has since drawn increasing numbers of foreign
investors, attracted by high interest rates and the prospect of falling
yields and rising prices in the run up to European Monetary Union.
Some dealers believe that the Italian authorities may have missed the boat.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe)
launched a highly successful Italian government bond contract last
September, which saw off a rival contract launched by the Matif, the
Paris-based exchange, at the same time. The Liffe contract traded an average
daily volume of 29,000 contracts in June, substantially higher than in
previous months.
In addition, the Italian bond market has just come through a period of high
volatility following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. On June
3, just after the referendum, nearly 68,000 Italian bond futures were
traded.
But the signs are that MIF will be able to attract a fresh source of
investors domestically.
The Liffe contract has been actively traded by international investors, but
dealers say many Italian banks and institutions have been waiting to use the
Italian market.
In addition, the new market is attracting some interest among retail
investors. According to the Bank of Italy, the Telematico system has now
been fully adapted, and is undergoing tests.
There will be 22 marketmakers in Italian bond futures on the Telematico
system, which consists of more than 200 screens throughout Italy, according
to the Bank.
The contract is very similar to the Liffe future: the MIF contract size is
L250m, compared with L200m for the Liffe contract, based on 8-10 year
Italian government BTP issues.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Spain brings a succulent
fruit to market - The country's plan to push on with privatising public
sector banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN is considering ways of relaunching the privatisation of the huge
public sector banking operations which it brought together a year ago under
the name of Argentaria.
There is a lot at stake. In terms of assets, Argentaria outweighs all the
private sector banks combined. Its collective loan portfolio totals some
Dollars 65bn. At book value, the group is worth about Dollars 5.5bn.
Madrid wants Spain to have a bank capable of fighting its corner in a united
Europe where big British, German and French groups are capable of forming
powerful lobbies to mould Community banking regulations.
The government is concerned that Spain's private sector banks may never
achieve the critical mass needed to compete on an equal footing. In
Argentaria, Madrid believes it has created the ideal weapon.
Argentaria consists of all the public sector financial institutions,
including Banco Exterior, the post office savings bank, and the
publicly-owned industrial, mortgage, agricultural and municipal banks.
A flotation planned for last year, designed to reduce the state's ownership
in Banco Exterior from 69 per cent to 51 per cent, was halted after Mr
Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's president, began to have serious doubts about
its implications.
Mr Luzon is determined to shed Argentaria's image as a bloated public sector
institution too closely linked to government policy. He is searching for a
balance between public and private ownership that will force Argentaria to
be competitive while not abandoning its role as a national flag bearer.
He has to decide whether to float part of the holding company, Argentaria,
which is 100 per cent owned by the state, or a further tranche of Banco
Exterior which is 69 per cent owned by Argentaria. A third possibility would
be to buy back the 31 per cent privately-held minority in Exterior and then
sell Argentaria.
One of Mr Luzon's problems in designing a flotation is that if he opts for
pressing ahead with Exterior only, it would rob Argentaria of its most
valuable and best-known asset and make a later flotation of Argentaria much
more difficult, if not impossible.
However, the problem with trying to sell part of Argentaria is that hardly
anyone knows what it is. 'I would like to privatise as soon as possible,'
says Mr Luzon, 'but it would be absurd to take Argentaria to the stock
market this year. We still have a lot of value to add.'
And even if, as he hopes, a first partial privatisation can occur next year,
it will be small. The point here is that the local markets are simply not
big enough to absorb the group. 'I would need four years to privatise just
20 per cent of Argentaria,' says Mr Luzon.
'If Spain does not make it to the top banking table in Europe it will be
very serious indeed,' he says. 'Europe is going to be nationalist for a long
time."
Adding some of the bureaucratic state banks to a streamlined Exterior has
not been easy. BCI, for instance, had been forced by the state to take big
positions in hugely unprofitable industries. Mr Luzon found himself, when
Exterior absorbed BCI, owner of Pta50bn of convertible bonds in a troubled
Basque steelmaker. He offloaded them back to the government.
He is also in the process of tracking down about 50 fishing trawlers, spread
around the Atlantic, built with BCI credits which have never been paid back.
He wants the money, not the boats.
Plucked from the upper echelons of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya in the late 1980s to
run Exterior, Mr Luzon has spent the last year developing unified computer
systems for 'his' new banks and selling unnecessary office space.
He says many of the institutions pooled into Argentaria are rich in hidden
assets but have been poorly run. The Caja Postal, for instance, owns most of
the post offices in the country.
One of the problems in designing a flotation of Argentaria, Mr Luzon says,
has been that he does not know for sure how much it is worth. 'At least
Pta800bn (Dollars 84bn),' he says, adding about Pta300bn to its book value.
The group's other fundamental problem is that while the bulk of its loans
are long term and either guaranteed by the state or secured against assets,
its financing is basically short term, making it vulnerable to interest rate
movements.
Mr Luzon says he expects the group to make pre-tax profits of Pta100bn this
year after Pta78bn in 1991. First-quarter figures for this year, show
pre-tax group profits of Pta24.8bn. They also reveal a return on assets of
0.8 per cent and a return on equity of 14.42 per cent, both significantly
below the average of Spain's top five banks.
Closing that gap will be a slow process, but Mr Luzon says he is about to
start a campaign to introduce Argentaria to the kind of small shareholder he
wants to attract when the privatisation process begins. The smaller the
better because one of the key elements in any offering of shares inside
Spain will have to be a mechanism to keep other Spanish banks from buying
Argentaria shares.
Spanish banks are traditionally the biggest players in the local stock
market. If Argentaria is as succulent a fruit as Mr Luzon says it is, rival
banks would be strongly tempted to to take positions in it.
That would throw a considerable spanner into Mr Luzon's grand design. But
how will he encourage a small shareholder to hang on to the shares? 'We will
have to give them presents,' he says.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM), the US computer company, and Hitachi,
the Japanese electrical machinery maker, have reached agreement on joint
development of computer printers for business use, the two companies said
yesterday.
Details of a final deal are being negotiated between Hitachi Koki, part of
the Hitachi group, and Pennant Systems, an IBM subsidiary responsible for
developing, manufacturing and marketing printers which was created during
the restructuring of the US company last year.
The latest deal between the two will lead to their first joint development
of printers, although Hitachi already supplies Pennant with the core engine
for its systems printers.
The aim of the agreement will be to reduce product development costs, as
well as to expand marketing channels for jointly-made products.
The office printer market is undergoing a shift away from large, centralised
printing systems to smaller, departmental systems which are cheaper andmore
flexible with more features. It is also becoming increasingly price-driven,
according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology market
consultancy.
IBM, a market leader for systems printers, is also a dominant player in the
centralised systems market which is being eroded by this trend.
Hitachi has considerable expertise in the manufacture of printer engines,
but mostly sells printers on an original equipment manufacture (OEM) basis.

AUSTRALIAN Gas Light (AGL), the Sydney-based fuel supplier, has joined the
growing list of Australian companies writing down the value of their assets
in depressed market conditions.
Following blue-chip Australian groups like CSR, Western Mining and Westpac
AGL has written down property and pipeline assets by ADollars 33.8m.(
Dollars 25.40m).
AGL directors said yesterday ADollars 15.5m of this sum would be taken as an
abnormal loss in the June 30 accounts, with the balance of ADollars 18.3m as
a charge against assets. The write-downs are based on independent valuations
which followed property sales in the latest June year totalling ADollars
53m.
Burns Philp, the Sydney-based food technology company, has signed an
agreement to increase its interest in Applied Microbiology, the US
biotechnology company, from 18 to 63 per cent for an undisclosed sum.
Based on recent quotations on Nasdaq in New York of USDollars 4.75 a share
for Applied, the deal would be worth about USDollars 44.2m.
As part of the transaction Applied will acquire all outstanding shares in
Burns Philp's UK-based preservative maker, Aplin &amp; Barrett, for a value of
ADollars 53m.

<TEXT>
ORENSTEIN &amp; Koppel (O&amp;K), the big German construction equipment and
escalator producer, is to reduce its workforce by 780, or 9.5 per cent, and
streamline its management as part of a reorganisation plan unveiled in
Dortmund yesterday.
The shake-up will reduce O&amp;K's workforce to 7,400, and comes on top of about
1,000 job cuts last year. It follows the approval by shareholders in Hoesch,
the German steel group which owns 75 per cent of O&amp;K, of the long-awaited
takeover by Fried. Krupp.
The reorganisation, as disclosed in the Financial Times earlier this week,
includes the sale of O&amp;K's plant and systems division to Hoesch. The
division will be combined with its counterpart at Krupp Industrietechnik.
O&amp;K said yesterday that the reorganisation and new corporate strategy was
aimed at ensuring 'the long-term and permanent strengthening and
stabilisation of the company.'
The company admitted that its expansion during the 1980s had led to
'dissipation and heavy burdens on the capital structure and personnel
resources.'
Coupled with the sharp fall in the US dollar and the big recent decline in
the western European construction equipment market, this has forced O&amp;K to
concentrate on its traditional strengths.
A new slimmed-down management structure will remove two levels of
management. In addition, Mr Dieter Schneider and Mr Wolfgang Starke will
join the 0&amp;K management board from Hoesch.
O&amp;K had total sales last year of DM2.38bn, from DM2.41bn in 1990, and will
report a loss for 1991 because of heavy restructuring costs and provisions.
Sales of the new-look O&amp;K are expected to reach DM1.8bn to DM1.9bn this
year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUGHES Aircraft, part of General Motors and the leading US defence
electronics group, is to axe over 9,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its
workforce, during the next 18 months. The move accompanies a significant
overhaul of the company's production facilities and business lines.
The restructuring - blamed partly on cuts in defence programmes and partly
on the weak economy - will result in an after-tax charge of Dollars 749.4m,
to be taken in the second quarter of 1992. Hughes said that about 60 per
cent of this figure related directly to the consolidation or elimination of
certain facilities.
Another 20 per cent - about Dollars 150m - is to cover redundancy payments
and other expenses. The rest relates to the costs of rationalising some
product lines, business and other assets.
Hughes did not disclose which specific businesses and plants would be closed
or merged. It merely stated in broad terms that 'a major facilities
consolidation' was being undertaken. But the company did make clear that it
was still planning to sell or close some businesses 'that are no longer
considered strategic to our growth'.
A year ago, Hughes announced organisational changes designed to put more
emphasis on commercial markets and lessen the company's dependence on
Pentagon contracts. US defence spending has been falling at around 5 per
cent a year, while Pentagon contracts still accounted for about 70 per cent
of Hughes sales. The company has said it would like to reduce this to around
50 per cent.
The bulk of the jobs lost will be in southern California, where two-thirds
of Hughes' 60,000-strong workforce is based.
Hughes added that there would be a further Dollars 40m charge on earnings,
because of a change in the way it recognises revenues from some of its
commercial businesses. This, it said, would be more consistent with the
practices in those industries.
Northwest Airlines, the heavily-indebted US carrier, said it was cutting 250
management jobs out of a total of 5,000, agencies report.
Boeing, the US aircraft maker, said it was in talks with China about
possible new aircraft orders this year, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The company also sought to play down the significance of a Dollars 1.2bn
deal announced on Monday by McDonnell Douglas to co-produce 40 commercial
aircraft in China. Boeing, a rival of McDonnell Douglas, termed the
McDonnell deal a mere 'follow on' to previous orders.
Boeing declined to elaborate what new orders it may receive from China's
airlines. But it said that by the end of the year more than 100 Boeing
aircraft would be operating in China.

of airports
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa is to take its Airports and air traffic services out of direct
government control and into two new companies.
Mr Piet Welgemoed, South Africa's transport minister, will today announce
the approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air
traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London
accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals, yesterday.
The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the
companies but both will be run on a commercial basis. The government should
be able to phase out its subsidies, said Price Waterhouse.
The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles about 12m
passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport.
Eight other airports will also be affected, including those at Cape Town and
Durban.
South Africa is an increasingly popular destination for air traffic: over
the past year, 25 airlines which had not previously offered flights to the
country applied for access rights.
Legislation will have to be passed before the proposal can proceed. 'This
could happen by the spring of next year,' said Mr John Wright, who is head
of regulation and competition services at Price Waterhouse.
A regulation committee will be established by the South African government
for the two companies, but will not have authority to intervene in the
everyday running of their affairs.
Airports and air services are currently run as part of a government
department. Mr Wright said that the move was not a prelude to any
privatisation.
The proposals to run them on a more commercial basis have been drawn up
since June 1991.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asko in DM413m write-off for
year
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASKO, the expanding German retail group, took a DM413m (Dollars 258m)
write-off last year on the value of its holdings in other companies and is
paying no dividend, although its main activities turned in a sharply higher
operating profit.
The company said that DM200m of the provisions related to its stake in Adia,
the Swiss employment and services agency which was formerly owned by the
stricken Omni group of financier Mr Werner Rey.
Adia is now controlled by Asko and Mr Klaus Jacobs, the Swiss businessman.
A further DM45m of the write-offs was in Lonrho, the UK company. The result
of the provisions was to reduce Asko's group net profits from DM282m to
DM6m.
At the operating level, Asko turned in sharply higher profits of DM681m
against DM421m. Cash- flow was DM800m after DM494m last time.
For this year, Asko said it expected operating profits to be similar to
those of 1991. Restructuring at the self-service department stores and the
setting up of its TIP discount chain had eroded profits early in the year,
however.
Group sales in the first four months rose by 12 per cent, but Asko gave no
figures. In 1991, turnover was DM18bn (DM10.9bn).
Shares of the company were suspended on Monday pending the announcement of
the write-offs and the decision to pay no dividend after last year's
distribution of DM17 per voting share and DM19 per preference unit.
Asko has said it intended to concentrate in future on its main store, food,
do-it-yourself, furniture, and clothing activities and shed peripheral
operations. It is opening 65 new stores this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAFNIA Holding, the embattled Danish financial services group, yesterday
asked for its shares to be suspended while police investigate transactions
by a senior manager on the company's behalf.
The suspension came a day before subscriptions open for the group's rights
issue, which is intended to raise DKr2bn (Dollars 341m) to stabilise the
group's financial position.
The group's equity capital has been virtually exhausted, partly as a result
of the unsuccessful attempt last winter by Hafnia and Norway's UNI
Storebrand to acquire control of Skandia, Sweden's largest insurance
company, and by falling bond and share prices in Denmark this summer.
Hafnia's latest problem was discovered when it was called on to redeem
options to buy shares in Interbank, a small bank owned by the listed
professional soccer club, Brondbyernes Fodbold.
The purchases of Interbank shares were intended to secure loans from
financial houses to the football club, according to Hafnia.
The options, for a sum totalling DKr288m, were established without the
knowledge of the directors, Hafnia said.
The deputy general manager responsible for the deal has been dismissed and
police have been asked to investigate the transactions.
The options were made at a share price which is higher than the intrinsic
value of Interbank, a difference amounting to DKr35m to DKr45m, said Hafnia.

second-quarter profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SGS-THOMSON, the heavily indebted Franco-Italian semiconductor venture
formed in 1987, made a profit in the second quarter of this year.
'We were profitable in the second quarter, even after interest charges, and
we expect to be profitable in the third quarter,' a company spokesman said.
The group also hopes to be able to return to profitability for the whole
year.
The company has returned losses for each year except 1989. It introduced
restructuring measures in 1990, when it made an operating loss and a loss
after tax of about Dollars 100m.
Last year, it reported an increased loss after tax of Dollars 102.6m, due in
part to a hefty interest payment of Dollars 70m, but was able to report a
slight profit at the operating level.
ST, which is owned jointly by Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled
electronics company, and IRI/Finmeccanica, the Italian state-owned holding
group, is ranked third-largest among European semiconductor manufacturers in
revenue terms by Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy.
The group has, however, shouldered a heavy debt burden which totalled
Dollars 900m last year, and it has been expected that ST would need a
capital injection from the French or Italian government.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Heavy loss at Sodiaal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of France's dairy industry were highlighted yesterday when
Sodiaal, one of the largest dairies, announced heavy losses for last year
and joined forces with Bongrain, one of its competitors, to rescue Union
Laitiere Normande, an ailing dairy co-operative.
Sodiaal, which owns the Yoplait yoghurt brand, managed to reduce its net
losses from FFr347.2m in 1990 to FFr227.6m (Dollars 44.4m) in 1991 on
turnover which rose from FFr17bn to FFr17.5bn over the same period.
The French dairies have come under pressure because of structural changes in
the agricultural sector and the slowdown in the economy. They have also been
affected by greater competition from other food companies.
Dairies face further pressure due to the concentration of ownership in
French food retailing which has seen a series of mergers culminating in last
month's takeover of the Rallye supermarkets by Casino retail group.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: A question of maintaining levels - The
water industry's efforts to satisfy the regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE PHRASE has tripped, somewhat glibly, from the tongues of the privatised
water industry's chairmen as they rolled out their results over the past
month.
'The need to balance shareholders' with customers' interests' has become
their mantra, and has prefaced every sound-bite.
But with companies announcing average dividend increases of 10 per cent, and
profit increases ranging from 2 to 30 per cent thanks to price increases,
shareholders have more to celebrate than customers.
Dividend growth compares to about 3 per cent for the market, and confirmed
the attraction of water companies as high yielding, but low risk,
investments. These defensive qualities came to the fore last week, as water
shares rallied while the market feared dividend cuts at BP and elsewhere.
Dividend cover has also remained conservative, in spite of rising interest
costs, as companies' huge capital investment programmes mount up. Yorkshire
Water, for example, raised its dividend 10.2 per cent, but dividend cover
was unchanged at 2.9 times.
The reporting season was largely free of the acrimony of 12 months ago.
Profits and salaries have risen less dramatically.
The relationship with Ofwat has improved and water companies say both sides
now understand each other better. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general,
has appeared less confrontational of late, although his full views will only
become clear next month when he will officially comment on the results.
'I think the regulator has been through a learning curve as well and is now
doing a good job,' said Mr Nick Hood, chairman of Wessex Water.
Growth in companies' 'core', or regulated, water and sewerage business has
been predictable, rising in line with prices. Recession affected companies
in the south because of falling industrial consumption and empty houses.
Thames Water estimated that recession reduced revenues by Pounds 16m while
companies like Northumbrian, where recession has been less severe, reported
little impact.
But outside the core, in the 'enterprise' businesses which companies set up
to generate unregulated earnings, results have been poor.
Welsh Water said Hamdden, its hotel arm, had a 'disappointing' year while a
loss-making environmental services associate was sold at a loss to SAUR.
Southern Water also sold a similar associate, again to SAUR, which required
provisions of 'several hundred' thousand pounds, the company said.
Biffa, Severn Trent's waste management arm which was acquired last year,
made annualised operating profits of Pounds 12.5m, well short of the amount
needed to cover Pounds 25m in interest charges on the purchase price.
Original hopes for Biffa to meet its interest costs this year are 'unlikely'
to be realised, Severn Trent said.
Other non-core results were mixed. Northumbrian said its enterprise division
increased sales threefold, but operating results were 'insignificant'. North
West and Thames announced small profits from non-core businesses, but
pre-tax margins were below 3 per cent in both cases.
Companies claim it is too early to judge the success, or otherwise, of
diversification. 'This has to be seen as a long term investment,' Mr John
Bellak, chairman of Severn Trent, said of Biffa.
Part of the problem may be structural. Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, analyst at
County NatWest, talks of the 'Hanson syndrome'.
'The bigger water companies have such a large critical mass that developing
a non-core is tricky,' he said.
Non-core businesses are partly designed as a hedge against tightening
regulation of core water and sewerage services. Ofwat will conduct a
periodic review in 1994 of companies' K numbers, the amount by which average
prices can be raised above the rate of inflation.
But the problem for the companies, and for investors, is that the
regulators' views on non-core earnings, and how he intends to 'ring fence'
them from regulated profits, are still under discussion and will remain hazy
until after the periodic review.
'The question is whether it has been right to try and expand earnings
rapidly outside the core or concentrate on the core, as Anglian has done,'
said Mr Bill Dale, analyst at SG Warburg. 'We may not know the answer for
two or three years,' he added.
Despite occasional hiccups in the non-core, the three best regarded water
companies - Wessex, Northumbrian and Yorkshire - reported results as
expected and emerged with their reputations intact.
Wessex and Northumbrian are seen as small enough to generate meaningful
non-core businesses. Wessex's joint venture with Waste Management
International of the US made a first contribution of Pounds 900,000,
slightly ahead of expectations. Yorkshire more than made up for higher than
expected provisions through improved efficiencies. It has now accelerated
its investment programme.
Elsewhere, only Welsh came out badly. Apparent back-tracking on its
diversification plans, and a promise to extend price abatements until 1995
unnerved investors who must now asses how vulnerable the company's perceived
high K number is to regulatory action.
This year, profits growth for the industry is set to slow, although average
dividend increases of 10 per cent are expected to continue.
Average water charges, which rose 15.5 per cent last year, are set to
increase by only 9.7 per cent in 1992-93. This includes voluntary abatements
of price rises by all companies following pressure from Ofwat.
Decelerating profits are also a result of companies' increasing debt burden
as the industry pays for some Pounds 28bn of capital expenditure this
decade. Most companies have gone, or are about to go, from holding net cash
to net debt.
As the periodic review approaches, customers are becoming more important.
Ofwat wants companies to ask customers their views on pricing and levels of
service before submitting business plans for the second half of the decade.
Ofwat is also looking at ways to measure companies' relative efficiencies
and customer service.
'Any company which does well on customer service will be viewed kindly and
allowed a more generous K,' said Mr Dale.
If so, the chairmen's mantra of a balancing act may have to be seen to swing
back a little from shareholders towards the consumer.

New London, the oilfield services group, lifted pre-tax profits by 31 per
cent to Dollars 5.04m (Pounds 2.72m) in the year to March 31, compared with
Dollars 3.84m previously.
Turnover jumped to Dollars 113m (Dollars 44.7m), helped by the acquisition
of International Drilling Fluids last July. Drilling fluids and well
servicing revenues now account for more than 90 per cent of total revenues.
After tax and minorities net profits advanced by 76 per cent to Dollars
3.55m (Dollars 2.01m). Earnings per share were 3.5 cents (3.2 cents).
An extraordinary Dollars 4.81m provision was made against loss on the sale
of its US oil and gas exploration and production operations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Teredo Petroleum has changed its focus to concentrate on enhancing revenues
from producing areas and in line with this is altering its fixed assets
accounting policy.
The USM-quoted oil and gas producer saw pre-tax profits decline by 43 per
cent to Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 160,000 restated) in the half year to March
31, after exceptional costs of Pounds 65,000 connected to its reorganisation
under which exploration activity has been curtailed and staffing levels
reduced.
Sales in the six months declined to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 3.1m). Provisions
for exploration costs fell to Pounds 414,000 (Pounds 486,000) and interest
payments and exchange losses took Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 73,000).
Earnings fell to 0.3p (0.5p) per share.
The company said that the 'successful efforts' accounting policy reflected
the fact that the speculative exploration stage had been completed. A charge
of Pounds 18.8m had been made against reserves as a result of the change.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFE, the French engineering group, is compulsorily to acquire the remaining
shares in Cronite Group, after securing 91.6 per cent of the
Birmingham-based foundries company in its Pounds 7.3m recommended offer.
AFE announced yesterday that it owns or has received valid acceptances in
respect of 14.9m shares.
This comes some three weeks after Mr David Pinsent, alone on the Cronite
board in his opposition to the 45p per share offer, recommended shareholders
to accept AFE's bid when it went unconditional on May 27. This in turn
followed AFE's failure to speak for 50 per cent by the offer's first closing
date.
Yesterday Mr Pinsent, a former chairman of the company and now a
non-executive director said that another independent UK company had gone and
that he would resign 'in due course.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Berisford problems 'at last under control'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International, the property and commodities group which nearly
went into receivership in 1990, said yesterday that 'the problems of the
past are at last under control'.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, also said two non-executive directors, Sir John
Egan and Mr Murray Stuart, thought it a suitable moment to retire from the
board. Mr Stuart was the chief executive who carried through a Pounds 1.2bn
refinancing.
Mr Alan Bowkett was appointed chief executive in January when Mr Stuart
resigned his executive job to take up another appointment. Mr Bowkett's job
now, Mr Sclater said, was to identify market sectors with above-average
growth prospects and to develop an industrial strategy which could be
pursued through acquisitions.
The group yesterday reported interim results for the six months to end-March
showing a net loss of Pounds 58m (profit Pounds 178.8m) after extraordinary
costs of Pounds 45.3m (gains Pounds 183.8m). There was a reduction in
shareholders' funds from Pounds 153m at the financial year end in September
to Pounds 95.6m. The shares fell 1p to 15 1/2 p.
A further Pounds 40m provision has been made against Berisford's loan
guarantees to Rayner Coffee International, its 45 per cent-owned coffee
trading associate. A review of RCI's business has persuaded Berisford it is
unlikely to become a strong business capable of attracting buyers.
Berisford has made its continuing support of RCI conditional on RCI making
asset sales to repay debt. Even so Berisford estimates it will have to sell
some of its own assets to meet its obligations under the guarantee to RCI.
The group had net cash of Pounds 3.8m compared with net debt in the
September balance sheet of Pounds 1.5m. However, at the end of March
Berisford was guaranteeing Pounds 49.4m of RCI's debt.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: GEC boosted by joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC's results yesterday disclosed how far the company had changed since the
formation in 1989 of its three joint-ventures with Alsthom of France in
power engineering, Siemens of Germany in telecommunication and General
Electric of the US in consumer appliances.
About Pounds 3.3bn of GEC's turnover of Pounds 9.44bn last year came from
the main joint-ventures, which generated 43 per cent of the operating profit
of Pounds 702m. Interest income was virtually unchanged at Pounds 105m,
largely because a Pounds 350m increase in net cash offset the impact of
lower interest rates. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 818m to Pounds 829m
on a slight fall in turnover from Pounds 9.48bn to Pounds 9.44bn.
In the past three years GEC's profits from continental Europe have risen by
42 per cent to Pounds 199m, while UK profits have fallen from Pounds 430m to
Pounds 393m as a consequence of the recession.
All the joint-ventures increased their operating-profits.
GEC-Alsthom was mainly responsible for a Pounds 34m increase in the power
system's operating profits to Pounds 157m, on a Pounds 230m increase in
turnover to Pounds 2.76bn. Financial controls at GEC helped to raise
operating margins at GEC-Alsthom from 4.4 per cent to 5.3 last year. The
joint venture's order book grew strongly largely due to sales of equipment
for combined cycle power stations and orders for locomotives and rolling
stock.
Sales of the telecommunications division fell from Pounds 1.25bn to Pounds
1.13bn mainly because of lower orders from British Telecommunications for
the System X exchange made by GPT, the joint-venture with Siemens. However,
the division's operating profits rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds 127m through
cost cutting. GPT was also responsible for much of the Pounds 350m increase
in the net cash GEC generated last year, largely through tighter management
of stocks and debtors.
Despite the severity of the UK recession, which the group believes is far
from over, the consumer goods joint-venture with GE increased profits by
Pounds 3m to Pounds 21m on a Pounds 3m fall in turnover to Pounds 268m.
Further rationalisation of the UK consumer appliance factories is planned
for this year.
The performance of the joint ventures together with the medical equipment
division, which increased profits by Pounds 6m, helped to offset a poorer
performance from several other divisions.
GEC-Marconi, the defence business, did not make provisions for
rationalisation costs should Germany pull out of the EFA programme.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 20m were largely responsible for a Pounds 9m
fall in Marconi's operating profits to Pounds 260m, on a Pounds 19m increase
in turnover to Pounds 2.78bn.
Elsewhere, profits of the office equipment division, largely accounted for
by AB Dick, the troubled US group, fell by Pounds 9m to Pounds 17m,
industrial apparatus' profits fell by Pounds 9m to Pounds 27m, distribution
and trading turned in profits Pounds 5m down at Pounds 15m, while profits at
electronic metrology, mainly Gilbarco, the US petrol pump maker, and Avery,
the weighing machine maker, fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 36m.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ICL buys personal computer distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has an 80
per cent stake, is spending an initial Pounds 30m to buy Technology, a
leading personal computer distributor.
Its intention is to overtake IBM, Compaq and Dell, the US manufacturers, to
become the dominant supplier of personal computers and open systems in the
UK. It is aiming for sales of more than Pounds 500m within five years.
Technology has reseller agreements with IBM, Compaq and Toshiba, however,
which implies that ICL will, for the first time, be marketing rival products
in competition to its own.
IBM refused to comment yesterday, saying its reaction would depend on ICL's
future strategy for its acquisition.
ICL has a thriving personal computer business based on machines designed and
built by Nokia, its wholly-owned Scandinavian subsidiary, worth Pounds 100m
a year. Its existing direct sales channel is growing at 25 per cent a year
but Mr John Gardner, ICL (UK) managing director, said: 'If we want to be
number one, we will have to grow faster than that. There is a limit to
organic growth.'
Technology, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.3m last year on sales of
Pounds 130m, is privately held. The main shareholder is Schroder Ventures.
The total price of the deal, which could rise to Pounds 40m, will depend on
future performance.
ICL will merge its own third party distribution activities into the company,
which will continue to be run by Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and chief
executive, and his management team. ICL business is expected to comprise
about 45 per cent of Technology's total activities.
The combined group will be the UK's largest personal computer and open
systems reseller and distributor with revenues of some Pounds 250m, ahead of
P&amp;P and Computacentre, its two main rivals.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Retail chief's departure adds to worries
about Asda performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Harker resigned yesterday as retail director of Asda, the
Leeds-based grocery chain.
The company said the appointment of an external replacement would be
announced shortly.
Mr Harker's departure came as little surprise to the City. Analysts said he
had long been associated with Asda's now-discredited 'old guard' and did not
fit in well with the new team of retailers being assembled by Mr Archie
Norman, who became chief executive at the end of last year.
Nevertheless, Mr Harker's resignation compounded recent worries about Asda's
performance and sent its share price down 2p to 29p yesterday. Concerns have
also been raised about the pending flotation of MFI, in which Asda has a 25
per cent stake. The pricing will be announced today.
Asda, which is still struggling under a high level of debt, is due to
announce its annual results on Monday when it is expected to report weak
trading and to take a substantial write-down on the book value of the 60
stores it acquired from Gateway for Pounds 705m in 1989.
Some institutional shareholders are believed to be dissatisfied with Asda's
performance following last year's Pounds 357m rights issue.
At the time, Cazenove persuaded half a dozen big institutional fund managers
to support the fund-raising by highlighting its turnround potential, but
Asda's shares have languished ever since and still stand below the 35p issue
price.
Mr Patrick Gillam, Asda's chairman, will meet several leading institutional
shareholders next week 'as a matter of routine'. Institutional shareholders
will be keen to hear about the progress the company has made over the past
six months and its future strategy.
Last month, Asda unveiled the first of its Dales supermarkets, which offer a
range of 7,000 discounted goods in a smart superstore setting.
Asda also announced yesterday that it was restructuring its administration
by contracting-out much of its legal, insurance and employee-savings work.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Charter Consolidated declines 4.8% but
increases dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTER Consolidated, the industrial holding group with a 38.5 per cent
stake in Johnson Matthey, the metals business, reported a 4.8 per cent fall
to Pounds 73.8m in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
The previous year's figures were after a Pounds 2.4m exceptional charge.
The strong balance sheet and relatively small fall in profits encouraged the
board to propose a final dividend of 14.5p to give a total of 21.5p (21p).
The dividend is almost twice covered by earnings per share of 42.5p (44.6p).
Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive, said the group had done well in
difficult trading conditions.
The shares rose initially yesterday but fell later, to close 2p down at
538p.
Mr Herbert said three of the four businesses managed within the group
increased trading profits, with JM's contribution virtually flat at Pounds
25.5m (Pounds 25.6m).
Group turnover was 1.3 per cent lower at Pounds 1.1bn, and operating profits
were down 2.5 per cent to Pounds 59.2m. Interest on the group's cash
balances fell, contributing Pounds 14.6m against Pounds 19.2m.
Mr Nigel Robson, finance director, said every one point fall in interest
rates cut group profits by Pounds 2m. Net cash fell from Pounds 133m to
Pounds 121.7m over the year although Pounds 30m was spent on acquisitions
and Pounds 25m on capital expenditure.
Mr Herbert said that in a 'challenging year' cost-cutting and a push to
increase overseas business had helped contain the profit fall.
At the Anderson mining equipment subsidiary 550 jobs had gone in the year,
cutting the workforce to 1,100 compared with 2,200 two years ago. Of the
Pounds 27m provision set up at Anderson a year earlier, Pounds 15m remained.
Pandrol, the rail track equipment business, lifted operating profits by 9.3
per cent to Pounds 11.8m, while the mining equipment division increased
profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.8m. Quarrying and mining profits rose
from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 3m, but building products profits were down from
Pounds 17m to Pounds 12.5m.
COMMENT
There are two ways of looking at Charter. It can be seen as a vehicle of
Minorco, which holds 36 per cent of the shares. That view could be supported
by the slightly surprising, though welcome, increase in the dividend, and
Charter's seeming inability to deal with the JM stake. On the other hand,
Charter could be a victim of circumstance, manfully running its
majority-owned businesses and trying to invest its substantial cash balances
sensibly. The truth probably falls somewhere between the two. On forecast
profits of Pounds 75m the prospective p/e is 12.3. Looking at it another
way, subtracting the value of the JM stake and the cash makes the rest of
the business look distinctly cheap. But more action is needed before that is
likely to change.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman shares dive 14 1/2 p as
losses reach Pounds 7.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Jones &amp; Shipman, one of the UK's three remaining publicly-quoted
machine tool companies, fell by nearly a third yesterday after the
Leicester-based company announced a Pounds 7.35m pre-tax loss and omitted
its final dividend for the second year running.
The loss for the year to March 31 compared with a deficit of Pounds 960,000
last time. It was accompanied by the announcement of a new business strategy
which will progressively halve the workforce of 500, take the group out of
the machining of parts, see the disposal of non-core small tools and honing
machines businesses, and allow the group to concentrate on precision
grinding machines.
The shares dropped from 45p to 27p after the announcement, before recovering
to 30 1/2 p. Losses per share were 56.1p, compared with 8.2p, while turnover
dropped from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 15.9m. A nil dividend for the year
compares with a 1p interim last time.
The restructuring will end nearly 100 years of parts machining at J&amp;S, which
will gradually move to subcontracting.
The Pounds 7.35m loss, which Mr John Wareing, managing director, admitted
was 'horrendous,' underlines the continuing severity of the machine tool
recession and the lack of confidence - especially among manufacturing
customers in the UK - to invest in capital equipment.
The group said market indicators suggested little improvement in trading
conditions before the end of 1992. Mr Wareing said inquiries from customers
were continuing at a high level, but the conversion rate into orders was not
as good as had been hoped.
The length and depth of the recession had prompted the group to announce a
fundamental change in its strategy - which has been under consideration for
the past 12 months - rather than adopt half-measures, Mr Wareing indicated.
A three-part strategy will produce 130 redundancies initially. This will be
followed by sales of the non-core businesses - Mr Wareing said J&amp;S was
already talking to a number of interested parties - and a progressive move
to subcontracting the machining.
Mr Wareing said the aim was to remove the heavy fixed cost of the machine
shop, which was large by the standards of European competitors. Eventually
this would enable the company to increase its returns when market conditions
improved.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Gresham House share price tumbles on loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRESHAM HOUSE, an investment trust specialising in the two areas recently
most prone to pitfalls - property and unlisted investments - yesterday saw
its share price collapse from 18p to 8p after it announced a second year of
losses. Fifteen months ago the shares traded at 300p.
The company said late on Tuesday night that a collapse in dividend and
interest income led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.87m in the year to
December 31. This followed a loss of Pounds 16.7m 12 months earlier.
Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that a
proposed re-financing under discussion with its banks was crucial to the
company's future. 'I think the worst will be over if we can sign up the
re-financing deal. If we can't, I will be struggling again,' he said.
Gresham is seeking the replacement of a short-term debt through the issue by
Gresham House Finance of up to Pounds 8.5m of 2.5 per cent secured loan
stock.
Gresham also said group net asset value, including property and other
subsidiaries, had turned negative to minus 18p from 129p a year earlier. Net
asset value of the actual investment trust, excluding subsidiaries, remained
positive although its net asset value fell from 91p to 62p.
Gresham, which is unrelated to Gresham Trust, the venture capital company,
is the second high-profile investment trust to hit trouble. Drayton
Consolidated Trust, managed by Invesco MIM, wrote off over half the value of
its unlisted assets in May.
Mr Stirling said dividend and interest income fell from Pounds 2.05m to
Pounds 471,000 after Gresham was forced to liquidate 'the majority' of its
non-property portfolio to pay off debts. He said details on Gresham's net
borrowings and gearing levels were not available. Interest costs fell only
slightly to Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 2.91m).
He confirmed that Gresham was being sued for Pounds 1m in relation to the
placing into receivership of a subsidiary. Court rulings have so far gone
against Gresham, which intends to appeal to the House of Lords.
Gresham intends to continue disposing of investments and properties to
reduce borrowings.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Price increases behind rise to Pounds 142m
at Midlands Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLANDS Electricity, the regional electricity company, yesterday rejected
claims from a consumer organisation that its bumper profits of Pounds 67 per
customer meant it should have frozen prices in April 1991, rather than
increasing them by 10.9 per cent.
On a historical cost basis, Midlands' pre-tax profits for the year to March
31 were Pounds 142.1m, up some 30 per cent from the Pounds 109.7m reported
for 1991. Turnover increased by 9.4 per cent from Pounds 1.33bn to Pounds
1.45bn.
The company said it had cut prices to consumers in real terms this April
when it announced an increase of only 1 per cent. This was in spite of the
fact that costs in its main electricity distribution business had risen 4.5
per cent over the year, said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman.
The large increase in prices and profits last year arose because the
company, like other regional concerns, had compensated for undercharging the
previous year, Midlands explained.
The supply business, which buys and sells bulk electricity, earned the
second highest profit reported by a regional company so far, at Pounds 8.3m.
Midlands improved operating profits in its retail and contracting
businesses, which made Pounds 1.1m and Pounds 800,000 respectively, compared
with Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 100,000 the previous year. The company's
generation business made a Pounds 1.3m contribution.
Operating profit from the main distribution business improved by 36 per
cent, as tariffs rose and controllable costs fell by 9.3 per cent or 4.7 per
cent excluding interest reductions.
Some 460 jobs have been cut since April 1991, leaving a workforce of about
7,500.
The outlook for the business was good, Midlands said, as sales of
electricity should grow by 0.5 per cent next year, and another 4 per cent is
likely to come off the company's costs.
Earnings per share were 49p against 35.7p last time and a final dividend of
11.6p makes a total for the year of 17.25p (10.5p).
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 157m and Pounds 160m next
year, putting the company on a prospective p/e of 6.8 to 7.5. A dividend of
about 19p is forecast.
COMMENT
Supply profits depend more on formulae set at privatisation than management
acumen - give or take a little clever cost allocation. Even so, if Midlands
can undercharge customers for supply by a cumulative Pounds 37m and still
make money, it will keep return on capital down and please the regulator
without penalising shareholders. Meanwhile, unlike several regional
companies, Midlands has improved retail and contracting profits and is
getting a small profit from its solid generation business. But while its
modest investments in energy service and gas marketing look sensible, some
City observers worry about the company's talk of investing in power stations
overseas, especially when it still has some way to go on customer service
standards at home.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: In Shops drops plans to bid for Amber Day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Amber Day fell 9p to 41p after In Shops, the Birmingham-based
stores group, said it had decided against proceeding with any offer for the
discount retailer.
In Shops halted the recent slide in Amber Day's share price on Monday when
it said it might make a bid. However, it decided against proceeding 'after
consultation with advisers and having taken account of the views of
shareholders.' In Shops shares closed 6p higher at 81p.
The much greater size of Amber Day meant that In Shops' expression of
interest was greeted sceptically in the City. The potential bidder's
institutional shareholders were reluctant to pursue Amber Day, which has
seen its share price collapse from 126p following criticism concerning Mr
Philip Green, chairman and chief executive.
Amber Day shares were also hit last month by a profits downgrading and the
departure of the finance director and only non-executive director.

<TEXT>
WILTON Group, the USM-quoted company which is moving out of property
investment to concentrate on the activities of its Glenchewton subsidiary,
formerly Cowan de Groot, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 39,000 for
1991.
This compared with a Pounds 1.08m loss previously, before Wilton raised its
holding in the toys, electrical components, hardware and housewares group
from 29 per cent to 69.9 per cent. Sales jumped to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds
4.27m).
Glenchewton reported results for the eight months to December 31, bringing
its accounting period in line with its parent. A pre-tax loss of Pounds
275,000 was taken on sales of Pounds 20.6m. The 12 months to April 30 1991
ended with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m on sales of Pounds 31.6m.
Wilton has made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 2.72m for property
disposals. These disposals, together with the Pounds 1.5m placing in
January, are intended to cut debt. A capital reconstruction is also planned.
Wilton's losses per share for the year were 0.002p (0.26p) and Glenchewton's
for the eight months were 1.54p (2.99p earnings).
Glenchewton has agreed to sell EWL Electric, an Irish Republic-based
importer and distributor of electrical products, for IPounds 2.26m (Pounds
2.07m). The purchaser is Edmundson Electrical, part of Marlowe Holdings,
which itself holds 15 per cent of Glenchewton.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: British Bio raises Pounds 30m via shares
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Bio-technology Group yesterday raised Pounds 30m before expenses via
a placing of its shares, mostly in the UK.
The issue, the first flotation of a bio-technology company in London, valued
the company at Pounds 151.8m.
The 7.06m shares were priced at 425p, right in the middle of the 400p-450p
target range the Oxford company gave in its pathfinder prospectus.
They closed on their first day of trading in London up 25p at 450p.
They also traded in the US on the Nasdaq market.
'We are delighted to get away in such a difficult climate,' said Mr Keith
McCullagh, chief executive.
'This shows there is an exit route for venture capitalists investing in
biotechnology and should encourage further investment in the sector.'
Mr Henry Somerset, a director at Kleinwort Benson, the issue's lead manager
and principal underwriter, said: 'The situation at the Daily Telegraph . . .
will have no effect on British Bio-technology. All of the stock has already
been placed with institutions.'
About 85 per cent of the placement was in the UK and 7.5 per cent in
continental Europe.
Morgan Stanley is lead manager in the US, for which only 7.5 per cent of the
stock was earmarked.
An additional 1.06m shares are available in the form of American Depositary
Shares as a 'green shoe' option to cover over-allotments or for price
stabilisation.
Mr McCullagh said demand in the US had been below expections when the
flotation had been planned in March.
US investors have shown increasing disenchantment with the biotechnology
sector in recent months.
British Bio-technology now has Pounds 60m in cash reserves, following a
private placement of Pounds 40m last year, said Mr McCullagh.
He said this should be sufficient to allow the company to bring its products
to market.
It is concentrating on four therapeutic areas: inflammatory diseases such as
arthritis; cancer; vascular and heart disease; and viral infections,
including Aids.
It has two drugs in early clinical trials and trials on a third are expected
to begin in August.
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge-based biotechnology company, yesterday
announced that it had sold 1m American Depositary Shares at Dollars 10 each.
Net proceeds after expenses will be between Dollars 8.5m and Dollars 9m.
The stock will be traded on Nasdaq.
The company said it would be looking for a London listing in the future.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Anglo American sells itself to the world: The world's
largest natural resources group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when Anglo American Corporation, the world's largest natural resources
group, decides to let in some light on its business, political events rudely
refocus attention on whether investing in South Africa makes sense.
Anglo's first roadshow for international investors reaches London today
after earlier performances in continental Europe. It has coincided with
South Africa's descent into political crisis following the Boipatong
massacre.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo's chairman, is phlegmatic about the
timing: 'Now is not an ideal time, but having said that, you're also not
going to run away from it.'
Anglo executives take comfort from the thought that the roadshow is intended
to offer a longer-term view of the company's prospects. In its 75-year
history, it has played a central role in South Africa's gold, platinum and
coal mining industries, and in the development of local manufacturing.
It has also survived the difficult years of apartheid, isolation, and
frequent tension with the government. Now the question is whether the group
can flourish in the new South Africa.
Anglo itself is not in any doubt. As one analyst notes, its executives
sometimes give the impression that, having headed off the threat from South
Africa's Afrikaans speakers, they are confident they can cope with any
challenge from the country's black community.
The future, however, will require satisfying domestic politicians and
international investors. Critics say Anglo's inbred business culture will
need to change. Mr Richard Stuart, analyst at stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co,
says: 'The mood is not right for this massive, centralised company.
'Anglo American is pretty much an anachronism from an international point of
view with its cross-holding structure rendering management basically
unaccountable to shareholders.'
Mr Ogilvie Thompson argues that being bid-proof allows Anglo to take the
long view, 'without having to bother that if your quarterly results aren't
good enough Mr Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts are going to come in and change
the whole thing'.
The complicated control structures reflect the fact that Anglo remains a
family business. Although Mr Harry Oppenheimer, son of the founder, retired
as chairman 10 years ago, his views feature prominently in this week's
presentation. Mr Ogilvie Thompson is unapologetic about the family
influence. 'I think any chairman of Anglo who didn't consult on the major
issues with someone who built the place up, someone that obviously has
ability and who has a substantial shareholding, would be a fool.'
Critics, however, say Anglo is run by too many polished Oxford-educated
courtiers, for whom relations with the family matter more than commercial
ability.
There are signs, however, that the group is changing. Anglo is discussing a
possible bid for some European food assets with Royal Group, an
entrepreneurial South African company, suggesting a new adventurism both in
terms of partners and markets. Mr Leslie Boyd's appointment as a deputy
chairman is evidence that an Oxford manner is not essential to rise to the
top.
With its three main associates - De Beers, Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment (JCI) and Minorco - over which it has effective control, Anglo's
market capitalisation at June 1 of Dollars 22.4bn (Pounds 11.7bn) makes it
the world's largest natural resources group. It controls 23 per cent of the
capitalisation of the Johannesburg stock exchange, down from 30 per cent in
1990, when gold mines were doing better.
That size makes it a natural target for a future left-of-centre government,
as South Africa moves towards majority rule. Anglo has years of contacts
with opposition figures on which to draw for goodwill, but it is impossible
to believe that a future government will not take some steps - such as
taxation of inter-group dividends - to encourage unbundling.
In the meantime, analysts forecast a fairly flat earnings performance for
the 1993 year. The best performance will probably come from financial
services, with banking profits reasonably buoyant in South Africa, and
interest income from Minorco, the overseas investment arm.
The main mining interests -
gold, diamonds, coal, platinum and base metals - are not expected to show
much change. Anglo owns stakes in some of the world's best mining assets.
Its gold mines are second in quality only to Gold Fields; Vaal Reefs and
Western Deep Levels are two of the richest gold mines in the world. Anglo
has considerable exposure to diamonds through De Beers and Anamint; and it
owns 24 per cent of Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer.
Demand for these commodities is dependent on strong world economic growth,
however. Slow growth in the past two years has held down profits, and there
is no immediate prospect of an upturn.
Management has managed to keep gold production costs flat in nominal terms
since the end of 1990, in spite of double-digit inflation. But the mines
need a higher gold price to stop the inexorable profit squeeze. Gold
contributed only 11 per cent to equity earnings in 1992 compared with 41 per
cent in 1983.
Diamonds also need an upturn in the world economy, and a return of consumer
confidence. An end to the gloom in Japan, which accounts for about a third
of diamond sales, is particularly eagerly sought.
Anglo's industrial assets, held mainly through Amic, are not of comparable
quality to its mining assets. Some, such as motor manufacturer Samcor, are
in businesses where it is not easy to make money in South Africa. Others
supply the mining industry and have suffered from their cutbacks. A company
such as Highveld Steel is well regarded, but it also depends on improved
stainless steel and vanadium prices.
Anglo is a core holding in any institutional portfolio in South Africa,
partly because of its dominance of the local economy, and partly because its
exposure to commodities offers a hedge against rand depreciation. It remains
to be seen, however, whether its new interest in marketing itself overseas
attracts a wider range of investors.

FT  02 JUL 92 / WPP finalises debt refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the international marketing services group, has reached agreement to
swap a quarter of its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 540m) of bank debt for equity.
Agreements signed yesterday with its 28-bank syndicate of lenders provide
for 239.5m new convertible preference shares to be swapped for Dollars
271.6m of debt.
WPP announced on May 13 that it was seeking its second refinancing since
April 1991.
The agreement, signed in the early hours of yesterday morning, must now be
put to shareholders; they will receive a document outlining the proposals by
July 12.
A banker involved in the deal said yesterday that 'there was a bit of give
from the banks at the last moment', which allowed a slightly improved offer
for the holders of WPP's 213m convertible preference shares.
Under the terms agreed yesterday shareholders will be offered an improved
rate of five times existing conversion terms, against roughly four times.
There are also 60m ordinary shares issued. According to a banker speaking on
behalf of WPP, the signed agreement could mean banks eventually holding 48
per cent of the group.
As part of the agreement, and subject to shareholder approval of the
conversion of the existing convertible preference shares, the banks have
also agreed to extend the deadline of the repayment of a Dollars 400m loan
from June, 1993 to June, 1997, when a further Dollars 604m loan falls due.
The banks have also agreed to provide new facilities of up to Dollars 150m
for two years.
WPP is confident that the revised proposal will reduce resistance among
disgruntled convertible shareholders, who at the beginning of June appeared
to be preparing a united front against the original proposal.
Under the terms of the deal such shareholders still stand to relinquish some
Dollars 46m in accumulated unpaid dividends - WPP is unable to offer any
dividend payments at least until June 1993 - and their 78 per cent of voting
rights will become 32 per cent. WPP has consistently argued that it was not
prepared to negotiate on the conversion terms.
WPP reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m for 1991, down 38 per cent, on
revenues of Pounds 1.2bn; without exceptional items, pre-tax profits were
Pounds 38.36m.

FT  02 JUL 92 / BAe in talks with Taiwan Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is to have talks with Taiwan Aerospace on a possible joint
venture to build regional jet aircraft.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's new chairman, is due in Taipei today as part of a
drive to secure the future of its loss-making regional jet aircraft
business.
Mr Denny Ko, Taiwan Aerospace president, said BAe was interested in the
possibility of co-producing medium-range passenger aircraft for sale in
China and other markets in the region.
The move is one of the strongest indications yet that Mr Cahill, who took up
his post two months ago after a period of disappointing performance for BAe,
intends radical changes for loss-making businesses such as the regional jet
aircraft operation.
BAe has already held talks this year with the big three Japanese
manufacturers - Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and
Fuji Heavy Industries - over a possible partnership in regional aircraft.
The company's regional aircraft business has been in difficulties for some
time.
'There are a number of our aircraft that have been built in anticipation of
rapid delivery and have not been sold. The market is very soft right now,'
said BAe yesterday.
The possibility of a BAe link with Taiwan could ease the worries of the
European Airbus consortium, the commercial aircraft maker in which BAe has a
20 per cent stake.
Airbus is concerned that BAe's talks with the Japanese companies could hurt
the consortium's own efforts to establish a partnership with the three in
research and development for a new 600-800-seat jumbo aircraft.
Taiwan's own interest in super jumbos faltered earlier this year when it
postponed a decision over whether to be involved in McDonnell-Douglas' plans
for a new 400-500-seat aircraft, the MD-12.
Taiwan Aerospace, 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, signed a
preliminary agreement last November to buy up to 40 per cent of McDonnell's
commercial aircraft operations for Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.05bn). However, the
two sides failed to reach a final agreement.
Taiwan Aerospace is also in talks with Russia's aerospace industry and
France's Aerospatiale on joint manufacturing, said Mr Ko.

FT  02 JUL 92 / BR plunges Pounds 145m into the red: Rail privatisation
prospects suffer setback as losses deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for the privatisation of British Rail worsened yesterday as it
became clear that the railway's brief era of profitability in the late 1980s
had decisively ended.
Results for the year to March 31 showed BR plunging into pre-tax losses of
Pounds 144.7m compared with the previous year's relatively modest loss of
Pounds 10.9m.
More significantly, the mismatch between falling income and record levels of
investment pushed borrowings up from Pounds 609.7m to Pounds 1.15bn - by far
the highest level since 1968, when they reached Pounds 1.6bn and triggered a
Pounds 1.2bn government write-off.
Board members acknowledged privately that the cost of servicing BR's
escalating debts meant the railway was unlikely to return to significant
profit in the foreseeable future, even in an economic upturn.
Recession was partly to blame for the rise in pre-tax losses. Passenger and
freight businesses alike suffered downturns in demand, leaving revenues
unable to keep up with rising costs. But the biggest impact on results came
from the severe deterioration in property profits and the cost of borrowing
to finance BR's Pounds 1bn-a-year investment programme.
In the late 1980s BR enjoyed three consecutive years of annual profits
exceeding Pounds 200m because of windfall gains from big commercial property
developments such as Broadgate, over London's Liverpool Street station.
These profits enabled the railway to finance investment from internal
resources. But with the commercial property boom now over, BR cannot make
enough money from running trains to plug the gap.
InterCity, commonly regarded as the jewel in BR's crown, barely broke even
in the year to March 31, its operating profits falling from Pounds 49.7m to
Pounds 2m. The only other part of the railway to show an operating surplus
was trainload freight, which made Pounds 67.5m (last year's figure for the
same period was Pounds 98.7m).
Railfreight Distribution lost Pounds 118.7m (Pounds 152.3m), Network
SouthEast lost Pounds 181.9m (Pounds 154.9m), and Regional Railways lost
Pounds 583.6m (Pounds 503.4m) - though the two passenger railway deficits
were more than wiped out by government subsidies of Pounds 892m (Pounds
601.5m).
BR's results come just two weeks before the expected publication of a white
paper setting out the government's plans for rail privatisation. The
corporation's poor financial performance may add to the private sector's
suspicions that there is little money to be made from running trains.
However, Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, the airline
company, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme yesterday that in the
next two weeks he would be submitting plans to BR to operate trains on four
to five routes.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Granada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least one UK company yesterday had the market scurrying to upgrade its
forecasts for the current year. Granada's 49 per cent jump in interim
profits was not only better than expected. The result also strongly suggests
that the management broom of new chief executive Gerry Robinson is sweeping
quickly down to the bottom line.
The extent of the cost cutting - reflected in a 12 per cent increase at the
operating level despite minimal help from the economy - is a bit surprising
at this belated point in the cycle. But that is a question for Mr Robinson's
predecessors. The issue today is whether, after outperforming by 65 per cent
over the last 12 months, the shares may not now run out of steam. At 257p,
the forward earnings multiple is 16 to 17 times, a rating which obviously
allows for the additional cost savings next year but which also assumes the
company will be able to generate new areas of growth.
The mature rental and increasingly competitive television business hardly
seem the likeliest of candidates, which leaves leisure and computer
services. The latter division's turnaround has been textbook stuff - cutting
out head office overheads and weeding out the dud contracts - and margins of
10 per cent should be established by the year-end. Whether Granada really
can go on to attack manufacturers' share of the maintenance market is
another matter.
In retrospect, investors probably over-reacted to the internal shenanigans
and rights issue drama a year ago. Granada's businesses have proved to be
fundamentally sound, and a progressive payout assured. But the shares are
still taking a lot on trust.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Continental/Pirelli
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to feel outrage at the efforts of Continental, the German tyre
company, to restrict Pirelli from exercising full voting rights over the 40
per cent it directly or indirectly controls. But investors attending
tomorrow's annual meeting should consider the risks before they throw out
the limitation on any one shareholder voting more than five per cent. Unlike
the UK, Germany has no takeover code requiring all shareholders to receive
equal treatment in a bid. The five per cent rule, which gives bargaining
rights to a broad corpus of shareholders, is the only effective barrier to
takeover by stealth, as Hoesch found to its cost when confronted by Krupp.
By allowing Pirelli full voting rights, other shareholders would be giving
it effective control without gaining anything in return. Pirelli argues that
it is now too deeply engrossed in its own domestic restructuring programme
to entertain hostile intentions towards Continental. It is interested in
being enfranchised only so that it can extract full value from its holding.
Eventually, it could realise a higher price for itself through the sale of
its enfranchised stake. That might help Continental's share price by putting
Pirelli's shares in firmer hands, but the purchaser would have no obligation
to other shareholders. Germany needs a proper takeover code, if its
corporate sector is to secure more foreign capital. There is no point in
going half-way towards democracy, least of all when the benefit would accrue
to a company which originally acquired its interests through a network of
indemnified undercover alliances.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: GEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways of judging Lord Weinstock. Either he is a penny-pinching
manager, obstinately hoarding his pile of cash, or he is a grand strategist
with the rare talent of avoiding all the worst pitfalls of the defence and
consumer electronics industries. Yesterday's results may have prompted GEC
shareholders to opt for the latter view. Few indeed are the UK industrial
companies which can offer a secure dividend covered nearly twice by earnings
and more than twice by free cash-flow.
Less certain is how GEC would compare at a different stage in the economic
cycle. Its weakness remains its uncertain growth prospects. Defence markets
are shrinking. Though the damage from Germany abandoning the European
fighter aircraft project would be limited, it would still make GEC's
purchase of Ferranti look an expensive mistake. Earnings from
telecommunications will fall this year as System X winds down. Vigorous
growth in power systems also seems unlikely. One view is that GEC's
immediate hopes lie in its Pounds 876m net cash and the scope for its
consumer business to rebound as recovery takes holds. The two are mutually
exclusive, however. The consumer business would only recover in the unlikely
event that interest rates fell sharply. That leaves cash as the main driving
force behind earnings this year. In that case, GEC's yield of 5.5 per cent
compares rather badly with the average money market fund.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Turning off the tap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The resounding flop of the public half of The Telegraph's flotation raises
the question of whether UK corporations can still look to the equity market
as a source of funds. The Telegraph may be a special case, having suffered
unfairly from renewed publicity over the Mirror float. GPA may have been
special too, by virtue of the complexity of its business. But one scarcely
envies the advisers to MFI and Wellcome, or indeed to any company
contemplating a big rights issue.
It is not as if the Telegraph flop can be put down simply to a falling
market. Between the pricing of the issue and yesterday's close of the offer,
the FT-SE had fallen by only around 30 points. Nor is it a question of the
UK market being short of cash. Last week's gilts issue - the biggest in the
market's history - was swallowed readily enough by the domestic
institutions.
The real problem may simply be that in a period of terminal gloom about the
UK economy, investors have given up thoughts of capital gain and are
interested solely in security of income. This could prove a temporary phase
as the markets adjust to a new world of low inflation. But the companies
which offer such security - the utilities, for instance - are precisely
those which do not need cash in the first place. As with individuals, so
with corporations: those who were seduced into borrowing in the late 1980s
are perhaps being left to find their own salvation.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: No time to shout foul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH ALDOUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Allister Wilson's article ('Closing the gaps between expectation and
reality', June 25) is good - although he could have said it in four
sentences instead of 54. However, the accountancy profession would be larger
in stature if it admitted that all these matters have been well known for 20
years. For most of that time it suited the profession that accounts had
little meaning other than a consequential one and no one knew what an audit
was supposed to be. The fact that public disquiet and some huge legal
actions mean that this state of affairs no longer suits the profession is
hardly the best reason to shout 'foul - someone else should do something'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Time to state the case for an
anti-savings drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There would have been a time when the chancellor's heart would have leapt
for joy at the rise in the UK personal savings ratio of more than one
percentage point to 11.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1992.
But this time, if Norman Lamont's heart registered any reaction at all, it
was not joy. When a country is struggling to emerge from recession, a rise
in savings is the last thing a chancellor wants.
Of course, it can be argued that there are better ways of stimulating
domestic demand than weak personal savings. The chancellor could listen to
all the siren voices asking him for more government spending and to expand
the budget deficit still further from its probable level of Pounds 30bn
plus. Or he could take risks with Britain's hard won trend towards lower
inflation by slashing interest rates and leaving the Exchange Rate
Mechanism.
I know which of the three would carry least risk - lower personal savings.
Of course, the personal savings ratio is not an instrument of policy in the
way that the budget and short term interest rates are. But it would
nevertheless be helpful to get away from a mind set in which savings are
always regarded as good and consumer spending as bad.
Some of us can still recall the National Savings drives which were inflicted
on us at school where we were expected to buy stamps to provide a ship or an
aircraft. I was not as shocked as I was meant to be when Milton Friedman
said to me that these savings drives had been intended to reduce
inflationary pressure and they had not affected the government's military
programme. If savings drives helped to relieve inflationary pressure,
anti-savings drives might help to relieve deflationary pressure.
In fact, I had been inoculated against any excessive or automatic belief in
the virtues of savings when as a precocious schoolboy I read a book by a
popular science writer, Gordon Rattray Taylor. He wanted to get to the
bottom of why unemployment had been so high before the second world war. He
explained that the real Keynesian message was that savings had been too high
and this had led to the evils of low output, high unemployment and general
depression.
It still seems to me the essential message of Keynes's General Theory in one
sentence, although the long term persistence of heavy unemployment cannot be
explained without bringing in wage behaviour.
Now for the inevitable qualifications and complications. To start with,
personal savings are only part of savings and very often not the most
important part. What matters from the point of view of the national economy
is total savings, including those of business and government.
It is puzzling that so inadequate an indicator as the personal savings ratio
has been such a good contemporaneous indicator of the state of the economy.
Personal savings were last near their present level in 1981, the bottom of
the previous recession. The personal savings ratio reached a low of 5.4 per
cent in 1988, the year of greatest inflationary pressure in the last boom.
Why is not more attention paid to the total national savings ratio? The
answer is that to do so would give the game away. For by the conventions of
national income accounting (whose inventors are now in Valhalla), savings
equal investment by definition. This is so in a closed economy or the world
as a whole.
Even in a single country investment is equal to savings plus the balance of
payments deficit on current account (or minus the payments surplus).
Many countries often have small gaps in their balance of payments; so true
savings ratios are not too different from investment ratios, and tell us
little about problems of boom, slump, capital shortage or surplus or
anything else. Even the UK's payments deficit is only 1 1/2 per cent of GDP.
For the world as a whole, the only gaps between savings and investment are
statistical errors and omissions. The inflationary or deflationary gap is
like one of these gaps in the mountains about which one reads in the guide
book, but which always keep receding further into the horizon.
The actual gap, which I have kept until the second half of this article for
the busy business read-er to avoid, is between intended sav-ings and
intend-ed investment. The two can be brought into line in a depression by a
fall in output and income to a level where savings are low enough to do no
more than offset the amount of investment that business is willing to carry
out.
But more stages are necessary in the argument. I have frequently criticised
the US obsession with the Japanese balance of payments surplus by saying
that it was just the mirror image of a Japanese savings surplus which was
performing a valuable function in promoting world investment and keeping
down world real interest rates.
Why then cannot any tendency for savings to exceed investment in the UK be
offset by a balance of payments surplus, Japanese style, instead of the
familiar deficit? No doubt the answer is long and complex and contains
structural elements. But the immediate reason why British industry cannot
easily make up abroad for any shortfall or demand at home is that the
tendency to slow growth and recession is worldwide.
The Germans are exceptional in still being in a situation where there is
more danger of excess demand than of deficient demand, thanks to unification
pressures. But in most other places the complaint is that consumers are not
spending enough. In Japan, the reluctance of consumers to accumulate more
debt is leading not just to a higher balance of payments surplus but to
recession.
How about, I will be asked, the much-discussed world capital shortage? What
world capital shortage? Obviously the former Communist countries could make
use of more funds both to replenish their capital stock and to help their
own hard-pressed consumers until their economies revive. But there is a
difference between a desire or even a need for capital and an effective
demand for it on terms that western investors are willing to meet. At
current levels of interest rates, wage rates, prices and so on there is
inadequate demand for capital to meet the world's savings potential.
The hardest piece of evidence against my view that intended savings are too
high is the obstinate tendency of world real interest rates to remain stuck
at about 4 per cent, judging by the yield on long term UK indexed bonds.
I cannot pretend to explain this completely. One possibility is that
although there is no effective capital shortage now, there will be in the
future and that the recession is just - for all its agony - a phase. A
related possibility is the fear that under the influence of recession or
just political weakness, governments might overdo the deficit spending and
create an excess demand for loanable funds in future. Yet another
possibility is that the bond market is just being lethargic in reacting to a
changed situation. The operators in it may have an exaggerated fear of
deficit spending.
If that is the case, then real interest rates will eventually drop. But in
the meanwhile some cushion is required; and it is as well that the maximum
levels of budget deficit decreed in Maastricht look like being exceeded not
only in the EC but in the world as a whole.

Tonight, as so often on summer evenings these days, it looks as though you
will be better off in the garden with a book, weather permitting, or
sampling some Australian Chardonnay or Peruvian Sauvignon, than watching TV.
Of course the book or the wine or both could be accompanied by your personal
stereo tuned to Radio 3 which, at 7.30, offers the BBC Symphony Orchestra
playing the world premiere of a piece by Edward Shipley, followed by Brahms'
Violin Concerto and Nielsen's Symphony No 5.
The funniest thing about supercilious documentaries which look back to the
moral codes of earlier ages and snigger is their blindness to the equal
absurdity of today's codes. True Stories undertakes to reveal all about
'Heavy Petting', the teenage substitute for sex in fifties America,
promising us a 'hilarious documentary'. Can you imagine how funny
television's assiduous toeing of the politically correct line on Aids is
going to look in 40 years time? BBC1's tabloid telly series 999 (9.30) which
shows films or reconstructions of heroic rescues today screens an amateur
video record of the boy who fell into the gorilla pit at London Zoo.

THE BEST INTENTIONS (12) Lumiere, Gate Notting Hill
THE RAPTURE (18) MGMs West End
THE INNER CIRCLE (15) Odeon Haymarket
CASABLANCA (U) Empire
It is Cannes Film festival delivery fortnight. A week after the film that by
wide consent should have won the 1992 Golden Palm, Robert Altman's The
Player, we welcome to Britain the film that did win the Golden Palm, Bille
August's The Best Intentions.
In the auteurist shorthand used and abused today, we say 'Altman's' and
'August's' films. But The Player owed much of its crackle to Michael
Tolkin's script from his own novel. (For more about Mr T read on in this
column.) And The Best Intentions boasts a script by Ingmar Bergman based on
the lives of his own parents. Who is to call it an August film rather than a
Bergman film?
It is certainly a long film. Three hours, and even that a digest of the
six-hour serial version simultaneously prepared for TV. If pressed against a
wall by a man with a gun, I would say that in some respects The Best
Intentions is not a film at all: more a roman fleuve in pictures about the
love between a rich girl with a possessive family, played by Pernilla August
 -the director's wife, who won the Cannes best actress prize - and a young
pastor with a blond moustache and a live-in guilt complex (Samuel Frohler).
Yet 20 minutes into this story, we scarcely care what aesthetic category we
put it into. Film or mini-series, family album or novel-with-pictures, it
surges majestically through the century's early years as Bergman recreates
the bitter-sweet romance of his mother Anna and father Henrik. Henrik is a
cold-eyed Lutheran priest, Anna a walking nervous breakdown. Between them,
in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye, they create the conditions
of elegiac dementia in which young Ingmar could be born.
This is a prequel to Fanny And Alexander. Some of the same gusty relatives
tack and billow across the screen, as turbulent variations are played on the
theme of family life. Anna's folk are wealth-encrusted Swedish bourgeoisie,
from raspy old Papa (Max Von Sydow) who watches the distant trains from his
mound of rugs by the window, to melting-eyed Mama, a pudgy former beauty who
hides reserves of malice in the folds of her outward kindness. Meanwhile
Henrik's Mama is a dotty old peasant woman living in the wilds and his
departed father has been replaced by an invisible, implacable,
incomprehensible God.
The defects of the parents are visited on the children and children's
children. As Henrik and Anna quarrel in their snowbound parish, which looks
as if it is a sermon's throw from the North Pole, their little son (Ingmar's
older brother) is nearly murdered by the surly ragamuffin they adopt out of
Christian kindness. He is a cousin to all those haunted, stark-eyed urchins
who have prowled through Bergman's films from The Seventh Seal to The
Silence.
Wonderfully elliptical even at its sprawling length, the film never
'explains' unhappiness or inhumanity. It merely exposes it vividly,
impassively, surgically on the snow-white sheet of the story's scenic
operating table.
Bergman the writer has lost none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone
and then beyond to the marrow. Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force;
reconciliations a melting poignancy; silences a terrifying ambiguity. If The
Best Intentions is less than the best of Bergman as a film - less than Hour
Of The Wolf or Persona or Fanny And Alexander - it is because August is more
skilled at shaping performances than shaping screen pictures. Bergman would
have let the madness of human hope and despair spill out into the lighting
and camerawork. August merely records that madness in the performances, but
the performances at best, especially from Mrs August, are richness enough.
If God is a supporting villain in The Best Intentions, he is the
arch-villain in Michael Tolkin's The Rapture. The writer of The Player wrote
and directed this electrifying fable about the evils of Christian
fundamentalism. Made on a mini-budget, it is part satire, part melodrama,
part visionary B-movie. One can imagine the moguls licking their lips. 'She
was only a switchboard operator,' the advertising copyline might run, 'but
she found a hot line to Heaven.'
The film's crazed primitivism is its strength. Mimi Rogers, who is fast
turning into today's Barbara Stanwyck, plays the telephone employee who
gives up her life as a daytime drudge and night-time debauchee - attending
swinger orgies with her suavely greying boyfriend Patrick Bauchau - when God
calls her 'collect'.
Will she pay for the call? Yes indeed. A bright light, a vision, a death;
then the poignant pleadings of her little daughter. Soon Miss R is out in
the desert waiting for God to snatch up her and the little one in a
pre-Judgment Day 'rapture.' But God moves in mysterious ways, especially
when He is the God of America's born-again fundamentalists. Even when
Gabriel's horn sounds in the film's astonishing finale, mystical
triumphalism is nowhere in sight. And the horsemen of the apocalypse pound
unfeeling through the mires of human grief and disenchantment.
If I spell out more of the plot, your own astonishment will be ruined. The
Rapture has a few first-time film-maker's faults: the over-urgent piling on
of saleable ingredients (sex, drugs, sudden death), too many
plonk-the-camera-down dialogue scenes. But it also has a first-time
film-maker's miraculous innocence. Scenes that a veteran would claim you
'could not do' are carried off here with a sublime insouciance.
The message of the film is that miracles do not happen: or not the useful,
daily miracles we pray for as distinct from the global magic act we all
await on Judgment Day. But this film is a miracle of its kind: a story that
pierces the veil between here and the beyond with a rough magic far more
powerful than the whimsical mysticism we have grown used to with Ghost and
company.
The Inner Circle is set in a city where everyone speaks English with a
strenuous Russian accent. It is Moscow in the 1940s, where according to
writer-director Andrei Konchalovsky (Maria's Lovers, Runaway Train) a young
man in the likeness of Tom Hulce served as film projectionist to a man with
a walrus moustache and Oriental eye make-up called Joseph Stalin (Alexandre
Zbruev).
While our hero falls under the tyrant's evil spell, his wife (Lolita
Davidovich) busies herself swinging between liberal goodheartedness - she
pays forbidden visits to a sickly-sentimental Jewish orphan (Bess Meyer) -
and cynical despair. In the latter mode, she lends her body to Bob Hoskins,
alias KGB chief Beria. They make love in his private train compartment as
the rolling-stock of history rattles towards Stalin's final days.
The first film ever shot in the corridors of the KGB, let alone Beria's
train compartment, The Inner Circle is also the umpteenth film to turn
truth-based political tragedy into dial-a-cliche melodrama. Overacted by
almost everyone in sight and scripted for stark risibility - 'F---off' says
Stalin to a VIP petitioner early on and the dialogue does not improve - it
comes to life only when raiding history direct. The climactic scenes of
people literally trampled to death in the crowds jostling towards Uncle
Joe's coffin shows the grim punishment that awaits a nation that misjudges
its leader during his life and turns misjudgment into deification after his
death.
Casablanca is 50 years old and has also undergone deification. But no
misjudgment here: the film is still a classic. Re-opening in a new 35-mm
print, it reanimates Bogart, Bergman and company and sets them dancing
through Rick's Cafe Americain as the dialogue crackles, the romance revs and
Dooley Wilson at the piano keeps telling us we must remember this. Who on
earth could forget?

John Wybrew is to take up the posts of chairman and managing director at
Windsor Life, rejoining the company after a two-year hiatus at British
American Assurance Company in Singapore. Wybrew, who joined Windsor in 1965,
replaces Brian Wood who resigned in April after insurance regulators
temporarily suspended the company's entire sales force, insisting that
proper training and testing procedures be put in place.
Windsor Life is wholly owned by the US's fourth largest insurance company,
New York Life, which has been running the company since Brian Wood's
departure. Wybrew was instrumental in Windsor Life's rapid expansion during
the 1980s - an expansion which presumably led to its acquisition by New York
Life in the first place.

The shakeout among the higher echelons of Britain's troubled construction
companies continues with the news that Jack Mawdsley, chief executive of
Tarmac's large quarry products division is to quit the group at the end of
this year.
The company's statement says Mawdsley, who is 53, is leaving to 'pursue
personal interests' which had been 'sadly neglected' during his 22 years at
the Midlands-based construction and building materials group.
One of the reasons behind Mawdsley's departure, however, may have been
disagreements over policy decisions taken by Sir Eric Pountain who gave up
day-to-day running of the company in February when he stood down as Tarmac's
chief executive. Sir Eric remains chairman.
In particular, Mawdsley opposed the continued high level of investment made
in housebuilding while other divisions including his own have had their
spending curtailed. He is understood to have been frustrated by Sir Eric's
reluctance to expand the quarry products division in continental Europe.
His decision to retire at the end of this year is understood to have been
taken before Sir Eric announced that he was standing down as chief executive
in favour of Neville Simms.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When David Evans (right) used to work his way around the world's central
banks in the early 1980s demonstrating Devon Systems International software
packages for managing financial risk, the product was little known, and
because of his name, it was commonly assumed to be his brainchild.
Now, Devon has 200 employees and the financial backing of its parent SunGard
of the US.
And Evans, who in those days was just demonstrating how the product helped
his then employer Samuel Montagu fulfil its reporting requirements, has
decided to join the UK subsidiary as a senior consultant.
The specialist in securities, derivative instruments and forex software
packages has been on the acquisition trail in recent months and Evans' task
is to provide advice on the right way to integrate and internationalise the
new purchases. His perspective will very much be that of a systems user. 'I
can't write a line of code,' he points out.
Evans, 44, for many years in charge of the operations side of the capital
markets business at Samuel Montagu and then Midland Montagu, was around in
the 'frontier' days of futures and options in London - in 1982 he recalls
spending a week trading on the floor of Liffe as soon as the exchange opened
just so that he understood exactly what was involved.
Those were early days for Devon, too, and Evans remembers weekends
'brainstorming' with chairman Cristobal Conde, helping with the 'real dirty'
systems development work.
The two have remained in touch since then and Evans notes how 'with the
market becoming much more staid recently, I am delighted to be doing what I
should have done many years ago'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Restitution claim can go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS BOARD v PANTELL
Court of Appeal:
Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Scott, and Lord Justice Steyn:
June 12 1992
A SOLICITOR who is knowingly concerned in his client's illegal financial
services transactions can be ordered by the court to take steps to restore
innocent investors to their pre-investment position or to remedy their
situation though he received none of the invested sums and was not party to
the transactions, provided the order is intended to effect, and might be
reasonably capable of effecting, restitution or a remedy.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by solicitors as
third, fourth and fifth defendants from a decision (FT, August 9 1991) of
Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, vice-chancellor, refusing to strike out the
claim against them in an action by the Securities and Investments Board
against Pantell SA and others.
The facts set out in the judgment were as alleged by the SIB, and for the
purposes of the striking-out application were assumed to be correct.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said that from about April 1988 to March 1989 Pantell, a
Swiss company, carried on unauthorised investment business in the UK.
In the course of that business Pantell distributed false and misleading
advertisements and made unsolicited telephone calls to persuade persons in
the UK to purchase shares in a Utah company, European American Corporation
Inc (Euramco).
The solicitors acted for Pantell.
Carrying on unauthorised investment business in the UK was a contravention
of section 3 of the Financial Services Act 1986. The publishing of
misleading advertisements contravened section 47. The advertisements had not
been approved of by an authorised person, in contravention of section 57.
The sale of shares in consequence of unsolicited telephone calls contravened
section 56.
The Act not only imposed criminal sanctions for contraventions, but also
provided remedies for investors who entered into share transactions as a
result.
Section 6(2) provided that if the court was satisfied a person had entered
into a transaction in contravention of section 3, it might order him 'and
any other person . . . knowingly concerned in the contravention to take such
steps as the court may direct for restoring the parties to the position in
which they were before the transaction was entered into'.
The SIB sought a remedy against the solicitors under section 6(2). It
alleged they were 'knowingly concerned' in Pantell's contravention of
section 3.
Section 61(1) provided that if there was a reasonable likelihood that 'any
person' had contravened sections 47, 56 and 57 or 59, the court might make
an order requiring him 'and any other person . . . knowingly concerned in
the contravention to take such steps as the court may direct to remedy it'.
The SIB sought a remedy against the solicitors under section 61(1), alleging
they were 'knowingly concerned' in Pantell's contraventions of sections 47,
56 and 57.
The solicitors denied they were 'knowingly concerned', but contended that
even if they were, on the true construction of sections 6(2) and 61(1) the
SIB was not entitled to the relief claimed. They asked for an order that the
action against them be struck out.
Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C dismissed the summons.
The solicitors' case was based upon the undisputed fact that none of the
payments made by the investors were made to them. The vice-chancellor
concluded that receipt of the money by the person 'knowingly concerned' was
not a necessary precondition of a restitutionary order under section 6(2),
nor of a remedial order under section 61(1). The solicitors appealed.
Mr Sumption for the solicitors submitted that the relief claimed under
sections 6(2) and 61(1) could not succeed, since it was a claim for
compensation for loss and there was no jurisdiction to order compensation
for loss against persons 'knowingly concerned'. He said the orders sought
were not restitutionary, because the solicitors had received nothing from
the investors and so had nothing that they could restore.
While orders made under section 6(2) and section 61(1) must be restricted to
their proper restitutionary purpose, it was not right to emasculate the
restitutionary remedy available against persons 'knowingly concerned' on the
ground that they were not liable to be subjected to compensatory remedies.
The precondition of an order under section 6(2) was that a person had
transacted in contravention of section 3.
The purpose of an order under section 6(2) must be to restore parties to the
transaction to the position in which they were before it was entered into.
So an order ought not to require a contravenor to repay the purchase price
of shares unless there was also provision for the return of the shares by
the investor.
Provided the precondition was met, the only limitations on the type of order
that could be made under section 6(2) that were justified by the statutory
language were that the order must be intended to restore the transacting
parties to their respective former positions and that the steps directed by
the order to be taken must be reasonably capable of doing so.
Subject to those limitations there was no reason why restrictions should be
placed on the type of order that could be made under section 6(2). The width
of the statutory language, 'such steps as the court may direct', was
striking and there was no good reason why it should be restricted. Nor did
the statutory language warrant any distinction between the type of order
that could be made against the contravenor and the type of order that could
be made against a person 'knowingly concerned'.
The fact that a person 'knowingly concerned' had not received anything under
the transaction did not restrict the court's power to make a section 6(2)
order against him.
Each investor must be willing that there should be a rescission of the
investment transaction in question, and be willing to return any shares or
money he had received under the transaction.
Similar points arose in relation to section 61(1).
There were two relevant preconditions before an order 'to take steps' could
be made under section 61(1).
One was that a person had contravened one of the statutory provisions
referred to in subsection (1)(a). It was alleged that Pantell had
contravened sections 47, 56 and 57. The second precondition was that there
were steps that could be taken for remedying the contravention.
The court was empowered if those two preconditions were satisfied, to make
an order for 'such steps as the court may direct' to 'remedy' the
contravention. The steps directed must therefore be intended to remedy, and
be reasonably capable of remedying, the contravention.
Subject to those limitations as to purpose and effect, there was no reason
to place further limitations on the steps the court could direct to be taken
under section 61(1).
In the light of that analysis of sections 6(2) and 61(1) it was not a valid
objection to the SIB's case that the solicitors had not received any of the
investors' money.
Orders under the sections should be directed to restoring not only investors
but all parties to their former positions, and not to a class but to
individual transactions. A restitution order could not remedy a section 57
contravention.
The appeal was dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE STEYN concurring said that the genesis of the provisions was
the widespread belief that operations of share-pushers were damaging the
integrity of the markets and contrary to public interest. Share-pushing
operations were only made possible because of the assistance of third
parties, such as bankers, accountants and solicitors.
'Knowingly concerned' was not defined. Mere passive knowledge would not be
sufficient. Actual involvement in the contravention must be established.
LORD JUSTICE NEILL agreed with both judgments.
For the solicitors: Jonathan Sumption QC and Leslie Kosmin (Barlow Lyde &amp;
Gilbert).
For the SIB: David Oliver QC and Thomas Lowe (Booth &amp; Blackwell.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories face rebellion on stamp duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is facing a possible backbench rebellion when the Labour
party uses next week's finance bill debate to propose an extension of the
eight-month 'holiday' on stamp duty.
A phalanx of senior Tory MPs, including some former ministers, have put
their names to a Commons motions calling for a temporary continuation of the
scheme or the abolition of the tax.
In total, the two motions have so far been signed by 62 MPs, and the number
of Tory signatories is well above the government's majority of 21.
Labour frontbench spokesmen said yesterday that the opposition would propose
keeping the concession in place for a further six months beyond the present
deadline of August 19.
Labour argues that although the scheme has not really worked in reviving the
housing market or construction industry so far, ending the concession would
still have a negative effect.
The move will hearten Labour MPs disappointed that they have so far caused
the government few tactical difficulties at Westminster, in spite of the
Tories' reduced majority.
Even if some Tories stop short of defying the whips on the vote, the debate
is expected to embarrass the government by highlighting the absence of
economic recovery in this area.
The government's decision to lift the point at which the 1 per cent levy
becomes payable, from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 250,000, was announced in
December as part of the government's measures to help home buyers.
One government whip admitted that Labour's decision might cause some
difficulty, although he thought the whips had managed to persuade some of
the Tories who had signed the motions.
Sir Malcolm Thornton, Tory MP for Crosby, has made clear that he will press
for a statement of intent from the government before the Commons disperses
for the summer in a fortnight's time.
Discussion of the finance bill in committee finished yesterday, and it is
due to be debated by the Commons as a whole early next week.
Ministers say that in the present public-spending round, extending the
concession and forgoing that revenue might ultimately make it more difficult
to cut interest rates. MPs who argue for a continuation of the scheme point
out that as it has not worked yet, the cost to the Treasury has been less
than the Pounds 420m estimated when the concession was announced.
Some senior ministers would like eventually to abolish the duty, but have no
plans to do so immediately because it is too valuable.
A Labour MP yesterday claimed the backing of prime minister John Major for
the principal of obliging the holders of public office to declare membership
of secret societies such as masonic lodges, David Owen writes.
Tabling a bill requiring such disclosure, Mr Chris Mullin, MP for Sunderland
South, said Mr Major had revealed his support for the idea in a 1986
questionnaire on freemasonry that was sent to all MPs.
Mr Mullin said he had a signed copy of the prime minister's answers
testifying to his belief that MPs, judges, local government officers and
others should be obliged to disclose their membership of masonic bodies.
Mr Mullin said the proposed measure - which would include a clause outlawing
discrimination against anyone on the basis of their declaration - was
'consistent with the government's stated ambition to create a classless
society.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock plan for successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Neil Kinnock warned Labour MPs yesterday that his successor as party
leader should not be forced to devote as much effort as he had to internal
reorganisation but must be allowed to 'accentuate the positive'.
He backed implicitly as swift a review as possible of the party machinery
after the general election defeat. His successor should be seen as winning
for the party, not within the party, he said.
At the same meeting, Mr Roy Hattersley, outgoing deputy leader, said the
party had spent so much time on internal reform and making clear what a
Labour government was not going to do that it had had neither the time or
the opportunity to set out what it stood for.
In spite of concern by some Labour MPs that the party's election inquest
would prove too superficial, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and favourite
to win this month's leadership election, wants any reform of Labour's links
with trade unions completed by the 1993 autumn conference.
Mr Smith is adamant that policy changes should not be rushed.
Mr Kinnock, in what may have been his last speech as leader to the
Parliamentary Labour party, said that 'years of denigration' of the party by
the Tory media had contributed to Labour's defeat.
Labour had to strive for trustworthiness so that if Conservatives repeated
'lies' about Labour's policies, they would not gain momentum. Labour had to
behave as a party that was serious about government.
The party also had to make clear that it backed 'efficient markets'.
The government's own figures show that since the election there has not been
the 'avalanche' of schools wishing to opt out of local authority control
that ministers had predicted, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, said that 56 schools had
decided to ballot parents on whether to become grant-maintained - a lower
rate than in the comparable period last year.

THE traditional queues formed early yesterday morning for the first day of
Harrods' summer sale.
The doors of the store in Knightsbridge, west London, were opened two
minutes early as Grand Prix racing driver Nigel Mansell officially launched
the sale.
The store's chairman, Mr Mohammed Al Fayed, is donating Pounds 50,000 to
charities chosen by Mr Mansell, including a hospital maternity wing.
Among the bargains in the sale were a diamond watch halved in price to
Pounds 40,000, a 25-in television set reduced from Pounds 729 to Pounds 199
and a microwave oven reduced from Pounds 279 to Pounds 99.
Mr Grant Lloyd, of Bracknell, Berkshire, had been queueing for more than two
hours for a Pounds 180 tennis racket on sale at Pounds 29.
'I'm actually hoping to get four. I know a few people who are interested in
them,' he said.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Fears on company car tax plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CARMAKERS and import-ers are concerned that Inland Revenue proposals for
restructuring company car taxation, expected to be published in the next few
days, will retain car-pricing bands to which the industry is opposed.
The review, which directly affects some 3m company car drivers, was ordered
by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, at the time of his March Budget.
Under the present system, the amount of tax payable by a company car user on
the benefit of the private use of the car is calculated according to a scale
involving engine capacity, age and purchase price.
The system has been criticised by the industry for a number of reasons. The
principal concern is that the two main price thresholds of Pounds 19,250 and
Pounds 29,000, above which the assessed tax benefit rises sharply, forces
manufacturers to produce market-distorting 'tax break specials' and
dis-advantages those companies such as Jaguar which specialise in the upper
end of the executive car sector.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is sufficiently alarmed for
its president, Mr Colin Hope, to have warned the all-party Motor Industry
Group of MPs that 'no one would have gained anything' if a banding system
were retained.
Jaguar yesterday emphasised its opposition to the retention of banding,
saying it would remain discriminatory against executive and luxury car
specialists.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd to visit Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, announced in the Commons yesterday
that he will visit Hong Kong from July 26 to July 28.
Replying to demands for early action to extend democracy in Hong Kong before
it reverts to Chinese control in 1997, he made clear that decisions about
the election to be held in 1995 were still some way off.
Mr Hurd said Mr Chris Patten, setting out later this week to take up his
post as the last British governor of the colony, would be undertaking
wide-ranging consultations.
When Mr Patten had weighed up the different views he would deliver his
advice to the British government.
Mr Hurd emphasised that he would not be announcing any decisions about the
1995 election during his visit later in the month.
Responding to a charge by Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West,
that the UK government was distancing itself from the democratic movement in
Hong Kong, the foreign secretary reaffirmed that the government hoped to
ensure that the arrangements made for 1995 continued after 1997.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office junior minister, stated that the total
number of people in Hong Kong eligible to vote in the legislative council
elections in September 1991 was 3.7m of whom 1.9m registered. The turnout
for the 18 directly elected seats was 39 per cent.
Mr Hurd disclosed that he had talked on the telephone with South Africa's
foreign minister on Tuesday night about implementing the European
Community's proposal for a visit by the foreign ministers of Britain,
Portugal and Denmark.
The foreign secretary said he would head the trio 'at the right time and in
a way that would be helpful in bringing back people to the conference table
and not just as a prestige gesture'.
He also refused to associate the British government with calls to ban South
Africa from all international sporting events.

FT  02 JUL 92 / New firms fail to boost Cleveland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH into Cleveland's economy has questioned the effectiveness of the
'enterprise culture' promoted by the government during the 1980s.
The report, partly funded by the Department of Employment, says the number
of new businesses set up in the county in the 1980s increased almost
threefold compared with the previous decade, but total employment was no
greater because the companies were smaller.
It argues that quantity was substituted for quality, with employees per
business dropping from an average of 25.7 for those set up in the 1970s to
8.9 in the 1980s.
Of the 1980s start-ups, 26 per cent were hairdressers, car breakers or in
other garage activities. More of the entrepreneurs in the 1980s were forced
into business through unemployment: 44 per cent were jobless or about to be,
compared with 28 per cent in the 1970s.
The report, by Professor David Storey, Professor of Small and Medium
Enterprises at of Warwick University Business School, and research fellow Mr
Adam Strange, estimates that 3,081 non-retail businesses were started during
the 1980s in Cleveland, compared with 1,143 in the 1970s.
It classes the increased number of companies as an asset, but emphasises
there was a reduction in relocations, which tend to employ larger numbers
than start-ups.
The study, which compares the 1980s findings with previous research into new
1970s businesses in Cleveland, says positive 1980s trends included:
An increase from 11 per cent to 25 per cent in women entrepreneurs.
The apparent disappearance of bank lending prejudices against women and the
unemployed.
Fewer trading difficulties among new companies.
Greater use of advice from agencies and fewer snags with 'red tape' and
finding premises. It concludes that the new businesses of the 1980s,
although more numerous, are less likely to achieve substantial growth than
their 1970s predecessors.
'If significant wealth is to be created in Cleveland, through 'the
enterprise culture', role models of successful firms need to be created,'
the report says. 'Judging from the results of this survey, these role models
barely exist.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / Local authorities turn to worms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMALLY the sight of hundreds of worms writhing around in the kitchen
rubbish bin might prompt a horrified call to the local council's pest
control officer. But if you live in the outer London borough of Sutton, the
chances are that the worms came from the council.
Sutton is distributing 1,000 'wormeries' - special plastic bins for waste
food and organic refuse - to families that volunteer for an experiment to
reduce the amount of kitchen waste collected every week by the borough's
binmen.
Each household receives a starter tub of 200 tiger worms to populate the
wormery. They look like thin earthworms, typically 2 to 4 in long, with pale
stripes. A single wormery will convert all the food waste of an average
family - more than half a tonne a year - into a mixture of high-quality
solid compost and liquid plant food.
The wormery is suitable for the kitchen because it does not stink of
rubbish, says Mr Chris Myers of Sutton Council. 'If anything, there is a
faintly sweet smell. And the worms can't overrun your kitchen. They soon
reach a stable population of a few hundred.'
Sutton council and the district of Adur in West Sussex, which is running a
similar experiment, say the worms are part of a wide initiative to cut
domestic waste - and therefore eventually save chargepayers money through
reduced collection and landfill costs.

BRITAIN plans to use its six months of EC presidency to step up its campaign
to bring the European central bank to London.
Sir Brian Jenkins, the Lord Mayor of London, who is leading the City's bid,
said yesterday he would keep up the struggle in spite of the weekend call by
10 of Britain's 11 EC partners to place the bank in Bonn. 'I'm sure it's not
over. We will press on and pursue what we've been doing so far.'
Government officials said Sir Brian's message would be supported by
ministers, who will be shrugging off the vote in favour of Bonn at the
indecisive Lisbon summit.
Sir Brian's drive is being given strong backing by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, who is sticking to his view that the
operational arm of the bank at least should be in London.
That is on the ground that the size of London's financial market would give
the European central bank the best possible connections to the world of
business and trading.
Britain's political position over the site for the bank has been severely
weakened by the UK's treaty reservations on whether it is to join the third
stage of economic and monetary union (Emu).
Sir Brian said Germany was trying to make acceptance of Frankfurt or Bonn as
the bank site a condition of Germany's willingness to take part in Emu. 'The
Germans will only opt in (to Emu) if they get the bank,' he said.
Sir Brian said the Corporation of London had spent only about a fifth of the
Pounds 1.5m fund set up to promote London as the home for the bank.
The decision on the site of the European Monetary Institute, likely to
predetermine the home of the bank, is to be made in December.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Retailers urge lease shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to reform 'outdated, unjust property laws' was launched yesterday
by the Property Market Reform Group, a newly formed retailers' pressure
group.
The group, which is backed by retailers including Clarks, Thorntons and
Etam, is pressing for changes in commercial property leases. It says the
traditional lease, which lasts 25 years and has upward-only reviews, has
caused inflation, bankruptcies and a deepening recession in the high street.
The launch of the campaign coincides with a report on the flaws in the
commercial property market by the Adam Smith Research Trust.
The report, by Professor John Burton of Birmingham Business School, says the
rigidity of retailers' property costs has 'produced a situation of
nightmarish crisis in many components of UK retailing'.
The chief trouble identified by Prof Burton is that rents are not being
pushed down as a result of falling retail profits. That is preventing a fall
in retailers' costs, which in turn stops them from cutting prices and
tempting customers.
'The rent review process constitutes an institutionalised, legally induced
form of cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces,' the report
says.
It calls for changes to the process by which rents are agreed and recommends
the abolition of confidential clauses in rent reviews to give greater market
transparency.
It calls for the cancellation of upward-only clauses in commercial leases
and says responsibility for rent payments should not remain with the
original tenant if the lease is assigned to another tenant.

FT  02 JUL 92 / A spectacular story of boom and bust: A group of more than
4,000 Lloyd's Names heard yesterday that they would soon have to pay a
further pounds 307m to meet losses from disasters that they helped to insure
against in the late 1980s. Richard Lapper describes the LMX spiral, which
produced the losses, and tells the story of Gooda Walker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HISTORY of Gooda Walker, the Lloyd's agency that has been most heavily
hit by losses from spiral reinsurance, is one of the most spectacular
boom-and-bust stories ever seen at the insurance market.
Gooda Walker's seven Lloyd's syndicates produced losses of Pounds 491m in
the 1989 year. The 4,000-plus Names who backed the syndicates learned
yesterday that they must pay a further Pounds 307m by the end of July to
help meet those losses and losses from earlier years. Names have already
been asked to pay Pounds 365m since April last year.
According to Mr Ralph Sharp, chairman of GW Run Off, which is now handling
the syndicate's affairs, the run-off - the process whereby future insurance
liabilities are settled - will be the longest and most complex in the
history of the Lloyd's market.
Yet in the mid-to-late 1980s Gooda Walker appeared to be one of the most
successful businesses at Lloyd's.
The agency's biggest syndicates, underwritten by Mr Derek Walker, co-owner
of the agency, were the 'engine room' of the spiral, underwriting hundreds
of separate reinsurance contracts.
The group's fortunes centre on the relationship between Mr Walker, a
Londoner, and Mr Tony Gooda, son of the founder of the Gooda &amp; Partners
agency, which lies at the core of the business.
Mr Walker, now in his early 60s, joined Gooda straight from school in the
1940s, but from the 1960s gradually took a more prominent role in the
underwriting side of the business, while Mr Gooda built up the group's
members' agency, handling the affairs of Names - the individuals whose
assets provide the market's capital base.
In the 1970s Mr Walker won a reputation at Lloyd's as a spiral underwriter,
providing aviation reinsurance to other London market companies and Lloyd's
syndicates.
Mr Walker's relationship with Gooda strengthened with the business setting
up new syndicates in 1974, 1976 and 1979. In 1981 the relationship survived
its toughest test, when Mr Walker was acquitted at the Old Bailey after
being accused of participation in a series of bogus reinsurance
transactions.
Mr Walker, who was awarded costs, was stung by the episode. After briefly
suspending himself from the market, he re-entered in the early 1980s,
determined to engineer a rapid expansion of the business.
Mr Gooda recruited Names and often channelled them into the group's own
syndicates, while Mr Walker built up his share of the lucrative spiral
reinsurance market. For a time it was a highly successful exercise.
The capital base of the group's seven syndicates rose from Pounds 47.9m in
1983 to Pounds 270.4m in 1988. The number of Names on Mr Walker's own
syndicate - number 290 - more than trebled from 713 in 1983 to 3,163 in
1989, attracted by its impressive record of profitability.
In 1986 the syndicate ranked seventh out of 102 non-marine syndicates, and
between 1981 and 1986 ranked among the top 25 per cent of performers in five
out of six years.
Other syndicates in the stable fared less impressively. Even so, there were
enough encouraging signs to lead the group to believe Mr Walker's knack
might eventually pass on to other syndicates in the group.
The lifestyles of Gooda Walker's leading executives flourished with the
group's expansion. 'They lived the good life,' says a former manager. 'They
entertained royally. There were cars for senior people and senior people's
wives.' Mr Walker maintained a fleet of expensive cars and ran an aircraft,
although he remained stubbornly distant from the socialising. 'Derek was not
prepared to compromise,' says a former colleague. 'He came in his Marks and
Spencers' suits, plain white shirt and Tuff shoes. People from outside the
old-school-tie ethos took a lot of care about the way they dressed in order
to win acceptance, but Derek dismissed all that.'
The group's rapid expansion in the spiral LMX market left it extremely
vulnerable. Business had been won by very aggressive pricing while the group
boosted profits by buying limited amounts of reinsurance cover, running very
large potential exposures in relation to the amount of premium accepted.
Gooda Walker's troubles were aggravated by the inexperience of some of the
newer underwriters.
The succession of catastrophes beginning with Piper Alpha in July 1988 and
ending with the European storms of January 1990 had a devastating effect.
Even after hurricane Hugo in September 1989 - the biggest loss ever to
affect the Lloyd's market - Gooda syndicates were aggressively competing for
LMX business and seemed unaware of their potential losses.
The storms of January and February 1990 were the coup de grace. However,
even then, awareness of the extent of the debacle was slow to dawn.
In a sad but ironic final flourish, Gooda Walker's executives decided they
needed more office space and contracted to lease a large property.
They were the last people to pay a premium before the property market
crashed, ending up paying Pounds 600,000 a month for three times as much
space as they needed.
In October last year Gooda Walker ceased trading.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Future of the European Fighter: Casa says alternative
fighter not acceptable
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CASA, Spain's state-owned aerospace company and the junior partner in the
EFA project, reacted angrily to Germany's decision to pull out from the
four-nation programme, saying any alternative fighter would not meet the
requirements of the Spanish air force.
A smaller aircraft, as proposed by Germany, would incur additional
development costs and would introduce estimated delays of between five and
eight years, Casa said.
It added that the consequences of such delays would be serious for the air
force and crippling for domestic industries.
Casa has a 13 per cent participation in the EFA project, while the Spanish
air force is due to acquire 87 Eurofighter units.
Casa said in a statement that it was 'firmly convinced' that the three
remaining partners in the project - British Aerospace and Itay's Alenia as
well as Casa - could take on EFA together and 'keep within the budget levels
identified for the four-nation programme'.
The acute disappointment expressed by Casa over the German position and the
company's bullish intention to push ahead without the Germans reflect the
enormous investment already made by Spain in the project and the hopes
placed in the programme by domestic industry.
Casa said Spain had already invested Pta70bn (Pounds 380m) out of a total
Pta125bn in the development phase of the Eurofighter and the production of
the aircraft could earn Pta31bn a year over 16 years for Spanish industry.
A total of 18 Spanish companies have been involved in the EFA's development
phase, employing some 2,000 highly specialised engineers.
The production of the Eurofighter would generate a total of 22,000 domestic
jobs and 50m working hours for the domestic aerospace industry.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Future of the European Fighter: Deutsche Aerospace
expresses relief at Ruhe proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German aerospace industry showed itself positively relieved yesterday
that the government had not decided to abandon the EFA project altogether,
but rather to try to negotiate a slim-line derivative.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, the chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace, the
Daimler-Benz subsidiary which has a 33 per cent stake in the project,
welcomed the explicit statement by the ruling political parties that Germany
needs a new fighter aircraft by the year 2000, and that it should be built
on the basis of European co-operation.
'We are happy that these positions, which Deutsche Aerospace has repeatedly
emphasised, have been confirmed,' he said.
'With the decision to press ahead with co-operation on the basis of the four
existing partners in the EFA consortium, and possibly to extend it, the
ruling parties have given a clear vote for the maintenance of the
technological and competitive capacity of this industry.'
Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler-Benz, also declared himself
'relieved and reassured' by the decision.
Yet the industry is clear that all now depends on the negotiations with the
partner states, and the chances of success in agreeing on a slim-line
fighter based on the EFA are relatively small.
The German aerospace industry federation, BDLI, has calculated that 10,000
jobs hang directly on the future of the EFA, and the same number indirectly.
The project also depends on a huge network of some 500 suppliers amongst
small and medium-sized German companies.
Their turnover adds up to some DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) and their total
employment to some 30,000, a third of them likely to depend on the EFA
programme.
The BDLI has also calculated that in net terms, after allowing for all the
taxes repaid to Bonn from income and corporate turnover generated by EFA,
the project would cost significantly less to the German economy than any
imported alternative, even far cheaper aircraft such as the MiG-29 or the
Swedish Gripen.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said yesterday that the CDU/CSU
parliamentary group - and in particular Chancellor Helmut Kohl - was clearly
opposed to any 'imported' fighter aircraft to replace the EFA.
However, the great unknown now remains whether Germany can persuade its
partners to cut back the EFA project to accommodate the German concerns, and
save the DM5.85bn in development cash which it has committed to the project
all the way to 1999.
Deutsche Aerospace concluded yesterday that it now expected Mr Volker Ruhe,
the defence minister, to reach an agreement with the governments of the EFA
partner countries, and then to report back 'a precise definition of the
specifications and the construction of the altered fighter aircraft, and how
it should develop from European co-operation.
'Then the company can investigate the industrial requirements needed to
realise the project,' it said drily.

FT  02 JUL 92 / The Future of the European Fighter: Germany will continue
development spending on EFA
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT spending on the European fighter aircraft (EFA) in Germany will
continue regardless of the decision not to go ahead with production
preparations next year, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, has confirmed.
He presented a draft budget for 1993 yesterday which contains DM830m (Pounds
284m) for further development of the aircraft, although it specifically
excludes DM110m (Pounds 38m) supposed to be set aside for tooling up for
production.
The apparent financial contradiction underlines the real difficulty for
Germany if it is to pull out of the production programme but maintain its
commitment to six more years of development spending.
The government is contractually committed in the EFA development programme
with Britain, Italy and Spain to spend up to DM3bn further until 1999, of
which the DM830m is the next tranche. Any decision to quit that programme
would almost certainly invite compensation claims from the partner
countries, and from Deutsche Aerospace, the principal German contractor.
On the other hand, calling a halt to the production programme will only save
far smaller amounts of money in the near future, with the heavy spending
required to take delivery of completed aircraft concentrated at the end of
the decade and after the year 2000. Germany was planning to take delivery of
only 14 fighters before 2000, out of a probable reduced total of 140.
The question now is whether Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, can
persuade his British, Italian and Spanish counterparts to go along with the
idea of a cheaper, lighter aircraft, and thus use the future development
cash for that purpose; or whether he will seek to pull out of the
development programme as well, in spite of the risk of having to make
substantial compensation payments, in order to make more significant savings
in the near future.
Officials pointed out yesterday that in the current period of acute budget
stringency in Germany, pulling out of the development programme would show
immediate savings, whereas compensation payments would probably be made only
after lengthy negotiations.
After the decision of the parliamentary parties on Tuesday not to start the
EFA production programme, Mr Ruhe said he would seek to reallocate
'uncommitted development funds' to the effort to design a new slim-line
aircraft. His ministry was unable to explain yesterday what he meant by
'uncommitted funds'.
The political compromise reached by the joint parliamentary group of the
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) was
criticised yesterday by the Free Democrat Party (FDP), third partner in the
coalition, for being deliberately unclear. In particular, it failed to
include any specific statement that the Jager-90, as the EFA is known in
Germany, will not be built.
Indeed, the CDU/CSU statement says at one point that the price of the
existing aircraft 'must be reduced', and at another that a new aircraft must
be designed. The vagueness was a deliberate effort to reconcile the opposing
viewpoints in the group. It remains in the essential decision not to go
ahead with the production of the aircraft as currently designed, but to try
to design a cheaper aircraft on the same development basis.
In spite of the compromise, the decision was interpreted almost unanimously
by the German media as the death of the Jager-90. It was also widely
interpreted as a triumph for Mr Ruhe.
'The Jager-90 is dead. . . . Ruhe's policy is not only popular, but also
quite correct,' said Bild Zeitung, the mass circulation daily newspaper. The
concept of the aircraft dated back to 1972, and 'since then much has
changed', it said. 'Young Ruhe is looking to the future, and has proved his
determination. Cheers]'
Only in Munich, headquarters of the German defence and aerospace industry,
was the opposite view apparent. 'The coalition thinks it has found the magic
solution, the 'Euro-fighter-2000', a sort of cheap version bashed together
from the parts of the Jager-90,' the Munich Merkur declared. 'It sounds
impressive. If the development partners are prepared to play, it will save
European co-operation, it will mean that countless hours of development work
will not be for the birds, and tens of thousands of jobs will be saved.' In
reality, the newspaper said, it must be doubted that any alternative
solution would be any cheaper, and the only thing Mr Ruhe would have won
would be a little more time.

feasibility of three-way split - Optimism belies serious concern

<TEXT>
BRITAIN, with a 33 per cent stake in EFA, remained confident yesterday that
the programme would go ahead even if Germany pulled out.
British Aerospace (BAe) and General Electric Company (GEC), which is
involved in the development of the radar and electronic warfare system for
the aircraft, both said the project could continue as a three- rather than a
four-nation programme.
BAe also claimed that the aircraft could still be produced by the three
partners ( Britain, Italy and Spain) at a similar unit cost to that applying
to four partners.
Although initial British calculations suggested that German withdrawal might
lift EFA's price to the UK by 7 per cent - and by 12 per cent if Spain also
decided to pull out - officials yesterday argued that additional costs could
be reduced by reorganising the production plan and other measures.
'Already major savings have been identified,' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK
defence secretary, said yesterday.
Costs could be saved by rationalising production and test sites. A German
withdrawal could also save costs because German wages are higher than those
in the three other partner countries.
One proposal is the establishment of a single production line, probably at
BAe's Warton plant in Lancashire.
However, this is likely to involve difficult negotiations between the
partners anxious to safeguard their work-sharing interests in the project.
Mr Rifkind also said yesterday he had been in contact with the Italian and
Spanish governments, which had indicated 'the importance they attach to this
project and their desire to see it go forward'.
However, this initial optimistic assessment does not disguise the
considerable uncertainty the German decision has created and the risk that
it could provoke severe repercussions to the programme and its future
viability.
Even if the other partners stay in the programme, they will have to
renegotiate the partnership in the event of German withdrawal.
This process could be complex and take at least 18 months, thus delaying
EFA's overall development timetable.
If the project collapsed, BAe estimates that around 40,000 jobs would be at
risk in the UK aerospace industry alone. Many thousands more jobs would be
indirectly affected in the UK.
The EFA programme needs a production run of about 400 aircraft to be viable.
When the four nations signed the original memorandum of understanding in
1988, they planned to buy a total of 765 aircraft: 250 each for Britain and
Germany, 165 for Italy and 100 for Spain.
Italy is now considering buying only 130 aircraft and Spain 87, while the UK
could reduce its original requirement to around 200 fighters. This would
still just make the necessary 400 aircraft break-even mark.
However, these figures could be revised again before the governments have to
commit orders for the aircraft next year.
This is likely to entail additional adjustments to workshare arrangements as
partner countries change the level of their proposed orders for the new
fighter.
German withdrawal would also have repercussions for broad industrial
collaboration in Europe.
'Withdrawal would be a backward step both substantively and symbolically,'
Mr Rifkind said yesterday. 'You cannot on the one hand make great rhetorical
flourishes in favour of European co-operation if you are simultaneously
withdrawing unilaterally from the most important example of European defence
collaboration.'
Mr Rifkind will ask Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, to clarify
his country's position on EFA when he visits London on Monday.
There is still some hope that Germany may in the end review its position and
stay in the programme, even though this would clearly require modifications
to the original four-nation project.
The feeling yesterday was this could result in a compromise, with Germany
ultimately opting for the EFA airframe but 'de-scoping' the aircraft by
adapting it with its own avionic and weapons systems to reduce costs.
Senior Royal Air Force officials said yesterday Germany could decide to
select a 'less capable' version of the aircraft if it changed its
operational requirements for the fighter.
An Italian Defence Ministry spokesman has said that officials were aware of
the changing German position on the future of the Eurofighter, Robert Graham
writes from Rome. But he added that no immediate reaction was likely from
the newly-installed government until it had passed a vote of confidence,
which will probably be held on Saturday.
Italy formally supports the original project in which it has a 21 per cent
stake, both because the air force needs such a new aircraft and because of
the industrial spin-offs. Both the Defence Ministry spokesman and Alenia,
the state-run aerospace company, responsible for the Italian end of the
project, said any decision would have to be a political one.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister-elect, yesterday hopped smartly onto
Israel's political fence as he tried to draw both left-wing and hard-right
groups into coalition with his Labour party following its election success a
week ago.
Mr Rabin, awaiting today's official call from President Chaim Herzog to form
a government, is embroiled in coalition manoeuvres only slightly less
byzantine than usual in Israel, despite his clear election victory over the
Likud party of Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
Yesterday he infuriated Meretz, a pro-peace party regarded as Labour's main
coalition partner, by drawing up draft administration guidelines containing
only bland commitments to Middle East peace talks and omitting reference to
a freeze on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
Labour deliberately fudged the guidelines, which serve as a manifesto for
the government, in an effort to entice Tzomet, a party of the extreme right,
into the coalition. Until recently Tzomet was in coalition with the hardline
Likud.
This apparently perverse move is explained by two factors. First, Mr Rabin
is anxious to consolidate his fragile parliamentary majority, minimise the
influence of religious parties and defuse right-wing protests against his
policy on the peace process. Secondly, Tzomet is desperate not to be left in
opposition after quadrupling its number of MPs from two to eight in the
election.
Neither Labour nor Tzomet is pretending that they do not have deep
differences - notably Tzomet's rejection of any territorial compromise or
freeze on settlements. Tzomet is even further removed from Meretz and
yesterday met the three religious parties to discuss ways of keeping it out
of the government.
Labour insists Mr Rabin's commitment to the peace process and a curb on
settlements will not be compromised.

FT  02 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Environment hit by too free trade - The
Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez provides a stark warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISSUES concerning the environment, formally not part of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), have now become part of the debate.
Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican city bordering west Texas, is a striking
testament to unrestrained free trade. In 20 years, more than 300 foreign
companies have opened plants there, to take advantage of low wages, and
duty-free exports to the US.
The city, home to more than 1.2m people, three times that in 1970, is now a
big producer of car wiring systems.
But the growth has had calamitous side-effects, both for Ciudad Juarez, and
its sister Texan city of El Paso. Some 400,000 Juarez people live in
neighbourhoods without sufficient housing, running water, sewerage
facilities, pavements or electricity.
An open canal carrying Juarez's daily 55m gallons of raw sewage runs
alongside the Rio Grande for 17 miles, contaminating shallow-water wells on
both sides of the border and occasionally the river itself.
El Paso has suffered from its neighbour's explosive and unregulated growth.
It is the fifth poorest city in the US, with rates of hepatitis, dysentery
and tuberculosis five, four and two times the US average respectively.
Cholera has been recently found in Juarez's water system, and could soon
find its way to El Paso, warns Dr Lawrance Nickey, of the El Paso
City-County Health District.
Environmentalists, and unions keen to oppose free trade on all grounds
possible, fear that Nafta will exacerbate problems along the border, and do
for the rest of Mexico what has been done for Ciudad Juarez.
They are demanding that the text of the agreement incorporates environmental
safeguards and that billions of dollars be spent on cleaning up the
frontier. 'Unless the government marries free trade and the environment, we
will be totally burnt. We cannot cope with more growth,' says Dr. Nickey,
Their concerns are shared by many US congressmen. Mr Bill Richardson,
Democratic congressman from New Mexico and a leading supporter of free
trade, says: 'What will decide the free trade agreement will not be the
commercial side - the array of trilateral trade agreements currently being
negotiated - but the environmental issue.'
The irony is that the free trade agreement could be decided by an issue that
it purports not to tackle. The agreement will incorporate some 'green
language' and may give US companies the right to seek redress against
Mexican businesses that obtain a competitive advantage by being able to
pollute freely. But the US and Mexican administrations have for the most
part insisted that Nafta stick to trade issues and that the environment be
addressed in parallel agreements.
The governments have partly done this through an integrated environmental
border plan, launched with some fanfare in February. The plan commits the US
and Mexico to spend about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in three years to
provide water treatment plants, better roads and solid waste sites along the
border, and promotes co-operation by enforcing existing regulations.
If successful, the plan would mark a considerable change. Mexico's Ecology
Ministry turned a blind eye to the 2,000, mainly US, bonded factories
(maquiladoras) along the border that dumped waste into rivers or nearby
desert. The National Toxics Campaign Fund found toxic discharges at
three-quarters of the maquiladoras it visited last year. These and other
wastes have helped turn the border into 'a virtual cesspool and breeding
ground for infectious diseases', according to the American Medical
Association.
The Mexican authorities have already started to crack closed hundreds of
maquiladoras for failing to comply with regulations. Mr Sergio Reyes Lujan,
under-secretary of ecology in Mexico, dismisses fears that Mexico will
become a haven for US polluting companies under Nafta and says 'there should
be no doubt that any factory rejected by the US will not be accepted in
Mexico. Low Mexican salaries are sufficient to attract US industries'.
Along with tighter enforcement of existing rules, US and Mexican officials
argue that Nafta will help the environment in at least two more ways: it
should make Mexico richer and thus more environmentally conscious, and
remove the incentive for foreign firms to operate along the already
saturated border - where in practice free trade pertains - and encourage
them to move to the less crowded interior.
Environmentalists, such as Mr Dick Kamp at the Border Ecology Project in
Arizona, counter that if Nafta as proposed by the administrations of Mexico,
the US and Canada is rejected due to environmental objections, the agreement
would soon be resubmitted but with much tighter environmental safeguards
written in.
A collection of environmental groups have drafted their own 'green language'
treaty, which would establish a commission on trade and the environment to
ensure trilateral harmonisation and enforcement of environmental laws, and
subject penalties on companies that failed to comply.
Many groups fear that without such provisions Mexico's promise to tighten
enforcement would soon be relaxed. Mexico does not have an independent
judiciary or congress and, as the pressure group Fair Trade Campaign argues,
there is no effective way to force environmental compliance through the
courts.
The Mexican government, fearful that the US would use environmental concerns
as another mechanism to protect US businesses from Mexican goods, has
opposed strong 'green language', but, by doing so, may undercut support for
the agreement in the US congress.

<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of Algerians took to the streets yesterday to mourn their
murdered president, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf.
A grief-stricken crowd gathered outside the presidential palace as mourners
filed past Mr Boudiaf's coffin in the hours before his funeral at Algiers'
main mosque. Women ululated as a green army truck bearing Mr Boudiaf's
coffin left the gates to move slowly towards the Djema Khebir mosque.
Some demonstrators blamed the recently banned fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) for Mr Boudiaf's assassination on Monday. Near the
palace, old posters of the Salvation Front remained on the walls, warning:
'We will strike with force.'
Others in the crowd chanted: 'Chadli assassin', accusing former President
Chadli Bendjedid, forced out of office in January. This echoed Algerian
press reports that the killing might have been organised by senior
politicians with much to fear from Mr Boudiaf's crusade against corruption.
'He died because he wanted to break with the old business, because he wanted
radical change and because he fought corruption,' said a weeping steel union
official.
'Boudiaf was clean, Hardly anybody else left in government is like that,'
added Mr Said Chitour, a tourist guide. Mr Boudiaf, who succeeded Mr
Bendjedid, elicited widespread respect among the crowd yesterday not just
for his anti-corruption campaign but also for his attempts to launch
economic reforms and curb Islamic extremism. Some FIS voters in yesterday's
crowd strongly opposed terrorism.
The poor central area of the Casbah was almost deserted and shops pulled
down their steel shutters in respect. Several thousand silent mourners
milled around the mosque on the harbour front and prayers were said over the
body. Ships sounded foghorns as the cortege left the mosque for the El Alia
cemetery, accompanied by an ashen-faced Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the
Palestinian Liberation Organisation, among the many foreign dignitaries
there.
Yesterday's calm will have come as a relief to Algeria's military-backed
government. It is coming under pressure to choose a new leader to end the
power vacuum.

SOUTH Korea and Japan yesterday announced an agreement to help reduce
Seoul's trade deficit with Tokyo, but the measures fall far short of what
Korean officials had been expecting.
South Korea's trade deficit with Japan last year amounted to Dollars 8.8bn
(Pounds 4.7bn), which accounted for 90 per cent of the country's total trade
deficit. South Korea relies heavily on Japan for machinery and industrial
components. The trade deficit would be even bigger if it was not for import
restrictions that South Korea places on Japanese products.
Mr Roh Tae Woo, the South Korean president, and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, agreed in January to try to find a solution to the
problem, with a deadline set for June 30. Tokyo was under pressure to make
concessions at that time due to new revelations about Japanese war crimes
against Koreans. Seoul's main demand has been the establishment of a Dollars
200m industrial foundation, financed mostly by Japan.
But Tokyo only agreed that each country should provide Dollars 8.3m.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's National Tax Agency, concerned at a fall in liquor tax revenue, has
asked the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate 'unfair pricing' by
beer and spirit discount houses, whose networks have expanded rapidly over
the past two years.
The tax agency's request is linked to an increase in low-priced imports
outside the sole agent system, and echoes complaints by domestic producers
and foreign importers, whose profits have suffered because of the heavy
discounting.
Tax officials said the increasing flow of parallel imports and an increase
in domestic beer discounting had 'disrupted' the market and hurt liquor tax
revenues, which were more than 5 per cent lower than expected last fiscal
year.
But Japanese consumers have welcomed the discounting, as the prices of
well-known foreign spirits have plunged by as much as 50 per cent at shops
with access to parallel imports.
Meanwhile, domestic beer can be bought for 20 to 30 per cent below
recommended prices at a fast-expanding network of discount houses, which
have challenged the complex distribution systems supported by Japanese
brewers. 'As consumers, we are happy with the discounts,' a tax agency
official said, 'but, as government representatives, we have to be aware of
the impact that it is having on our society.
'The important thing is to maintain fair competition.'
The FTC will face the difficult task of determining whether the discounters
are guilty of predatory pricing or whether they are merely participants in a
newly-competitive market.
The agency, which takes Y132 (56p) on a Y320 bottle of beer, indicated
yesterday that it would prefer a return to the stability ensured by the old
domestic beer cartel and the sole agent system for imports.

FT  02 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Telecom pact to cut rates for overseas
calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEPHONE companies will come under pressure to cut their international
charges following a milestone agreement by the world's telecommunications
industry in Geneva.
The International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT), a
United Nations-affiliated body which groups telecommunications ministries
and companies from around the world, has agreed to reform the complex
accounting rate system which has been blamed for keeping international call
charges well above costs.
The decision was taken unanimously at a meeting of the CCITT, attended by
delegations from 46 nations, in Geneva last week and details have only just
emerged.
The main element of the deal is a recommendation to cut accounting rates - a
type of wholesale price which telephone companies charge each other for
delivering international calls - to costs over a period of one to five
years.
The price consumers pay to make international calls is made up of two
elements: the accounting rate, which the local telephone company pays to its
counterpart in the recipient country to 'deliver' the call, and a premium to
cover the local company's costs and profit margin.
These accounting rates are thought to be typically two to three times the
actual cost of delivering calls and underpin the high prices which consumers
pay.
The agreement to cut accounting rates - which is the culmination of more
than a year of negotiations - will not feed through automatically into lower
consumer prices. But pressure from national regulatory authorities and
growing competition in the industry is expected to force cuts eventually.
The CCITT, which had previously denied there was a link between accounting
rates and consumer prices, said it believed its recommendation would 'in
time, positively affect user charges'.
Mr John Berndt, who runs the international communications business of AT&amp;T,
the largest US telecommunications group, said the agreement would 'translate
into real benefits for customers around the world'. BT, the largest UK
group, said it was a 'useful step', but refused to commit itself to cut
prices.

<TEXT>
SHELL, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, and Arvind Mafatlal, the Indian chemicals
and textile group, have decided to go ahead with a Rs60bn (Pounds 1bn)
petrochemical project that potentially marks the largest foreign investment
in India.
The decision to embark on the design and engineering phase of a more than
threefold expansion of their National Organic Chemical Industries Limited
(Nocil) ethylene plant in west India comes after a detailed reappraisal of
the venture. This followed an almost doubling of costs on a project first
proposed six years ago as a result of inflation and the devaluation of the
rupee.
The government's liberalisation policies had also added to uncertainties on
future cash flow because of the prospective drop in India's protective
tariffs.
Nocil said yesterday that the third reappraisal of the project had shown it
to be 'sufficiently robust' for the partners to proceed to an 18-month
design and engineering phase.
Construction would begin after that - though Nocil might earlier place
advance equipment orders.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US recession caused serious problems last year for France's luxury goods
groups. The downturn in the US market was the chief cause for a 1.5 per cent
fall in exports, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The latest figures from the Comite Colbert, which represents 70 of France's
largest luxury goods companies, including Bollinger champagne, the Hotel du
Crillon and Chanel perfume, show that their combined turnover fell by 1 per
cent to FFr29.36bn (Pounds 3bn) in 1991. This decline in sales follows a
decade of uninterrupted growth. The US recession, combined with the weakness
of the dollar, created difficulties last year.
The Comite Colbert members saw their US sales fall by Dollars 89m (Pounds
48m) in 1991. This was offset by an increase in sales to Japan, which now
represents 12.2 per cent of their turnover, and to the rest of Europe.
As a result, the overall fall in exports was limited to Dollars 62m, or 1.6
per cent. Sales in France itself, still the Comite Colbert's biggest single
source of business, rose by 0.8 per cent to FFr8.7bn. In real terms this
represented a fall of 2.6 per cent in the French market.

PRESIDENT Fernando Collor seems to have rescued himself from the brink of
political obliteration with his impassioned television address to the
Brazilian people late on Tuesday, but his future remains uncertain,
Christina Lamb reports from Braslia.
The immediate threat that the main government party would withdraw its
support has been overcome, but pressure continues from the media and
opposition parties for his resignation, following Mr Collor's strong denial
of an avalanche of corruption charges.
The focus is now on the congressional inquiry into alleged corruption by Mr
Collor's former friend and campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias.
In his speech, Mr Collor denied all links with Mr Farias since he assumed
the presidency, dismissing charges that Mr Farias had paid his expenses, and
accusing his opponents of 'fabricating a crisis'.
However, despite a masterful performance, the president offered weak
evidence, leaving many allegations unanswered.

<TEXT>
THE purchasing managers' index fell sharply last month, adding to worries
that the fragile economic recovery is losing momentum, reports Michael
Prowse in Washington.
The index dropped to 52.8 per cent, compared with 56.3 per cent in May. Wall
Street analysts had expected a modest drop to about 55 per cent.
The index remains above 50 per cent and thus does not suggest the
manufacturing sector is contracting, but it points to a significant loss of
vigour and may heighten concern that jobs will not be created rapidly enough
to reduce the unemployment rate, now at a six-year high of 7.5 per cent.
The drop in the index left financial markets keenly awaiting employment
figures, due today, which will give the first comprehensive indication of
economic trends in June. If the figures are bad, many analysts believe the
Federal Reserve will be unable to resist calls for another cut in interest
rates, although it might delay action to avoid seeming to bow to political
pressure.

Although a revised 1992 budget increasing the consolidated budget deficit to

parliament plans today to pass a law to slash an unpopular value added tax
from 28 to 14 per cent.
Mr Gaidar warned that such a cut in a central source of income would force
reductions in agricultural and military spending and would 'destabilise
society'.
But Mr Alexander Pochinok, head of the budget committee, accused the
government of underestimating revenues.
Russian authorities also introduced a new controlled exchange rate of
Rbs125.26 to the dollar instead of floating the currency at a market rate as
they had originally planned.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of an early election was raised in Poland yesterday when Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister-designate, told parliament he would resign
if it failed to support him.
The crisis came when Mr Pawlak, 32, leader of the Peasant Party, who was
designated premier less than a month ago, found himself all but abandoned by
three key parties with which he had hoped to form a government. He had
refused to relinquish control to them over economic policy.
Mr Pawlak said he would not present candidates for government posts, leaving
open the possibility of a last-minute compromise. If he quits, his would be
the shortest term of the four prime ministers since the Communists gave up
power in Poland in 1989.
The parliament contains about 10 key political groups all increasingly
unable to agree on a stable government majority. Should they fail, the 460
deputies can either accept a government proposed by President Lech Walesa or
go to the polls, less than a year after the last election.
President Walesa yesterday said he had started to consider dissolving
parliament but added he still had 'several solutions' on forming a
government, one of which included himself as prime minister.
The latest political crisis came against the background of an optimistic
economic forecast from the Warsaw Trade School's (SGH) economic monitoring
unit. It predicted continuing growth in industrial sales over the summer,
with rising exports and domestic sales as a devalued Zloty continues to
squeeze imports and boost sales abroad.
The forecast follows results for the first five months which suggested GDP
could grow 2 per cent this year, reversing three years' decline.

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN the eyes of most Greeks, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister,
pulled off a Herculean feat at the Lisbon EC summit.
By finally winning Community support for the Greek view that the ex-Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia must change its name before it can be recognised
internationally, Mr Mitsotakis has silenced rebellious rumblings in his
conservative party and left the opposition in disarray.
The Macedonian government, recognised so far only by Turkey and Bulgaria,
has not yet made clear whether it will accept the decision, though Mr Denko
Maleski, the foreign minister, has resigned in protest.
Greece now feels in a strong enough position to offer friendship to its
northern neighbour, including financial assistance and a cross-border trade
package that would be channelled through Salonica, capital of the Greek
province of Macedonia.
But Mr Mitsotakis's next task is likely to prove more difficult. He wants to
reverse almost 20 years of official antagonism and sign a treaty of
friendship with Turkey.
'We can live with the Turks today. As far as the east is concerned, we can
feel safe, nothing will happen,' he said last week, referring to the Defence
Ministry's conviction that Turkey, Greece's eastern neighbour and partner in
Nato, is the main threat to Greek security.
Mr Mitsotakis has now made two trips to Turkey to exchange ideas with Prime
Minister Suleyman Demirel on the proposed treaty. According to Greek
officials, it would outline principles for resolving a group of
long-standing bilateral disputes, from rival claims on undersea oil in the
Aegean and delineation of airspace to treatment of the Greek and Turkish
minorities in Istanbul and Thrace respectively.
He has also come under British pressure to adopt a more conciliatory
attitude towards Turkey, as developing closer EC relations with Ankara has
been spelled out as a priority of the British presidency.
Even before the Lisbon meeting, Greece agreed to drop a two-year-old veto
imposed on the Community's redirected Mediterranean policy, which provides
for Ecu2.05bn (Pounds 1.43bn) in loans and grants for co-operative projects
between Mediterranean countries, because it would make funds available to
Turkey.
But signing the friendship treaty will depend on whether current efforts to
reunite Cyprus, being sponsored by the UN secretary general, are successful.
Mr Mitsotakis had originally intended to push ahead with the treaty
regardless of the Cyprus issue. But he found himself obliged to make the
linkage following angry reactions from both Greek Cypriot politicians and
public opinion at home.
Although last month's round of high-level talks on Cyprus in New York
produced few tangible signs of progress, it brought together the leaders of
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities for the first time in over two
years.
Now that President George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, has managed
to persuade most of his community that not all those driven from their homes
in 1974, when Turkish forces occupied the northern third of the island, will
be able to return, it is up to Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader,
to make the next move.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations is today expected to launch a massive humanitarian relief
operation aimed at feeding the 300,000 starving inhabitants of the besieged
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The operation will be assisted by 1,200 Canadian troops, who will arrive in
Sarajevo early this morning after travelling overland from Croatia where
they have been deployed as UN peace-keepers.
The troops, equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers, will immediately
take control of the airport, which until last Monday had been blockaded by
Serb irregulars, and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army.
Western governments and international relief agencies are on standby, ready
to send food to Sarajevo, which has been under siege by Serb irregulars for
86 days.
Yesterday, the local inhabitants got their first taste of fresh water for
many weeks after UN troops delivered 27 tons of supplies to three charities
representing Moslems, Serbs and Croats, Bosnia's main ethnic groups.
The aid was delivered by four French aircraft following French President
Francois Mitterrand's visit to Sarajevo last Sunday.
But UN officials and locals warned that any upsurge in the fighting could
jeopardise the entire relief operation.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, one of the leaders of the Serb irregulars, promised to
court-martial anyone who broke the ceasefire.
A western diplomat dismissed the statement, issued only to international
newsagencies and not to the Serbian media, as 'a public relations exercise
and not done in good faith'.
The besieged suburb of Dobrinja was yesterday again attacked by Serb
irregulars.
In Washington, President George Bush said he had 'no plans at this juncture'
to use the six US warships which have been moved from the Mediterranean into
the Adriatic Sea.
However, he said he was 'appalled at the human suffering and the killing in
Sarajevo. . . we will do what we are called upon to do.'
Appearing on a morning television chat show, the president said the forces
were meant to 'send a signal to the people over there that we're serious'.
They include four warships carrying marines, as well as attack and transport
helicopters which could provide air and naval cover for food aid
distribution efforts.
Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, accused the US of wanting to launch
a military intervention in Bosnia. 'It is very likely that Washington is
waiting for a motive for intervention and, without any doubt, it will
intervene if it gets the motive' said Tanjug.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Bush rules out lone US intervention in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday ruled out unilateral US intervention in
war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina, saying the problem was primarily European.
It would be unwise for the US 'to go ramming in as the sole perpetrator of
force', he said on a morning television chat show. 'What we've tried to do
is work with the United Nations,' he added.
Mr Bush spoke as western governments and relief agencies readied themselves
to mount a huge airlift of food to 300,000 inhabitants of the Bosnian
capital, Sarajevo, following an 86-day siege by Serb irregulars.
But 1,200 Canadian troops, due in Sarajevo to take control of the local
airport today, were being held up by minefields north-west of the city late
yesterday.
Secretary of state James Baker clarified the US position, saying the US was
ready to move swiftly to obtain a new UN Security Council resolution
authorising the use of force if necessary.
He added that the US would support a UN resolution authorising the use of
force to protect the relief mission if Serbian forces interfered.
Western diplomats are concerned that Sarajevo's small airport might prove
incapable of handling the volumes of food to be airlifted. They are
considering opening up a 125 mile land corridor from the port of Split. UN
launches operation to feed Sarajevo, Page 2

Correction (published 31 July 1992) appended to this article.
THE sharp fall in Japan's stock and real estate prices, and restructuring in
Japanese industries, are making the country's companies more attractive to
foreigners wishing to buy them.
Increasing numbers of Asian concerns have acquired Japanese corporations as
declining profits have pushed them into the arms of large Taiwanese, Hong
Kong, Korean and Singaporean groups.
Taiyo Fishery, a leading fishing company, sold Hayashikanesenkyo, a shipping
affiliate, to Evergreen, the Taiwanese shipping company, while the Wingon
Group, a finance and distribution group in Hong Kong, acquired 20 per cent
of Seiyu, the Japanese retail chain.
In the first half of this year, the number of mergers and acquisitions of
Japanese companies with overseas corporations surged 2.3 times from the
previous year to 16 transactions.
The value of transactions fell 43 per cent to Y13.3bn (Dollars 105m) in the
first half, according to Daiwa Securities.
The number of acquisitions by US companies rose to 10 from three in the same
period last year, while purchases by European companies halved to two deals.
CORRECTION
WING On, the Hong Kong finance and distribution group, holds 40 per cent in
a Hong Kong venture with Seiyu, the Japanese retail group. On July 2 the FT
stated incorrectly that Wing On holds 20 per cent of Seiyu.

<DATELINE>
   HAMILTON, BERMUDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERMUDA'S ailing tourism industry has been hit hard by a week-long strike
called by the island's main union, the Bermuda Industrial Union (BIU). The
strike was triggered by the allegedly unfair dismissal of a black employee
of Bermuda Forwarders, a small freight forwarding company.
Buses, taxis shipping ferries, rubbish collection, dock loading, and some
hospital and construction services have been affected by the strike.
Picketers have been blocking access to the island' airport since Friday,
causing delays and five-hour traffic jams.
The strikers are demanding the reinstatement of the employee as well as 15
co-workers fired after walking out in sympathy.
The strike has been fuelled by an undercurrent of racial tension. The
island's population is more than 50 per cent black, and blacks comprise a
majority of BIU membership. Mr Ottiwell Simmons, MP, president of the BIU,
accuses the government of 'a concerted effort to break the union and destroy
its leadership'. On Monday, police arrested 15 prominent union leaders who
were picketing the airport, including the presidents of the port, hospital,
bus operators and lorry drivers' divisions.
The government has also obtained a Supreme Court injunction ordering public
employees back to work. The BIU vows to intensify the strike. Bermuda's
tourist industry, already battered by three consecutive years of recession,
fears that 3,500 unionised hotel workers will join the strike.
Premier Sir John Swan warned yesterday that 'there is a danger of very real
damage being done to the economy. We cannot allow visitors to this island to
be used as pawns in the dispute.'

THE FUTURE of Adidas, one of the world's leading sporting goods groups, was
unclear last night as the management waited for a response to its DM1bn
(Dollars 659m) buy-out bid for the company.
The management offer, put together by Mr Rene Jaggi, chief executive, was
due to expire at midnight last night.
However, Adidas said yesterday it had received no response from its
controlling shareholder, Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), the holding company
that represents the interests of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French
businessman and politician.
BTF, which announced on Monday that it had also received two other offers
for its 55 per cent stake in Adidas, said it was still considering the
management offer and would continue doing so 'for the next few days'.
Euro RSCG, the marketing services company formed last year by the merger
between Eurocom and RSCG, the French advertising agencies, expects to
produce profits of up to FFr220m (dollars43m) in 1992, its first year of

Eurocom made net income of FFR183m in 1991, a fall of 5.2 per cent on the
previous year. RSCG made an estimated overall loss of FFr280m during 1991.

ability to organise a proper meeting

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
TAKING OVER the presidency is far more than just becoming the Community's
titular panjandrum for six months. For Britain, it will involve a lot of
work - chairing an enormous number of discussions at a time when the EC has
a crowded international agenda and a civil war to try to settle in
Yugoslavia.
The kudos of pirouetting on the world's stage as EC president may mean less
to Britain, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and of
the G7 economic elite, than it does to smaller states. But 'governments do
themselves a favour with their own citizens in managing a well-run
presidency', says a senior member of the Council of Ministers secretariat in
Brussels.
And, if there's one thing on which British ministers and civil servants
pride themselves, it is being better than most of their continental
counterparts at preparing EC meetings, making sure they start (and stop) on
time, and ensuring that ministers know what they have (and have not)
decided.
Barring mishaps - most likely to come in the process of ratifying the
Maastricht treaty - the odds are that the next six months will see a rise in
pro-EC opinion in Britain. The natural, geographic feeling that Britons have
of being peripheral to the Community will be temporarily allayed by nightly
television pictures of UK ministers chairing Brussels meetings of the
Twelve, as well as hosting important informal gatherings in London, Kent,
Northamptonshire, Cambridge, Perthshire, with a grand finale in December at
Edinburgh.
More important will be the fact that the UK government itself will have to
temper its own strongly-felt views on the Community. By chairing all
ministerial councils, all meetings of EC ambassadors, all sessions of
official working groups (at least 10 on any Brussels working day), the
presidency might seem to have an enormous opportunity to push its own
national policies. Not so. At the end of the day, EC presidencies need to
find compromises, even at the expense of their national interest.
Germany provided a classic example of this in 1987-88. Having almost
single-handedly wrecked the Danish presidency's attempt to get an EC budget
deal in Copenhagen in December 1987, Chancellor Helmut Kohl secured a deal
two months later under his own presidency, at great expense to Germany in
terms of increased aid to southern EC states. He thus paid, quite literally,
for chalking up a budget deal to his EC presidency.
The same may happen to Britain. In recent weeks it appears to have stepped
up its opposition to the plan by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, to increase EC spending by a third over 1993-97, partly in the
knowledge that it will have to be more malleable once in the presidency.
During the next six months, the UK can still put forward its national
viewpoint. This will be done by junior ministers while their seniors take
the chair.
More than in the past, recent EC presidencies have been swept along by the
broad tide of mega-events, such as the attempt by the western half of Europe
to cement itself into a political and monetary union in the face of
disintegration in the eastern half.
The UK presidency will lay out its programme, at this month's European
parliament session. Little of its substance may be very British, except its
tone. Nor will much of it necessarily come to pass. Such programmes are not
like the Queen's Speech, with a parliamentary majority to enact it into law.
A presidency does, however, have a power of procrastination, of putting off
Council discussion of things it does not like. The last British presidency
in 1986 was criticised by some EC officials for doing little on the budget,
except to try to stabilise farm spending. This criticism is a bit unfair,
since it was only the following year that the Commission put its 1988-92
financing plan on the table. Nonetheless, it leads one official to hope that
'this time we will get a good, conscientious Community presidency rather
than a good, conscientious British presidency'.
UK presidencies tend to rely less than those of smaller states on the
Commission and the Council secretariat for help, even though the second
institution is acquiring more diplomats to help run the Maastricht-mandated
'common foreign and security policy'. But, in international business, a
presidency can ask its predecessor and successor to join it in the so-called
troika to represent the Community. Britain's troika partners will be
Portugal and Denmark (on the assumption it is still in the EC next spring).

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, state of the union: Majors ministers prepare wide
ranging agenda
</HEADLINE>

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
Britain's chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, may be a Euro-sceptic at heart. But
his agenda during the UK presidency will be firmly based on two elements of
the Maastricht treaty, writes Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent.
While Maastricht's main purpose it to lay down the route to European Union,
the chancellor's EC policy will be based on those passages which specify
that the Community shoul have an 'open market economy with free competition'
and operate on the principle of 'sound public finances'.
The latter principle has been thrown into sharp relief by the failure of the
Lisbon summit to make progress on the future shape of the EC's finances.
This leaves the British presidency with the difficult task of beginning
negotiations again on trying to trim back the so-called Delors II package of
Commission proposals calling for a real increase of almost a third in EC
revenue between now and 1997.
Mr Lamont has vigorously opposed the Commission's plans in the past but will
be working to reach an agreement by December's EC summit in Edinburgh.
While the UK presidency may require the chancellor to be more even handed
than he might like in discussions on the future of the EC budget, Sir John
Cope, the paymaster general, will feel under no such constraint when batting
for Britain against Mr Delors' plans over the next six months.
UK ministers will be putting considerable stress on value for money when
negotiating to ensure that the future financial arrangements of the EC fit
in with Britain's idea of budgetary stringency.  In other respects, however,
the chancellor has already indicated some flexibility on EC affairs.
On Monday, he signalled a willingness to drop the UK's long standing
opposition to the EC setting a minimum value added tax rate as part of a
bargain that would include lower excise duties for whisky than those
proposed by the Commission in Brussels.
Although no final decision was taken, the move may take the contentious VAT
issue off the boil for the duration of the presidency, particularly as the
latest proposals would allow the UK to retain its zero-rated VAT for
products such as food and childrens' clothing.
Mr Lamont will also be pressing his EC colleagues to support the completion
of the single market and to lobby in their own cabinets for a liberal EC
trade policy.  The UK presidency will give him a high-profile opportunity to
press for more open EC markets for goods from the former communist countries
of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The chancellor believes that one of the important duties of a finance
minister is to promote supply side reforms that make economies more
efficient and sensitive to market signals.  If he has his way, such broader
issues and their long term impact on the EC will play a significant part in
the informal weekend talks among Community finance ministers scheduled for
early September in Bath.
If any British minister is poised for Britain's EC presidency, it should be
'the Prez', as staff at the Department of Trade and Industry irreverently
refer to Mr Michael Heseltine, their minister and president of the Board of
Trade, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor.
Mr Heseltine sees three priorities:  successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round;
completion of the Cockfield agenda of 282 harmonisation measures in the
European single market by next January 1;
Progess on 'outstanding specific policy initiatives', including issues like
the extent of national powers inside the single market, enlargement, and
liberalisation.
'If we are going through something as ambitious as the Cockfield agenda,
there are inevitably going to be compromises and arrangements that are not
as good as you would like, so we are going to want to look carefully to see
where further progess can be made,' he says.  'We shall revisit many of
those compromises in the interests of even more competitive circumstances,
or in pursuit of our determination to flatten the bumps in an only partially
level playing field.'
He sees liberatlisation as a constant, evolving force essential to Europe's
future competitiveness:  'I do not mean a well-meaning, wishy-washy
liberalism, but a dynamic and radical programme to remove regulation, open
markets and give people freedom of action and choice.'
In specific terms, he is looking to liberalisation in the gas and
electricity sectors, in telecommunications and in air transport.
He talks of 'three great economic realities' that will guide 'our
presidency'.
The single market itself.
The overriding importance to UK exporters of markets in the developed world,
where 'trade does not need special support'. This hints that he intends to
give little ground to special pleading exporters to developing countries for
soft loans and favourable export insurance premiums.
Developing countries need access to industrial markets more than aid. This
suggests strong support for the market-opening aims of the Uruguay Round,
and new association agreements with eastern European countries.
The first test of his mettle will come sooner than he might like, Britain
and Germany have been busy over the past two weeks trying to broker and
EC-US compromise on liberalising farm trade that would break the deadlock on
the Uruguay Round before next week's Munich summit.  The past three EC
presidencies have been dedicated to a similar compromise - in vain.  It
would be a sterling start to the presidency if he could succeed.
Coming hard on the heels of the Earth Summit, the environment will loom
large in the UK presidency.  Mr John Major has already written to EC heads
of government proposing deadlines for implementing decisions taken at Rio,
including ratification of the treaties to curb greenhouse gases and protect
bio-diversity, writes David Lascelles, Resources Editor.
However, Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment minister, will be pursuing
some specific British aims.  One is to ensure that EC environmental measure
are more evenly implemented throughout the Community.  The UK has always
complained that while it adheres to EC rules, others quietly ignore them.
So it will press for an 'Inspectorate of Inspectorates', a Brussels watchdog
that will chase up national environmental agencies.
The UK also hopes to resolve the long-running wrangle over the siting of the
EC's own environment agency.  This has been held up by the horse-trading
over the location of other EC institutions.
Measures already on the agenda include the completion of the EC's fifth
action plan on the environment - a kind of check list which parallels Rio's
Agenda 21.  A directive on disposal of waste is in the works, and further
decisions will need to be taken on aiding the clean-up of east Europe.
One measure unlikely to make much head-way during the UK presidency is the
plan form an EC carbon tax.  With the departure of Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana,
the environment commissioner, it has lost its chief proponent, and the UK
was lukewarm at best.  On the other hand, the idea will not go away.  It
remains, an option for reducing carbon emissions and stimulating energy
efficiency, and several EC states are keen on it, if only to boost tax
revenues.
Employment secretary Gillian Shephard will use her six months in the chair
of the council of ministers to argue for 'minimalist' approach to EC
employment legislation rather than introduce a raft of new directives,
writes David Goodhart, Labour Editor.
She may also be in a position to further postpone the controversial working
time directive. laying down minimum holidays and maximum working hours.  An
understanding was reached last week on the main points but important
technical differences remain between Germany and France.
Mrs Shephard, helped by the Danish referendum, has been good at winning
sympathy from other countries for striking out what the UK dislikes in the
directive.  Her officials say she is closer to the European Christian
Democrat tradition than here predecessor, Mr Michael Howard.
But considering that Britain would still prefer to see the directive fall
Mrs Shephard may be in the odd position of steering this directive on to the
statute book; possibly then to launch a legal challenge to it at a later
date.
The UK government hopes and believes that the high-water mark of
interventionist employment legislation - epitomised by the working time
directive - is now past.
The themes to be highlighted by the UK at various events around Britain
include employment creation, health and safety, removing obstacles to labour
mobility, and training.
The UK's other passion is the implementation of social directives. It can
point the finger, having implemented 22 out of 22.  Just behind it comes
Germany with 21.  Ireland trails everybody, with 16, but four countries have
only implemented 17.

FT  01 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL weakness in ICI, the chemicals giant, upset the market shortly
after the start of trading, when there was news of yet another brokerage
downgrade of the group's profits.
Smith New Court, the securities house, chopped its forecast for the current
year and also for next year. This move caused the shares to drop to 1198p
before stabilising to close a net 15 off at 1206p. Mr Charles Lambert, at
Smith, lowered his prediction for this year by Pounds 100m to Pounds 750m
and next year's by Pounds 150m to Pounds 900m. Both forecasts are around the
lowest in the market.
Mr Lambert attributed the downgrades to three factors. Firstly, that
earnings had been damaged by the anaemic US recovery and continued weakness
in the dollar, allied to a poor performance by the UK economy. Secondly, the
weakness in the crucial agrochemical business during the second quarter was
not simply weather-related but reflected price-cutting in the US. Thirdly,
generic competition to ICI's Tenormin drug had gathered pace.
There were also hints that ICI was about to bid for Fisons, the troubled
chemicals group; although not ruled out, such suggestions were deemed
premature by marketmakers. Nevertheless, Fisons climbed 12 to 212p on heavy
6.2m turnover.
Dealers also pointed to the bearish effects of a large overhang of ICI
shares, resulting from Goldman Sachs' purchase of Hanson's 2.82 per cent
stake in May. Goldman is believed to still be holding at least 10m ICI
shares.
BP rallies
British Petroleum recovered 3 1/2 to 203 1/2 p after company director Mr
Steve Ahearne addressed the Society of Inv-estment Analysts (SIA) in London.
While the share price picked up, however, after the steep decline caused by
last week's resignation of Mr Robert Horton as chairman and chief executive,
most oil analysts registered disappointment at Mr Ahearne's refusal to
discuss dividend policy or the departure of Mr Horton.
An oil sector analyst said: 'The seminar was peppered with slides and
speeches about corporate strategy, but what everybody was waiting to hear
was dividend policy; it is very frustrating.' He added that US investors
were showing increasing signs of getting cold feet about BP. Another
specialist, who attended the meeting, said he found it difficult to see why
the shares had bounced yesterday, adding: 'There was nothing new in what Mr
Ahearne said.'
Turnover in BP remained high, with 40m shares traded yesterday, following
110m last Friday and the 45m that changed hands on Monday. Japanese
institutions were said to be keen sellers, while at least two of the big US
investment banks apparently have been aggressive buyers of the shares.
Suggestions that a stake builder had been at work were disregarded.
Lonrho pleases
Eagerly awaited mid-term results from Lonrho, the international
conglomerate, cheered the market after the board reported figures above best
market expectations and announced a dividend payment.
Interim profits fell to Pounds 38m, from Pounds 109m at the same stage last
year, but market predictions were in the range of Pounds 25m to Pounds 35m.
An interim dividend of 2p, although reduced from last year's two interim
payouts of 3p and 5p respectively, also surprised analysts, several having
predicted a dividend payment of no more than 1p.
Analysts were particularly pleased by the company's breakdown of the interim
figures, both geographical and by region for the first time.
The shares responded by improving 4 to 81p on the figures, but then
retreated on profit-taking to end only a penny up at 78p after brisk trade
of 5.6m. Mr Rob Davis at US merchant bank Lehman Brothers said: 'I think the
worst is over. The refinery problems are behind the company and the second
half should be a lot better.'
Steel activity
Turnover in British Steel jumped to 38m in strong two-way business as the
shares experienced a volatile session. They fell 6 1/2 in early trade as
some dealers continued to reflect on the company's poor results announced on
Monday and the prospect of a dividend cut, a view that took hold after a
gloomy analysts' results meeting.
Bargain hunters moved in at midsession, however, and the upward momentum was
further boosted by US buying, which helped the shares rally to end unchanged
on balance at 60 1/2 p.
TSB featured prominently in the market's heavy programme trade and options
market activity, the shares eventually closing 7 higher at 141p with a hefty
5.1m changing hands.
Rumours that SmithKline Beecham was about to be included in County NatWest's
prestigious Top 30 list boosted the shares by 20 to 893p.
Scottish Power was given a strong push by Nomura, the Japanese broking
house, and the shares ran up 2 1/2 to 182p on good turnover of 1.8m.
Nomura's utilities team said the stock had been left behind in the post-BP
upsurge by other electricity and generator stocks.
Shares in BM Group continued to slide, falling 37 to 113p in turnover of
3.1m.
MicroFocus shares shrugged off the recent bout of weakness and jumped 83 to
1733p after a positive meeting with County NatWest.
The recent improvement in copper prices was appreciated by investors in RTZ,
the world's biggest mining company, and led to a demand for stock which
caused a squeeze. The shares appreciated 18 to end at 625p.
Kingfisher weakened 8 to 496p following a profits downgrading from County
NatWest. Its forecast for the current year has been cut by Pounds 13m to
Pounds 229m and that for 1993/94 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 250m.
Ms Kimlan Cook, stores analyst at County, said the downgrade mainly
reflected concern about a DIY price war involving the company's B &amp; Q
subsidiary.
Sears was steady at 84p in average trading of 2.7m shares, as chairman Mr
Geoffrey Maitland Smith told the annual meeting that trading has been flat
for the first five months of this financial year.
Profits downgrades continued to depress United Biscuits. The shares dipped 4
to 352p as County NatWest and Smith New Court followed other securities
houses in cutting estimates of 1992 profits.

FT  01 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures traded in a tight range in a volatile session, while
traded options saw improved turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened strongly at 2,545, the September futures contract on the FT-SE
experienced a two-way pull in which a leading independent trader was bidding
for the contract while BZW and SG Warburg were reported to be the early
sellers. The latter two gained the upper hand, which saw September go into
retreat, falling to a day's low of 2,531 and leading the underlying cash
market down.
September steadied at midsession and light buying saw it advance to the
day's high of 2,554 before once again drifting lower in the afternoon. The
firm Wall Street was said to have had no effect. For most of the session
September traded in a narrow range of 2,545 and 2,531, ending at 2,545, down
8 from the previous session and around 2 points above its estimated fair
value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover was again around 7,000 contracts
by the official close.
In traded options, turnover improved to reach 40,267 contracts. The FT-SE
option was busy, having 13,491 lots traded. BP was the most active stock
option with a day's total of 2,834 contracts. This was followed by TSB, in
which 2,036 lots were dealt.

FT  01 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer close after an erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND quarter of 1992 came to a somewhat ragged close on the stock
market last night, with both stock index futures and equity prices moving
erratically before ending on a confident note. Some comfort was drawn from
the market's success in bouncing from the FT-SE 2,500 mark, which was tested
in early dealings.
Volume improved, in terms of shares traded through the Seaq, but around 15
per cent of the day's total of 458.5m shares came from two stocks - British
Petroleum and British Steel, both driven by the market's dividend worries.
The reshuffling of portfolios and trading positions ahead of the end of the
quarter was also reflected in several trading programmes. Stock index
futures contributed to the gyrations in the underlying stocks, which saw the
Footsie decline by 13 points before rallying strongly in the afternoon. Wall
Street's gain of 37 Dow points overnight made little impact but London
responded favourably at the close to a further rise of 10 Dow points early
in the new session in New York.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished a net 5.4 ahead at 2,521.2, making a gain of
around 3.3 per cent over the second quarter. However, the Footsie is nearly
8 per cent below the peak reached in the weeks following the re-election of
the Conservative government at the UK general election in April.
The London meeting be-tween BP and the Society of Investment Analysts proved
uneventful, and brought no news on the oil group's dividend policy. Shares
in BP continued to be traded heavily, however.
Also in the spotlight again was British Steel, as the market assessed the
outlook for future dividends in the light of the board's decision to reduce
the final payment for 1992.
Outside the trading programmes, leading shares showed a mixed pattern. A
hefty fall in ICI, prompted by a downgrading from a leading UK securities
house, dragged the rest of the equity market down at first. But this was
later counter-balanced by good US demand for selected pharmaceutical stocks,
the notable exception being Glaxo, which trod water yesterday.
The underlying tone of corporate reporting was encouraged somewhat by the
interim statement from Lonrho, which pointed to an improvement in the second
half of the year. RTZ shares extended the past week's advance on hopes of a
further rise in metal prices.
At the close, the stock market appeared to be in more confident mood than
for some time. Traders were glad to see a calm finish to the second quarter
of the year which has brought its share of hopes and heartaches, culminating
in the dramatic departure of the chairman and chief executive of BP, one of
the largest British companies.
City analysts remain cautious about the outlook for the UK market. Concern
is focused around two areas: UK corporate results and the outlook for the
Japanese stock market. While few analysts expect much good news from
Britain's boardrooms just yet, many hope that by the end of the third
quarter, economic recovery will begin to show itself in company profit
accounts.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sticks in narrow range
before jobs data
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK prices failed to add to Monday's sharp improvement yesterday, the
market ending virtually unchanged amid investor nervousness awaiting
tomorrow's important employment figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.34 at 3,318.52 at the close,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.80 to 408.14, but
the American SE composite managed to put on 2.18 to 379.28 and the Nasdaq
composite rose 4.80 to 563.60. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 201m
shares.
The market largely ignored the day's economic news, which contained no
surprises. The Chicago Purchasing Management Association reported a modest
rise in business activity in its region, the Conference Board revealed a
slight decline in its consumer confidence index for June, and the Commerce
Department said its index of leading economic indicators was up 0.6 per cent
in May.
These figures were unimportant alongside tomorrow's employment report for
June, which the market hopes will be sufficiently weak to persuade the
Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Fed's policy-making Open Market
Committee was meeting yesterday to assess policy, and analysts said any
easing of monetary conditions was unlikely until after the jobs report was
released.
Among individual stocks, Digital Equipment declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars
34 5/8 after stating that it had cut prices on its lowest end personal
computers (PCs) to match recent price reductions by its competitors. The
company also said it is considering extending the price cuts to more
expensive models.
Compaq, which lowered prices of its PCs in early June, dipped Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 24 7/8 . IBM was down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 97 7/8 and
Hewlett-Packard off Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 68 1/2 .
Boeing appreciated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 in turnover of 2m shares
after analysts sounded positive noises on the aircraft maker's chances of
winning a Dollars 2.4bn jetliner order from United Airlines.
Amsouth Bancorp receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 3/4 on the conclusion of its
agreement to buy First Chattanooga Financial for Dollars 100m in cash and
stock. First Chattanooga, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 8 3/4
to Dollars 32 3/4 on the news.
Also on the Nasdaq, Software Publishing plummeted Dollars 4 to Dollars 8 3/4
in heavy trade on warning that it would only break even, or possibly report
a loss, for the upcoming fiscal third quarter.
Calgene weakened Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11 1/2 after the US Patent and
Trademark Office agreed to rule on a tomato gene patent claimed by ICI
Seeds.
Canada
TORONTO finished higher after heavy trading, paced by an advance among
mining issues. The TSE 300 index gained 11.9 at 3,387.7, while rises
outscored declines by 362 to 239. Volume expanded to 32.5m shares from
20.3m.
Moore Corp dropped CDollars 2 further to CDollars 20 3/4 . The company said
the previous day that, due to weak sales in April and May, it expects
second-quarter earnings to be substantially below expectations and less than
last year's second-quarter net. Yesterday, a company official told analysts
that Moore's 1992 net income will likely not exceed the 1991 figure.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: US news leaves dollar shaky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest batch of US economic indicators did little to help an already
shaky dollar yesterday and it failed to recover significant strength against
the D-Mark or pound, writes Peter John.
The US currency had rallied in early dealings as profit-taking put pressure
on a strong D-Mark. However, it was a short-term correction, and when
consumer confidence data and US regional buying order figures were released
traders found no encouraging signs and sold the dollar down. The forthcoming
G-7 meeting in Munich was also prompting dollar nervousness.
Dealers were particularly worried that consumers' perceptions of the next
six months were less optimistic than they had been for some time. They also
focused on the purchasing managers' index for Chicago in June, the first
June figure to be released in the US and which came in below most estimates.
After the effect of the figures had faded the dollar recovered and closed up
on the day at DM1.523, against DM1.517 on Monday. But traders said it
slipped again in late dealings in spite of holding firm against the yen and
Canadian dollar. In New York the US unit finished at DM1.5227 last night.
Mr Mark Slater of Merrill Lynch said: 'There were no supportive numbers and
the market has been looking for a bounce in the dollar rather than the
reversal of a downward trend.'
Sterling, which had suffered from Mrs Thatcher's recent comments over
European unity, rallied against the D-Mark but failed to reflect any growing
confidence in the UK currency. It eased to Dollars 1.904 from Monday's
Dollars 1.907 close and struggled to hold around DM2.900 after rising from
DM2.893. It continued to flounder at the bottom of the EMS band, some 6.02
percentage points below the top-placed Portuguese escudo. However, there was
no intervention by Portugal to sell the escudo and narrow the range, as it
had done on Monday. Although the stated maximum differential is no more than
6 percentage points, in practice it is 6.18.
Moscow confirmed that the rouble would become a convertible currency from
today, although wrangles continued yesterday over whether the Russian
currency rate would be established completely by the market, or some element
of fixed rate would remain.
The rate was set at 125.26 roubles to the dollar, compared with a
prospective rate of Rbs85 last week.
In Belgrade, Yugoslavia announced an 85 per cent devaluation of the dinar
and redenominated the currency in a package of moves designed to save the
war-ravaged economy. In Warsaw, the National Bank of Poland said it would
introduce new banknotes and knock four zeros off the zloty.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Short future gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling futures were slightly firmer yesterday following the
battering they received on the previous day. Meanwhile, the pressure on
period rates eased.
The September futures contract opened two basis points higher at 90.09 as
dealers decided that Monday's harsh mark-down was overdone.
It traded within a five-point range to show some strength towards the close
and was finally 3 ticks up at 90.12 with just over 16,000 lots traded. The
December contract moved within a three-point range to close two points
better at 90.36 with more than 6,700 contracts dealt.
In the sterling cash market, some of the pressure that had been imposed on
period rates by technical factors resulting from the end of the first half
of the year disappeared and the key three-month interbank rate ended at 10
1/16 per cent, down  1/16 from Monday's level.
The Bank of England was unable to meet more than half of the day's forecast
liquidity shortage until the close. During the day's trading, rates moved up
to around 11 per cent before the Bank was prepared to take out the shortage.
The Bank provided three tranches of assistance of Pounds 50m, Pounds 171m
and Pounds 218m, making a total of Pounds 439m. The remainder was covered by
late assistance of Pounds 555m.
An initial shortage forecast of Pounds 950m was reflected largely by the
take-up of Treasury Bills and maturing assistance, which was expected to
drain Pounds 1.071bn from the system.
As most banks had balanced their books for the first half, they were
unwilling to sell their bills and the Bank of England initially provided
very little assistance - Pounds 48m of band 3 bank bills at 9 21/32 and
Pounds 2m of bank bills in band 4 at 9 19/32 per cent.
In the second round, the shortage was revised up to Pounds 1bn and the Bank
bought Pounds 142m of band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 28m of
band 3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 1m of band 4 bank bills at
9 9/32 per cent.
By the afternoon, the shortage was adjusted back down to Pounds 950m and
assistance of Pounds 218m consisted of Pounds 158m of band 1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent, Pounds 10m of band 2 bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent,
Pounds 35m of band 3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 15m in band 4
bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway adamant on whaling
decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY IS adamant that it will not bow to international pressure condemning
its decision to reinstate hunting of minke whales following a five-year
pause, despite threats of trade embargoes on imported Norwegian fish.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, recognised internationally as
a champion of the environment, has stated publicly that Norway will not
reverse its stance and that quotas for 1993 commercial whaling will soon be
fixed even if the IWC fails to lift its commercial whaling moratorium
implemented in 1985.
The IWC Scientific Committee a few days ago unanimously estimated that the
north-eastern Atlantic stock stood at 86,700 animals. 'The harvesting of a
stock of this size on a sound, scientific and sustainable basis is fully
justified,' Norway argues.
Norway's last fixed commercial whaling exploitation quota was in 1987, for
325 minke whales from North Atlantic stocks and 50 from the Jan Mayen stock.
While it may be difficult for outsiders to understand Norway's hard-line
approach to commercial whaling, the government argues that in certain remote
areas of the country, especially in the north, fishermen and their families
depend on whaling as a supplement to fishing to earn an acceptable annual
income. In addition it is part of policy on settlement distribution.
It is a particularly important factor in outlying districts which offer few,
if any, alternatives to fishing and hunting, runs Norway's case.
Mrs Brundtland, who has received hundreds of international awards and
recognition for her work in promoting environment conservation, said she
expected criticism of Norway's decision but insists that it is in keeping
with the recent Earth Summit in Rio, which established that the objective of
achieving conservation and sustainable use 'shall apply to all marine living
resources, including marine mammals'.
Britain's Prince Philip, who also heads the Worldwide Fund for Nature, is
visiting Norway and will meet the prime minister today.
In a national radio interview, he said that although Norway's decision was
regrettable, he was 'too polite' to broach the controversial issue with Mrs
Brundtland.
In another radio report, the European Community was quoted as saying that
Norway's decision was hypocritical of its international reputation as a
friend of the environment and raised questions about the sincerity of its
convictions.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP reform threatens tractor
makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADICAL overhaul of the European Community's common agricultural policy
will accelerate the restructuring of Europe's farm machinery industry, said
Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, chief executive of NH Geotech, yesterday.
The CAP reforms, agreed in May and fiercely opposed by some farmers in
continental Europe, would force machinery producers to put further emphasis
on cost reductions. That would lead in turn to more job cuts in the
industry, said Mr Ruggeri at the London headquarters of NH Geotech, one of
the world's largest farm machinery producers.
Employment at the company has fallen from just over 30,000 when it was
formed in May last year - from Fiat and Ford's earthmoving and agricultural
businesses - to a little over 20,000. Mr Ruggeri would not quantify any
further job cuts but said that the restructuring of the company's
manufacturing operations would continue.
He warned that the CAP reforms, which included a 29 per cent cut in cereals
prices over three years and compensation to farmers for taking land out of
production, could force the collapse of medium-sized equipment producers
lacking geographical or specialist strengths.
'NH Geotech will definitely survive,' he said. 'And it is possible that some
small specialised manufacturers may continue to serve certain specific
market niches. But there is a significant group in between, serving a more
significant portion of what was until recently a prosperous European market,
which will have very serious difficulties.'
Tractor sales in Europe have plummeted from 301,000 units in 1980 to an
expected 150,000 this year - a figure that includes eastern German sales. Mr
Ruggeri said mid-range 'standard' tractors, the mainstay of European
markets, would be worst hit by the CAP reforms. In the combine harvester
market, where unit sales had dropped from 22,000 in 1980 to an expected
9,000 this year as farmers switched to contractors' machines, the phasing
out of grain production subsidies would worsen the situation. In the much
smaller market for hay and forage machines, the scenario was very bleak,
said Mr Ruggeri.
Overall, the only product line with opportunities for growth were special
tractors for orchards and vineyards.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm ministers finally
approve CAP reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community farm ministers late last night approved enabling
regulations for the radical reform of the common agricultural policy which
were agreed on May 21.
Final accord was reached just before midnight when the UK was scheduled to
take over the EC presidency.
Thus at the eleventh-hour, Portugal, which had held the presidency, was
allowed to take credit for the reform which had been painstakingly
negotiated.
Formal adoption of the package, which will cut farm prices and take land out
of use in a bid to cut the EC's food mountain, was delayed at the 11th hour
by French and Italian demands that a law protecting foodstuffs originating
in a particular place from imitation be adopted at the same time.
In the end a decision on the law, which was opposed by the UK, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Belgium, was deferred until a later ministerial meeting.
France and Italy agreed to the package only after assurances that the
European Commission, the EC executive, would submit proposals dealing with
particular problems their farmers face.
France had demanded a shopping list of concessions to pacify its farmers who
have gone on a rampage against the reforms. Italy wanted to be able to
produce more milk.
The accord is seen as a key card for the EC in efforts to conclude the GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Uruguay Round of world trade talks,
which are stalled over a dispute between the Community and the United States
over farm subsidies.
The immediate cost of pushing through the reform now - to give farmers a
target at the beginning of the agricultural year in key areas such as
cereals - seems likely to involve concessions to Italian dairy producers and
is also likely to include more sweeteners for French cereals and beef
farmers.
Italy was given short shrift in May when it held up the reform package in an
attempt to get retrospective validation of its illicit overproduction of
milk from its partners. Italy has a milk quota of 9m tonnes a year but in
fact produces 11.5m tonnes. It had sought to get more than half the excess
approved in May.
Italian officials say their farmers will have to slaughter 430,000 dairy
cows unless it obtains a compromise.
France, which unlike Italy backed the reform in May, faced even greater
political constraints, dramatised by the escalating farmers' protests
against the revamped CAP ahead of its autumn referendum on Maastricht.
The reform cuts support prices to near world market levels while
compensating farmers through the provision of direct income payments,
contingent on larger farms taking 15 per cent of their land out of
production.
Since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, both the 12
and the European Commission have been busily soft-pedalling on any issue
which might upset anyone's national susceptibilities, within a strategy
which requires 11 member states to steam ahead with ratification in the hope
of pulling Denmark back on board.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip ahead of jobs data release

<TEXT>
WITH all eyes on tomorrow's important jobs data, US Treasury prices eased
slightly yesterday in the wake of news that had few implications about the
state of the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  1/8 at 102 15/32 ,
yielding 7.778 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 5/16 ,
yielding 4.817 per cent. Trading activity was reported to be light.
After opening slightly firmer, prices edged lower on the news that the May
Chicago Purchasers' index had risen slightly, that the Conference Board's
latest consumer confidence index had remained virtually unchanged, and that
the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 per cent in May. All three
sets of figures carried the same message: only very modest growth in the
level of business activity.
Trading was subdued primarily because participants were unwilling to get
involved ahead of tomorrow's June employment report. Hopes remain high that
the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates if, as expected, the jobs data
confirms continued weakness in labour conditions nationwide.
UK government bonds closed higher as the pound proved slightly more
resilient in the foreign exchange markets yesterday after Monday's weakness.
The gilt futures contract opened at 97.26 and traded up to 98.04 on an
average volume of about 22,000 contracts. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 116 1/32 to trade at 116 5/16 by late
afternoon while the latest auction stock - the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 -
traded up from 35 1/16 to 35 9/32 .
Dealers said sterling's performance in the foreign exchange markets was
likely to remain the main influence on the gilt market in the immediate
future. Sterling finished the day at DM2.8992/17, up from Monday's 2.8918/53
close, but still below the 2.90 level.
FRENCH government bonds ended  1/8 point lower in lacklustre market
conditions. Dealers said the slight drop in prices may reflect positioning
by traders ahead of tomorrow's auction of FFr9bn to FFr11bn of French
Treasury bonds.
The market is focusing on political concerns, which may well be reawakened
today, when the cabinet decides on the date of a referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty on European union. A September date is widely expected, so
any surprise could prompt some reaction in the French bond market.
THE German government bond market ended the day unchanged after prices were
eased up slightly during morning trading. Dealers said the bund market
lacked direction, and any movement was contained by strong resistance and
support levels, which were confining the market to a narrow range.
Short-term rates edged higher as nervousness about the direction of interest
rates continued to depress the market.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day firmer, buoyed by hopes of an easing
in US and Japanese interest rates.
Dealers said the market opened on a weak note, but traded up steadily during
the day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue traded in a range of 5.265
to 5.3 per cent, ending at 5.275 per cent. In the futures market, the
September contract breached the 103 level for the first time in three
months, to reach a high of 103.06. The contract ended the day at 102.95, up
from Monday's close of 102.84.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian crisis drags down
loans in secondary market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political crisis in Brazil continued to send ripples through the
secondary market in loans to less-developed countries yesterday and is
blocking Latin American borrowers from raising new funds.
Yesterday, benchmark Brazilian debt fell to around 30 per cent of face value
in the secondary market from 34 per cent on Monday. At the start of last
week, before allegations of corruption surfaced against President Collor,
Brazilian debt was trading at 40 per cent of face value.
Political tension in Brazil has dragged down the trading price of loans to
other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Argentina. Bankers said
new issues by borrowers from all Latin America countries were now postponed
until market stability is restored.
Market disruption becomes more serious for potential borrowers as
outstanding bond issues mature. Last week, Petrobras, the Brazilian
state-backed oil company, said it would call a Dollars 250m bond issue. The
issue will have to be refinanced by early August, when the call option is
exercised.
Latin American borrowers have been borrowing at tighter yield spreads and
longer maturities over the past year. This trend has now reversed. Bankers
said even the best Latin American borrowers would find it hard to borrow at
maturities longer than two years.
Yield spreads on mostoutstanding bond issues have widened dramatically. For
example, Telebras, the telecommunications company, launched a Dollars 100m
five-year Eurodollar issue last month at a yield spread of 368 basis points
over US Treasury bonds. Yesterday, the bonds were quoted at a yield spread
of 449 basis points.
Algerian debt stabilised in the secondary market yesterday following the
assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf on Monday. Algerian floating rate
debt obligations were mostly quoted by traders at around 80 per cent of face
value, down from 87 per cent early on Monday, although dealing activity was
very light.
Moroccan debt, which could face pressure from fundamentalist Islamic
supporters, was trading at around 43 1/2 per cent of face value yesterday,
from 48 per cent on Monday.

space

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JUDGE yesterday gave Canary Wharf some breathing space by temporarily
blocking moves by American Express to pull out of the project.
Mr Justice Blair of the Ontario Court of Justice refused to let American
Express set a deadline for declaring Olympia &amp; York in default of its
obligations towards tenants in the London Docklands development.
Similar filings in New York and London have yet to be resolved.
Mr Justice Blair upheld arguments that the entire Canary Wharf project,
which is currently under administration, could be irreparably harmed if the
US-based financial services group was allowed to repudiate its lease at this
time.
American Express said last night the judge's decision was 'procedural at
this point. It does not affect our fundamental legal right.'
American Express signed a lease for 20 Cabot Square, one of the Canary Wharf
buildings, two years ago and is due to move in this autumn. It claims that
O&amp;Y, which is under court protection in the UK and Canada, has defaulted on
the lease by suspending payments totalling Pounds 22m which are required for
completion of the building.
American Express sought court permission yesterday to accelerate its claims
against O&amp;Y by setting a deadline for the lease conditions to be met. If O&amp;Y
failed to meet the deadline, American Express was seeking the right to
terminate the lease and other agreements with O&amp;Y.
The American Express application was opposed by O&amp;Y, as well as by Credit
Suisse First Boston (CSFB) which owns another of the Canary Wharf buildings.
CSFB argued that by allowing American Express to proceed, the court would
clear the way for a flood of other tenants to cancel their leases to the
detriment of the project as a whole.
The amount paid by the Reichmann family owners of O&amp;Y for assets of the
property group was about CDollars 500m (Pounds 225m), documents filed in an
Ontario court reveal. Beginning in early 1991, the assets were bought
through private companies at the going market rate, injecting cash into the
troubled company.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hughes Aircraft to cut workforce
by over 9,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT, ALAN FRIEDMAN and BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUGHES Aircraft, part of General Motors and the leading US defence
electronics group, is to axe over 9,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its
workforce, during the next 18 months. The move accompanies a significant
overhaul of the company's production facilities and business lines.
The restructuring - blamed partly on cuts in defence programmes and partly
on the weak economy - will result in an after-tax charge of Dollars 749.4m,
to be taken in the second quarter of 1992. Hughes said yesterday that about
60 per cent of this figure related directly to the consolidation or
elimination of certain facilities.
Another 20 per cent - about Dollars 150m - is to cover redundancy payments
and other expenses. The rest relates to the costs of rationalising some
product lines, business and other assets.
Hughes did not disclose which specific businesses and plants would be closed
or merged. It merely stated in broad terms that 'a major facilities
consolidation' was being undertaken. But the company did make clear that it
was still planning to sell or close some businesses 'that are no longer
considered strategic to our growth'.
A year ago, Hughes announced organisational changes designed to put more
emphasis on commercial markets and lessen the company's dependance on
Pentagon contracts. US defence spending has been falling at around 5 per
cent a year, while Pentagon contracts still accounted for about 70 per cent
of Hughes sales. The company has said it would like to reduce this to around
50 per cent.
The bulk of the jobs lost will be in southern California, where two-thirds
of Hughes' 60,000-strong workforce is based.
Hughes added that there would be a further Dollars 40m charge on earnings,
because of a change in the way it recognises revenues from some of its
commercial businesses. This, it said, would be more consistent with the
practices in those industries.
Northwest Airlines, the heavily-indebted US carrier, said yesterday that it
was cutting 250 management jobs out of a total of 5,000, agencies report.
Boeing, the US aircraft maker, yesterday said it was in talks with China
about possible new aircraft orders this year, writes Alan Friedman in New
York.
The company also sought to play down the significance of a Dollars 1.2bn
deal announced on Monday by McDonnell Douglas to co-produce 40 commercial
aircraft in China. Boeing, a rival of McDonnell Douglas, termed the
McDonnell deal a mere 'follow on' to previous orders.
Boeing declined to elaborate what new orders it may receive from China's
airlines. But it said that by the end of the year more than 100 Boeing
aircraft would be operating in China.
THE Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium
producer, is cutting 2,100 jobs from its worldwide workforce, writes Barbara
Durr in Chicago.
It will take an after-tax charge of Dollars 40.6m, or 48 cents per share, on
its second-quarter results to cover severance costs.

CHRYSLER'S negotiations with its bankers over the rescheduling of more than
Dollars 6.8bn of the company's debt should be concluded this month, said the
carmaker's chairman, Mr Lee Iacocca, yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson.
Mr Iacocca said the talks were 'going very well,' thanks to the success of
some of Chrysler's newly-launched vehicles and the company's improving sales
outlook.
An agreement should be reached by July 30, he said, but it could be even
sooner.
Speaking at a production launch for Chrysler's new 'LH' mid-sized car, Mr
Iacocca said the company was ready to operate profitably selling between 2m
and 2.5m vehicles a year over the next five years.
The Chrysler chairman's comments encouraged Wall Street, where the campany's
stock rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 21 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

   TWO of the largest wholesale food distributors in the US
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Super Valu and Wetterau - yesterday agreed to revise the terms of their
proposed Dollars 1bn-plus merger.
Under the outline deal announced last month, Super Valu would have made a
cash offer of Dollars 30.20 for each Wetterau share, valuing the common
stock at Dollars 643.3m. It would also have taken on Dollars 440m of
outstanding Wetterau debt.
Ahead of this transaction, however, Missouri-based Wetterau would have
'demerged' its retail subsidiary, called Shop 'n Save. This would have meant
a free distribution of shares in the business to existing Wetterau
stockholders.
However, after further negotiations and a Wetterau board meeting yesterday
afternoon, the two companies said they had agreed revised terms. Under the
new deal, Super Valu would pay Dollars 30.25 a share in cash, but no
demerger of the Shop 'n Save subsidiary would take place. Approval from
shareholders and certain regulatory consents are still needed.
Earlier in the day, fears that the deal would be called off caused Wetterau
shares, which were briefly suspended, to plunge sharply. By the close in New
York - before terms of the revised deal were known - the shares were down
Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 26.
Wetterau, quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, currently ranks as
the national third-largest grocery wholesaler, while Super Valu has the
number two spot. Together, the combined operations would outstrip
Oklahoma-based Fleming Companies as the nation's largest wholesale food
distributor.
Separately, Super Valu announced first-quarter profits for the three months
to June 20 totalling Dollars 45.6m after-tax. This represented a sharp
improvement on the Dollars 31.6m seen in the same period a year earlier.

UNION leaders at Pirelli, the loss-making Italian tyres and cables group,
yesterday sought an urgent meeting with Mr Giulano Amato, the new prime
minister, to discuss the plant closures announced by the group earlier this
week.
As part of its plan to return to profitability in 1992, Pirelli announced
the closure of a tyre plant at Messina, in Sicily, with the loss of 720
jobs. A further 300 redundancies will cover the group's Tivoli plant, near
Rome.
Earlier this year, Pirelli announced the loss of 500 jobs at various
operations in the Milan area.
Yesterday, unions called an eight-hour strike for today and threatened to
occupy the works destined for closure.
The latest job cuts in Italy follow a number of redundancies and plant
closures at Pirelli's foreign operations aimed at cutting costs and raising
productivity. The company announced earlier this week that it had broken
even at the operating level in the first five months of this year.

KIMBERLY-CLARK, the US consumer products company best known for Kleenex
tissues, is forming a joint consumer products group in Europe with
VP-Schickedanz of Germany.
Terms of the 50-50 venture were not disclosed, but the combined company is
expected to have annual sales in excess of Dollars 1.2bn and a workforce in
Europe of more than 5,000.
The companies said they aimed to become a leader in the European consumer
products market. About two thirds of the estimated sales of the new venture
are expected to come from the German company's existing operation.
Kimberly-Clark said it would contribute all its consumer products operations
in continental Europe to the venture. It said it would exclude these
businesses in the UK and Ireland and its European speciality products and
service and industrial businesses.
Mr Wayne Saunders, chairman of Kimberly-Clark, and Mr Peter Fischer,
president of VP-Schickedanz, said in a joint statement that the new
partnership would take advantage of 'complementary marketing, manufacturing
and technological strengths'.
Mr Saunders said benefits for Kimberly-Clark included greater access to
German-speaking markets and strengthened positions in Spain and Italy where
the company presently does business by way of licence agreements.
Mr Fischer said that the new company would offer VP-Schickedanz an increased
presence in the French and Benelux markets.
Kimberly-Clark, with 1991 sales of Dollars 6.8bn and a workforce of 41,000
people, employs 1,200 in its continental European consumer products
businesses.

<TEXT>
THE struggle to save Ercros, Spain's largest chemicals group, moved a step
closer to resolution last night when its board decided not to file for
protection from creditors and to risk its future on a series of negotiations
with creditor banks today.
Mr Jose Piquet, Ercros' managing director, said last night that he had ruled
out a suspension of payments. 'If we do not get new funds this company will
last only a few days more,' he added.
Ercros, 40 per cent owned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), employs
10,500 people in chemicals, mining, fertiliser and explosives businesses. It
owes banks and suppliers more than Dollars 1bn, half of which matures this
year.
The KIO has made clear it is prepared to see Ercros go bankrupt rather than
make new funds available without parallel assistance from other shareholders
and the Spanish government.
Officials close to the company said that a meeting with the Industry
Ministry in Madrid had gone 'very well' and that the government had
indicated that it was prepared to try to help the company, although it could
not make new funds available.
While no promises have been made, the company seems to interpret this to
mean Madrid will try to intercede on Ercros' behalf to slow the flood of
imported fertilisers into the country and to pressure the state-controlled
Banco Exterior, the group's largest creditor with Dollars 200m of loans
outstanding, to be helpful in renegotiating the debt today.

THE French cabinet will today decide whether the heads of more than a dozen
state-controlled companies will keep their jobs in the third phase of its
regular three-yearly review of top jobs in the public sector.
In a surprise move, Mr Rene Thomas is expected to stay on as chairman of
Banque Nationale de Paris, the biggest French bank and a significant
investor in French industry. Mr Thomas, 63, had been expected to resign this
summer as he will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 within his next
three-year term.
However, the government has reported to have found it difficult to find a
suitable successor. Last night, the BNP board voted for Mr Thomas, a close
friend of President Francois Mitterrand, who has headed the bank since 1982
despite a period of ill-health, to be reselected. Ministers are expected to
confirm this today.
Ministers are also expected to endorse the appointment of Mr Gilles Menage,
former head of President Mitterrand's private office, as chairman of
Electricite de France, replacing Mr Pierre Delaporte, who reaches the
mandatory retirement age next year.
The cabinet is expected to confirm the nomination of Mr Louis Gallois,
currently chairman of Snecma, the aircraft engine maker, as head of
Aerospatiale, the aircraft and missile maker, succeeding the retiring Mr
Henri Martre.
All three existing chairmen in the insurance sector - Mr Jean Peyrelevade at
Union des Assurances de Paris, Mr Michel Albert at Assurances Generales de
France, and Mr Francois Heilbronner at Groupe GAN - are expected to be
renominated for another three years.
The reselection of Mr Francis Gutmann as head of Gaz de France and of Mr
Philippe Rouvillois as chairman of CEA, the atomic energy commission, are
expected to be endorsed.

Costs resulting from the closure of two subsidiaries pushed Greenwich
Communications, the USM-quoted radio and television services group, Pounds
92,000 into the red in the six months to February 29.
Turnover rose to Pounds 171,000 (Pounds 42,000) and at the operating level
there were profits of Pounds 18,000 (Pounds 32,000 losses).
Last time there was a Pounds 95,000 pre-tax loss and at the 1991 year end
losses amounted to Pounds 768,000.
Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said the exceptional charge of Pounds 180,000
was largely associated with the closure of Greenwich Satellite (GSL) and
Greenwich Satellite Espana (GSE).
Following the irregularities discovered in Spain, he recommended that,
should no additional share capital be raised by the local directors, GSE
should be put into liquidation.
Losses per share were 1.33p (1.36p).

Under the terms of the offer, existing shareholders will be entitled to take
up the new shares on a 33-for-80 basis.
Holders of 35.69 per cent of the current issued share capital have
undertaken not to take up their entitlement, which will widen the existing
shareholder base.
The 41.18 per cent of the trust previously held by Anglo Scandinavian
Investment Trust before it was taken over by Finsbury Growth Trust is being
placed with a number of institutions.
The zero preference dividend shares offer a fixed capital return paid in the
winding up of the trust, which is planned to commence on December 17 1999.
The trust also announced a same-again interim dividend of 1p for which the
new ordinary shares will not qualify.

The mortgage book includes about 1,600 borrowers, and is valued at about

lending business over the next few years. We therefore decided to pull out
of the UK residential mortgage market. Our core business in the UK is

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hewetson, the Hull-based flooring products and construction materials group,
announced sharply lower annual profits and a reduced final dividend.
Mr Peter Price, chairman, said the decline was mainly attributable to
reduced demand for access flooring which in turn saw group turnover for the
year to March 31 fall from Pounds 43m to Pounds 32.4m.
Costs of reorganisation at the operation were taken above the line as an
exceptional charge of Pounds 251,000, contributing to a 54 per cent fall to
Pounds 745,000 (Pounds 1.61m) in pre-tax profits.
Interest charges, however, fell to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 798,000) as
gearing was cut from 103 per cent to 48 per cent following reduced stocks
and last August's rights issue.
Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 4.35p (10.81p). The final
dividend is cut to 1p (2.9p) for a 2.6p (4.5p) total.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Central Investment Holdings, a chocolate manufacturing group with
interests in the Asia Pacific region, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
922,000 for the 1991 year.
The fall from the previous Pounds 1.34m was attributed to higher financing
costs associated with the takeover of Sunshine Allied Investments of
Singapore in October 1990.
Net interest charges amounted to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 571,000) but borrowings
have been sharply reduced since the year-end following an injection of
Pounds 9m of equity funding by Consolidated Resources, an associate of Anglo
American.
Turnover improved to Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 40.2m). After tax of Pounds
444,000 (Pounds 457,000) and minorities Pounds 765,000 (Pounds 120,000)
losses per share were 0.73p (2.03p earnings). Nevertheless, the proposed
final dividend is held at 0.7p for a total of 1.15p (1.1p).

<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's largest industrial company, has completed its retreat from
telecommunications with the sale of its remaining activities to a
Luxembourg-based company made up of a group of French banks.
Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial group which bought most of Fiat's
telecoms activities in 1990, will have a four-year option to buy the stake
from the banks. The transaction, worth L1,100bn (Pounds 500m) will give Fiat
a L860bn capital gain this year, helping it to close 1992 with a profit
which will be 'lower but still positive', said Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman.
Mr Agnelli gave no forecast for this year's dividend, cut by almost 40 per
cent last year. However, Fiat said industrial activities would show an
operating profit in 1992 in spite of mounting problems in the car business.
Turnover at the Fiat Auto car subsidiary in the first half of this year was
6 per cent below the corresponding period in 1991.
Yesterday's deal came as a surprise. Fiat is selling its 25 per cent stake
in the telecoms business created in 1990 from the sale of its Telettra
telecoms subsidiary to Alcatel. Under that transaction, Fiat retained a 25
per cent stake in Alcatel Italia, the company formed from the merger of
Telettra with Alcatel Face, the French group's Italian operation.
Finparcom, a Luxembourg-registered company mainly made up of French banks,
is paying L850bn for the stake. Meanwhile, Alcatel will pay Fiat around
L260bn over the next four years.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Lonrho falls 65%and cuts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday reported a 65 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to the end of March and cut
its interim dividend from 5p to 2p per share.
A combination of the continuing effects of the recession and technical
problems at the South African Western Platinum mine saw pre-tax profits
decline from Pounds 109m to Pounds 38m. Earnings per share fell from 9.3p to
0.1p.
Profits before taxation would have been worse without property disposals
accounting for Pounds 12m (Pounds 9m) including Pounds 7m (Pounds 1m)
relating to associates.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 903m. Although asset sales
realised Pounds 500m, borrowings remained high after Pounds 100m of capital
expenditure and the acquisition of majority ownership of Gewog, a German
holding company, which inflated the overall debt figure by Pounds 135m.
The Pounds 500m gained from asset disposals also included Pounds 177.5m from
the sale of a one-third stake in the Metropole Hotel chain to the Libyan
Arab Foreign Investment Company. Part of this sum went towards eliminating
borrowings associated with the Metropole chain.
Mr Paul Spicer, deputy chairman, said: 'You have to admit that to cut
overall debt in a recession without a loss of income is an achievement.'
He added that further disposals would take place over the next six months,
further reducing debt, and predicted a much better second half.
Shareholders' funds, excluding minorities of Pounds 433m, remained unchanged
at Pounds 1.3bn. Lonrho's tax charge as a percentage of pre-tax profits
increased to 63 per cent (20 per cent). Estimated tax was Pounds 24m (Pounds
22m).
Mr Spicer said the cutting of the dividend had mitigated its advance
corporation tax problem - corporation tax payable on the company's UK
profits are not large enough to offset the ACT payable on its dividends.
Net interest payable fell slightly from Pounds 54m to Pounds 52m. A further
Pounds 13m (Pounds 12m) was capitalised during the period. The group has
cash of Pounds 283m (unchanged), 80 per cent of which is deposited with
European banks.
Pre-tax profits fell in all of Lonrho's businesses and geographical areas.
Southern Africa suffered the biggest fall, from Pounds 32m to Pounds 3m, due
to technical problems at Western Platinum and the fall in the price of
precious metals.

FT  01 JUL 92 / 'Big Brown' delivers a challenge to rivals: United Parcel
Services' purchase of Carryfast makes it a major player in Europe. But can
it succeed where FedEx failed?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one o'clock in the morning in Louisville, Kentucky. Dozens of cargo
aircraft sit on the airport tarmac. In the vast hangars nearby, local
students are pulling packages off and on conveyor belts, for a princely
Dollars 8 an hour. In the course of one night, more than half a million
parcels will come and go.
The remarkable feature of this operation - a typical night for United Parcel
Services' air division - is that it did not exist 10 years ago. The
Atlanta-based company dates back to 1907, but for most of its life it has
been a cheap, reliable 'ground deliverer' of bulky parcels within the US.
Mud-coloured vans earned UPS the nickname 'Big Brown'; its image was
similarly dull.
The extent to which UPS has tried to change all that was demonstrated this
week. The Atlanta-based company announced it was buying, for an undisclosed
price, Carryfast, the UK's largest privately-owned express delivery company.
The deal adds 8m packages to UPS's annual total of 2.9bn handled.
Carryfast is the last main link in UPS's European delivery system, the 16th
purchase in a seven-year build-up which has cost more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 527m). A decade ago, UPS did not own an aircraft and did not move
express packages between the US and most foreign countries. Suddenly, it has
become a large player in the European market, with an owned fleet of more
than 130 jets.
All of which would be fine, except that Federal Express (FedEx), the largest
US express delivery company and a rival of UPS, has just terminated an
important European expansion strategy.
The cause was simple: losses running at more than Dollars 100m a quarter,
and mounting. Since FedEx and UPS are chasing similar customers - a
business-oriented market that wants a speedier, more convenient service than
national post offices can offer - and UPS is also making losses in Europe,
this raises a simple question: can UPS succeed where FedEx failed?
Part of the answer may lie in the company's character. UPS has been in the
delivery business since its founder, Mr James Casey, sent motorcycle
messengers around Seattle in the early 1900s. These homespun origins are
still apparent today. UPS is markedly devoid of business school whizz-kids
and its chairman, Mr Kent Nelson, began his career in an Indiana customer
service department.
At home, the company has a reputation for conservatism; it clung to listed
prices when competitors were wooing customers with discounts. But when the
company does move, it tends to do so with immense deliberation.
UPS's structure is an important factor. In spite of its size - revenues of
Dollars 15bn make it the world's largest parcel delivery business - its
equity is privately owned, mainly by employees. UPS has also made no large
acquisitions recently. The result is long-term debt of Dollars 830m at
end-1991, compared with shareholders' funds of Dollars 3.9bn. 'UPS has long
pockets,' says one analyst, 'and it is able to take the long view.'
Second, UPS cannot afford to fail. The US express delivery market is
squeezed by recession and competition. FedEx is trying to cling to its
entrenched position, while Airborne Express, a low-cost operator in the
business market, has carved out an effective, undercutting niche.
In the ground deliveries sector, there is pressure from imitators, such as
Roadway. UPS, although solidly profitable, saw its US ground volume decline
last year. 'The US ground market was maturing,' says Mr Donald Layden, UPS's
director of international operations. 'The opportunity was to move into
express deliveries and expand internationally.' He says that by the end of
the decade, around one-third of UPS's revenues will come from outside the
US.
Third, the fact that FedEx has, to some extent, retreated from the European
market may make life easier for the remaining players.
Even so, competitors are quick to point out the potential hurdles. Part of
the problem at FedEx was the difficulty in integrating national ground-based
delivery services into an international, air-oriented network.
One rival said: 'It's a different mentality. A domestic driver picks the
goods up and delivers them; with an international delivery, you need some
idea of customs regulations and all that. International express is also very
time-sensitive - Federal found that some of its drivers just saw these
packages as another delivery.'
A second problem is the market itself. One reason why the likes of FedEx and
UPS were attracted to Europe was the notion that, as the single market
dawned, trade barriers would fall, companies would become increasingly
multinational and cross-border packages would flow. In reality, there has
been an increase in delivery capacity and a smaller upturn in volume. FedEx
recently estimated the intra-European overnight market at just 100,000
packages a day, compared with 3m in the US.
Third, although FedEx has given up trying to deliver for itself in most of
Europe, some large rivals - including Brussels-based DHL, with whom UPS once
considered merging, and Australia's TNT - are less likely to abandon the
fight.
Competitors have no doubts that UPS is trying to force the issue. 'They're a
real a thorn in our side,' says one rival, 'They're very competitive and the
prices are suicidal - they must be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a
year.'
UPS's response is phlegmatic. Mr Layden clings fiercely to his stated goal
of profitability in Europe by 1994, although he admits that blending of the
numerous businesses acquired is 'a very big management task'.
With 20,000 employees in Europe, and a Dollars 1bn-plus investment at stake,
Mr Layden cannot afford to be wrong. Even so, UPS may find that travelling
is the easier part. It is usually harder to arrive.

FT  01 JUL 92 / ICI and Calgene see red over longer-lasting tomatoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries and Calgene, a Californian company, are trying
to squash each other's tomato patents.
The tomato war broke out yesterday when each claimed the other had infringed
its patents for genetically improved longer-lasting, non-squidgy tomatoes.
At stake is a significant part of the world's Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn)
fresh tomato market.
Both companies have developed tomatoes which retain their flavour and
firmness longer. Each pinpointed an enzyme that makes tomatoes rot and then
blocked its action. Unfortunately, they both picked the same enzyme.
Yesterday the US Patent and Trademark Office said their patents were similar
and would investigate which was valid.
Once decided, the winner could make significant profits from the US
processed tomato paste market worth about Dollars 4.2bn a year. In 1995, ICI
plans to introduce into the processed tomato market an improved fruit which
makes naturally thick paste for use in ketchups and sauces.
But the companies are not intent on driving each other out of the market. Mr
Simon Best, business manager of the fruit and vegetable activities at ICI
Seeds, says the company is prepared to negotiate a compromise with Calgene.
'Although we have no immediate plans to contact Calgene, the lines are
open,' he says.
However, the companies may need to be thick skinned. If a compromise is not
achieved, the Patent and Trademark Office would adjudicate, starting its
hearings in September.
Meanwhile, the race is on to use the technology to stop peaches, plums,
apples, apricots, pears, papayas, bananas and avocado pears rotting, says Mr
Best.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Rescheduling of ex-Soviet debt likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARIS Club of western creditor governments is likely to agree a
rescheduling of the former Soviet republics' Dollars 65bn (Pounds 35bn)
foreign debt before a full programme of economic reforms is agreed between
Russia and the International Monetary Fund, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US
treasury secretary, said yesterday.
He said it was one of the few times that a debt restructuring would be
agreed before the signing of an official 'standby' economic programme with
the IMF. However, provisions would be inserted so that if an IMF standby
were not finally agreed, the restructuring would be halted.
Mr Brady confirmed that western nations are likely to favour a 'phased
approach' to Russian economic reform at next week's Munich summit of leaders
from the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations. Russia would receive
Dollars 1bn from the IMF in the form of 'first tranche' of funds,
representing a quarter of the Dollars 4bn that will be available once
agreement is reached on a full standby programme.
The advantage of a first tranche payment is that it involves fewer
conditions than a standby, increasing the chance of agreement between the
IMF and Russian negotiators. First tranche agreements are rare but have been
used before with India, Venezuela, Chile and Algeria.
The Paris Club deal, however, is controversial because other debtor nations
have been expected to sign a standby agreement with the IMF before being
granted a debt rescheduling.
Group of Seven leaders are expected to support this special concession as a
way of indicating support for President Boris Yeltsin's reform efforts even
if IMF talks remained bogged down.
On the wider agenda for the Munich summit, Mr Brady said the US's priority
was to strengthen world economic growth. He said the US would push for lower
world interest rates but he expected the main focus to be on fiscal
measures.
He said Japan's plan for a Y7,000bn-Y8,000bn (Pounds 29bn-Pounds 34bn)
fiscal stimulus announced at the weekend was 'important, significant and
different'. It was potentially as big a stimulus as that announced in 1987,
he said.
Mr Brady declined to say he was satisfied with German fiscal policy but he
praised Bonn for its steps to contain its budget deficit. His caution
suggests the US is seeking to avoid a row on interest rates at Munich. He
said another central objective at the summit would be to make progress on
the Uruguay Round trade talks.
President George Bush showed more support for Mr Yeltsin by announcing that
the US would accelerate the release of credits to Russia, allowing it to buy
Dollars 300m of farm products.

FT  01 JUL 92 / US ready to protect aid airlift: Pentagon sends ships to
Adriatic as supplies reach Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is ready to provide naval and air protection for an inter-national
airlift that has begun to fly food and medical supplies into the besieged
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
Defence officials in Washington said yesterday the US navy had sent six
ships into the Adriatic so it could provide military protection once the
United Nations asked it to do so. But the US did not intend to send in
ground troops.
The moves to step up US involvement in the Yugoslav conflict came as more
French air force aircraft flew emergency supplies to Sarajevo.
The aid has begun arriving after UN peacekeeping forces on Monday took
control of Sarajevo airport from Serb irregular forces. But sporadic firing
in the city centre and a suburb near the airport underlined how vulnerable a
relief operation could be.
Mr Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, said the US was ready to give air and
naval protection to the aid effort if the tenuous ceasefire broke down.
'It's not something the US would do unilaterally,' he said. 'It's something
we would probably do through the United Nations or under UN auspices.'
Administration officials are also discussing the need for a 125-mile land
corridor to transport aid from the Croatian port of Split, which is emerging
as a staging post for relief operations.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said the aid corridor came up
in his talks in Washington with Mr James Baker, the secretary of state. The
US view, Mr Kinkel said, was that an airlift alone could not get help to
Sarajevo quickly enough.
Mr Kinkel said earlier that western allies might have to use military force
in Bosnia because economic and diplomatic sanctions had not had a big enough
impact on Serb leaders in Belgrade, who are widely blamed for fighting in
breakaway Yugoslav republics.
All peaceful means must be tried to end the Yugoslav conflict, Mr Kinkel
said, but added: 'If that is not sufficient, then unfortunately we will also
have to resort to military action.'
A further three French aircraft flew to Sarajevo yesterday, two from Split
and one from Paris, with signals equipment.
The first French aircraft carrying aid landed in Sarajevo on Monday in the
wake of President Francois Mitterrand's high-risk visit to the battered city
on Sunday.
Some 26 tonnes of food and medicine are due to be distributed by
representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to a starving and
ailing population of 300,000, cut off for three months by the fighting
between ethnic factions.
In London, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the UK was ready to
operate four humanitarian flights a day. Royal Air Force Hercules transports
were ready to take off at short notice, he told the House of Commons.
But Mr Major continued to take a cautious approach towards any involvement
of British troops in military action in Bosnia. 'We don't, at present, have
ground action in mind,' he said.
Meanwhile 1,000 Canadian UN 'blue helmets' have begun moving from Croatia to
Sarajevo by road and are expected to secure the airport and restart normal
activity there tomorrow provided the fragile ceasefire holds.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Personal View: How Britain can resolve the Danish dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEON BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British presidency of the European Community begins today. Six months
ago, when it was being planned, the agenda was clear: completion of the
single market, ratification of the Maastricht treaty, working towards the
first enlargement negotiations and with luck, a budget deal too.
That remains the agenda, but the Danish referendum has transformed the
political context. It should have come as no surprise that last week's
European Council concluded that formal negotiations with applicants for
membership could only start after Maastricht had been ratified. That may
mean a delay. It need not be a long one and important preparatory work can
proceed meanwhile. More significantly, the commitment to enlargement by
Britain's partners was new and genuine. It provides a sound base for
advancing this vital presidency objective.
As for the budget deal, there was never any real prospect of agreement at
Lisbon last week. It was always clear that such a deal could only be reached
during the course of the UK presidency. The sharpness of the argument on
this issue at Lisbon shows how hard this will be. Yet it is very much in the
interests of the UK presidency to secure a deal, and to avoid annual
wrangles weakening the EC for the next five years, so as to help clear the
way for enlargement negotiations.
But the main new item on Britain's agenda must, of course, be to help
resolve the problem caused by the Danish vote. The strategy is clear: for
all the other countries to proceed with ratification, whether by referendum
or by the parliamentary route. In the autumn, when it is evident that the
rest of the Community wants to go ahead with Maastricht, the Danish
government will be asked for ideas on clarifications, amplifications or
protocols which would enable it to ask its voters to think again.
What those ideas will be, it is difficult to say. It is likely that what
will be needed is a way to reassure the Danes that the Community is not a
centralising juggernaut. If that can be done, a service will be done to the
Community as a whole.
Governments may value the Community as it has developed since the mid-1980s.
And the many applicants clamouring for membership may share their
enthusiasm. But the Danish referendum demonstrated the fragility of popular
support in some member states.
Strengthening that essential support can best be done by giving effect to
subsidiarity. Both the Commission and the member states under the British
presidency will have to work out a practical programme for determining the
best level for taking decisions.
What is the best level of control? Who should decide? Is too much attempted
at a European level? All of these questions will need specific answers. The
debate is not new.
'Subsidiarity should not be seen as something for the theologians of
Community law, but as something intensely practical: where to draw the line
between what is best done by the Community, and what is best done by
national governments. Even if the Community has the legal right to
legislate, it should exercise a self-denying ordinance unless the problem
can only be resolved by action at a Community level.'
That is not a quotation from Mr Delors last week, though he has for some
time held this view. It is something I said myself in a lecture in 1989.
Some examples where power can be handed back come readily to mind. There is
no need for the EC to continue to set or police standards of drinking water.
National ministers could take back responsibility in this area.
Other sorts of 'interference' may seem pettifogging, yet they are
indispensable if a single market is to be created and maintained. Should
Germany, for example, be free to decide unilaterally, in the name of the
environment, on packaging laws which operate in practice to restrict trade
from other member states?
Again, we can all have a laugh at the Commission's expense when the EC
produces a regulation of biblical proportions defining, say, the acceptable
levels of asbestos in a billiard-cue tip. But UK billiard-cue tip makers
would be less amused if their product was excluded from France as a fire
hazard.
A further problem is that in certain key areas the national governments are
divided about the limits of Community action. Social policy is an obvious
example.
In listing some of the more obvious difficulties with the concept of
subsidiarity, I do not mean to say that the problems are insuperable. In the
competition field, for example, I think we are already establishing a good
balance between what should properly be decided and controlled at European
level, and what is better handled nationally.
Take state aids. Those who resent the Commission's increasing temerity in
controlling national subsidies are quick to argue that such powers should be
returned to national level in the name of subsidiarity. Yet that would be
wholly inconsistent with the Treaty of Rome and the Common Market itself. It
would be a return to the law of the jungle in which rich, nationally
cosseted companies were free to trample upon less privileged competitors at
huge cost to European productivity and jobs. The Commission has a duty to
act as a referee and will not betray that obligation. What we should do, and
indeed have recently decided to do, is to introduce a de minimis rule: a
level of aid below which the Commission no longer requires member states to
notify their subsidies because aid below that level does not harm
competitors. Unnecessary bureaucracy can in this way be avoided. That
decision must now be implemented.
On the mergers side, it may be that more can be done to reduce bureaucracy,
for example, by developing a common form for filing notifications either
with the Commission or member states.
More radically, some suggest there is no need for the Commission to retain
its sole right to grant exclusions from the general prohibition on concerted
practices between companies in the Treaty of Rome. That deserves
examination, but the potential benefits must be balanced against the
possibility that such an innovation could introduce market distortions
resulting from different interpretations of Community law, varying quality
of member states' anti-trust legislation and the rigour with which national
laws are applied.
These may seem technical issues, dwarfed by the more glamorous objectives of
the British presidency. Yet subsidiarity is crucial. The concept is
introduced into Community law for the first time in the Maastricht treaty.
Getting its application right, interpreting it and explaining it properly
could do a great deal to build public confidence in the next phase of the
EC's development. And it is on its ability to enhance public confidence
throughout the Community that Britain's presidency may ultimately come to be
judged.

<TEXT>
A battle royal has developed in Malaysia between the Sultan of the staunchly
Muslim state of Kelantan and Anwar Ibrahim, the country's finance minister.
It's all about whether the Sultan paid a trifling MDollars 2.1m in import
tax for a Lamborghini sports car.
Originally, the car had been held by Malaysian Customs on its arrival at
Kuala Lumpur airport. Then the Sultan turned up - and simply drove the car
away. At first, the government, in the person of Anwar, insisted that the
import duty on the Lamborghini had to be paid. The Sultan dug in his heels.
Last week, the government said the proper procedures had been followed and
the issue was now settled.
Not so, says the Sultan. He says he has not paid any import tax.
Furthermore, the Sultan's palace has issued a statement insisting that the
government and Anwar make a public apology for the undue embarrassment
caused to the Sultan.

It's nice to know that Sir Adrian Cadbury's committee on corporate
governance is not going to be the last word on the subject. BTR chairman Sir
Owen Green has already complained that Cadbury's report was long on
accountability and short on encouraging efficiency. Now comes another
challenge, this time from the lateral thinkers at the Royal Society for the
encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce.
The Society, whose past initiatives include the Great Exhibition of 1851, is
running a two-year inquiry which started last year and goes under the title
of Tomorrow's Company. Unlike Cadbury, who accepted the existing framework
of accountability with reservations, the Royal Society's enquiry asks
dangerously fundamental questions. What are companies for? Who do they exist
to serve? What responsibilities do they have to groups other than
shareholders?
Like Sir Owen, the man in charge of the programme, Mark Goyder, thinks that
the present system lays too much emphasis on the investor. The most valuable
input in most of today's more important products is not materials, says
Goyder, but knowledge; yet we scarcely know how to measure it.

If someone had suggested a week ago that the toast of transatlantic

Yorker, the idea would have been treated with the same sort of disbelief
that greeted the rumours that she and her husband, ex-Sunday Times editor
Harold Evans, were returning to London to run The Observer.
However, it is a sign of how high she stands in the estimation of the New
Yorker's reclusive publisher Sy Newhouse that he should believe her capable
of reversing the fortunes of America's best known high-minded, not to say
high-brow, magazine. Now losing around Dollars 12m yearly, it badly needs
livening up.
Brown has certainly done a wonderful job revamping Vanity Fair. Since taking
the editor's chair in 1984, she has nearly quadrupled its circulation to 1m,
and managed to keep advertising rising in the midst of a steep recession.
Perhaps she will prove to be cast in the same mould as Harold Ross, the New
Yorker's first editor, who had a genius for picking talented writers even if
he did not always understand what they were writing about.
But whatever the likes of Dorothy Parker and James Thurber might have
thought about her arrival, the main thing is that she should keep up the
cartoons.

FT  01 JUL 92 / A long haul to privatisation: Profits from running trains
will depend on track charges, says Richard Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of it: a few years from now, Britain's railways will be largely run by
the private sector. Gone will be the surly employees, the lack of
information, the delays and cancellations. Private railway companies will
compete for passengers' custom by giving them good service and reliable
trains at an affordable price.
Or will they? Today, British Rail is expected to announce its worst
financial result in seven years - a loss of more than Pounds 140m for the
year to March 31, and even that is only after receiving government subsidies
of nearly Pounds 900m. If this is the state of Britain's railways after a
decade of restructuring, it is tempting to ask, what private-sector company
is going to be in the least bit interested in running them?
When the government's long-delayed white paper on rail privatisation appears
in a fortnight's time, the plans will look like this:
BR will be split into two separate bodies. One will continue to own the
tracks; the other will operate the trains. The track-owning body will charge
the train operator for the use of its tracks.
The train-operator will gradually be privatised. Passenger services will be
franchised out to the private sector, and the freight and parcels operations
will be sold.
Private-sector companies will be allowed to run their own passenger or
freight services on BR's tracks.
A rail regulator will be created to make sure all train operators get fair
access to BR's tracks.
The main feature of these proposals is that, faced with the poor financial
performance of the railways, the government has given up hope of selling
them off in their entirety. Instead, it has decided to leave the financially
burdensome track infrastructure with British Rail and pursue the less
ambitious notion of privatising the trains.
This makes sense. Bus operators, after all, do not own roads, nor do
airlines own airports; and would-be train operators such as Stagecoach, the
bus operator, and Virgin, the airline, have expressed no desire to become
owners of tracks.
The trouble is that even with responsibility for the tracks stripped away,
companies like Stagecoach and Virgin are interested only in cherry-picking
one or two of the most lucrative train services. There has been no
discernible interest from any quarter in the idea of franchising the great
bulk of BR's operations: nor is there likely to be unless some tough
questions are satisfactorily answered.
The most obvious one is whether there is any money to be made from running
trains. British Rail's latest figures will offer little encouragement on
this score. No doubt the private sector would prove more successful at
extracting profit from trains than British Rail. Even so, its prospects of
doing so will depend crucially on what it is charged for the use of the
tracks.
The reason why this figure is important is that rail infrastructure costs
are so high. For a lorry owner, infrastructure costs are barely an issue:
access to the roads, in the form of the annual vehicle licence fee,
typically represent only 4 per cent of operating costs. For airlines, too,
airport and air navigation charges represent only 10 per cent of outgoings.
But for British Rail, track costs amount to 48 per cent of the total.
At present, British Rail has no system for allocating track costs to
individual trains. Ownership of the tracks is split between the four main
business sectors - InterCity, Network SouthEast, Regional Railways and
Railfreight - each of which meets its track costs out of general revenues.
When one business sector runs a train over another sector's tracks, the
track owner has no idea how much it should be charging the train operator
for the trip. Instead, it charges a token fee intended to reflect the
marginal extra cost of accommodating the extra train.
The significance of this system is that it artificially inflates the
profitability of train services which get cheap rides over other sectors'
tracks. To take the most notorious example, the Gatwick Express, a
high-frequency InterCity service running between London Victoria and Gatwick
Airport, makes big profits because it runs entirely on Network SouthEast's
tracks, so paying only a marginal contribution towards its track costs.
Freight trains, too, run largely on other sectors' tracks. Services like
these are virtually the only ones on British Rail which make profits.
All this could change once a proper system for charging track costs has been
set up. Just conceivably, an accurate identification of costs will reveal
that some services have been losing less money than previously thought. More
likely, the bigger impact will be the revelation that the profitability of
the few apparently lucrative services is illusory, so further reducing the
prospects of getting the private sector interested in running any of them.
Efficiency gains may enable the private sector to bring lossmaking services
into profit. But British Rail's latest figures will serve as a warning of
the acute vulnerability of railways to swings in the economic cycle.
Moreover, will the private sector seriously be interested in entering such a
business with 48 per cent of its costs not only fixed, but under the control
of a state-owned monopoly supplier?
Paradoxically, the services which turn out to be the most attractive to the
private sector may prove to be those with the poorest commercial prospects.
Ministers have already made it clear that subsidies to Network SouthEast's
commuter services and Regional Railways' branch lines will continue after
privatisation. The government envisages franchising out these lossmakers for
periods of five or 10 years to whichever private-sector company requires the
smallest subsidy to run them.
For the private sector, the clear appeal of this set-up is security.
Franchisees would have little control over revenues: fares on subsidised
services would doubtless remain under political control, and levels of
service would be specified under the terms of the franchise. Any subsidy
would therefore have to be based on a formula which protected the franchisee
from downturns in traffic beyond its control. In other words, it would enjoy
a guaranteed profit.
There are, however, strong objections to such an arrangement. It seems
almost inconceivable that the Treasury would be prepared to lock itself into
a deal that required it to subsidise guaranteed profits for the private
sector. It would also go against Treasury principles to accept fiscal
obligations stretching years into the future, particularly if they extended
beyond the date of a general election.
Neither is it clear how passengers would benefit from the deal. With
revenues fixed, a franchisee would have little or no incentive to improve
services. Rather, its best option for increasing profit would be to cut
costs - a move unlikely to result in more or better services.
And where, besides, would franchisees obtain their rolling stock? New trains
are extremely expensive: the fleet on order for Network SouthEast's suburban
lines in London and Kent, for example, is costing British Rail some Pounds
600m. Unlike buses or aircraft, trains tend to be custom-built for the
routes they serve, so they cannot easily be bought or sold on any
after-market. No private-sector company could invest so much in assets which
would be at risk of being rendered worthless if a franchise were not
renewed.
More likely, franchises would come complete with whatever British Rail
rolling stock was already in use. In all probability, franchisees would end
up taking on British Rail's staff, too. But then, one has to ask, if the
assets and the people were to stay the same, would privatisation make any
difference?
It is possible to be optimistic. After all, the same question could have
been asked of any of the other utilities and corporations that have
undergone privatisation: yet most of them have been transformed by change of
ownership.
The catch in this case is that, although there may be a change of
management, a franchise arrangement would leave ownership of the assets with
state-owned British Rail. One of the biggest potential benefits of
privatisation is the opportunity it offers to take railway investment out of
the straitjacket of the public sector borrowing requirement. If that
opportunity is thrown away, there is every reason to suppose that the
railways will continue to be dogged by underinvestment.
Two possible conclusions may be drawn from all this. The first and most
depressing is that, for all the fuss and fanfare that will accompany the
white paper and subsequent legislation, privatisation will go largely
unnoticed by the railway passenger. The likes of Stagecoach and Virgin may
find profitable niches for the odd private-sector train; lossmaking services
on a handful of rural branch lines may be tentatively franchised out; but
the vast majority of passenger services will continue to be operated by the
same old British Rail in the same old way.
But there is an alternative. The prospects for rail privatisation would be
transformed if only the private sector could see a way of making an
acceptable return from it. The main reason why it cannot do so is that
expensive-to-use railways simply cannot compete with cheap roads.
The success or failure of privatisation will therefore hang on the
government's willingness to level the playing field between the two modes.
That means either pumping massive subsidies into the track-owning side of
British Rail to reduce or eliminate charges to users, or heavily increasing
the cost of using the roads. Neither option is attractive; but if the
government fails to choose one of them, privatisation of the railways may be
left not so much on the slow track as up against the buffers.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: Mike Westbrook Orchestra - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Westbrook's idea of a standard is not a Monk or Strayhorn original. He
prefers to arrange a nursery rhyme for jazz and chamber orchestras combined,
or to write a moody setting for the poetry of William Blake. His latest
project, which celebrates the 200th anniversary of the birth of composer
Gioacchino Rossini, is no less ambitious or eccentric in its execution. At
Ronnie Scott's, accompanied by a disreputable looking big band which
includes a violin and an accordion, the arch-arranger tackles The Barber of
Seville, The Thieving Magpie and Cinderella with famous gusto and humour.
Bringing a 20-piece orchestra to a jazz club which has the atmosphere of a
sauna, could have been unwise, however - had it not been for the steamy
burlesque warbling of partner Kate Westbrook. With her black dress and red
gloves clasped around the mike, her sensual but not entirely serious
serenades are entirely suited to the lubricious atmosphere of Soho in
summer. Rosina was given a new persona as Berlin cabaret lieder and Figaro
himself was introduced by altoist Alan Barnes as a cheerfully swinging
'Factotum Al Bebop'. Four trumpets, their owners perched precariously on a
shelf at the back of the stage, declaimed uproariously the while.
The improvised trilling of soprano saxophones and blue bass line eventually
crowded in on the overture to the Barber and Westbrook, who has the look of
a cavity wall insulation salesman, looked on mischievously. Kate, now all in
red, proceeded to astonish a near melting audience with the endlessly
rolling r of a most unlikely and lascivious Cinderella before the orchestra
neatly segued into a militaristic marching piece taken from The Thieving
Magpie. After more dramatic snarling from Kate, Mike set the orchestra into
a gallop and the Scott Club crowd, either gasping for air or gaping with
amazement, were overwhelmed by the William Tell overture. Rossini, who
apparently relished the opportunity to stun an audience, would surely have
approved.
Mike Westbrook is at Ronnie Scott's until Saturday July 4

FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: Tabloid times - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Normally at this time of the year British television consists of little but
thwok, thwok, 'Thirtay-fortay'; and 'Just a single there from a thick edge,
nicely fielded by Lewis'. It is, no doubt, yet another indication of the
intensification of the battle for ratings that this year there seem to be
nearly as many new series opening in early summer as we would normally
expect in early autumn. Even more significant is the type of material. We
have already seen the start of such tabloid telly series as Crime Limited on
BBC1 and Michael Winner's True Crimes on ITV and now we are getting a lot
more of the same sort of chatty human interest journalism.
Regular readers will know that the concern expressed here has never been
that such series should not exist but that popular journalism should still
be good journalism, and that the increase in 'tabloid' content should be
accompanied by a proportionate increase in more demanding matter. The fear
has always been that if you force desperate competition upon broadcasters,
Gresham's Law will ensure that bad drives out good, and even though the
total quantity of television goes up, not only does the proportion of more
intelligent material fail to go up with it, but the quantity may actually go
down. It is difficult to be sure, programme quality being such a subjective
matter, but my impression is that that is precisely what is happening now.
In fairness it should also be said that much of the tabloid material is
better than what you find being aimed at the same audience by today's print
medium. For example the opening episode of BBC1's 999, a British version of
the American series 911, turned out - contrary to the fears I expressed
beforehand - not to contain the sort of sickeningly intrusive footage in
which the American programme specialises. You can never be sure until you
have seen three or four episodes, but judging solely from the first, 999 is
more reminiscent of the stuff which used to appear in boys' magazines such
as Adventure and True Stories 35 years ago.
The first programme opened with a reconstruction of a rescue by firemen and
doctors of a woman buried under a collapsed house, and went on to an amazing
story about a man making his first freefall parachute jump, clipped to his
instructor who, unknown to the jumper, blacked out shortly after leaving the
aircraft, a fact observed by a following cameraman who 'swam' down to the
couple and released their parachutes. There was also a reconstruction of a
bizarre incident in which a teenage girl fell out of a water-ski tow boat,
was mown down by the driverless craft, and only saved from death by the
prompt action of teenage brothers messing about in a speed boat. It was hard
to avoid the queasy feeling that, however much the programme emphasised the
courage of the rescuers, we were all being invited to enjoy someone else's
misfortune.
The same could be said of A Class Of Their Own, an ITV series about gifted
children which opened on Monday with an account of Katharine Merry's
progress, as she hopes, towards an Olympic gold medal. Having run the
fastest 100 metres ever recorded by a 14-year-old she is now, at 16, under
intense training. This was a perfectly amiable, competent bit of programme
making, on the sort of subject which would once have provided a five minute
item for Nationwide.
Another new lightweight series from BBC1 is Fighting Back, which might be
sub-titled This Is Your Ghastly Life. From a studio chair Lynn Redgrave
interviews someone who has suffered a terrible setback but overcome it and
soldiered on. Programme 1 told us about Mike Nolan, a singer with a pop
group, who survived a bad road accident but now suffers from epilepsy.
Programme 2 tonight features former Wimbledon champion Arthur Ashe who
contracted Aids from a blood transfusion necessitated by open heart surgery:
more individual misfortune. Still, those who enjoy This Is Your Life and
find it comforting to hear about people worse off than themselves will
presumably like this series. But up to now British television journalism has
had ambitions far beyond this.
No doubt television executives will claim that it still has and point to
other new series such as CIA on BBC1, The Crescent And The Star on BBC2, and
Seven Up on ITV, though this last title is already familiar to us; all that
is new is the idea of extending the septennial sequence of documentaries to
children in Germany and Japan.
As for CIA, it is part of a flash flood of spy programmes which seem to have
been brought about by the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the
end of the cold war. Suddenly people are admitting what some of us suspected
all along: that most of the 'secrets' were not worth guarding in the first
place and that most of the spies were double or treble agents or had been
turned so many times that they had forgotten which side they were meant to
be working for.
CIA began with a pre-credit sequence which suggested we were in for a
comedy: Nazis straight out of ''Allo 'Allo' crept into the woods saying 'Ve
buried zese wery waluable microfilms'. They proceeded to dig a hole and bury
what appeared to be half a dozen copies of 'Gone With The Wind' in film cans
the size of wagon wheels. Goodness knows what the producers imagine
microfilm looks like. Matters went downhill from there with too many old
spooks talking to camera, too many topics launched and then abandoned, and
far too little semblance of a coherent programme plan.
By far the best of the new factual series starting last week was Charles
Bruce's The Crescent And The Star which promises to record 'the resurgence
of Islam in the former Soviet states of central Asia'. Episode 1 showed us
what is happening in Turkmenistan. Out on the steppe mosques are being
built, the muezzin is calling the faithful to prayer, and civil servants
have stopped quoting Karl Marx and started quoting Adam Smith. It is as
though communism was just one more brief tale in the unending story of the
Arabian nights.
Clearly the British have not lost the art of making broadsheet television
programmes. However, it is worth remembering that whereas there are just
four programmes in The Crescent And The Star, a series such as Fighting Back
can run for years or even decades judging by This Is Your Life. Similarly
Seven Up is by its nature a very occasional series, while 999 could run and
run. It may all prove to be paranoia, but it looks as though ITV and the BBC
are building up for a ratings war at the tabloid end of the current affairs
business, with precious little effort being put into expanding the opposite
end.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: Fuente Ovejuna - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is still a chance to catch Lope de Vega's 1619 play at the National
Theatre before it travels north. Theatre-lovers who missed it last time
round should pick up the telephone and book in haste. Except for young
children and persons of especially timid disposition (there is a certain
amount of rape and murder), it is hard to imagine that anyone could fail to
find it both stirring and rewarding.
The strong story is archetypal, or over the centuries has come to seem so,
though Lope lights up his characters with individual touches. A Commander in
the service of Ferdinand and Isabella, who has the village of Fuente Ovejuna
as his fiefdom, is a voracious tyrant who at last goes too far. The village
summons its collective courage to assassinate him, takes the cruel
consequences, but survives through heroic solidarity: when the Inquisition
comes to seek out the culprits, even under torture, nobody - man, woman or
child - will say more than 'Fuente Ovejuna did it]' To our great relief they
get away with it, but it is touch-and-go, and the 'happy ending' casts
troubling shadows.
Declan Donnellan's production has lost none of its cutting edge in this
revival. It plays for just under two hours without an interval, seizing
one's attention from the start and never letting go. Many of the original
players remain: again James Laurenson's monstrous Commander is exquisitely
detestable, and again Rachel Joyce plays his chief victim with disarming
plainness and wrenching force. Her calf-eyed fiance is still Wilbert
Johnson, funny and honestly touching.
As the incorrigible village debater Mengo, Clive Rowe (who also sings, to
excellent purpose) somehow manages to look exactly like Lenny Henry and Dawn
French, which makes him irresistible. Pamela Nomvete's Pascuala is a match
for him - but one ought to be praising everybody here: each of the many
roles, large or small, is addressed with terrific commitment. Adrian
Mitchell's colloquial-modern Englishing serves them and the drama well
(unlike his recent version of Lope's Columbus play The Discovery of the New
World, where the sacrifice of period rhetoric and dignity was a dull loss).
The several elements of the show - Nick Ormerod's tellingly simple designs,
Mick Hughes' bold lighting, above all Paddy Cunneen's toughly 'ethnic' music
and Jane Gibson's direction of the massed parades and dances - meld into an
indissoluble whole. Donnellan has imposed a tight theatrical form upon it
which would probably have surprised the playwright (taut structures seem not
to have concerned him much), but does him magnificent justice. The close-up
vignettes live and breathe, within a stern formal plan that grips like a
vice.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Cleansing the Elbe by data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The River Elbe, which rises in Czechoslovakia and runs for more than 1,000
kilometres before it joins the North Sea near Hamburg, is one of the world's
most beautiful rivers. It is also one of the filthiest. Anyone unlucky
enough to fall in will swallow a dangerous cocktail of sewage, bacteria,
heavy metals, nitrates and chlorinated hydrocarbons.
A single dose of Elbe water may not be lethal, but much of the wildlife in
and around the river has been killed off. After years of talk, an
international project is at last under way to clean up the river and the
North Sea into which it runs. For the first time, the scientists involved
can draw on advanced data collection, computer analysis and measurement
techniques borrowed from the world of process manufacturing.
The initiative to clean up the Elbe began in 1985 when the countries
bordering the North Sea signed a treaty to halve pollution levels. While the
former West Germany was willing and able to tackle pollution in the 200
kilometres of river it controlled, the Czechoslovakian and East German
authorities, which controlled the remaining 900 kilometres, were
uncooperative and lacked resources. Now Germany is unified and the Czech
market economy stabilised the real work has started.
The first step was the formation of the International Commission for the
Protection of the Elbe (IKSE) in 1990. IKSE, backed by the Czech and German
governments and the European Commission, has concentrated on accurate
measurement. 'It's the first part of the battle. You have to have results
before you can build plants to clean the river up', says Rolf de Vries, a
project manager on secondment from computer supplier IBM.
As part of its main project labelled INES (Information Network Elbe
Sanitation), IKSE is now treating the river like a huge process plant.
Remote sensors, monitoring stations and laboratories are being established,
sending information back for consolidation and further analysis.
Such an elaborate network of stations would have been unthinkable five years
ago, but the cost of the technology has fallen and IBM has donated PS/2
notebook and desktop computers and RS/6000 Unix workstations worth DM 1m.
The 18 measuring stations are being installed along the banks of the Elbe or
on floating pontoons. A suction pump takes water and distributes it to
automatic instruments which measure its composition.
The results are stored by a local PS/2 personal computer, and forwarded
electronically every 24 hours, by modem, to laboratories or land stations.
The water quality data is then sent up through an electronic hierarchy.
Local results are transmitted to Hamburg and Prague for country analysis and
then forwarded to the IKSE Secretariat in Magdeburg for final analysis.
The detectors could reveal if a serious accident has occurred. For example,
the level of one chemical may exceed allowable levels or the water may be
less opaque than it should be. The station computer would send an alarm call
to the land offices. The river is never unguarded. If an alarm occurs
outside office hours, a standby service receives the alarm call. Duty
engineers then call into the station using notebook computers for more
information.
IKSE expects the benefits from the INES project to be enormous and
long-term. Ultimately, the data could be used to underpin every
anti-pollution activity, ranging from prevention, clean-up, legislation,
prosecution or the issuing of licences to discharge substances.
The project team hopes its methods will attract interest. An initiative to
clean up the River Oder (in Poland and Czechoslovakia) is underway, and IKSE
believes that those responsible for rivers across Europe and beyond could
make use of the methods and software involved.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, State of the Union: Uphill all the way in drive from
Portsmouth to Madrid - Richard Donkin takes to the road to climb the EC's
paper mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 38-ton lorry swept through another French village riven in two by the
N138 highway. Traffic was queueing ahead and Gerard Gibeaux, the driver,
relaxed his grip on the steering wheel and gave a shrug as he pulled to a
halt.
'Farmers,' he said. The southbound long-distance lorry drivers had been
warned before leaving Portsmouth for Le Havre that French farmers were once
more on the warpath with roadblocks around Paris. Today it appeared that
some were converging on Le Mans. A tractor could be seen moving slowly at
the head of the snake a mile or so up the road. Just six months from the
advent of the single market the movement of goods across borders appears as
fraught as ever to the lorry drivers.
Our load was 154 cases of office furniture made by Herman Miller, of Bath.
The customer was the savings bank, Caja de Madrid. The freight haulage
company was Cave Wood Transport of High Wycombe and the driver was French -
open borders at least have arrived in the trucking business itself. We
caught the final night crossing from Portsmouth. At Le Havre Gerard extended
his bottom lip as only a Frenchman can and looked depressed. 'We loose much
time. Plenty traffic,' he said in his best broken English.
We turned out of the traffic queue to by-pass Le Mans and made Bordeaux by
nightfall. Trucks crowded into the lorry park just outside the city and the
drivers made a bee-line for the adjoining hotel and a meal that puts the
British transport cafe to shame. The drivers entertain each other with
travellers' tales spiced with Chaucerian bawdiness.
Only the names have changed over the centuries. The lorry driver sees
himself as the verray, parfit gentil knyght bedevilled by police and customs
officers. Asked how the movement of goods had improved in 1992, Nigel
Hainsworth, a British driver, said: 'It hasn't changed one bit. No one has
yet come up with a solution to the VAT problem. As long as every country has
different rates we are going to have pay duty and that will mean paperwork.'
The main difference for drivers after next January should be the
disappearance of documents such as the T2 which needs to be stamped by
customs. And VAT will be dealt with by deferred accounting.
In the northern European countries the customs clearances are now being
carried out increasingly at the point of delivery. But customs clearance by
agents in Spain, Italy and Portugal can still take a full day and at best
takes several hours.
We approached the Spanish border town of Irun around 11am and Gerard, one of
Cave Wood's most experienced drivers, was worried. 'We might be waiting
until six-o-clock tonight,' he said.
Drivers who come to Irun discuss one of the most taxing questions. 'If the
customs controls are going to disappear as we are told,' said Nigel
Hainsworth, 'why are the Spanish building another big lorry park and customs
offices on the border?' It was a question to which no-one had an answer.
Gerard was surprised. At 3.30pm his documents were back in his hands. The
goods were not physically examined. We never saw a customs officer. They
only deal with the agents.
The freight agents and customs officers have most to lose from open borders
and have staged strikes in France and Portugal this year.
The red-capped Basque police were out in force beyond the border but they
were not stopping lorries today. One driver spoke of a convoy of three
British lorries carrying a consignment of computers a few weeks ago whose
drivers could not produce their permits when stopped by the Basque police.
The supplying company was forced to pay Pounds 28,000. 'The Basque fines are
like telephone numbers,' he said.
In France the fines are lower but seem more frequent. 'I had two FFr900 and
one FFr600 fines for tachograph offences in the same month,' said Steve
Jones, a British driver.
We reached Madrid at 2.30am. Lorry drivers sleep in their cabins. There is a
pull-down shelf for co-drivers behind the front seats that provides a
sleeping space not much larger than a coffin. It was hot in the cabin and
Gerard did not lower the windows. There was too much risk, he said, and he
drew his finger from ear to ear.
By mid-morning we were heading for Coslada, the customs clearance park for
Madrid in the hope of finding some freight for the return journey.
Coslada is a truckers' graveyard. They come, they hand in their papers and
they wait.
A British driver parked his refrigerated lorry and walked into the customs
offices. His peaches were ruined. Would anyone help him? No one moved. He
swore and left. Brussels seemed a long way from Coslada.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine to spell out DTI
'relaunch' plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RESTRUCTURING of the Department of Trade and Industry to sponsor the
country's main industrial sectors will be announced by Mr Michael Heseltine
on Friday.
The president of the board of trade is planning to 'relaunch' his department
as industry's champion in Whitehall in the wake of last month's announcement
of the abolition of the National Economic Development Council.
Mr Heseltine has not secured additional funding from the Treasury for the
restructuring; and he will insist that he has no intention of returning to
the interventionist policies of the 1960s and 1970s,
But in a speech to staff he is expected to emphasise that the government's
free-market economic framework allows room for an active government role in
promoting and assisting individual industries.
An accompanying video to be sent to industrialists is expected to emphasise
that government help will include a renewed drive across Whitehall to remove
bureaucratic interference and excessive regulation.
Mr Heseltine, who has been combing through a sector-by-sector analysis of
Britain's trade performance, also wants to emphasise his role as industry's
sponsor in Europe and in other world markets.
He intends to strengthen his department's detailed knowledge of industry's
difficulties by establishing at least a dozen sectoral groups - ranging from
chemicals to electronics - to represent their industries' interests in
Whitehall. Some of the groups are expected to be staffed by officials
leaving the office which services the development council.
His critics are expected to characterise the reorganisation as a
public-relations exercise, but Mr Heseltine regards it as the first step in
his planned transformation of the government's relations with industry.

<TEXT>
THE continuing recession will oblige ministers to rein in spending demands
for 1993-94, a Tory backbencher warned yesterday, David Owen writes.
Prefacing what promises to be a bruising public spending round, Mr John
Townend, the MP for Bridlington and chairman of the influential Tory
backbench finance committee, said ministers should be reminded that receipts
from revenues were falling.
If they did not reduce demands, the government would face 'increasing taxes
or increasing the public-sector deficit,' he said, and called for
confirmation of the commitment to 'financial rectitude'.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Smoker seeks to set legal precedent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLICITORS acting for a smoker with a rare circulatory disorder who is suing
Gallaher, the US-owned cigarette manufacturer, said yesterday his case might
provide the first test of the duty of care that tobacco companies owe to
smokers.
Mr Cormac Fitzpatrick, of Belfast solicitors Vincent P. Fitzpatrick, said he
was confident that it could be proved his client's disease was attributable
to smoking.
Mr John Dean, 37, of Ballywalter, Co Down, suffers from Beurger's disease,
which causes constriction of the arteries and in its most severe form can
lead to gangrene and loss of limbs. The disease is incurable but can be
controlled. Although the condition has not advanced to the serious stage in
Mr Dean's case, he claims that he has been unable to work for seven years
and that his family life has been adversely affected.
Mr Fitzpatrick said the uniqueness of his case lay in the fact that
Beurger's disease is thought to be caused directly by smoking. With other
smoking-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer it is hard to
prove nothing else could have caused the disease.
Mr Fitzpatrick said Mr Dean had a strong case because he had only ever
smoked one brand of cigarette, Benson &amp; Hedges, made by Gallaher.
Gallaher said it could not comment on the case but would be defending it
vigorously.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Business links with charities backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS strongly support the idea of companies working with charities
but most managers fail to realise the fact, according to research published
today.
A survey by the charity National Children's Home shows that 78 per cent of
shareholders would prefer to invest in a company that took part in
charitable activity.
Only 7 per cent of businesses involved in the study, however, believed that
potential shareholders were more likely to invest if they worked with the
voluntary sector.
'Clearly companies are underestimating their shareholders' support for
charity links,' the report says.
Only 28 per cent of companies, according to the study, sought to work with
charities that had links with their type of products.
The research confirms the development of a more structured approach to the
commercial sector's relationship with charities. Companies are moving away
from making large cash donations to organised sponsorship and promotional
activity.
The report says that while the business sector's demand for professionalism
from charities was largely being met, there were still 'horror stories' of
charity representatives attending City meetings in jeans and T-shirts. 'Some
charities still do not share an understanding of the marketing benefits a
company looks for,' the report concludes.

FT  01 JUL 92 / TV-am drops Channel 5 bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects for Channel 5 looked increasingly uncertain last night as
TV-am withdrew from the contest less than a week before the bids to run the
new television channel have to be submitted.
The breakfast television company, which announced in April that it was
backing a bid by the Entertainment Channel, decided to pull out after
looking at the final business plan.
Another potential backer of the Entertainment Channel, Mr Conrad Black,
chairman of The Daily Telegraph Group, is also unlikely to go ahead.
The decision means that there may be only one significant bidder - Five TV -
for the channel, which should reach about three quarters of the UK
population.
Thames Television has emerged as a significant force in Five TV - a
consortium that has been working on a bid for more than a year.
It was clear last night that Thames Television will be involved in a bid for
the Channel 5 licence but it is not yet clear what form the bid will take or
who the final members of the consortium will be.
As well as Thames, the consortium includes Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City
TV in Toronto, CanWest, a Canadian-based international broadcaster, and Sony
Pictures, the Hollywood company.
Time Warner, the world's largest media group, is also being wooed as a
prospective participant in a bid.
The uncertainty is because whoever wins the licence will have to pay for the
retuning of millions of video recorders likely to suffer interference from
the Channel 5 signal. Many viewers will also need a separate aerial to
receive a good-quality picture, but the successful bidder will not have to
finance those.
Mr David Frost, the interviewer, and Mr Jeremy Fox, the independent
producer, set up the Entertainment channel and still hope to make a bid.
Yesterday Mr Fox said that under the existing terms of the licence proposed
by the Independent Television Commission he had to recommended to potential
shareholders that 'the risk was too great'.
The Entertainment Channel is however talking to Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest in the hope of receiving financial backing.
Earlier this year Mr Berlusconi was enthusiastic about Channel 5 and then
decided to pull out. Now, apparently, he is in the process of changing his
mind again. Bids for the new channel are likely to be in the region of the
minimum Pounds 1,000 a year, and the ITC may decide not to award the licence
 -unless it is certain that the matter of retuning video recorders can be
dealt with effectively.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-rebels angry at tax'betrayal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR indication that the UK is ready to go along with a European
Community plan to set a minimum 'floor' rate for Value Added Tax provoked
outrage among Euro-sceptic MPs on both sides of the Commons yesterday.
Critics claimed that Mr Norman Lamont's readiness to do a deal at a meeting
of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg on Monday represented the 'thin end of
the wedge' in handing over fiscal powers to Community decision-making.
In the Commons chamber, Mr Tony Marlow, Conservative MP for Northampton
North, and Mr Bob Cryer, the Labour MP for Bradford South, both called
points of order challenging the constitutional ramifications of the move.
Demanding a government statement, Mr Cryer described the concession as 'a
betrayal of the British people by handing over power to the European
Community on an unprecedented scale'.
Later, he added that Mr Lamont's position represented a fundamental shift
from that held by Mr Nigel Lawson, the penultimate chancellor, who had
always rejected EC interference on VAT rates.
Several Euro-sceptic Tory MPs backed the claim, arguing that precedent
showed the 'ratchet effect' of Community decision-making meant it would be
almost impossible to claw the power back without other substantial
concessions.
Such views were fiercely rejected by Downing Street and the Treasury. They
said that Mr Lamont had agreed such a move only on the ground that the
decision would be reviewed in four years' time by the EC Finance Council in
a decision that would require unanimous agreement.
Acceptance of a minimum 15 per cent VAT limit would have no impact on the UK
and did not require Britain to forgo its zero-VAT policy on items such as
food, children's clothes and transport.
Instead, it had been agreed as a means to persuade the UK's EC partners to
make concessions on whiskey taxation and was now withdrawn after a failure
to reach an accord.
However, there was some disagreement between the prime minister's office and
the Treasury over why the four-year limit had been imposed.
While Mr Lamont's office said the timetable was to prevent this parliament
tying the hands of its successor - disallowed by parliamentary convention -
Downing Street said it was linked to more pedantic requirements for a
planned VAT review.
A Whitehall official added that the principle of some EC control over VAT
had been established as long ago as 1977 and was a key element in the
efforts to create a single EC market.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major scorns Kinnock jibe on
Maxwell pensions affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, refused to accept yesterday that the
government had ignored repeated warnings from the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation (Imro) about the difficulties of combining trust law
with the Financial Services Act in pension fund regulation.
He reacted angrily when Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, asked him
whether any ministers would be resigning in the wake of the Maxwell affair.
In noisy scenes in the Commons, Mr Kinnock quoted the words of Mr George
Nissen, who on Monday resigned as chairman of Imro. Mr Nissen said that the
organisation had been telling the government for some years of the
difficulties of pension and trust law.
'Why did the government take no effective action in response to these
repeated warnings from the regulatory body?' Mr Kinnock asked. 'When can we
expect the government to take its share of the responsibility, and when can
we expect ministers to follow Mr Nissen's example?'
Mr Major replied by citing another part of Mr Nissen's statement, in which
he had said that Imro freely acknowledged that it was open to a share of
reproach for what had happened. The prime minister went on to accuse Mr
Kinnock of 'seeking to spread blame where it doesn't exist.'
The essence of Mr Kinnock's question reflects the case that has been put to
the parliamentary ombudsman by Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the
all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners.
The argument is that the Department of Trade and Industry failed to act on
warnings that the regulatory regime was inadequate.
This is the second time in just over a week that Mr Kinnock has stepped up
the pressure on the government over the Maxwell affair by raising it at
question time.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokesman, said yesterday that Imro's
evidence to the social security committee recalled that the organisation had
briefed a leading expert on trust law to advise it and had sent a copy of
his report to the government.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, confirmed yesterday that he
had laid regulations to bring into effect greater legal powers for
pensioners whose pension funds are wound up.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Another place' welcomes Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE baroness looked unusually demure and self-effacing in her black hat and
scarlet robes. Only the determined grip on her handbag was familiar.
But then, this was no longer a mighty prime minister. It was a timorous
debutante on her first day in a new political playground - another time and,
as they say in the Commons of the neighbouring chamber, 'another place'.
Her audience by its size alone left no doubt, nonetheless, that her arrival
was a special occasion. As Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven progressed towards
a former member of her cabinet, the lord chancellor, the House of Lords'
scarlet benches were as packed as for the Queen's formal opening of
parliament.
In the front row of the opposition benches, two other former prime
ministers, Lord Wilson and Lord Callaghan, looked on. Just a row along sat a
handful of her most loyal Commons supporters, Euro-sceptics all, like
banished knights cast out of court.
Before the ceremony, Mrs Thatcher had conceded it to be 'a very nervy'
occasion. 'It is such a hot day - too hot to be wearing such heavy clothes,'
she said.
In the event she was as cool as ever, escorted by her sponsors, Lord Joseph,
her one-time political mentor, and Lord Boyd-Carpenter, once her boss at the
ministry of pensions.
The arcane rites - dating from 1672 - were observed. Slow progresses, a
brief kneel at the feet of Lord Mackay of Clashfern at the Woolsack, the
swearing of oaths to uphold the safety and defence of the kingdom and the
Church and the triplicate doffing of hats.
Then with a less formal handshake with Lord Mackay and a roar of approval
from the chamber it was over. The political rubicon of the central lobby
that divides Lords and Commons had been crossed.
Returning to the Chamber in her more familiar blue, the new baroness
respectfully held her tongue as Baroness Chalker defended the prime
minister's opposition to a referendum on Maastricht.
One peer, Lord Mounteagle, spent 43 years summoning up the courage to speak
between his swearing-in and his first address to the chamber. With a
Maastricht debate tomorrow, Baroness Thatcher is expected to make her
speaking debut a little sooner.

<TEXT>
MPs LAST night approved a motion authorising the establishment of select
committees to scrutinise the work of most government departments.
Demands from both sides of the House for the appointment of a select
committee on Northern Ireland were rejected by a government majority of 173
(201-28).
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, was jeered when he insisted that it
would be wrong to take such a step while the constitutional talks on the
future government of the province were still in progress.
There was also support from both sides of the House for a Labour move to
ensure that absorption of the Department of Energy by the Department of
Trade and Industry did not result in energy issues being denied adequate
consideration.
An attempt to appoint a sub-committee to deal with energy was defeated by a
government majority of 112 (179-67).
Mr Bruce Grocott, a Labour frontbench spokesman, urged the select committee
scrutinising the new Department for the National Heritage to investigate the
steady decline in public-service broadcasting.
He claimed that a 'Thatcherite view of broadcasting' was being imposed on
the industry, where morale was at an all-time low.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Cezanne sketch fetches Pounds 792,000: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PREVIOUSLY unpublished preparatory study of Cezanne's masterpiece 'Les
Grandes Baigneuses' was sold for Pounds 792,000 at Christie's on Monday
night. In a slim offering of 60 lots by the London auction house, drawings
were included in an attempt to maintain consistency of quality if not price.
The top-priced work was Monet's 'Charing Cross Bridge, La Tamise', which was
estimated at between Pounds 2m and Pounds 2.5m. It sold for Pounds 2.145m.
Interest was greatest in the so-called 'signature pieces' - works that
exemplify the best of an artist, with Chagall's exuberant 'La Grande Parade'
finding a a new home for just over Pounds 1m.
A lustrous and richly textured still life by Monticelli sold for Pounds
319,000, and Fantin-Latour's 'Roses', a minor masterpiece, found its sales
target of Pounds 165,000.
Perhaps the greatest surprise of the sale was the failure of a good and
early Dali which was bought in at Pounds 160,000. The sale totalled Pounds
7.986m with 24 per cent bought in.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Meeting sparks hope for Ulster
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONISTS yesterday injected a measure of optimism into all-party talks on
Northern Ireland's future by participating - apparently constructively - in
an unprecedented meeting with Irish ministers, Ralph Atkins writes.
The Rev Ian Paisley, the hardline leader of the Democratic Unionist party
who has in the past thrown snowballs in anger at an Irish prime minister,
spent two hours in London with a delegation that included Mr David Andrews,
the Irish foreign minister.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, now faces the difficult job
of moving the talks formally from 'strand one' - on devolution in the
province - to 'strand two', where the Irish Republic enters actual
negotiations, rather than just 'talks about talks' such as those at
yesterday's meeting. Mr Andrews left the meeting saying that the move had to
be made 'as quickly as possible'. Sir Patrick refused to comment but is
expected to chair a plenary session of 'strand one' in Belfast today that
would allow him to consult leaders of local parties.
Even if Sir Patrick was able to announce the opening of 'strand two' this
week - and it is not clear Unionists will agree - less than a month remains
before the talks process is supposed to end, with little apparent agreement
on areas discussed so far.
Yesterday was a 'preliminary' meeting that agreed an agenda for 'strand
three' - technically involving only the UK and Irish governments but with
local politicians acting as observers.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Move to cut local red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government moved yesterday to reduce the amount of red tape businesses
encounter in their dealings with local authorities.
Nine councils will establish partnerships with local business groups to draw
up guidelines to help businesses conform with regulations, under a pilot
programme announced by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister.
Small businesses often find it hard to comply with regulations covering such
areas as trading standards, environmental health, social services, planning,
building control and fire safety.
The local authorities in the project will set up consultation groups with
businesses to discuss issues and to draw up booklets.
The booklets will set out the authorities' regulatory responsibilities,
explain what information is available and where it can be found.
They will lay down performance standards that businesses can expect from the
authority on, for example, the response time to inquiries, and explain how
businesses can complain or appeal against a decision. The booklets are due
to be published by early next year.
The authorities include county and borough councils from Kent, Suffolk,
Ipswich, Nottinghamshire, Barnsley, South Ribble and Hounslow, west London.

<TEXT>
LONDON'S RiverBus, the loss-making Thames passenger service due to close at
midnight last night, has won a three-month stay of execution, Richard
Tomkins writes.
A consortium of public and private-sector bodies, mostly with interests in
the Docklands area of east London, has raised Pounds 300,000 to keep the
service going while efforts are made to secure its long-term future.
The service had looked doomed to closure after the financial collapse of
Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development in Docklands, which had subsidised
it.
The administrators to Canary Wharf have now agreed to pay half the cost of
underwriting the RiverBus's Pounds 100,000-a-month losses until the end of
September.
The balance of the losses will be underwritten by the London Docklands
Development Corporation, the City of London, some riverside London boroughs,
and leading Docklands companies.

FT  01 JUL 92 / No going back to the bad old days: Michael Cassell meets
Howard Davies, who takes over as CBI director-general today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Michael Heseltine sets off to bang on Whitehall doors in search of an
industrial policy, he can count on Mr Howard Davies, the new
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, being right
behind him.
Mr Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has long deplored the 'averted
gaze' of government when it comes to industry, and is pledged to take up its
cause along the corridors of power.
Mr Davies is an old Whitehall hand - if that is possible at 41 - and will be
expecting results. He takes over today at the CBI, following in the
footsteps of his predecessor, Sir John Banham, by coming from the Audit
Commission.
Although he confesses to some trepidation at the task ahead, he thinks he
has arrived at an exciting time. 'We have a newly elected government which
clearly thinks it ought to have an industrial policy but which has not quite
worked out what that might mean. The CBI is in a good position to engage in
a dialogue with government and to influence events.'
According to Mr Davies: 'Now it is possible to talk about an industrial
policy again, Mr Heseltine has to get the government as a whole to agree the
preconditions for a successful industrial base. Without some sort of
corporate strategy at national level, there is nothing to guide you when you
come to make the difficult decisions.'
In his book, there is no question of a return to bad old days of
interventionism and the discredited language of the corporatist past. But he
says there 'is a place for a kind of ideology in government' which, in the
long run, can have an effect on the nation's ability to create wealth.
If the CBI view prevails, Mr Heseltine will champion industry's cause on the
European stage, where Mr Davies says EC business organisations must begin to
play a much more forceful, influential role. He expects Mr Heseltine to be a
badly needed 'friend at court' in Westminster.
Mr Heseltine, Mr Davies says, has been given a licence to securea long-term
commitment to address British industry's difficulties within a framework of
agreed priorities.
Given the presence of industry's new 'champion' on several cabinet
committees, Mr Davies believes Mr Heseltine has ample opportunity to
influence the decision-making process. But if feathers occasionally get
ruffled in the Treasury or the Foreign Office, then so be it.
He says there 'is intelligent life in the Treasury'. But he suggests that
its narrow perspective badly needs to be broadened, something that the
decision to link the public expenditure and budget-fixing functions should
help.
With ministers now agreed on how public expenditure should be reshaped to
address economic weaknesses and to assist the creation of wealth, the CBI's
new man believes it would be that much harder for them to produce spending
programmes that denied their long-term objectives.
'There are, for example, deep anxieties over whether the government really
sees training and enterprise councils as a long-term investment in the
workforce, or as a way of administering quasi-benefit programmes. We need
clear commitments and spending decisions which support them.'
On Friday, Mr Heseltine is to announce further plans for the reorganisation
of his department. Mr Davies says a priority for industry will be the
appointment of someone within the DTI with responsibility for assembling
views from outside into a coherent framework for action. Mr Davies defines
this role as someone who is 'an interlocuter below the secretary of state
who is always prepared to talk about the things we want to talk about'.
He also believes Mr John Major should lead the new dialogue of understanding
between the government and industry by delivering a personal commitment to
building British industrial performance to match its competitors.
'I would also like to see him go abroad to a country where Britain needs to
improve its trade and to hear him say that he is leading a mission
specifically to do something about it. The process has to start at the top.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / Life policy penalties face probe: Lautro may curb
cancellation fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATORS are considering whether to limit the amount that life insurance
companies may charge policyholders who cancel within the first few years of
a contract.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance and unit trust
industries, is considering rules that would force shareholders in publicly
owned life insurance companies to bear part of the cost of early
terminations. Mutually held life insurers would have to deduct a portion of
costs from the life pool, owned jointly by remaining policyholders.
If adopted, the rules would allow policyholders who cancel their policies
early to receive refunds larger than those they are now entitled to. The
cost of each sale is deducted from the first few years of premiums paid and
policyholders cancelling in the first two years can lose up to 100 per cent
of contributions.
Rules under consideration would require each company's actuaries to provide
a guidance note specifying which part of early-terminators' sales costs
should be allocated to either shareholders or to the life fund, which is
jointly owned by remaining policyholders.
Present practice in the life insurance industry is to deduct the cost of
selling and maintaining each policy from the initial premiums paid. On
average, according to Lautro, it may take seven to 10 years for the holder
of a 20-year endowment policy to be entitled to a 100 per cent refund of
premiums.
Commission to the sales agent is the largest single cost.
The rules would apply to life insurance, pensions and other long-term
savings contracts.
A recent study by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, found that a quarter to a third of all policies were cancelled in
the first two years.
Consideration of the new rules follows completion of a report by Mr Marshall
Field, a partner at consulting actuaries at Bacon and Woodrow, who was asked
by Lautro to study front-ended charges for policyholders.
That report is to be considered by the Lautro board at the end of next
month. A draft of the report, circulated in April, suggested that it might
be unfair and unwise to allow life companies to continue to charge early
terminators for the full costs of their own sale.
Forcing companies to bear part of the cost would be an incentive for them to
see that policies were not mis-sold. Mis-selling occurs when consumers are
sold policies that, while not fraudulent, are inappropriate for their needs.
They are frequently cancelled in their early years.

UP TO 20,000 senior civil servants, including assistant secretaries and

and 6.2 per cent.
This follows a government survey of pay settlements in the private sector.
Under a pay formula the government is committed to giving rises to this
group of staff that fall within the middle 50 per cent of private-sector
settlements in the past year.
A report by the Office of Manpower Economics gives the range for the past
year as 4 per cent to 6.2 per cent, with a median of 5 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Boost to savings ratio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS' reluctance to increase spending and tough financial pressures on
many companies were highlighted in figures released yesterday pointing to
subdued growth this year.
The Central Statistical Office said the savings ratio - personal savings as
a percentage of disposable income - rose to its highest for nearly 10 years.
It was 11.5 per cent in the first quarter from 10 per cent in the last three
months of last year.
The bigger-than-expected increase highlighted how many consumers appear
unwilling to increase their spending.
Company spending in the first quarter exceeded receipts by Pounds 4bn, up
from a Pounds 1.1bn deficit in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds
2bn in the previous three months. Company profits fell 6 per cent between
the fourth and first quarters.
The seasonally adjusted figures covering personal and company finances may
have been distorted by uncertainty ahead of the general election. Many
consumers are thought to have reined back spending plans, leading to weak
sales growth.
Especially in the light of the lack of an evident upturn since the general
election, the statistics underline the generally weak state of demand in the
early part of this year.
One potentially bright spot for the economy in the first quarter was that
real personal disposable income increased by 1 per cent compared with the
fourth quarter of last year. That followed a 0.3 per cent decline between
1990 and 1991.
However, much of the increase reflected a 1.9 per cent increase in wages and
salaries between the fourth and first quarters, a development thought to be
due mainly to early payment of bonuses ahead of the election. Further
increases in income of this size are therefore not expected later in the
year.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Scargill stance on sell-off criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS' leaders were told yesterday by Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy
spokesman, to accept that they would probably lose the battle against
privatisation of the coal industry.
Mr Dobson said at the National Union of Mineworkers annual conference in
Scarborough he believed 'the cards are stacked heavily against keeping coal
in the public sector'. The NUM should draw up plans to protect the most
vulnerable pits and maintain safety standards, he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, disagreed that privatisation was now
inevitable. If contingency plans were discussed, then 'everyone in Britain
knows we have conceded the argument', he said.
The union wants to see the repayment of some EC grants if privatisation goes
ahead. Mr Scargill added that the conference 'should not rule out any
additional action'.
He outlined a campaign of action against sell-offs that would include legal
appeals to the European Court. The NUM is to argue that British Coal or
future mine owners should repay money saved by taking pension contribution
holidays.
Thousands of employers will watch closely as the NUM attempts to persuade
the European Court that the coal corporation acted illegally by taking a
pensions holiday.
The NUM's argument, outlined by Mr Scargill at the conference, is that the
European Court's Barber judgment established that pension-fund money was
deferred wages. The implication is that by withholding payments the
corporation is breaking the law.
According to the National Association of Pension Funds, 47 per cent of
companies were on holidays last year.
Mr Ivan Walker, a partner at law firm Russell, Jones and Walker, is one of
many who believe the European Court has no jurisdiction over the issue
because it involves property. The Barber ruling was different, he said,
because it was in the context of equal pay, an issue over which Europe has
jurisdiction.
Mr Scargill may consider a challenge through the UK courts where any
argument would rest, in part, on whether the fund's trust deeds empowered
its trustees to sanction a holiday, and if they were making a valid exercise
of their power.
British Coal said the power to take a holiday rested on a change agreed by
the rules amendment committee.
The corporation said that when there had been a shortfall in the pension
fund between 1975 and 1988 it had topped up its normal contributions with
Pounds 800m to make up the deficiency.

Compansation claims for the Isle of Man scheme must be submitted by July 15.
The Manx scheme was introduced five months before BCCI's collapse. It is

LAWYERS representing creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday called for a full public inquiry into what happened to the bank's
assets and who was responsible for the fraud that led to its closure last
year.
Speaking in front of the Luxembourg court, Mr James Lingard of Norton Rose,
the UK law firm that advises creditors' committees in London and Luxembourg,
said inquiries had been too limited. 'What we want to find out is who is
responsible and where the money went,' he said.
His call was part of an attempt to persuade the Luxembourg court not to
consent to a proposal agreed by BCCI's liquidators and the government of Abu
Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder.
The proposed settlement - likely to be in the region of between Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 629m) and Dollars 1.7bn - has already been approved by courts
in the UK and in the Cayman Islands but cannot take effect until Luxembourg
has approved it.
Touche Ross, liquidators to BCCI, said yesterday any remaining creditors who
has not yet done so should notify the firm of claims against the bank, even
though the official deadline expired yesterday.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Muscles flexed in power play: Juliet Sychrava on the case
for electricity discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tim Eggar, the energy minister, is in a confrontation with Britain's
blue-chip companies that might force him to tighten electricity industry
regulation.
Yesterday angry industrialists from the Energy Intensive Users Group lobbied
the minister for an urgent reduction in their electricity bill, just a day
after ICI publicly complained about electricity prices.
ICI said that without an electricity price cut, its chlorine business could
not compete in Europe.
'Our problem needs to be solved pretty well overnight,' said Mr Bryan
Bulloch, power services manager at ICI's chlor-alkali plant.
Mr Peter Ruff of the Chemical Industries Association, of which ICI is a
member, supported ICI's view. 'It is in the government's interest to make
sure energy pricing is realistic in the chemical sector,' he said.
The chemical industry contributed about Pounds 3bn to the balance of
payments, and employed 300,000 people, but sharply rising electricity bills
were threatening the sector, he said.
Other large companies, such as Blue Circle, Ranks Hovis McDougall and GKN,
also attacked Mr Eggar when he met the Major Energy Users Council (MEUC)
earlier this week.
The companies say their bills have risen by anywhere between 10 per cent and
30 per cent since electricity privatisation two years ago.
That contrasts with Mr Eggar's claim that 'the benefits of privatisation are
coming through', made last week after South Wales Electricity said it would
cut its prices by up to 2 per cent.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, said that with average profit
increases of 40 per cent, other regional companies could have done far more
for customers.
What Mr Eggar can do for those customers now is uncertain.
Traditionally, the government has countered complaints from ICI and others
by saying they were simply paying the price of losing the subsidies they
enjoyed before privatisation.
Many large users deny that they want subsidies back. Mr Ruff said the CIA
just wanted a breathing space until companies such as ICI could genuinely
choose their supplier, for instance from overseas.
But Mr Neil Tribick, vice-chairman of the electricity group of MEUC, wants
lower prices for big customers now. That does not mean subsidies, he says,
it means normal commercial practice. 'At the moment, the domestic consumer
buys his energy at the same rate as industrialists buying a million times
more. There is no recognition of large consumers' value to the industry.'
Without large consumers there would be no reliable demand, but peaks and
troughs that would make the generators' life impossible, he claims.
Domestic consumers already pay an average of about 3p a unit more than large
consumers. But, Mr Tribick and others argue, the differential is far less
than on the Continent, where, he said, his competitors paid at least 10 per
cent to 15 per cent less for their electricity.
Another large user from the steel industry said: 'If we moved across the
Channel we would pay 50 per cent less.'
That, many large users say, is because of high UK prices, not Continental
subsidies. Breaking down the UK price, they argue that it could be
substantially cut.
First, the 11 per cent nuclear levy or subsidy all electricity consumers pay
to Nuclear Electric should go, especially now that the company is making
more money.
Second, the regional companies' and National Grid Company's profits show
that their charges to customers for using the electricity network were set
too high at privatisation and should be brought down.
Finally, they should receive a discount on the underlying cost of wholesale
electricity.
ICI has another suggestion. It could buy coal on the world market and pay
the electricity industry a charge for converting it to power. Mr Bryan
Bulloch of ICI said yesterday: 'I think there is a chink there for a
solution and the DTI may seriously consider it.'
Large users believe there are a number of things Mr Eggar can do now. He can
encourage Offer, the industry watchdog which is reviewing National Grid's
charges, to take a firm line.
He can bring forward the review of the regional companies' charges, which is
due in 1994, and start cutting the nuclear levy.
One large user pointed out that there was a precedent for tightening
electricity regulation and squeezing profits in this way. 'The history of
privatised monopolies is that regulation needs to be tightened up. The
government set charges too generously. Now it must squeeze them.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / Businesses face the crunch over filing accounts: Andrew Jack
on new fines introduced by Companies House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM today, thousands of companies across Britain will start receiving
letters saying they are to be fined because they have not filed their
accounts.
Any limited company that is late in lodging its annual accounts at Companies
House, the government's central company information point, will be subject
to fines of up to Pounds 5,000.
Not surprisingly, officials have reported a sudden surge in the postbag over
the last few days in advance of the new penalty regime.
Mrs Lynne Beale, assistant director of compliance, has some simple advice
for those who may have missed the campaign, which culminates today: 'File.'
she says. 'It's in your own interest.'
The new penalty regime follows the most intensive marketing campaign ever by
Companies House, which is an executive agency under the government's Next
Steps init-iative.
Advertisements and posters have been warning the business community for
several months not to be late for a very important date - July 1 - in a
programme costing more than Pounds 300,000.
From today, thousands of companies will start to receive letters notifying
them that they are subject to mandatory fines for failing to meet the
deadlines - which are 10 months after their financial year-end for private
companies and seven months for public companies.
The fines operate on a sliding scale from a minimum of Pounds 100 for a
private company and Pounds 500 for a public company that files within three
months after deadline, up to Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000 respectively for
those filing more than 12 months late.
Since 1984, when the Commons public accounts committee criticised Companies
House for inadequate compliance, more than 1,300 company directors have been
fined and given a criminal record for failing to file accounts.
Companies House is responsible for collecting two sets of documents from
every company each year - the accounts, and the annual return, which
includes information on directors, the registered office and shareholders.
In the mid 1980s, only about 40 per cent of accounts were being received on
time. Now filings of both documents are running at nearly 82 per cent,
against a target of 85 per cent for June this year, and 86 per cent in 12
months' time.
Returns for the accounts alone - on which the fines are to be levied - are
at about 88.1 per cent. With a total of 1.1m companies, that means that
nearly 131,000 are liable to be penalised.
The recent campaign is clearly having an effect. Compliance for accounts has
shot up rapidly, from 85.3 per cent just a month ago.
Mrs Beale lists a number of excuses companies often recite for filing late:
that they have not been cleared with the tax authorities or that the annual
general meeting has not yet been held (those are not preconditions for
filing), that their accountant is responsible (he is not) or that it is too
much red tape to bother with.
She has little sympathy for those arguments. 'Disclosure of the accounts is
the price companies pay for limited liability,' she says. 'Everyone has a
right to know this information. Would you do business with a company that
fails to file its accounts on time?'

THE TWO defendants in the second Blue Arrow fraud trial have reversed their
decision to represent themselves in court and have reinstated their lawyers,
John Mason writes.
That follows a decision by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which employs the defendants
 -Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown - to pay the income-tax liabilities of
both men as well as their legal fees.
Those liabilities - which may approach Pounds 400,000 for each man - arise
from the Inland Revenue's decision to treat P&amp;D's payment of their legal
fees as a benefit in kind. Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown are both charged with
conspiracy to defraud.

Stately offer: one of Britain's most important neo-classical mansions is for
sale at a price of Pounds 4.5m. Heveningham Hall is a Grade I listed
Georgian building in Suffolk, built in 1752, with a 469-acre estate
landscaped by Capability Brown. Receivers Cork Gully were appointed last
year to sell the mansion after the death of Iraqi businessman Abdul Amir
Al-Ghazzi, who bought it from the government in 1981. Last December Mr
Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, said he would not buy back
Heveningham - a right that was part of the 1981 sale agreement. His decision
came in spite of pressure from heritage campaigners to end what the Suffolk
Building Preservation Trust called 'a tragic catalogue of neglect,
misfortunes and disasters' since 1981. The National Trust said last November
that the mansion should not be 'put at risk' by another sale on the open
market.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Lloyd's agencies may merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYTER Brockbank and Cassidy Davis, two of the most prominent agencies in
the Lloyd's of London insurance market, are discussing a merger.
The deal would bring some of Lloyd's best known and strongest syndicates
under common management and create one of the biggest businesses at Lloyd's
of London.
Hayter Brockbank's syndicate 861 is a market leader in shipping and oil rig
insurance, while Cassidy Davis syndicate 582 has won international renown in
the highly specialist political-risks field, where it supplies businessmen
with insurances to cover against risks such as kidnapping.
Both groups have won reputations for developing innovative methods. Cassidy
Davis recently became the first Lloyd's agency to appoint a marketing
director, while earlier this year Hayter announced that it intended to set
up a direct motor insurer, selling motor policies through a combination of
mass media advertising and telephone sales.
Lloyd's announced record losses of Pounds 2.06bn last week for the 1989 year
 -under its three-year accounting system - and its syndicates and the
agencies that manage them are under pressure to cut costs and increase
productivity.
The two groups have already reached agreement to merge Hayter Brockbank
syndicate 929 and Cassidy Davis syndicate 1114.
If the talks succeed, the combined group might be among the top five in the
Lloyd's market next year, measured by stamp capacity (the amount of premium
income the syndicates are allowed to underwrite according to Lloyd's rules).
Hayter Brockbank currently manages stamp capacity of Pounds 245m and Cassidy
Davis Pounds 90m.
Hayter, which has expanded rapidly during the past two years, has already
announced plans to increase the size of its two biggest syndicates.
Mr George Stevens, managing director of Hayter, expects managed capacity to
rise to Pounds 445m in 1993.
Both groups also own members' agents, which handle the affairs of Names, the
individuals whose assets provide the Lloyd's market's capital base. Mr
Stevens expects capacity here to amount to Pounds 330m next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, said yesterday that he
would dismiss any member of his government found implicated in the Bombay
financial scandal.
Addressing his first press conference in Delhi since taking over power a
year ago, he said that any minister found to have been involved in the
securities scandal 'will not remain in the ministry'.
Senior officials say privately that they know of no evidence to incriminate
ministers. Opposition leaders claim, however, that two or three ministers
are implicated and plan to make this the main plank of their attack on the
government when parliament reconvenes next week.
The prime minister defended the government's handling of the still widening
fraud case that has cost financial institutions more than Rs30bn (Pounds
576m) by saying that it had acted speedily when irregularities had been
uncovered.
Four of Bombay's leading stockmarket brokers and eight others, including two
managers of the Standard Chartered Bank Bombay were yesterday remanded in
custody by a special judge of the Bombay High Court.
Commenting on the enormity of the amount involved, the judge stressed that
the scandal 'was not a stray incident but a matter of extreme national
importance, the subversion of the banking and financial institutions as well
as the system'.
Officials argue that the onus of proof against ministers and senior
officials now lies with the opposition. If the opposition is unable next
week to substantiate allegations against ministers now widely circulating in
Delhi, the government will emerge the stronger.
Mr Rao also defended his government against charges that it was moving too
slowly over economic reform.
He said that over-rapid change could 'catapult' the country into further
difficulties. He said that what was needed was 'quick but steady change'.
Reaffirming his belief in increasing liberalisation, he said there would be
no change in the content or direction of policy.

employers pay only 3 per cent of salary into a pension fund, with added but

Japan's labour market showed signs of slackening in May in response to the
steep slowdown of the Japanese economy, although employment remained at high
levels, according to government statistics released yesterday, writes Steven
Butler from Tokyo.
Unemployment in Japan inched up by 0.1 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 2.1
per cent in May. The ratio of job offers to applicants, however, declined
from 1.17 to 1.14, according to the Labour Ministry, indicating a
considerable loosening of the labour market compared to March last year,
when the ratio stood at 1.47. In the manufacturing sector, employment fell
by 100,000 compared to April, when 20,000 jobs were lost, but there was an
increase of 580,000 jobs in the service sector.
Also yesterday, the Economic Planning Agency said its index of leading
indicators in April fell from 40.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent, pointing to
weak economic activity in the months ahead. The EPA report showed
across-the-board weakness of the economy, with the exception of the housing
sector.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S new government, to be led by the Labour party following its
election victory last week, will be committed to market reforms of the
sluggish economy, a key economic policy adviser to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister-elect, said yesterday.
But Mr Avraham Shochat, a senior Labour MP who is a leading candidate to
become finance minister, admitted in an interview that the party had not
formulated a detailed plan for the immigration-burdened economy.
This was despite calls from the US during the election campaign for an
urgent liberalisation programme.
Mr Shochat added that, although Labour backed privatisation, it opposed
allowing at least four of the biggest state-owned companies to slip out of
government hands.
They were Israel Chemicals, Israel Aircraft Industries, the telecoms
monopoly Bezeq, and the Israel Electric Corporation utility.
He suggested a majority of the shares in these four could be sold through a
stock exchange flotation, but the government would keep a form of control as
the biggest shareholder through a stake of 'at least 26 per cent'.
Mr Rabin has said he also favours keeping El Al, the state airline, under
similar control.
But Mr Shochat insisted that the party's traditional commitment to socialism
had changed, reflected in the endorsement of market-oriented reforms at a
policy-making party convention last year.
Accelerated privatisation is one measure being urged on the new government
to help cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. It is
supported by the Bank of Israel as well by as the US, which provides Israel
with Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in annual aid.
Mr Shochat said he accepted much of the central bank's advice, saying
Labour's privatisation plans would achieve 'quite a release of government
control over the economy'.
He said about Shk1bn (Pounds 217m) a year would be diverted from spending on
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to boost infrastructural
investment in Israel 'proper'.
Labour hopes this will persuade the US to provide Dollars 10bn in loan
guarantees to boost investment.

FT  01 JUL 92 / US backs Israeli stance on peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, last night gave immediate and
enthusiastic backing to a call by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister-elect, for Israel and the Arabs to start continuous negotiations in
Middle East peace talks originally launched last October.
'We were very pleased to see the statement by Mr Rabin saying let's engage
and let's stay engaged and let's get something done. We were very pleased to
see that and we would like to do what we can to assist in that effort,' Mr
Baker said in Washington.
His comments, made within a few hours of Mr Rabin's statement, were the
clearest expression yet by the Bush administration of its satisfaction over
the result of last week's general election.
They followed remarks by President George Bush on Monday saying he looked
forward to working with the new government, expected to be in place by
mid-July.
Washington had grown increasingly frustrated by Mr Yitzhak Shamir's
footdragging approach to the Arab-Israeli talks, which had gone through five
rounds of stop-start negotiations without achieving significant progress.
'We must move now to have a continuous negotiation. Let's sit down, not
every four, five or six weeks. Let's find out, can it be achieved or not,'
Mr Rabin said in Jerusalem.
The main talks involve separate negotiations between Israel and Syria,
Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Jordan and Israel and the Palestinians.
Mr Rabin wants to concentrate on the latter, aiming to reach an interim
agreement on Palestinian self-rule - which will precede talks on the final
status of the occupied territories - within nine months.
Palestinians have welcomed Mr Rabin's approach. But they are likely to be
unsettled by the prospect of the US and Israel, having mended their
differences, moving closely together on the peace talks.
Mr Rabin's offer of significant self-rule under the interim agreement will
test their preparedness to accept less than complete independence.
'We expect to find out to what extent the Palestinian delegation from the
territories is ready to negotiate seriously,' Mr Rabin said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S ruling authorities were in crisis talks yesterday in an attempt to
select a new leader to succeed Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the head of state who was
assassinated on Monday.
As the ruling High State Council met in permanent session, the state-run
television station continued its news blackout with non-stop broadcasts of
chants from the Koran.
According to a government official, a decision on a new leader could come in
the next few days.
General Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister and most influential figure on
the council, is an obvious candidate to succeed Mr Boudiaf as head of state.
However, the council might choose a civilian to deflect criticism of the
military grip on the country.
Meanwhile, the search for Mr Boudiaf's killers widened. The identity of
organisers of the attack, initially suspected to be the fundamentalist
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), remained a mystery.
After confused reports, it was confirmed that one of the attackers was shot
dead by Mr Boudiaf's bodyguards immediately following the assassination.
Security forces were yesterday questioning another suspect.
The population of Algiers reacted calmly to the attack on Mr Boudiaf, during
which about 40 other people are believed to have been injured, and the
forces of order kept a discreet presence on the streets.
The FIS is seen as having had strong motives to retaliate against the
government for its banning in March and for the imprisonment of thousands of
its members in desert camps. The authorities have also put seven of the
movement's senior members on trial for alleged crimes against the safety of
the state.
Several other influential groups also held grievances against Mr Boudiaf,
who made many enemies after being asked in January to take the leadership
after 28 years in exile.
He replaced President Chadli Bendjedid, who resigned in January after the
authorities cancelled Algeria's first multi-party elections which the FIS
was set to win.
said to believe that Mr Boudiaf's wish to hold a presidential election
before the end of the year was a dangerously fast return to democracy so
soon after the disaster of the last poll. The attack took place in the
eastern city of Annaba. It was only Mr Boudiaf's second trip outside the
capital since taking office.
Mr Boudiaf is expected to be buried alongside other national figures in Ain
Nadja cemetery, just outside Algiers.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Democrats form queues to back US trade
bill - Mileage can be won from 'foreignfoes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER since the US merchandise trade balance turned negative in the 1980s,
there has been an unwritten political rule: election years - particularly
presidential election years - require the Democrats to move a trade bill
through Congress.
This year's bill, which could come to the floor for debate as early as next
week, is not much different from past ventures. It allows the Democrats to
seem to stand up to foreign foes in a way that presidents - who must handle
the consequences - often cannot. Yet it gives the responsibility for tough
action to the president's appointee, the US trade representative.
The current trade bill is notable for the fact that the provision most
egregious to free traders has already been removed. It would have limited
domestic car production by Japanese subsidiaries, who were begged to set up
US plants a decade ago.
It would have frozen the Japanese share of the US market - imports and
domestic - at 1992 levels for seven years, raising the ceiling only to
offset the increase of American car exports to Japan.
This is not to say that all the controversial stipulations have been
removed. The bill remains, according to one US trade lawyer, 'a mishmash of
special interest legislation'.
It would, for example, expand the anti-dumping regime to attack
'circumvention' of dumping duties. Thus countries which set up final
assembly facilities to 'evade' dumping duties in third countries - or even
the US - could still find the duties imposed either on the final product or
on its imported parts.
One proposal takes aim at EC patent rules. Another requires the US trade
representative to retaliate (with a few exceptions) against countries if a
year of negotiations over intellectual property rights fails to convince
them to change their ways.
It also contains a five-year extension of 'Super 301' - a provision in the
1988 trade legislation which required the US trade representative to name
the countries with the most formidable trade barriers and negotiate them
away. Super 301 expired after two years, much to the trade representative's
relief.
The bill requires the trade representative to institute a trade complaint
against Japan for its closed rice market and substantially tightens the
rules for the Generalised System of Preferences, which gives duty-free entry
to products from developing countries.
Democratic Congressman Sander Levin of Michigan is expected to bring to the
House floor an amendment which directs US trade officials to
institutionalise the informal commitments made by Japanese motor companies
early this year.
It would require Japanese companies to boost their purchases of parts from
US suppliers and it suggests holding Japanese car exports at 1.65m.
The current trade bill also has something the administration wants - customs
modernisation - on the theory that President George Bush may be induced not
to veto it. But that is a decision still to be made.
In the House, the legislation has the blessings of trade hawks - such as Mr
Richard Gephardt, the Majority leader - and moderates, such as Mr Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the powerful ways and means committee.
It is likely to get toned down when it reaches the Senate and vetoed by the
president, but opponents worry that similar legislation may reappear next
year.
In the Senate, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee
which has authority over trade, would like a simple bill extending Super 301
and a 'trade enforcement act' which requires the US government to retaliate
if countries fail to live up to their trade agreements.
Most congressmen know passage of the proposed legislation would create an
outcry in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). They also know
that the voters do not have a clue about either the Gatt or international
trade rules, so they hope the legislation can be sent to the president for
an unpopular veto just before the November elections.

travel agent's ticket prices, writes Bethan Hutton. The UK general manager
of Nigeria Airways, Mr Brendan Anugwom, was fined Pounds 2,000. The
injunctions were granted in July and November after CES Travel complained
that the state-owned airline was selling tickets at lower prices than
specified in a sales agreement.

A CANDY-STRIPED book landed on the desks of Japanese building executives
yesterday, instructing them in the fine arts of competition and the dangers
of dango, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo.
Dango are cosy cartels to 'smooth out the bumps of competition' - as an
executive once put it - by awarding contracts, fixing prices and generally
rigging bids. They have upset the US, which wants to prise open the market
for its contractors. By publishing the book, Japan's Federation of
Construction Contractors hopes to show the US it is tackling the problem.
Publication coincides with a warning by the Construction Ministry to 66
companies found to have rigged bids for government projects in Tokyo.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE US steel companies yesterday filed 84 trade complaints against 21
foreign countries in their latest attempt to counter flat-rolled steel
imports and trading practices they claim are unfair.
Led by the six biggest integrated steel companies, the producers submitted
to the US Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission the
most extensive set of 'unfair trade cases' in the industry's history. The
same strategy in the 1980s forced foreign governments to agree 'voluntary'
restraint agreements in exchange for an end to expensive trade action.
Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel Group, said an exhaustive review of
international trading patterns showed many governments continued to
'massively subsidise' their steel exports and 'systematically' dump them in
the US 'at prices far below fair market value and often below' production
cost. Despite Dollars 23bn (Pounds 12.4bn) spent to modernise the industry,
the steelmakers last year lost more than Dollars 2.2bn, he added. 'Another
Dollars 108m was lost in the first quarter of the year; results for the
second will also be unsatisfactory.'
Almost all major steel-producing countries were named. Britain was accused
of subsiding its steel production by 20.15 per cent and selling its exports
in the US market at 18.05-114.81 per cent below what US law considers fair
market value. Germany was accused of 5.39-64.46 per cent subsidies and
1.97-64.46 per cent dumping margins. Also named were Argentina, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan.
The steel producers ignored pleas by US steel trading companies to refrain.
The producers are led by USX, Bethlehem Steel, LTV, Inland Steel, Armco and
National Steel.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: KLM poised for right to operate within the
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM, the Dutch national airline, is poised to be the first European airline
to be granted the right to operate within the US. The deal could open the
way for other European countries to strike similar deals and, as part of a
quid pro quo, give US airlines increased rights to operate between European
cities.
'The first round of talks (between the US and the Netherlands) is expected
to take place in late August,' Mr Pieter Bouw, KLM president, said
yesterday. 'This could well lead to the signing of an agreement between the
US and the Netherlands before the American presidential elections in
November.'
Washington hopes other European governments could be pressed by the move to
open up their own skies, so that their national airlines could follow KLM
into the US domestic market.
Mr Jeffrey Shane, US assistant transportation secretary , said this week:
'There needs to be a competitive prod in the form of a carrier establishing
a much larger foothold in North America and forcing everyone else to
catch-up ball'.
In the US magazine Aviation Week, he said KLM would be the most likely
European carrier to fulfil this role. It could be followed by Singapore
Airlines if the US government's planned 'open skies' policy were extended to
the Pacific Basin.
KLM and Singapore Airlines would benefit from the main plank of that policy:
introduction of 'cabotage', the right for foreign airlines to fly in the US.
August's talks between the US and the Netherlands will include the question
of foreign ownership of US airlines.
KLM has a 20 per cent stake in the parent company of Northwest Airlines, the
fourth biggest US carrier by turnover. US law prevents foreign ownership of
airlines. Mr Bouw wants 'substantially simplified regulation of non-citizen
ownership of airlines'.
No plans existed to raise KLM's stake in Northwest, but rule changes would
'open almost limitless opportunities for co-operation with Northwest.' This
could mean improving links between the two airlines' networks, and in areas
such as maintenance, where work can be shared. Mr Bouw will press for an
increase in the number of US cities from which KLM can fly to Europe, an
important step in setting up a global airline network. This was a project
KLM could not complete on its own.
But KLM and British Airways had not re-started talks on a strategic
alliance. However, 'we are not ruling out a BA deal yet'.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Hopes fade for quick end to Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks would be
settled before US elections in November appeared to fade yesterday as
European Commission officials conceded they had given up hope of presenting
a compromise on farm trade to the US this week.
To break a long-standing dispute with the US on farm protection measures,
the EC needed to present its compromise to Washington before next week's
Group of Seven summit in Munich.
An EC official predicted that no settlement would be possible until after
the US elections, warning that trade disputes between the EC and the US
could escalate into trade war.
There were hopes that the trade talks impasse could be broken in May when
the EC agreed sweeping reforms of its Common Agriculture Policy. This
appeared to pave the way for EC cuts in subsidised farm trade that the US,
and other farm exporters, had been calling for since the end of 1990.
EC officials insist that differences between the US and the EC are now
infinitesimal, but complain that conflicts inside the EC secretariat, and
crises elsewhere, have made it impossible to agree an EC position that could
be offered to the US. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, has been ready
to meet EC officials at short notice.
At the same time, however, staff inside the EC Agriculture Commission have
argued that there is no urgency to reach a settlement with the US. This
position has been endorsed by France, which is Europe's leading food
exporter and is concerned by Uruguay Round proposals to cut subsidised food
exports by 36 per cent in value terms, and by 24 per cent in terms of
volume.
An official in the EC's External Affairs Commission said yesterday that the
Maastricht crisis, and conflict in Yugoslavia, had diverted the attention of
Europe's leaders: 'I don't think anything can now happen (on the Uruguay
Round) until after the US election.
'The main failure here is with the Commission itself,' he added. 'Unhappily,
because of internal divisions, we have not been able to agree a position
that we are ready to fight for, and to sell to member states.'
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has in turn been unwilling or
unable to create the necessary consensus.
The official warned that US-EC disputes over Airbus, steel, oilseeds and
shipbuilding - which have been held in check while Uruguay Round
negotiations have continued in earnest - also threaten to escalate.
'There will have to be a lot of goodwill or this could slip into a trade
war.'

MRS Irene Seale pleaded guilty yesterday to extortion and conspiracy to
commit extortion in connection with the fatal kidnapping of Mr Sidney Reso,
the Exxon executive whose body was found last weekend, writes Alan Friedman
in New York.
US law enforcement officials said Mrs Seale had also agreed to enter a
guilty plea on state kidnapping charges, but federal kidnapping and other
charges would be dismissed as part of a plea agreement. The plea bargain,
which still stipulates a minimum prison term of 20 years, was agreed after
Mrs Seale began co-operating with prosecutors. It is understood that her
information led the FBI to the wooded area in southern New Jersey where Mr
Reso's corpse was buried.
Mrs Seale's husband - Mr Arthur Seale, a former Exxon security guard - is
expected to face murder charges. The Seales were arrested on kidnap,
extortion and conspiracy charges on June 19. Mr Reso apparently died several
days after suffering a gunshot wound to the arm.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Clinton benefits from infighting of rivals: Political
squabbling reduces support for Bush and Perot in the US presidential race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton has been the instant beneficiary of a sharp political
confrontation between President George Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the
prospective independent US presidential candidate.
The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll has the likely Democratic nominee
rising from third to first place in the election race. It is the first time
this poll has put Mr Clinton ahead this year and the first time it has
relegated the president to third place, albeit by margins the pollsters
consider statistically insignificant.
The poll gave Mr Clinton 33 per cent of support, Mr Perot 31 per cent and Mr
Bush 28 per cent, against 36 per cent for Mr Perot, 30 per cent for Mr Bush
and only 26 per cent for the Arkansas governor three weeks earlier.
It is the second leading poll within a week to suggest that Mr Perot's
support may have peaked. He seems to have disappointed Democrats and the
better educated, both of whom had been big factors in his initial charge to
the front of the presidential field. Among Democrats, his support dropped to
24 per cent from 35 per cent earlier. Most of the support returned to Mr
Clinton.
Although the Post poll did not ask specific questions about Mr Perot's
alleged investigations into the Bush family and his countercharges of a
Republican 'dirty tricks' campaign, more than 40 per cent of those surveyed
said the more they knew about Mr Perot the less they liked him.
Meanwhile, as his two rivals have thrown invective at each other, Mr Clinton
has been portraying himself in the last two weeks as the moderate,
policy-oriented voice of reason. This seems to have paid off - with two in
three respondents in the Post survey saying they had heard of his recently
unveiled economic plan, and about half approving of it.
Unlike Mr Bush, Mr Clinton has also managed to shape a Democratic party
platform very much in his image. Although platforms often mean little in the
heat of a presidential race, this one offers few hostages to fortune by way
of expensive and quintessentially liberal policy commitments.
It makes much of 'traditional' family values, an issue which Republicans and
possibly Mr Perot have sought to make their own.
The president will still have to fight off Republican critics of his stand
against abortion. The Supreme Court's refusal on Monday to overturn the
landmark Roe vs Wade judgment, as Mr Bush wanted, may take some of the heat
out of the issue, since it left the demarcation lines in the debate blurred.
But it leaves the president out on a limb.
Mr Bush must be concerned that his poll ratings continue to decline. For an
incumbent president to be running third, even at an early stage of a
volatile campaign, is not a ringing endorsement.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Collor rules out resignation over corruption claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil made a desperate bid to hang on to power
last night with an impassioned address to the nation denying the mounting
charges of corruption which threaten to end his political career.
Appearing tearful but controlled, Mr Collor insisted: 'I will stay to the
end of my mandate, and those who think they can intimidate me with unjust
accusations are fooling themselves.'
His address was his third and most critical since the wave of allegations
against him was initiated by his younger brother a month ago. Yesterday's
20-minute speech came in response to claims that his household expenses are
being paid by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, his campaign treasurer who is currently
under congressional inquiry for alleged extortion.
Mr Collor strongly denied the charges and insisted he had neither met nor
spoken to Mr Farias for almost two years.
'My government has nothing to hide,' he said, showing a statement from his
private secretary testifying that he had paid his own bills.
The president hit out at political opponents and 'vested interests' whose
privileges, he said, had been harmed by his modernisation programme. 'I was
elected by 35m votes and will not accept a fabricated crisis by those who
want power through non-democratic means.'
He warned 'with each rumour, each allegation, the dollar rises, the stock
market falls, people increase prices and the country loses. Those who lose
most are those with least.'
But with almost all his aides and family now named in the country's worst
corruption scandal, Mr Collor's position is becoming increasingly untenable.
Early reaction to his speech suggested it would not save him.
Folha de Sao Paulo, the leading opposition newspaper, carried yesterday a
front-page editorial demanding his resignation. Mr Eduardo Suplicy, a
senator from the Workers' party, said the country's stability depended on Mr
Collor quitting.
Several ministers are threatening to abandon the president. Mr Jose
Goldemberg, education minister, told reporters: 'The documents which are
appearing require an explanation.' Mr Pedro Luis Rodrigues, the presidential
spokesman, admitted Mr Collor's speech was mainly aimed at convincing the
ministers to stay.
The financial markets were calmer yesterday after Monday's 14.7 per cent
drop, rising 6.2 per cent by the close. However, one trader warned: 'This
does not indicate stability, but simply how much stocks have already
fallen.'
The central bank has had to sell more than Dollars 500m (Pounds 270.2m) in
reserves to prevent an explosion in the dollar rate.

JAPANESE Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in the US yesterday on a
three-day visit ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Munich next week,
agencies report from Washington.
He will meet President George Bush at the White House today before flying by
helicopter to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, for more
talks. It will be the first meeting between the two leaders since Mr Bush's
trip to Tokyo in January, when his trade mission was overshadowed by his
collapse at a state dinner.
As well as a series of trade disputes between the US and Japan, they will
discuss aid to the ex-Soviet republics, nuclear safety, third world debt and
the Uruguay Round trade negotiations - all items high on the G7 agenda.
An official said the US side would press Japan to move more quickly to open
markets in such areas as semiconductors, glass and car parts.
He said Japan could expect US support for efforts to regain several small
islands occupied by the Soviet Union after the Second World War - a likely
issue when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visits Tokyo in September.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Colombia clarifies foreign investors' tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Colombian Congress has passed legislation clearing up uncertainty about
the tax treatment of foreign investors, although such investment will still
be treated less favourably than originally proposed by the government.
The legislation had been stuck in Congress for months; legislators made
various proposals that would have set tax levels so high that foreign
investors would have been driven away.
Although the tax burden on foreign companies will initially be fairly heavy,
the rate will drop significantly in succeeding years, particularly for those
reinvesting part of their profits in the country.
The government needed to raise tax revenues, in part to replace lost income
from reduced taxes and duties on foreign trade. The 1991 fiscal deficit is
forecast at about 1.4 per cent of GDP, but 1 per cent of this is due to weak
coffee prices, which increase government transfers to growers.
Foreign companies will be liable for the basic income tax rate of 30 per
cent and a surtax charge of 7.5 per cent. The tax on profit remittance
starts at 12 per cent in 1993 and, for non-oil companies, falls to 7 per
cent by 1996.
For oil companies, the rates are higher because of a 600 peso/barrel (92 US
cent) production tax and because the profit remittance tax will stay at 12
per cent.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Right wing to block Chile reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S right-wing opposition is preparing to block a vital package of
constitutional reforms proposed by President Patricio Aylwin, in retaliation
for its humiliating defeat in municipal elections on Sunday.
The reforms seek to expand the limited scope of democratic rights set out in
the 1980 constitution, a legacy of General Augusto Pinochet's 16-year
dictatorship.
Mr Aylwin can draw only limited comfort from the 53.3 per cent polled by his
centre-left coalition in Sunday's contest. The opposition, which controls
the Senate, said the vote did not give him a mandate to 'steamroller the
country with political reforms'.
The draft amendments seek, among other things, to weaken Gen Pinochet's
constitutionally unassailable hold over the armed forces and what is, in
effect, his and the military's control over the Senate and the National
Security Council.
'Without the proposed changes,' says Mr Sergio Bitar, a leading socialist in
Mr Aylwin's coalition, 'Chile risks being saddled with an emasculated
democracy, a rubber stamp parliament and a president subject to being
pressured by the armed forces.'
Renovacion Nacional, the largest opposition party, says the reforms are a
'political time-bomb'. The extreme-right Union of Independent Democrats
regards the 1980 constitution as one of the finest achievements of military
rule and says it will not sanction any changes.
The hostility of right-wing parties to constitutional reform signals the end
of the 'democracy of consensus' that marked the first two years of Mr
Aylwin's administration. Back then the government won important tax and
labour reforms with the co-operation of opposition leaders, who were keen to
establish their democratic credentials.
But the mood for compromise has evaporated following the right's setback in
the municipal elections, where it polled less than 30 per cent.
The opposition's chances of winning next year's presidential and
congressional elections look slim, which is why it will do everything in its
power to torpedo the government's programme.
Even before the package was sent to parliament, government officials were
admitting the amendments would founder in the opposition-controlled Senate.
They implied that their presentation was a mere formality to comply with Mr
Aylwin's electoral pledges.
The president has begun to back out of some of his proposed reforms.
Designated senators will be allowed to complete their eight-year terms. He
has also promised he will not fire Gen Pinochet, now 76 and fitted with a
pacemaker, from the army command if Congress restores the president's power
to decide military appointments.
But Mr Aylwin's about-turn has disappointed the left flank of the ruling
coalition. They believe a booming economy and the government's popularity is
blunting the president's reforming zeal.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S ruling coalition yesterday agreed to finance old age care within
the public health services, adding a potential new burden to the costs of
social security facing German employers.
The deal should bring to an end one of the longest-running disputes in
German politics, which has bitterly divided the government, and left the
whole system of old age homes in limbo for the past 20 years.
Agreement was reached yesterday after the Free Democrats (FDP), the liberal
minority partner in the coalition, backed down and accepted that financing
of old age care would have to be included in the wider state health
insurance scheme.
Previously the FDP, strongly backed by German industry, had argued that old
age homes should be financed by individual, voluntary contributions.
The deal, which seeks to compensate employers for their higher social
security payments by relieving them of the legal requirement to pay sick pay
for a day away from work, was condemned by both employers and trade unions.
The former claimed that the long-term and incalculable costs of old age care
would not be fully compensated.
The trade unions announced total opposition, and threatened protest strikes,
if sick pay protection is affected. Absence through sickness in Germany is
widespread, because at present three days' sick pay are guaranteed.
The agreement was greeted with delight in the coalition, and in particular
by Mr Norbert Blum, the employment minister. 'After 20 years of debate, this
is a good day for the welfare state,' he said.
It is estimated that 1.65m old and disabled people currently qualify for
nursing care, a figure likely to rise by 250,000 by the year 2010. Places in
homes cannot be guaranteed, and some 270,000 receive social security
payments while staying at their own homes.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Markets fearful about Spanish economy: Speculation grows
that Gonzalez may be tempted to call early general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in employment in Spain, along with a widening of the country's
public sector deficit, is adding to speculation about an early general
election and causing heavy selling by foreign investors on the Madrid stock
exchange.
The Madrid bolsa, which lost more than four points on Monday, reached 1992
lows yesterday. The government, its optimistic job creation and
deficit-cutting targets for the year well out of reach, is struggling to
decide how to improve its deteriorating finances.
The first signs of concern in the markets emerged after Denmark voted
against ratifying the Maastricht treaty The Danish rejection prompted heavy
selling of long-term Spanish bonds, threatening to force Madrid into
expensive short-term financing of its debt.
Ireland's 'yes' vote only briefly lifted the gloom, but official figures
published in the last week have shown that Spain is now operating very wide
of the mark on almost all its main economic indicators.
For the first time since the country joined the EC in 1986, Spain is
suffering a net reduction in jobs, with 110,000 jobs - 1,200 a day - being
lost in the first quarter of 1992. In December, the government was
predicting net job creation of 200,000 this year and the reduction in
employment is likely to aggravate already strained relations with the
unions.
Madrid has badly miscalculated its income for the year, with official
receipts rising just 2.8 per cent by May as the economy cools, while public
spending has risen more than 10 per cent. If Madrid was not delaying
payments, spending would be up by around 20 per cent. At the same time the
trade deficit has risen 15 per cent to Dollars 16bn following a slowdown in
exports.
For a government that has trumpeted its intention to cut the public sector
deficit from 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product to just 1 per cent of
GDP by the end of 1996, its inability to control spending is a serious
setback. Some economists believe that unless measures are quickly taken the
1992 public deficit could widen to 5 per cent of GDP.
Madrid is scaling down 1992 growth forecasts from 3 per cent to around 2 per
cent, but independent projections suggest growth will fall well under that.
Some analysts are forecasting 1992 inflation of nearly 8 per cent, a 2.5
point rise on 1991.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, is studying two emergency measures
to boost income - to increase the tax witheld on personal incomes and an
immediate increase in VAT from 13 per cent to 15 per cent before the higher
figure becomes obligatory next January.
He may also try to persuade Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to freeze current
spending and is likely to try to impose an extremely restrictive 1993 budget
on the cabinet in the autumn. His problem is that campaigning for the next
general election - which must be held by October 1993 - is already underway.
Mr Solchaga is believed to be urging Mr Gonzalez to go to the polls early,
or at least before further economic belt-tightening measures become
inevitable.
Spain has already been stung by the European Community's refusal to make
so-called cohesion funds available to it this year and was unable to secure
agreement on how much these would be worth at the EC summit in Lisbon last
week.
The Spanish government is to appoint Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the 58-year old
deputy governor of the Bank of Spain, as governor when the current two-term
incumbent, Mr Mariano Rubio, retires at the end of July.
The appointment ends months of speculation after Mr Rubio's involvement in a
financial scandal earlier this year made it unlikely he would be reappointed
for a third term. Mr Rojo is a highly respected academic who studied at the
LSE.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Bonn fails to back the EFA: Coalition calls for cheaper,
slimline version of proposed Eurofighter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S ruling coalition partners yesterday refused to give the green
light for production of the European Fighter Aircraft developed with
Britain, Italy and Spain, but stopped short of pulling out of the programme.
In Bonn, the coalition partners indicated their preferred course of action
was to build a cheaper, slimline fighter developed on the same basis and
with the same partners, to be called the Eurofighter 2000. They suggested
that other European partners, meaning France, might be brought back into the
programme.
The apparent ambivalence in the German position has left the UK government
still not wholly convinced that the original project has collapsed, putting
thousands of aerospace jobs at risk. Urgent talks will now be held between
London, Rome and Madrid on how to interpret Bonn's position.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, will also face discreet
questioning when he comes to London on a long-scheduled visit next Monday.
Hopes remain that Germany's official retreat from the EFA project is chiefly
aimed at heading off domestic political criticism.
The compromise was seized on by both supporters and opponents of the EFA as
a victory. Britain, Italy and Spain will have to decide if they are ready to
negotiate with Germany on a cheaper and lighter aircraft, still modelled on
the EFA.
Mr Ruhe claimed the decision meant the end of the 'Jager-90', as the EFA is
called in Germany, but admitted that the new aircraft would be developed on
the same basis.
Members of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian-based coalition partner
which has fought furiously to save the project, said the decision meant
little more than 'a change of labels'. The fighter programme would continue
'at a lower level', one official said.
The UK, which like Germany has a 33 per cent stake in the programme,
indicated it was prepared to discuss with Germany and the other two partners
the future of the EFA. Government officials insisted that while 'no one
wants Germany to leave the programme' conversion of the project to build a
less sophisticated aircraft was not a viable option.
UK officials also said they were encouraged that Germany had decided to stay
in the development stage of the programme, which would allow all partners to
review the situation again.
British Aerospace, however, said it continued to believe, 'as every
consortium study has shown, that EFA remains the most cost effective means
of meeting the common operational requirements of the four air forces'.
It also added that it did not believe a lighter version of EFA would fill
air force requirements and that other options would be more expensive than
the original programme.
One possibility mooted last night was for Germany to acquire the EFA
airframe but to equip the aircraft with its own avionics and radar systems
to reduce its overall cost.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, also stressed in the House of
Commons that the UK still considered EFA to be the best solution for the
four countries.
BAe claimed last night that EFA could still be completed by the three other
partners within the prescribed costs of about Pounds 20bn for the
four-nation programme without Germany.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said the cost implications of a
German withdrawal could be minimised by rationalising production plans.
The decision was also greeted with some relief by Deutsche Aerospace, the
aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz.
'It is positive that they say the co-operation should be continued, and that
a new fighter aircraft is needed by the Luftwaffe around the year 2000,' the
company said.
'We will now have to consider the decision in detail, and investigate how
the failure to go ahead with production preparations will affect our
operations.'
The compromise resolution agreed by the joint parliamentary group of the
Christian Democrats and CSU said the 'Jager-90 in its present form is too
expensive. The total system price . . . must be substantially reduced'.
After declaring that a new fighter is 'absolutely necessary' for the
Luftwaffe 'around the year 2000', the decision states that 'the European
co-operation of the four EFA partners should be continued and if possible
extended to bring in further partners'.
Casa, the Spanish partner in the programme, said it was committed to EFA.
'It is not true that Spain would leave the consortium if Germany withdraws,'
said Mr Jose Alvarez Vara, Casa's chairman.
But a decision on an increase in Spain's 13 per cent participation in the
project would be delayed.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Treasury warned on flagging industrial production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has been told privately by senior economists from some of
Britain's largest companies that manufacturing output is flagging. It is one
of the starkest warnings yet that the recovery is failing to materialise.
The message was delivered last week at a meeting between Mr Alan Budd, the
Treasury's chief economic adviser, and a group of economists assembled by
the Treasury.
The gathering provided a sombre assessment of how weak world growth and high
UK interest rates are damaging prospects for the manufacturing sector. It
accounts for just over a fifth of UK gross domestic product and in the first
quarter of this year was one of the few bright spots in the economy.
In the three months to March 31, manufacturing output grew by 0.3 per cent -
compared with the previous three months - while the economy as a whole
contracted by 0.5 per cent.
According to the private sector economists, however, manufacturing growth in
the second and third quarters is likely to be flat, at best.
Amid increasing signs of restiveness by some Tory backbenchers about the
lagging pace of the expected upturn, the bleak views expressed will increase
the pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to seek ways to stimulate
growth, possibly through a cut in borrowing rates.
Mr Lamont needs a relatively large increase in output this year and in 1993
to reduce the growing strains on government finances, which are being pushed
into large deficits by reduced tax revenues and higher social security
spending.
Last night, the chancellor again insisted that the government was adamant in
its rejection of proposals that the UK might either leave the exchange rate
mechanism or seek a realignment within it.
Speaking to a Commons' dinner of the rightwing Conservative '92 Group, he
repeated his earlier claims that any attempt to devalue sterling would
result in higher rather than lower interest.
In an effort to allay fears of a substantial increase in Britain's
contributions to the European Community budget, he pointed out that any such
move would be fiercely resisted. It was absurd that criteria for monetary
union required a squeeze on deficits and at the same time, the Commission
was seeking increased spending by member states, he said.
The Treasury's meeting with the industrial economists - from sectors
including chemicals, metals and engineering - is expected to be the first of
a series of such gatherings, repeated three times a year.
It is part of an effort by Mr Budd to build up stronger links with
industrialists, to help in economic forecasting.
It is intended that the meetings will take place on a regular basis and
provide objective assessments of industry trends.
For the moment, the Treasury is sticking to its forecast in March that
growth this year will be 1 per cent. But it is now revising this figure
downwards.
A further reminder of the weak state of demand came with news that the
savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of disposable income - rose
to 11.5 per cent in the first quarter, its highest level for nearly 10
years.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK presidency to set stage for enlarged EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government marked the start of its European Community presidency
today with a confident prediction that the next six months will set the
stage for the EC's rapid enlargement from 12 to at least 15 members.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, underlined the government's determination to push through
ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Delivering a broad hint to Conservative Euro-sceptics that the government is
willing to make ratification a fundamental issue of confidence, Mr Hurd
said: 'What the prime minister has done has been to make it clear that this
is not a peripheral matter. It is an essential part of government policy.'
His comments came as loyal Conservative MPs renewed their attacks on the
newly ennobled Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven. During another orchestrated
performance in the House of Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
joined backbench MPs in reminding his predecessor that the Single European
Act which she had signed in 1985 was responsible for much of the
'centralisation' in the EC.
Cabinet ministers said the government was determined to discredit the stand
taken by Lady Thatcher, who intends to renew her onslaught on Maastricht in
her maiden speech to the House of Lords.
Mr Major, who said the Maastricht accord looked forward to
'decentralisation', will be joined today by cabinet colleagues for joint
talks on the presidency with Mr Jacques Delors and the European Commission.
Mr Hurd acknowledged the Commission president would have liked a federal
structure for the Maastricht Treaty. 'He would like to feel that the
Commission was a strong executive with a strong central power, but that is
not what happened. But he is a realistic man. He is beginning to realise -
though not all his colleagues have - what harm has been done.'
The foreign secretary, who will chair the EC council of ministers in the
run-up to the Edinburgh summit in December, said critics of Maastricht had
not appreciated the extent to which the 'flow of ideas' in the Community was
running in Britain's direction. That included the new interests in
enlargement and 'minimum interference by Brussels' as well as a more
realistic approach to EC spending.
Mr Hurd singled out the change of mood over enlargement as central to the
trend. Despite wrangling at Lisbon, he said that from three to five of the
European Free Trade Association countries should be members by 1995.
Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and, possibly, Norway are all
candidates.
Britain intends to put the preparation of a negotiating mandate at the
centre of its presidency and Mr Hurd said that it was 'realistic' to expect
their entry within three years.
He reinforced his message on the importance of sticking with Maastricht in a
speech circulated by Conservative Central Office.
If Britain sought to renege, he said, it would amount to behaving like
'political spivs'. With the arguments running in its direction, it would be
foolish to back off into 'noisy and destructive isolation'.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Inquiry clears Lloyd's of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has been cleared of any suggestion of fraud or malpractice
by the committee of inquiry set up under the chairmanship of Sir David
Walker.
However, in a report to be submitted to the insurance market's governing
council this morning, Sir David criticises the standards of some market
professionals.
He says the care and diligence of a number of members' agents, managing
agents and underwriters fell 'materially below best practice'.
He calls for those working in the market to monitor constantly one another's
standards of practice and for new regulations to ensure fairness in the
allocation of Names - individuals whose wealth backs the market - on
syndicates.
Sir David stresses that the existing weaknesses in the market are not
significantly caused by the regulations under which Lloyd's is governed.
The Walker committee was established in mid-February to examine allegations
particularly concerning whether so-called external Names were
disproportionately placed on syndicates which made the greatest losses.
The report says that the 'catastrophic losses' sustained in the 1988 and
1989 underwriting years can be wholly explained in commercial terms and
judgments.
It says the losses sustained on so-called LMX - London market excess -
business were not confined to Lloyd's syndicates during that period and were
also experienced by a number of corporate re-insurers.
The report concludes: 'We do not find the developments of the LMX spiral to
have been improper or to have been distorted by conspiracy or mis-feasance.'
It adds that confidence in the Lloyd's market can be rebuilt, and recommends
reforms which could be taken within the existing framework of self
regulation.
Last night Lloyd's said: 'The council will consider these matters today but
must broadly be in agreement with the findings of Sir David's committee.
There is obviously much to be learned from his committee and we will apply
these lessons vigorously.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Move from cyclical to
defensive stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING Monday's 3.8 per cent drop in Hoogovens in Amsterdam, steels
dropped across the board in Frankfurt yesterday in what was perceived as a
move out of cyclicals, and into defensive stocks, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reported institutional selling of carmakers and engineers as well
as steels. Turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM5.7bn as gains in banks, and two
of the three big utility stocks gave the market some stability in aggregate.
After a 3.24 fall to 693.61 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed
4.49 lower at 1,752.63. Dealers said that cyclicals had had a good run:
Volkswagen dropped DM7 to DM376.50 and Degussa, its chemicals and metals
refining activities regarded as a cyclical play, by DM12.50 to DM345.
Thyssen led steels down with a fall of DM7.70 to DM229.70. Mr Glen Liddy of
Kleinwort Benson, who put out a sell recommendation on the stock last week,
said that Thyssen had outperformed a relatively strong market by almost 5
per cent since the beginning of 1992, pushing the immediately prospective
p/e up to 17 compared with a five-year average of 10.3. He worried, too,
that overcapacity in western Europe will be exacerbated by the ability of
former eastern bloc countries to bring product into the west at less than
economic prices.
Among defensive stocks banks and utilities mostly showed gentle increases,
although among the latter Viag fell another DM2.70 to DM390, its basic
attractions obscured by a turndown at its Schmalbach-Lubeca packaging
subsidiary, whose shares fell another DM10 to DM464.
In retailing, Asko, a byword for high balance sheet gearing, was suspended
at Monday's DM745 as it brought its annual news conference forward to
tomorrow. A spokesman said that the supervisory board would decide today on
the need for additional risk provisions.
MILAN fell further in gloomy trading as dealers despaired of the total lack
of interest from domestic investors. Foreigners, worried by currency
devaluation fears, continued to sell. The Comit index fell 6.4 or 1.4 per
cent to 454.16 in turnover estimated at between L80bn-L100bn after L71.2bn
on Monday.
Dealers feared that if the current malaise continued, the index could fall
as low as 420, last seen in early February 1988. June mutual fund data, due
out in the next few days, are expected to be poor, they added.
Among leading blue chips, Generali lost L500 to L27,700 while Fiat dropped
L156 to L5,288. Olivetti remained weak, losing L53 to L3,136. Italgas, which
had been weak recently as investors switched into Snam, fell L127 to L2,783
on fears that Monday's assassination of Algeria's head of state could lead
to a disruption of supplies of natural gas.
PARIS, quiet for most of the day, was buffetted in the final hour by the
expiry of options and futures. The CAC 40 index, which went as high as
1,915.59 and as low as 1,883.12, closed 6.67 lower at 1,900.63. Volume,
which had reached only FFr1bn by 3 pm, jumped to FFr4bn by the close on
option and futures-related activity.
Alcatel Alsthom was one of the most active stocks, losing FFr4 to FFr649
while Elf added FFr4.90 to FFr377.30. Among smaller stocks, L'Oreal fell
FFr17 to FFr910 while Valeo, which has seen several put-throughs of stock
recently, lost FFr6 to FFr780.
MADRID's general index closed a mere 0.81 lower at 238.31, but that was
enough to take it to a new 1992 low. Meanwhile there were serious losses in
the construction sector where Cubiertas dropped Pta520, or 6.3 per cent to
Pta7,780 and Valderrivas by Pta760, or 9.1 per cent to Pta7,520.
Spain's budget deficit was now looking extremely serious, said Mr Miguel
Olabarri at Schroder Securities, and that made for a very poor outlook for
the construction industry, with the government as its biggest customer.
ZURICH was led higher by chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers rising SFr40 to
SFr3,320 as the SMI index rose 8.2 to 1,854.8 but the market also had to
absorb Swissair's news of an 'unsatisfactory' start to 1992. The airline's
shares fell another SFr28 to a new 1992 low of SFr635.
AMSTERDAM ended barely changed, though a steady dollar helped most
internationals to close with small gains. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.1 to
123.6.
KLM lost 70 cents to Fl 35.70 after the airline said it had made an
unspecified first quarter profit, but that earnings were lower than hoped.
The steel and aluminium maker, Hoogovens, fell another Fl 1.00 to Fl 49.30
following last Friday's news that it planned to reduce its 1992 investment
programme.
ISTANBUL's index rose for the seventh consecutive day, piercing the 4,400
level for its best close in nearly five months. The index added 42.19 to
4,407.23, after an intraday high of 4,478.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Political victory brings Greek equities
to life - Kerin Hope on the latest developments in Athens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took a political victory to bring life into the Athens stock market this
week, after Greek investors had ignored normally encouraging signals such as
a fall in inflation and impressive 1991 earnings from listed companies.
The Athens general index surged 7.9 per cent on Monday to 876 in response to
unexpected European Community backing for Greece on the sensitive issue of
recognition for Macedonia. At the Lisbon summit, Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis finally persuaded other Community leaders that the former
Yugoslav republic should change its name, in order to avoid implying a
territorial claim on part of northern Greece.
The Macedonian dispute, together with the spectre of a wider Balkan
conflict, had been blamed for a steady decline in share prices this spring.
On May 29, the index reached an 18-month low at 776, before recovering to
hover around the 800 mark. Turnover also shrank, averaging only about Dr1bn
(Dollars 5.26m) daily.
Mr Alexander Moraitakis, managing director of Nuntius Securities, says: 'The
market was reacting to every political twist and turn, not to economic
developments. As a result, we now have some of the lowest price/earnings
ratios to be found anywhere.'
Improved productivity, assisted by wage restraints, has spurred a healthy
increase in profits for many listed companies, particularly in the banking,
construction and food and beverages sectors. While continuing recession is
expected to keep domestic demand low, a much increased flow of tourists is
boosting the outlook for food-processing and service-sector companies.
Although only the most optimistic forecaster is willing to predict that the
Greek economy may be on the road to recovery, inflation has at last started
to drop. It is expected to stabilise at around 15 per cent over the summer,
the lowest for more than two years.
Yet with tax-free government paper still being offered at interest rates of
up to 21 per cent, brokers are uncertain about the market's prospects for a
sustained improvement. A rally early this year, which brought the index to a
1992 high of 1,009 in February, quickly fizzled out as individual investors
pulled out.
Ms Mariella Porfyratos, an analyst with Midland-Pantelakis Securities, says:
'What the market needs is steady growth over the next few months, which will
attract institutional investors from abroad, not another short, sharp
rally.' Yesterday the index fell 1.9 per cent to 842.8.
However, Stock Exchange officials are hopeful that a catalyst for
improvement is at hand, in the form of screen-based trading, due to be
introduced over the next few weeks.
Banks of computers now fill half of the trading space inside the Stock
Exchange building. They will operate at first alongside the floor, so that
brokers can make a gradual switch from old-fashioned open outcry to the new
system.
The Dollars 3.8m system is being set up by Femcon Associates, a US company,
which computerised the San Francisco stock exchange and the New York
commodities exchange. It is being paid for mainly through EC funding.
The initial stage will be computerised trading of bank shares, which account
for about 50 per cent of total market capitalisation. By the end of the
year, the remaining 150 listings will be included in the system and brokers
should start moving away from the floor to trade from their offices.
According to Mr Nikitas Niarchos, the bourse president, daily volume is
likely to quadruple once automated trading is fully under way. 'I do not
anticipate that it will take more than a few weeks for the brokers to get
accustomed to the new system and start trading at much higher volumes. But
it will be a while before we start introducing new products,' he says.
For investors, a large part of the new system's attraction will be the
increase in transparency. Confusion and delays over execution of orders has
contributed to individual investors' reluctance to return to the market
after its volatile performance over the past two years, according to
exchange officials.
Mr Costas Galanis, technical adviser to the bourse, says, however, that if
the new system is to operate efficiently, computerisation must be extended
to include settlement and depositary arrangements. 'The next priority for
automation is the settlement system. Then we can start thinking about
introducing options and futures,' he adds.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Nikkei fails to regain 16,000 as books
close

Tokyo
BRISK buying by investment trusts lifted share prices yesterday, but the
Nikkei average failed to regain the psychologically important 16,000 level
in the face of continued arbitrage-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 210.46 up at 15,951.73. After opening at the day's low of
15,785.13, the 225-issue index rose to the session's high of 16,060.92 in
the early afternoon on small-lot bargain hunting and index-linked buying.
However, arbitrage unwinding pushed it lower towards the end of the day's
trading.
Volume rose from 155m shares to 210m. Advances led declines by 521 to 391,
with 168 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 11.09 at 1,236.20. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.44 to
977.51.
There was some disappointment that the Nikkei failed to remain above the
16,000 mark on the last day of June, the book closing day for some
investment trust funds at trust banks. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew said buying to manipulate share prices was especially active towards
the end of the session. Other buyers included investment trust funds which
had been set up last week.
In spite of the rise in the index, construction and property-related issues
were weak. Worries over the financial soundness of construction companies
were triggered by a report from a leading foreign brokerage, focusing on
loan guarantees of construction companies, which circulated in the market.
'The rise in outstanding loan guarantees means an increase in potential bad
debt,' said a real estate analyst at a US brokerage. Sato Kogyo, whose
outstanding loan guarantees have risen by 65.8 per cent from the previous
year to Y120.9bn, fell Y81 to Y710. Penta-Ocean Construction lost Y44 to
Y795.
High-technology blue chips, which were previously sold off, firmed on
bargain hunting. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, improved Y6 to
Y647 and NEC Y21 to Y824.
Banks, which have been heavy losers, gained ground, with Industrial Bank of
Japan putting on Y80 to Y1,530 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y1,290.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y10,000 to Y591,000. The
government's decision to allow foreign ownership of the shares from August 1
encouraged buying.
Isetan, the leading department store, fell Y230 to Y1,600 on rumours of
financial problems at its leading shareholder, well known for its share and
land speculation activities.
In Osaka, the OSE average recovered 93.60 to 18,689.02 in volume of 13.5m
shares.
Roundup
YESTERDAY'S trend in the region was neutral to better, and trade was mostly
quiet. Manila was closed for a public holiday marking the inauguration of Mr
Fidel Ramos as president of the Philippines.
HONG KONG advanced, as a wave of afternoon buying overcame midsession
declines. The Hang Seng index rose 46.02 to 6,103.92 as turnover slipped
from HKDollars 3.76bn to HKDollars 3.46bn, its lowest for a week.
Analysts argued over reasons for yesterday's volatility, some blaming
longstanding talk of a Hutchison Whampoa rights issue, and others linking it
to the settlement of old futures positions, followed by the setting up of
new ones.
Banks turned in the day's best gains, followed by property counters.
Utilities and the commerce and industrial sector lagged well behind.
TAIWAN reversed a run of six consecutive declines, the weighted index
rallying 56.31 to 4,523.81 ahead of today's bank holiday, in turnover of
TDollars 18.4bn, down from TDollars 21.1bn.
A technical rebound in financials, after sharp falls last week, led other
sectors higher; China Development saw heavy trading and appreciated TDollars
7 to TDollars 109. Brokers also said that the market was boosted in late
trading when some legislators again proposed changing the stock transaction
tax in parliament yesterday.
AUSTRALIA ended its financial year quietly firm, with the All Ordinaries
index just 2.4 higher at 1,644.7 in moderate turnover of ADollars 245m.
Domestic issues saw little interest as dealers squared their books, but News
Corp jumped 78 cents to ADollars 21.08 on strong US buying and the gold
index climbed 14.9 to 1,145.8.
ANZ McCaughan Securities saw hope for domestic demand, saying that the
introduction of compulsory pension savings in Australia from today will
boost share market activity.
NEW ZEALAND was subdued awaiting tomorrow's budget, the NZSE-40 index
finishing just 0.66 up at 1,520.65.
DHAKA's all-share index rose 7.39 to 386.98 in anticipation of the
government's decision to waive capital gains tax on shares, which takes
effect from today.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African troubles lift
platinum price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM'S PRICE rose strongly in London yesterday following an overnight
rally in New York. That was sparked by worries about the present political
instability in South Africa, which supplies more than 65 per cent of the
western world's requirements.
The metal's price closed in London yesterday at Dollars 381.25 a troy ounce,
up Dollars 14 from Monday's close, a gain of nearly 4 per cent in one day
and its highest level for nearly a year.
There had been a change of market sentiment, possibly helped by the buoyancy
of base metal prices in the past few days, said Mr Tim Pearce, principal
trader at Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
The market was now less worried about the lack of growth in Japan's economy
and more concerned about the possibility of strikes hitting South African
mines. Platinum is mainly used in catalysts, particularly those used to
clean up noxious emissions from cars, and the Japanese motor industry is
experiencing a difficult year.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of the Banque
Bruxelles Lambert group, suggested, that South African supplies were not
threatened because any miners' strike there would damage further gold mines
already teetering on the brink of disaster.
However, the platinum market was tight, stocks were 'minimal' and consumers
were living hand-to-mouth. So, despite the speed of yesterday's rise, prices
between Dollars 370 and Dollars 380 an ounce were sustainable, said Ms
O'Connell.
In its recent platinum review, Johnson Matthey pointed out that Russia's
platinum export sales spiralled out of control last year to reach a record
1.1m ounces. This helped to drive down the price from an average of Dollars
472 in 1990 to Dollars 376. Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of the review,
suggested the Russians recognised that damage had been done and he forecast
export sales this year would fall back to between 600,000 and 700,000
ounces. JM forecast that platinum supply and demand should be in balance in
1992 and this should enable the price to climb back to Dollars 400 an ounce
by the year-end.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freight futures spiral
downwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S FREIGHT futures market enters July, a month of seasonally low
prices, with prices on a seemingly unstoppable downward spiral.
The Baltic Freight Index, the barometer of dry cargo shipping rates on which
the market is based, yesterday fell for the 27th consecutive day, shedding
13 points to 1,091 and taking the total decline over the period to 197
points.
'This market is very consistent in being negative,' said Mr Philippe van den
Abele of Clarkson Wolff. 'The shipping market has been hit by a lack of
Japanese demand for raw materials since the beginning of the year.'
Demand for freight had fallen not only in the grain sector, but also in iron
ore and coal.
Ms Cathy Severn, freight trader with GNI, the London futures broker, said
that last year had seen very buoyant prices following the upsurge of
activity in grain to the former Soviet Union. With the market running high,
older ships had not been scrapped, making this year's downturn worse.
The June contract went off the board yesterday at 1,108, compared with 1,705
in June last year.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Campaigning whaler trapped on
the Clyde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NORWEGIAN whaling boat was trapped on the Clyde in Glasgow last night
after activists from the environmental group Greenpeace blocked its exit
down the river.
The 65-foot Elin Toril was prevented from starting its return voyage to the
Lofoten Islands because seven Greenpeace protestors manacled themselves to
the Bell's Bridge, a swing bridge, preventing it from opening to let the
boat through.
Four others had chained themselves to the Elin Toril's whaling harpoon, the
roof of its wheel house and its crow's nest. The whaling boat sailed to
Glasgow on Monday with a party of people from whaling communities in the
Lofoten Islands off northern Norway to underline their support for a
resumption of whaling.
That day the Norwegian government announced to the International Whaling
Commission, which is holding its annual meeting in the city, that it will
resume commercial whaling next year, defying the moratorium which the IWC
agreed in 1985, and irrespective of any decisions the 37-nation body takes
this week.
Yesterday Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture secretary, urged Norway to
reconsider its decision. Attending a conference in Luxembourg, he attacked
the 'double standards' of countries which failed to live up to international
commitments.
On Monday night the Elin Toril had been the scene of joyous celebrations,
matching those reported from fishing communities along the coast of Norway,
at the decision of the Norweagin government.
'Whaling's part of our way of life,' said Mr Stig Odinsen, skipper of the
boat which, perhaps rashly, he had moored within a harpoon's shot of the
much larger Greenpeace research ship Polo.
There are about 25 whaling boats based around Mortsund in the Lofoten
Islands, with the rest of Norway's 50-odd whaling boats based on the
mainland.
Until 1987 when Norway finally adhered to the moratorium after the US
threatened to ban the import of Norwegian fish, some 60 per cent of Mr
Odinsen's income came from hunting whales, with the remainder coming from
netting cod and other whitefish in the summer and herring in the winter.
Since then he has had to confine himself to normal fishing.
There is a simple reason for the attractions of hunting whales: they are
considerably more valuable than whitefish. Speaking mainly through an
interpreter Mr Odinsen says: 'One kg of whale meat is worth Pounds 3 whereas
one kg of cod is worth Pounds 1. One big whale is worth about Pounds
10,000'.
In the last season before Norway joined the ban on whaling Mr Odinsen caught
20 whales. He reckons he could kill between 50 and 60 minke whales a season
if the Norwegian government granted him a sufficiently large quota.
The minke whale is one of the smallest of the whale family, dwarfed by
leviathans such as the blue whale which has become an endangered species.
'All kinds of hunting are cruel, but whaling is no more cruel than elk
hunting or your own fox-hunting,' says Mr Odinsen. 'With our new harpoons
loaded with a grenade which explodes on impact the whale dies
instantaneously.'

BASE METAL prices settled back from earlier highs in the afternoon on the
LME as the market started to pause for breath after its recent run-up.
Dealers said the extent of the advances since the middle of last week, which
were not based on any solid fundamental factors, made many players nervous.
After further early gains, most prices settled back under profit taking.
Three-month COPPER slipped to the day's lows, matching Comex, and might test
Dollars 2,400 a tonne on the downside. ZINC was under pressure from profit
taking. TIN breached the Dollars 7,000 a tonne level. NICKEL and ALUMINIUM
both touched two-month highs. London's COCOA market also appeared to be
entering a period of consolidation after the recent advance, but dealers
said it could be set to resume its upward trend fairly shortly as there had
been little sign yet of any significant selling by producers into the rally.
Robusta COFFEE extended early losses to finish up to Dollars 21 lower,
depressed by weaker levels in New York amid talk of possible origin selling.
Dealers said they did not expect any major move in coffee prices ahead of
the next meeting of the ICO at the end of the month.

10% below target
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZAIRE'S COBALT production in 1992 will fall by nearly 10 per cent from a
target of over 9,000 tonnes, because of adverse climatic conditions, the
managing director of Gecamines, the state-owned mining company said
yesterday, reports Reuter from Tokyo.
Mr Atundu Liongo, who was in Japan, a major cobalt consumer, for discussions
with trading houses. said he was confident that Zaire and Zambia could
sustain a producer price of Dollars 25 a lb for cobalt for the rest of this
year. But many traders doubted this, saying that demand in the
industrialised countries was weakening.
The free-market price of cobalt was quoted at Dollars 23.50-Dollars 25 a lb
in Europe on Monday, unchanged from Friday.
Zaire and Zambia account for 70 per cent of world production of cobalt, a
strategic mineral used in alloys for making aircraft engines and turbines as
well as audio tapes. Mr Liongo declined to give a specific output target for
1992 and did not give 1991 output.
Zaire and Zambia agreed in early June to maintain for the rest of 1992 a
producer price of cobalt at Dollars 25 a lb. The two countries raised it to
this level from Dollars 11 in 1991. 'Before fixing the producer price at
Dollars 25, we consulted with our agents and Zambia,' said Mr Liongo.
On 1993 producer prices he said: 'It is premature now to talk about what we
will do next year. Let's see what impact it (producer price at Dollars 25)
will have on the market.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Austrian issue finds overwhelming
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OKB, the Austrian state-backed financial institution, yesterday proved that
international demand for Eurosterling bonds remains strong, launching a
Pounds 125m issue to overwhelming demand.
Many analysts expected overseas buying of sterling bonds to diminish
following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty on European monetary
union. As a relatively high-yielding market, sterling was seen as having
most to gain from economic convergence in the run-up to monetary union.
However, both UK and continental European fund managers snapped up the
available paper against the background of a rising gilts market.
Participants in the deal reported no signs of hesitancy. The top triple-A
credit rating of the borrower and the backing of the Austrian government
were additional attractions.
The deal, lead-managed by Warburg Securities, was initially regarded as very
tightly priced by syndicate officials at other firms. The yield spread over
government paper is among the lowest on a new Eurosterling issue.
The 10-year 9 1/4 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed
price of 98.20, for a yield of just 12 basis points more than gilts.
Only bonds issued by borrowers such as the European Investment Bank - which
are exempt from withholding tax in Italy and invariably attract strong
buying from this quarter - have been launched at lower yield spreads.
By the close of trading, OKB bonds were quoted at 98.65 bid, for a yield
spread of 9 basis points.
Although demand for sterling paper remained firm, syndicate officials were
not predicting a rush of Eurosterling issues. One barrier is the lack of
interest rate and currency swap opportunities for potential issuers.
OKB swapped the proceeds of yesterday's issue into floating rate D-Marks via
a complex package which involved a dollar swap component. Few borrowers are
willing to engage in such complex arbitrage.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Abbey National raises MTN
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL Treasury Services, the funding arm of the UK bank, has
doubled the size of its global medium-term note (MTN) programme to Dollars
10bn, making it one of the largest borrowing programmes outstanding.
Additional borrowing will be used to fund Abbey National's growing portfolio
of securities and non-mortgage assets, including leasing and backing for
structured finance transactions.
An MTN programme provides a legal framework under which a borrower can
quickly issue bonds where pockets of investor demand are identified. The
Abbey National programme allows it to issue bonds between one year and
30-year maturities, in a range of currencies, and in both the Euromarket and
US domestic market.
The programme was increased from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 5bn last year. Mr
Jonathan Nicholls, director of capital markets, said the latest increase
should cover Abbey National's funding requirements to the end of 1993.
Two new dealers, Yamaichi International and Credit Suisse First Boston, have
been added to the 10 already committed to the programme.
Abbey National's core mortgage lending business is growing only slowly,
reflecting the depressed state of the UK property market. Mortgage lending
is funded mainly from retail deposits.
However, Abbey National has surplus balance sheet capacity. Capital market
borrowings are used to fund holdings of non-mortgage assets, including a
portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds and leasing assets. The bank currently
holds Pounds 10bn to Pounds 12bn of such 'investment' assets.
Last year, Abbey National Treasury Services showed a Pounds 62m profit by
exploiting the difference between its cost of funds - usually at levels
below the London inter-bank offered rate - and return on assets.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Housing lenders still strong,
says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the housing market recession, the UK's traditional providers of
housing finance, the large building societies and Abbey National, are far
stronger than generally realised, a report published today says.
The report's author, Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, says he believes that even very small building societies
perform just as well as the large ones.
'Short of a complete meltdown in the housing market after some disaster like
a 20 per cent fall in house prices, we are not expecting any more top
building societies to get into a position where they have to be rescued,' Mr
Wriglesworth says.
Mr Wriglesworth expects total bad debt provisions by societies to jump to
Pounds 1.17bn this year, or around Pounds 1.3bn if Abbey National is
included.
Although building societies have never before had such a high proportion of
bad debts on their books, they have only a quarter of the bad debts of the
banks. Bad debts make up around 0.7 per cent of the loans of the 20 top
societies while they are 2.78 per cent of lending by the Big Four banks.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: BMW goes to America to find the
smarter buyer - Andrew Fisher on the background to the German manufacturer's
plan to build cars in South Carolina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US-built BMWs start rolling off the South Carolina production line in a
few years, it will not only be Americans kicking the tyres, feeling the
paint and testing the quality. Since some of the cars will be exported,
choosy German buyers will also give the models their close scrutiny.
Quality, for drivers on both sides of the Atlantic and elsewhere, will be a
crucial test for the new plant. So will profitability. In the mid-1990s, it
should be apparent whether BMW's investment of Dollars 400m in the tough US
market, where European imports have lost much of their cachet, has proved a
costly risk or a valuable opportunity.
Some experts think the German company, which announced its US plant last
week, had no choice but to go ahead. Mr John Hammond, managing partner of J.
D. Power, the US car market research firm, says: 'It's not a risk. I think
it's absolutely mandatory. The risk is if they don't do it. The risk is
trying to stay a worldwide player within the confines of national
boundaries.'
For the harsh truth is that conditions in the US car market, the world's
biggest with 8.2m cars sold last year - down from 10.5m in 1988 - have
changed dramatically since the heyday of the mid-1980s when German car
companies had a 4.5 per cent share. Today, they have only 2.7 per cent,
although they are better represented at the upper end of the market.
There are four main reasons for the plight of German car manufacturers in
the US:
The decline in the dollar from a peak of DM3.47 in February 1985 to under
DM1.60. This has hit US consumers' ability to buy European cars and put
their makers under extreme pricing pressures;
The rise of competition from the Japanese, with efficient 'transplant'
production facilities in the US and snazzy models (built in Japan) which hit
at the luxury and sports segments of the market where the German companies
had their strongest penetration;
The severe impact of the US recession and the subsequent concentration on
value for money rather than the prestige of high-priced European imports;
Germany's costs. Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW's chief executive, says
production costs in the US are one-third lower. Also, the approval process
for new sites is quicker than in bureaucratic Germany. The start next year
of the 36-hour week will exacerbate the industry's problems. Last year,
hourly labour costs - including generous social welfare benefits - were DM44
(Dollars 27.80) for German vehicle makers against DM35 in the US and DM34 in
Japan.
Mr John Lawson, research director at DRI Automotive Group, the London-based
consultancy, says: 'Life's got tougher. It's really hard at these continuing
cost levels for German companies to make money at present exchange rates.
The pricing umbrella they had is gone as the Japanese have come in and
priced well underneath.'
Moreover, 'there is a new, more abstemious mood in the US'. Hence the
increased market penetration of lower-cost Japanese vehicles, aided by
aggressive pricing. For example, the up-market Lexus car, made by Toyota in
Japan, costs Dollars 44,000 in the US against DM95,000 (Dollars 60,000) in
Germany.
So although the demographic profile of the US shows a greater potential
market for more expensive cars, with the population forecast to include more
affluent people aged 45 to 55, that may not be translated into a surging
luxury or near-luxury car sector.
Mr Hammond says: 'Demographics is only half the story. People moving into
these demographic categories are not buying luxury cars to the extent they
did in the past.' More important these days is quality at a favourable price
 -'there's more emphasis on the smart buy'.
To many American consumers, that means Japanese cars, which have some 30 per
cent of the total market, or a US model now that domestic companies have
been forced by Japanese competition to improve quality and styling. Against
this sombre background, sales of German cars have recovered encouragingly.
BMW added 24 per cent in the first five months and Audi, the Volkswagen
subsidiary also looking at possible North American production, gained 19 per
cent.
VW, however, saw US sales drop 20 per cent in the first six months. This
reflected that production of its new Golf and Jetta family models was still
in the start-up phase. These are built in VW's Mexican plant, where DM1.5bn
is being spent on expansion.
Mercedes-Benz had a rise of 18 per cent. As with other up-market
manufacturers, it benefited from the comparison with the low level of last
year, affected by recession, the Gulf war, and the new luxury goods tax.
Mercedes has no plans for a US plant, though it will start small-scale
assembly in Mexico for local buyers.
Since Mercedes has a profitable truck operation in the US, it is more immune
to dollar gyrations. BMW buys Dollars 400m worth of components a year in the
US, but needs to raise this sharply to take advantage of the low US
currency.
BMW is coy about the type of car that will be built in the US, although it
will probably be initially a two-seat, soft-top roadster, based on the
3-series and priced at less than the Dollars 30,000 luxury tax threshold.
Mr von Kuenheim emphasised that the plant, with a capacity of up to 70,000
cars a year, would be capable of building all BMW models. Buyers on both
sides of the Atlantic will be keen to see how well the quality of BMWs made
in the US compares with the Bavarian originals.

THE public section of the privatisation of GIO Australia, the New South
Wales government's insurance company, has closed fully subscribed, with
applications exceeding ADollars 1bn (USDollars 0.70bn).
The NSW government yesterday claimed the float as Australia's biggest retail
capital raising, surpassing last year's offering of the federal
government-controlled Commonwealth Banking Corporation which raised about
ADollars 715m from non-institutional shareholders.
The GIO received more than 120,000 applications and plans to allocate 65 per
cent of the flotation to individual shareholders. The balance is being
offered to institutions under a tender system designed to determine a share
price between ADollars 2.10 and ADollars 2.40.
The strong public response suggests ADollars 2.40 a share is likely to be
achieved from institutional bidding. GIO shares are scheduled for listing in
early August.

The bank will be the first of its type in the predominantly Moslem state.
AIB said yesterday it expected the bank to be operating by next year and saw
it as a first step, to be followed by setting up a commercial bank in the

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EARNINGS at Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong trading, property and shipping
conglomerate, will be hit severely this year if it succeeds in its bid to
take private its associate Cavendish International, analysts in the colony
said yesterday.
The cost to Hutchison will be HKDollars 5.8bn (USDollars 750m) if a general
meeting on July 10 approves its HKDollars 5.50-a-share offer for the 35 per
cent of Cavendish it does not already own.
One of Cavendish's main assets is a 24.5 per cent stake in Husky Oil, a
Canadian oil and gas producer. Hutchison also separately owns 24.5 per cent
of Husky.
The offer document for Cavendish shows that between the end of 1991 and
March this year the value of its interest in Husky depreciated by HKDollars
1.18bn. The combined write-down for an enlarged Hutchison would be in the
order of HKDollars 2bn, analysts said.
Last year, Hutchison absorbed write-downs to the value of Husky's oil and
gas reserves of HKDollars 760m. In the year to December 1991, Hutchison
posted profits of HKDollars 3.3bn - down more than 5 per cent on the
previous year.
Analysts are concerned that Hutchison's venture into UK telecommunications
is not providing returns as quickly as hoped. Hutchison denies both points.
Mr Philip Tose, managing director of Peregrine, the Hong Kong broker, said
that although Hutchison represented long-term value, the performance of
Husky and UK telecommunications represented a short-term risk to Hutchison's
earnings growth.

343m for Florida mill

<TEXT>
KYOEI Steel, a medium-sized Osaka steelmaker affiliated to Sumitomo Metal
Industries, has agreed to pay about Dollars 343m for Florida Steel, a US
minimill, joining a long list of Japanese companies to have taken stakes in
the US steel industry.
But Kyoei, aware that most of the Japanese steelmakers have been badly
bruised by the continuing weakness of the US industry, said the completion
of the deal in October depended on agreement over the rationalisation of the
struggling US company.
Florida Steel's parent, FLS Holdings, agreed to the acquisition by Kyoei,
which makes steel bars and in 1983 established its own US subsidiary, Auburn
Steel. Kyoei believes it has accumulated enough experience in the difficult
US market through Auburn to make a success of Florida.
Kyoei, the fourth-largest Japanese electric furnace steelmaker, has been
encouraged to make the acquisition by a troubled domestic market for steel
bars. The company, and other steel bar makers in the Osaka area, agreed to
reduce production by as much as much 50 per cent in recent months to reduce
an expanding inventory that has accompanied the slowing of the Japanese
economy.
Difficulties at Florida Steel arose from a leveraged buy-out (LBO)in 1988
that was a response to a hostile takeover attempt. However, the LBO created
debt that the company has been unable to service, prompting it to seek a
friendly purchaser.
Kyoei said the 'know-how we have gathered from Auburn Steel will help us
restructure' Florida Steel, though the company will 'carefully examine
business conditions in the US' and has left open the possibility that it may
withdraw.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: PaineWebber warns of lower
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE first indication that Wall Street's phenomenal earnings growth of the
past year may be slowing, PaineWebber, the retail broking house, said
yesterday that its profit in the second quarter would be below first-quarter
levels.
Mr Donald Marron, chairman, said the company would report net income of
between Dollars 45m and Dollars 47m for April to June, down from the record
Dollars 74.3m earned in the first three months of the year.
Second-quarter earnings, however, would still be better than a year ago,
when the company made Dollars 33.8m.
Total revenues of around Dollars 580m will also be sharply lower than in the
first quarter, when revenues totalled Dollars 874.3m. Although its
performance measures unfavourably against the first quarter, the overall
state of the securities business remains strong.
Although Mr Marron gave no specific reason for the fall in quarterly
earnings, individual investor activity in US markets has slowed from the
high levels seen in late 1991 and early 1992. Recent sales of stock funds
have shrunk compared to first-quarter levels, as a stagnant equity market
and rising bond yields made stocks look less attractive.
Commission revenues, recurring fee business and broker productivity,
however, remain strong, says PaineWebber.
Asset management remains an increasingly important part of its business,
with repeat fees, mostly from managing customer assets, running at levels 20
per cent higher than a year ago. The company currently has just under
Dollars 100bn of assets in custody.
PaineWebber said it remained committed to keeping a lid on costs, but it had
increased its workforce recently, hiring about 390 new brokers and
institutional salesmen in the past year.

<TEXT>
THE Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium
producer, is cutting 2,100 jobs from its worldwide workforce.
It will take an after-tax charge of Dollars 40.6m, or 48 cents per share, on
its second-quarter results to cover severance costs.
The company has been struggling against a deteriorating aluminium market and
said it was reducing its workforce to improve competitiveness. The cuts will
include hourly-paid workers as well as salaried employees.
The low price of aluminium battered the company's results during 1991 and
the first quarter of 1992. Last year, Alcoa's net income fell 79 per cent to
Dollars 62.7m compared with Dollars 295.2m in 1990, and its first-quarter
1992 results were down 22 per cent to Dollars 76m against Dollars 97m in the
year-earlier period.
Aluminium products account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of
revenues.
Trying to soften the blow to its 65,000 strong workforce, the company said
it would help minimise the cuts through attrition, transfers and early
retirements. It will also reduce the number of jobs filled by outside
contractors.
Alcoa warned earlier this year that it was reviewing operations and that
this would result in job reductions.

rise

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management, the leading US waste services company, expects
second-quarter earnings to increase by about 23 cents a share to a total of
about 67 cents.
This result reflects gains of an initial public offering of shares by Waste
Management International and some special charges.
Excluding these gains and special charges, the company expects that
second-quarter earnings from operations will be in the range of 43 cents to
45 cents per share. These represent a 10 to 15 per cent improvement over the
39 cents a share of a year ago.
The Chicago-based company expects to record a non-taxable gain of about
Dollars 240m, before minority interest, from the offering by Waste
Management International, the company created to own virtually all waste
operations outside North America.
Waste Management International is 56 per cent owned by Waste Management, 12
per cent each by Chemical Waste and Wheelabrator Tech-nologies - both Waste
Management subsidiaries - and 20 per cent by shareholders.
The special charges include Dollars 96m, after tax, relating primarily to a
revaluation of the company's medical waste business and to charges on two
Chemical Waste incinerators.
The company will also take a one-time, after-tax charge of Dollars 71m for
adoption of two new accounting standards.
These charges will not affect second-quarter results, but will appear in the
earnings for the six-month period ending June 30, the company said. They are
excluded from the 23 cent per share gain for the second quarter.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Indocement raises a few eyebrows
 -William Keeling reports on reaction to the group's plans to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDOCEMENT, the largest quoted company in Indonesia, has been preparing to
diversify away from cement for more than a year. But the recent announcement
that it will acquire food companies and property totalling Rp1,720bn
(Dollars 848m) has raised a few eyebrows in Jakarta.
With a market capitalisation of more than Rp7,000bn, Indocement is part of
the Salim Group, a loose collection of mostly non-quoted companies in which
Mr Soedono Salim - also known as Mr Liem Sioe Liong, and reputedly
Indonesia's richest person - is a leading shareholder.
Non-quoted companies in which Mr Salim has an interest hold more than 40 per
cent of Indocement, which has a capacity of 9.4m tonnes a year and 52 per
cent of the Indonesian market. It made a net profit of Rp308.6bn last year,
a rise of 23 per cent over 1990, on sales of Rp771.3bn.
The purchases, which are all non-quoted companies from within the Salim
Group, will give Indocement a debt-to-equity ratio of 132 per cent, and a
rights issue to reduce debt is not planned.
The principal acquisition is the assets of PT Bogasari Flour Mills, a flour
milling company with an estimated 85 per cent market share in wheat flour.
The purchase cost of Rp1,179bn includes the assumption of about Rp350bn of
debt.
Mr Judiono Tosin, a senior official of the Salim Group and an executive
director of Indocement, explains there are benefits in buying the assets of
Bogasari but not the company as a legal entity.
In this way, Indocement can double-depreciate many of the assets and reduce
its medium-term tax exposure. Bogasari will be taxed on the difference
between the selling price and the book value of the assets, but the company
is not revealing what the book value is.
Also being purchased is 51 per cent of the Indofood Group for Rp777bn. Its
main product is instant noodles, made of wheat flour, in which it holds a 90
per cent market share.
The final acquisition, for Dollars 56m, is Wisma Indocement, a 23-storey
Jakarta office building. Indocement and Bogasari already occupy 45 per cent
of the building, which is fully let.
Of Indocement's 13 commissioners and directors, Mr Salim and five others
have announced an interest in the companies being purchased. Mr Tosin says
there is no question of private shareholders benefiting at the expense of
the public company. 'If Indocement purchases a non-group business, we (the
Salim Group) regard it as a migration of funds,' he explains.
The private side of the Salim Group, he says, plans to invest in industrial
estates, including Batam island off Singapore where it has a stake in the
Dollars 400m Batamindo industrial estate.
The reaction of Jakarta's brokers has been mixed. The food sector has high
potential growth and Bogasari has a cash-flow of about Rp160bn a year.
However, Bogasari and Indofood dominate their sectors and expansion will
depend on total market growth. Mr Tosin estimates instant noodle sales have
grown 26 per cent a year since 1986, although Bogasari operated at only 71
per cent capacity in 1991.
Some brokers question whether, at Dollars 2,900 per sq m, Wisma Indocement
is over-valued. A stake in a similar building recently sold for Dollars
1,900 per sq m, but Mr Tosin says the price is fair.
The brokers' main concern, however, is that the acquisitions increase
Indocement's exposure to sectors regulated by the state.
Indocement maintains a close relationship with government. In 1985, the
state took a 35 per cent stake in Indocement for Dollars 320m after the
company suffered substantial losses. Mr Sudwikatmono, president director of
Indocement, is President Suharto's brother-in-law. The government sets a
guideline retail price for cement, currently Rp5,425 per 40kg bag, and
authorises all imports and exports. Indocement estimates its gross profit
margin at 45 per cent in 1991.
The next few years, however, may see trading margins diminish. Growth in
domestic demand is expected to fall and the company may become more reliant
on exports, where the price is lower.
The wheat and flour sector is similarly state-controlled. Bogasari is
Indonesia's sole licensed miller of wheat and the sector is closed for
capital investment except for new projects which export at least 65 per cent
of production. However, Indonesia does not produce wheat and the government
is the sole importer.
The World Bank is pushing for a review of the sector. A confidential report
on Indonesia last month stated that 'significant additional benefits would
result from further deregulation of agricultural products, especially sugar
and wheat'.
The government is preparing a deregulation package prior to a meeting of
donors next month, but Indocement does not expect wheat to be included. Mr
Tosin says the company would welcome a competitive environment but the pace
of deregulation is up to government. 'We don't have any say about that,' he
insists.

wholesalers in balance

<TEXT>
A PROPOSED Dollars 1.1bn merger between two of the largest wholesale food
distributors in the US - Super Valu and Wetterau - hung in the balance
yesterday as the two companies tried to agree terms.
Under the outline merger agreement announced last month, Super Valu would
have made a cash offer of Dollars 30.20 for each Wetterau share, valuing its
common stock at Dollars 643.3m. It would also have taken on Dollars 440m of
outstanding Wetterau debt. Ahead of this transaction, Missouri-based
Wetterau would have 'demerged' its retail subsidiary, called Shop 'n' Save.
Yesterday, however, Wetterau said that Super Valu wanted to revise terms.
The new proposal was not disclosed, but Wetterau acknowledged that there
would be a reduction in the amount offered to shareholders. Wetterau shares,
which were briefly suspended, had fallen by Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 26 3/8
by lunchtime in New York.
The Wetterau board was due to meet during the afternoon to consider the
reduced offer, and a decision was expected by early evening. It said that
the new terms would only be disclosed it decided to go ahead with the deal.
Analysts, however, were not over-optimistic that the transaction would be
pursued.
Wetterau, quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market currently ranks as
the national third-largest grocery wholesaler, while Super Valu has the
number two spot. Together, the combined operations would outstrip
Oklahoma-based Fleming Companies as the nation's largest wholesale food
distributor.
Separately, Super Valu announced first-quarter profits for the three months
to June 20, totalling Dollars 45.6m after-tax. This represented a sharp
improvement on the Dollars 31.6m seen in the same period a year earlier.
However, earnings per share increased more modestly, from 60 cents to 64
cents.
Food wholesaling enjoyed a 13 per cent operating profit improvement, despite
'a sluggish selling environment and deflation in the cost of products sold'.
Retail operations showed a 75 per cent profits advance, but this was helped
partly by acquisitions.

A US bankruptcy court has approved a one-month extension - until the end of
July - of the deadline by which The New York Daily News has to file its
reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
The postponement will give more time for talks with prospective buyers of
the New York tabloid, which was bought by the late Mr Robert Maxwell in
1991.
The two main contenders for The News are Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian
publisher who also owns the Daily Telegraph in London, and Mr Mortimer
Zuckerman, the property developer who owns US News and World Report and
Atlantic Monthly magazine.
The key issues for both bidders are the reaching of an agreement with the
trade unions representing the newspaper's 2,100 full and part-time workers
and the settling of claims by the paper's creditors.
Mr Black has already offered to set aside Dollars 75m for severance
payments, working capital and his offer to pay between 25 and 50 cents on
the dollar to creditors who are owed Dollars 43m. Mr Zuckerman is believed
to be his making proposals to union leaders this week.
CBS/FOX FILM, the home-video venture of CBS and Twentieth Century-Fox with
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said they have settled a lawsuit in which CBS accused
MGM of cheating CBS/Fox out of video cassette rights to successful films,
AP-DJ reports from New York. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
A class action lawsuit has been filed by a New Jersey consumer against
Sears, Roebuck, the US retail chain, on behalf of people who paid Sears for
allegedly unnecessary and/or over-priced car repair services, AP-DJ reports.
The allegations include installation of parts that were not necessary, or
charges for repair services that were not performed.

ITALGAS, the quoted Italian gas and water distribution company which is

Sales of gas and water increased in Italy and in foreign markets, said Mr

sales jumped by 63 per cent in volume terms, thanks to contracts to supply a

The rise in operating profits stemmed from a 30 per cent fall in net
financial charges and rigorous cost controls as well as the higher sales, he
added. Last year, the group made net profits of L91bn (Dollars 76.21m) on
sales of L3,353bn.
Mr da Molo calmed fears about a possible interruption in gas supplies
following this week's political upheaval in Algeria, which supplies about a
quarter of Italy's natural gas requirements. Responding to a sharp fall in
the group's share price earlier this week, Mr da Molo expressed confidence
about the certainty of supplies from Algeria following contacts with
politicians and other parts of the ENI group.
Italgas is pushing ahead with its strategy to expand abroad, notably in
eastern Europe and Latin America. Mr da Molo revealed that it intended to
tender for a number of regional gas companies due to be privatised in
Hungary.

FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Parents foster Europe's computer
makers - Alan Cane examines the era of strategic alliances after Digital
takes up to a 10% stake in Olivetti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCRAMBLE among Europe's computer manufacturers to tie up with a larger,
better resourced partner is virtually at an end.
The deal secured last Friday, through which Digital Equipment (DEC) of the
US will take up to a 10 per cent stake in Olivetti of Italy at a cost of
almost Pounds 200m, (Dollars 370m) is almost the last throw in a poker game
which has occupied Europe's faltering computer makers for the past
half-decade.
Their struggle to secure a lifeline to the future, however, is becoming a
sideshow to the main event: the battle between US computer giants to ensure
their technology stands a fair chance of becoming the world standard.
That was the principal reason DEC was prepared to pay well over twice the
market price for a share in a loss-making Italian manufacturer with no
certain path back to profitability.
European manufacturers, penalised by small, insular markets and rising
research and development costs, have been seeking relief in strategic
alliances since the 1980s. ICL of the UK found a wealthy parent in Fujitsu
of Japan two years ago. Nokia Data of Finland was in turn purchased by ICL.
International Business Machines of the US earlier this year spent Dollars
100m to take a small stake in Groupe Bull of France.
Of Europe's large players, only Siemens of Germany is left unpartnered. It,
however, may be in no mood for courtship. It is still fully occupied
digesting the loss-making systems company Nixdorf, which it bought last
year, and is the only European company which may not need a partner either
for financial or technological reasons.
Olivetti needs both. It lost Dollars 387m last year and revenues are
falling. It has shed 25 per cent of its workforce in the past two years, but
further cuts may be necessary if it is to reach its goal of a return to
profitability this year.
Although it has developed some excellent products, including the Quaderno
small notebook computer, it relies heavily on the US and Japan for basic
technology.
In particular, it needs a reliable source of Risc (reduced instruction set
computing) microprocessor chips. Risc chips are fast and powerful. They are
the microprocessor of choice for scientific workstations; within a few
years, they are expected to power most personal computers and medium-sized
computer systems.
This is the largest and fastest-growing sector of the computing market. It
is also an 'open' market where systems are expected to conform to
industry-wide standards.
This is the heart of the matter. Competing Risc suppliers, which include
IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, DEC and Mips, all of the US, are
fighting to establish their Risc technology as the industry standard. That
means, inevitably, forming alliances with competitors who will design the
Risc chips into their systems, so driving up volume.
Sun Microsystems, for example, has licensed its Sparc Risc technology to a
wide range of companies including ICL.
IBM's deal with Bull and DEC's deal with Olivetti, however, indicates that
Risc suppliers are now prepared to trade off equity funding against Risc
'design-in'.
Olivetti currently builds machines based on Risc technology from Mips. Mips,
however, has a question mark over its future. It has just been acquired by
Silicon Graphics and one of its principal supporters, Groupe Bull, has
defected to IBM following the deal between the two companies earlier this
year.
As a result of last week's deal, Olivetti will now use DEC's Risc chip, the
Alpha microprocessor in future products. The Alpha chip is the most advanced
of its kind. When it launched the chip earlier this year, DEC claimed it had
the performance of a small supercomputer. It also claimed that, by 2000, 80
per cent of businesses in Europe would be using Alpha technology in some
shape or form. The Olivetti deal is a clear prerequisite for that prediction
to be fulfilled.
DEC has currently no share of the European Risc market, which is dominated
by Sun with almost a 60 per cent share followed by Mips (19 per cent), IBM
(10 per cent) and Hewlett-Packard (8 per cent).
Olivetti talked to both Hewlett-Packard and IBM before agreeing the deal
with DEC with whom it has had an alliance (one of the 229 Olivetti claims in
advertisements) stretching back over 20 years. Olivetti already provides DEC
with about 100,000 personal computers a year for sale in Europe.
For Olivetti, the advantages of the deal are threefold. It gains an
injection of equity capital at a time when its resources are heavily
stretched. It has access to an advanced Risc technology around which to
design workstations and personal computers.
And it has a US partner to share the burden of future product development
(an earlier alliance with AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, fell apart
in 1989).
Olivetti's recent advertising emphasising the number of its alliances has
been widely seen as an attempt to reassure customers anxious about the
company's lack of a larger partner.
For DEC there are both advantages and disadvantages. It has a partner to
help disseminate its Alpha Risc technology. Through its equity partnership
it has a better foothold in Europe and access to Olivetti's distribution
channels. And it opens the door to further co-operation between the two
companies in commercial and technical areas.
DEC today, however, is a giant with feet of clay. The world's third-largest
IT supplier with sales of about Dollars 13bn, it lost more than Dollars 500m
last year and has not made a profit in the any of the first three quarters
of 1992.
In Europe, it is still assimilating last year's purchase of Kienzle from
Mannesmann and the minicomputer operations of Philips of the Netherlands.
It failed to exploit three of the major elements of the modern computer
industry; personal computer, high performance workstations and open systems.
It desperately needs to make a success of its Alpha technology if it is not
to become one of the industry's also-rans.
So both DEC and Olivetti have powerful reasons to make a success of the
joint venture. Questions which remain unanswered, however, include the fate
of Mips, now a falling star among Risc suppliers, and the position of
Siemens. It may have no need of a partner, but it is the last big European
target for America's jostling Risc vendors.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wheway runs up Pounds 715,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEWAY, the environmental engineering group, fell from profits of Pounds
1.37m pre-tax to losses of Pounds 715,000 in the 26 weeks to March 28.
Mr John McGowan, chairman, said good performances in Scandinavia, France and
the US were not enough to offset the the recession-induced downturns in the
UK and Australia.
Atlas Wright, the computer room air conditioning systems company which
accounts for 60 per cent of the group's total volume, saw a deferring of
orders from the first to the second quarters.
That resulted in group losses of Pounds 1.75m in the first quarter.
Despite this collapse in other companies' capital expenditure, Mr McGowan
said that Wheway's recovery was 'not solely dependent on general economic
recovery', adding that the Pounds 10.3m investment made two years ago in air
filtration technology was now beginning to see some return.
Turnover declined 11 per cent to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating
profits 81 per cent to Pounds 483,000 (Pounds 2.48m).
The group was tipped into losses by interest payable - albeit lower at
Pounds 773,000 (Pounds 1.11m) after last July's Pounds 16.5m rights issue -
and exceptional charges of Pounds 425,000, relating to reorganisation and
redundancy costs.
Debt at period-end stood at Pounds 12.7m; before the rights issue it was
Pounds 28.6m.
Mr McGowan said the group was becoming 'more and more focused'. He described
the intra-group trading as 'huge', with the environmental engineering and
clean air divisions operating in much the same markets.
Losses per share emerged at 0.51p (earnings 1.1p) but the interim dividend
is held at 1p.

<TEXT>
BOC Group, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, has ended its
costly involvement in the US home healthcare market by agreeing to sell its
Glasrock business.
BOC will sell Glasrock to Homedco Group, a California-based company, for
Dollars 72m (Pounds 39m), slightly above its net asset value after dediction
of liabilities. However, the UK group took an exceptional provision of
Pounds 19.6m for the year to September 30, to cover a reorganisation of
Glasrock.
BOC bought the business in 1983, hoping to benefit from the increasing
numbers of patients being treated at home. However, the business came under
pressure from cuts in US federal funding for healthcare and offered few
economies of scale.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove Industries cut to Pounds 7.1m as
recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group,
announced a fall in profits as the recession and falling margins affected
its main automotive and aerospace divisions.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 8.85m to Pounds 7.09m in the year to March
31.
However, the results were hailed by Mr Bijan Sedghi, chairman, as proof of
Bromsgrove's resilience compared to its competitors. Mr Steven Mills, chief
executive, said: 'We do believe there are plenty of opportunities to go
forward.'
Turnover increased 8.8 per cent to Pounds 90.1m, helped by a first-time
contribution from environmental businesses acquired last year.
Aerospace was affected by postponed civil aircraft orders and defence cuts,
but offshore companies performed well, and plastics had a better second
half.
Interest costs increased slightly to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 2.58m) and the
proceeds of a Pounds 10m rights issue were not received until close to the
year-end. Following the rights, gearing fell from 94 per cent to 50 per cent
on net borrowings of Pounds 19.6m.
Earnings per share, fully diluted for the rights issue, fell to 11p (14.8p).
A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p (3.9p).
Extraordinary losses totalled Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 2.93m) and included
business closures in the industrial division and Pounds 224,000 of costs on
the aborted acquisitions of two companies.

LOWNDES LAMBERT, the ins-urance broker which was floated last year,
yesterday announced a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 12
months to March 31.
Buoyed by a strong growth in new business, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds
9.3m (Pounds 7.4m), pushing earnings per share up 21 per cent to 25.8p.
Lowndes recommended a final dividend of 8.4p, making a total of 12.6p.
The shares closed 3p up at 273p.
Income from brokerage - including group share of associated undertakings -
rose to Pounds 61m (Pounds 53.4m), offsetting a decline in investment income
to Pounds 5.88m (Pounds 6.63m).
Operating profit rose to Pounds 7.47m (Pounds 5.75m), while income from
interests in associated undertakings improved to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.61m).
Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, pointed to strong growth in new business. In the
UK, for example, income grew by 11 per cent in spite of the recession and
soft insurance markets.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Interest earnings help boost Fyffes to
IPounds 12.4m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FYFFES, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, reported a 33 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.5m) for the six
months to April 30.
Turnover was ahead 6.5 per cent at IPounds 289m.
Mr Carl McCann, finance director, said, however, that interest earned on its
cash holdings of some IPounds 105m had been the principal factor in the
profits growth. Oversupply of bananas in the European market had held back
growth in trading profits.
Last year's first half results had been adversely affected by the battle
with Chiquita in the US over the sourcing of European-destined bananas from
Honduras. As part of the peace agreement, Fyffes temporarily limited its
purchases in the Honduran market.
Mr McCann said the company's new Central American operation 'is now much
more cost-efficient', but added that it had been adversely affected by low
prices in the European market.
'If we had had last year's prices and this year's cost structure, we would
be looking at much better figures', he said.
The decision last month by the PPI Del Monte administrators to sell the
company off rather than float it had revived expectations of a Fyffes' bid.
Mr McCann declined to comment on whether a fresh approach had been made to
the PPI administrators. But a market analyst said: 'Fyffes' position has
always been that if the price is right, they are interested'.
PPI bought the Del Monte fresh fruit operation for Dollars 875m (Pounds
473m) in 1989 and it is thought that any bids for the company now, following
the decision to abandon a flotation, will be at a substantial discount.
This would still be more than the IPounds 100m on hand to Fyffes and as the
company remains averse to debt-levered acquisitions it is likely that it now
has a partner with which to make a bid.
Earnings per share came out at 2.23p (2.22p), and the interim dividend is
increased to 0.3549p (0.3226p).
The company said that for the full year 'we expect net profit before tax to
show an increase on 1991 although earnings per share are unlikely to be
ahead of last year'.

CHRYSALIS, the music publishing, communications and media company, is
planning to launch the UK's first game show channel on satellite television.
The company has acquired the television rights to 14,000 American game shows
and plans to run them non-stop for 18 hours a day.
Chrysalis, in partnership with Mr Howard Huntridge, the television game show
specialist, is trying to raise Pounds 15m for the venture.
So far there has been little investment interest in the project from the UK
and talks are about to begin with potential US backers.
The aim would be to launch the channel on cable television in the autumn and
move to the new Astra satellite a year from now. Negotiations are at an
advanced stage with SES, the Luxembourg company that runs the Astra
satellite system, for an option.
Apart from advertising and sponsorship income further revenue is envisaged
from viewers taking part in games by telephone and a television shopping
segment.

<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the fast-growing UK pharmaceuticals group, is in negotiations with
unions to make up to 220 of the 430 staff at Evans-Kerfoot, its generic
drugs subsidiary, redundant.
The company plans to scale back production of generic pharmaceuticals at its
Ashton plant, concentrating on niche medicines as well as supplying capsules
and tablets for Medeva's patented products, according to Mr David Lees,
finance director.
Evans-Kerfoot would incur a loss of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m in 1992,
he said.
Last March, Mr Bernard Taylor, executive chairman, said that its unbranded
generic businesses were for sale.
Since the beginning of the year, the subsidiary has lost its managing
director, finance director, production director and personnel director.
Mr Lees said the losses were not large in proportion to the rest of the
group, and the company was still on target to meet analyst's expectations of
about Pounds 35m profits this year.
It made Pounds 16.7m before tax last year.

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Colorgraphic, the advertising and direct mail literature group,
were suspended at 25p yesterday pending clarification of its financial
position, writes Andrew Bolger.
Colorgraphic, which has been hit hard by the advertising recession, also
announced that Mr Nick Winks had been relieved of his duties as chief
executive and deputy chairman. Mr Alan MacLeod has resigned from the board.
An adviser said the suspension and board changes followed the breaching of a
banking covenant by the group, which had found its trading conditions
continuing to deteriorate.
A further statement would be made as soon as talks with its bankers had
ended.
Mr Ron Welch, founder and executive chairman of Colorgraphic, has resumed
the role of chief executive.
At yesterday's suspension price, Colorgraphic has a market value of Pounds
4.24m, compared with a peak of Pounds 33.2m in 1989.
In March, the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.33m in the year to
December 31, against a profit of Pounds 2.01m.

UNICHEM, the pharmaceutical wholesaler and retailer, is to pay Pounds 14.5m
for Scott, the Scottish chemist chain.
The acquisition will give UniChem a total of 194 pharmacies and underlines
the company's commitment to building a second core business in retail
pharmacy.
Scott made pre-tax profits of Pounds 458,000 on turnover of Pounds 16.5m in
the year to end-April 1992. It owns 31 chemists in the Glasgow area and has
interests in two health centres.
The purchase is being satisfied via Pounds 11.6m cash and Pounds 2.9m in
10-year loan stock.
Four of the Scott shops have annual sales of more than Pounds 1m and UniChem
expects its new pharmacies to contribute to profits in the first year.
It plans to take them into its retail chain under the Moss name.
Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, said: 'This is an excellent buy for us, as
Scott is one of the few large groups of pharmacies left in the market. It
also strengthens our business in Scotland and underlines our commitment to
build a second core business of retail pharmacy.'

over AZT drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals company involved in the world's largest
ever non-privatisation secondary share issue, faces further generic
competition to AZT, the HIV treatment and one of its largest-selling
products.
Microbiologica, a Brazilian company established by staff at Rio de Janeiro's
Federal University, has received permission from the Brazilian licencing
authorities to manufacture and sell AZT in Brazil, a country which does not
recognise Wellcome's AZT patents.
The group plans to sell the drug elsewhere in Latin America where patent
protection is weak. It is also looking at the possibility of selling it in
Canada and Spain.
The Brazilian company plans to sell generic AZT at about Dollars 100 (Pounds
54) per 100 tablets compared with Wellcome's price of Dollars 140.
It expects to have production for 80kg a month by January next year,
adequate to supply 60 per cent of the Brazilian market worth Dollars 30m a
year.
Wellcome said yesterday that it did not believe the Brazilian company had
sufficient manufacturing capacity to launch the product in the immediate
future, and that it expected no immediate impact on sales. The world market
for AZT last year was Pounds 177m, making it Wellcome's second best-selling
product after Zovirax, another anti-viral treatment.
Prof Fernando Steele da Cruz, Microbiologica's administrative director, told
Pharmaceutical Business News, a Financial Times newsletter, that its AZT was
100 per cent pure and had been tested in the US and UK.
Wellcome's share price has been highly sensitive to stories about AZT, sales
of which represent about 11 per cent of group revenues.
However, analysts are expecting to hear additional details about the
effectiveness of AZT at the Amsterdam Aids conference taking place during
the last week before the share offer closes on July 24.
AZT is already under pressure in other countries from generic manufacturers.

LONRHO, the international trading group, yesterday published for the first

geographical area which showed a collapse in pre-tax profits from southern
Africa.
Technical problems at South Africa's Western Platinum and a decline in
precious metal prices were responsible for pre-tax profits falling from
Pounds 32m to Pounds 3m. Pre-tax profits from mineral extraction and
refining throughout the group fell from Pounds 39m to Pounds 14m.
Mr Paul Spicer, deputy chairman, said the group was confident the second
half would contain better results because technical problems at Western
Platinum had been solved and production of precious metals would be
increased.
The Americas reported no profit figures as the recession continued to affect
its Princess Hotels. Leisure, which includes hotels in Africa, saw pre-tax
profits decline from Pounds 3m to nil.
Pre-tax profits from east, central and west Africa fell from Pounds 36m to
Pounds 23m, while in Europe profits dropped from Pounds 22m to Pounds 5m.
The UK businesses continued to be affected by the recession as pre-tax
profits declined from Pounds 19m to Pounds 7m. Pre-tax profits from motor
and equipment distribution fell from Pounds 11m to Pounds 6m.
General trade, which includes distributors of electrical goods and aircraft
spares, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 24m to Pounds 9m.
In financial services, pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 24m to Pounds 4m.
Manufacturing, which includes The Observer newspaper, reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 5m to Pounds 3m. Pre-tax profits from
agriculture slipped from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Mild winter retards Anglo United
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, announced
yesterday that it had cut its dividend and renegotiated its debt repayment
schedule as profits for the year to end-March fell by 48 per cent.
The mild winter and continuing recession dented profits before tax, which
fell from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 8.3m on sales from ongoing businesses up
from Pounds 537.2m to Pounds 555.9m.
Exceptional profits of Pounds 5.3m were achieved from the sale of a number
of small assets against Pounds 7.8m last time.
Earnings per share were down at 1.9p (5.1p). Mr David McErlain, chairman,
said it would be imprudent to pay an uncovered dividend. The final was
therefore reduced from 1.4p to 0.65p, making a total of 0.85p (1.6p).
'It may not be what many fund managers wanted to see but it's the right
decision. The cut in the total dividend was in line with the profit fall. If
profits increase so will the dividend,' he added.
After missing a debt repayment of Pounds 17m in February, Anglo has
renegotiated its debt repayment schedule, relating to the 1989 purchase of
Coalite for Pounds 478m, enabling it to pay off debt with proceeds from
disposals.
Anglo's disposal programme of its non-core businesses has been affected by
the recession. Liquid fuel and chemicals are likely to be sold for less than
the Pounds 70m-Pounds 80m Anglo originally wanted after trading profits fell
from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 9m.
Other businesses, including Pozament, a manufacturer of waterproof grouts,
and Seaham Harbour Dock Company saw profits fall from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds
4.7m.
Solid fuel manufacturing and distribution, the smokeless fuel business,
reported unchanged trading profits of Pounds 21.6m - about Pounds 6m below
the budgeted figure due to the exceptionally mild winter.
Overall trading profit fell from Pounds 48.8m to Pounds 35.4m. The interest
charge decreased from Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 32.6m as debt fell from Pounds
233m to Pounds 196m.
COMMENT
An exceptionally mild winter and difficult trading conditions have frozen
Anglo's ambition to buy some of British Coal's assets. The company's last
quarter tells a sorry story: trading profits down from Pounds 24m to Pounds
12m, mainly because of the mild winter. As trading profits of Anglo's
non-core businesses tumbled so it has become much harder to find buyers. If
it still manages to achieve the Pounds 70m of planned disposals by next year
and has better luck with the weather British Coal will be back in its
sights. The dividend cut, while unexpected, was the right thing to do given
the fall in profits. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m and earnings of
2.3p put the shares, which fell  1/2 p to close at 13 1/2 p, at a
prospective multiple of 6 - a 58 per cent discount to the market.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Negative asset value at Gresham House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRESHAM HOUSE, the investment trust specialising in unquoted companies and
property, had a negative net asset value at December 31.
Gresham, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.87m (Pounds
16.7m) for the year, said its net asset value per share collapsed to minus
18p on December 31, against a value of 129p a year earlier.
The announcement was issued after the stock market closed, and the shares
were unchanged at 18p.
The loss included Pounds 6.92m of unspecified exceptional losses. Last year,
Gresham's exceptional losses were Pounds 15.1m as some of its larger
holdings were put into receivership or hit by recession.
The company said discussions with its bankers about an Pounds 8.5m
refinancing were continuing 'satisfactorily'. But it warned shareholders
that any break-down in negotiations would 'make it very difficult for your
board to continue the group's operations'.
Dividend and interest income from investments fell sharply to Pounds 471,000
(Pounds 2.05m), although rental income improved to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds
1.22m). A sale of property investments is scheduled to continue, the company
said.
But Gresham's property development company has been placed into
administrative receivership following a dispute with Customs and Excise. The
property arm has therefore, in line with accounting standards, been
deconsolidated from the group's balance sheet, although consolidated in its
profit and loss account, the company said.
In separate litigation regarding a finance company, Gresham intends to
appeal to the House of Lords against a recent unfavourable ruling.
There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds 2.34m following over-provisioning
in previous years. The loss attributable to shareholders was Pounds 6.48m
(Pounds 16.8m). Losses per share totalled 208.3p (395.9p). No dividend is
recommended.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Beverley drops into red at Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEVERLEY GROUP, which as Petrocon failed to acquire rival engineering group
James Wilkes through a hostile takeover in April, reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 2.57m for 1991, a year beset by operational problems and the
recession.
The loss followed profits of Pounds 941,000 last year and was struck on
sales up from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 18.3m.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said the group would continue to pursue growth
through selective acquisitions, the first stage of which was achieved in
March through the purchase of Beverley Group.
Mr Robinson and three other Petrocon directors controlled Beverley, which
Petrocon bought for Pounds 2.68m.
Beverley's results coincided with a suspension of trading in the shares of
West Industries, the engineering company where Mr Robinson was chairman
until earlier this year. The shares were suspended yesterday at 2p at the
company's request pending clarification of its financial position.
The company has posted proposals to shareholders and creditors for it to
enter into a corporate voluntary arrangement (CVA) under the 1986 Insolvency
Act and for the CVA to be supervised by Mr Cedric Clapp of Ernst &amp; Young.
Meetings of shareholders and creditors will be held on July 14 to consider
the proposals. If approved further proposals will be put to shareholders as
soon as possible for a reconstruction of West through a scheme of
arrangement under section 425 of the 1985 Companies Act.
For the year to March 31 1991 West's pre-tax loss deepened to Pounds 6.3m
(Pounds 1.08m).

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: SWEB surges 35% to Pounds 83m and switches
on the gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WESTERN Electricity, the Bristol-based distributor, raised profits by
35 per cent in its first full year as a privatised company.
The sharp increase for the year to March 31, which was in line with other
electricity company results, was accompanied by a 14.5 per cent increase in
the total dividend to 17.4p.
Mr William Nicol, chairman, said the 'excellent' result came from a
combination of cost cutting, better management of assets, and higher sales.
SWEB made Pounds 83m before tax, up from Pounds 61.3m, the pro forma result
produced last year for the privatisation. Turnover amounted to Pounds 847m
(Pounds 779m) and earnings per share rose by 11.6p to 50.6p.
The bulk of the increase in operating profit came in electricity
distribution, up by Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 93.7m. This reflected a 3.3 per
cent increase in tariffs, and a 1.4 per cent increase in volume.
The tariff rise was lower than the 3.6 per cent permitted by the terms of
its licence and many customers had taken advantage of the 1 per cent
reduction offered to those who paid by direct debit. The volume increase was
lower than normal due to the recession.
The retailing and contracting business saw profits drop from Pounds 1.1m to
Pounds 400,000, reflecting a difficult high street market.
In the long run, SWEB is aiming for an 8 per cent a year real increase in
dividends. Mr John Sellers, finance director, said the latest result more
than justified the increase. One reason was the Pounds 6-Pounds 7m reduction
in costs last year, part of a strategy to bring costs down by 10 per cent by
1993-94.
SWEB also announced yesterday that it had set up Western Gas, a joint
venture with UtiliCorp United of the US, to sell gas to business customers
and take advantage of the ending of the British Gas monopoly later this
year.
Mr Nicol said that the new venture would enable both partners to contribute
their special expertise.
COMMENT
SWEB made a point of being unapologetic about this sharp increase, which was
in line with market expectations. It achieved a rise in volume sales in
difficult times, made further progress in its battle against costs, and
forewent a part of the tariff increase to which it was entitled. The
dividend increase was among the highest so far. The group justified this on
the basis of a formula by which any real increase over 4 per cent has to be
backed by improvements in performance rather than just volume. The main
disappointment is the retailing side which registered a small loss. Given
SWEB's large commitment to this area, it bears watching. The shares gained
11p to 321p where they yield just over 6 per cent, slightly above the sector
average.

FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: BM annoys institutions as share price falls
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE slide at BM, the construction equipment and engineering group,
continued yesterday following last week's resignation for health reasons of
Mr Roger Shute, the founder-chairman, and Monday's profits downgrading by
Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker.
The share price fell from 150p to 113p. One analyst called it 'a meltdown'
following what appears to have been a collapse of confidence in the company.
The fall came as Baillie Gifford, the Scottish institution, announced that
it had raised its stake in the group last Friday to 5.05 per cent. Since the
start of June the share price has fallen from 398p, wiping over 70 per cent
from BM's stock market valuation.
The board, led by Mr Matthew Thorne, the new non-executive chairman, began
talking to its institutional shareholders yesterday but is understood to
have annoyed some of its largest shareholders by addressing a meeting of
analysts first.
Analysts at that meeting said BM had continued a tradition begun by Mr Shute
of not being particularly forthcoming with information about the company.
While this was generally accepted from Mr Shute, who developed a strong City
backing at a time when BM's profits and earnings were rising rapidly, the
market urgently needed more specific answers now that the share price was in
free fall.
In particular shareholders would like to know how two crucial distribution
contracts with Komatsu and Hitachi, the Japanese heavy construction
machinery manufacturers, would be affected by the departure of Mr Shute who
developed the relationships.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Institutions cool on Telegraph flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, MAGGIE URRY and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LUKEWARM response to the flotation of The Telegraph is expected when
applications for the public offer close today.
Cazenove, one of the joint brokers to the issue, said yesterday last week's
placing of half the 26m shares on offer had gone well. Demand for the 13m
shares being sold through a public offer would only be known after 10am
today, the deadline for applications.
However, institutional investors contacted by the FT yesterday expressed
little enthusiasm for the offer. A weak stockmarket has cast a cloud over
new issues.
The flotation at a price of 325p values The Telegraph, whose main businesses
are the daily and Sunday newspapers of that name, at Pounds 435.5m. The 26m
shares being sold are raising Pounds 84.5m before expenses for Hollinger
Group, Mr Conrad Black's investment company. Hollinger is retaining a 68 per
cent stake in The Telegraph.
Analysts said they expected The Telegraph offer to be fully subscribed,
although it was difficult to gauge retail demand. However, one analyst said:
'I have not spoken to one institution in favour of the shares.'
Many investors and analysts expressed concern about the price of the issue,
compared with other companies in the sector.
There was also concern about Mr Black's plans for future investments in
media businesses. The prospectus outlined a possible bid by Hollinger for
the New York Daily News with The Telegraph then being offered a half share
in that newspaper, although Mr Black has since played this down.
Brokers said the shares would at best trade at a small premium to the issue
price when dealings begin on July 8 and could open at a discount.
Shares in Anglian Group, the double-glazing company, go on sale to the
public next week at a price of 210p, valuing the Norwich-based group at
about Pounds 183.5m, writes Richard Gourlay. Advisers NM Rothschild had been
hoping for a price of 250p as recently as two weeks ago.
Yesterday 21.05m shares were placed with institutions and underwriting was
secured for the same amount of stock being offered to the public.
The 210p price gives Anglian a pro forma historic price earnings ratio of
12.2 times and pro forma historic earnings per share of 17.2p.
The company is raising Pounds 56.5m through the flotation.

FT  01 JUL 92 / BP quickens pace of debt reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum said yesterday it would accelerate the cost-cutting and
debt-reduction programme it had in place before last week's surprise
resignation of Mr Robert Horton, chairman and chief executive, and hoped to
be cash positive by next year.
Mr Steve Ahearne, chief financial officer and a BP board member, was giving
the first presentation of corporate strategy since Mr Horton's departure,
though the meeting was arranged well before last week's boardroom coup. He
told analysts the company would accelerate its asset disposal programme, cut
capital spending and continue to improve productivity. He refused to comment
on dividend policy.
Speculation that BP may halve its dividend has seen its share price fall
from 243p to close at 203 1/2 p yesterday.
One analyst said yesterday's presentation was of a 'steady as she goes'
programme, which showed that while the style of management might alter, the
substance - with the likely exception of dividend policy - would remain
little changed.
Mr Ahearne said BP hoped by next year to begin reducing its Pounds 8.5bn
debt burden. This would be achieved by improving productivity, and
continuing cutting operating costs by Dollars 750m (Pounds 395m) a year by
1994, although competition might dilute that.
Capital expenditure would be reduced by 25 per cent to Dollars 5bn in both
1993 and 1994, from Dollars 6.5bn this year. New investments would have to
be profitable at a crude oil price of Dollars 18-Dollars 20 a barrel.
The third prong of the programme is an acceleration of asset divestment in
non-core businesses, with a target of between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn
this year and in 1993. Most of the disposals are expected to be in the
marketing, chemicals and nutrition businesses.
Mr Ahearne said BP's second-quarter performance in exploration and
production had been good, although but profit margins in the refining
business were lower. The outlook for the chemicals business was likely to
remain difficult for the rest of the year, but there were some signs of a
pick-up in demand.
Analysts said the City would be reassured by what was seen as a prudent
programme, although the possibility of a dividend cut remained the most
pressing concern. Most managing directors in BP are now believed to support
a 'rebasing' of the dividend to a sustainable level.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the close of the second quarter, it appears that this column's suggestion
at the start of the year that UK investors would be better off in cash was
slightly on the gloomy side. According to County NatWest's preliminary
calculations, the return on cash so far in the UK is 5.2 per cent. This
beats UK equities, with a return of 5.0 per cent, but lags long gilts with
8.9 per cent and index-linked with 6.6 per cent.
This is consistent enough with a low-growth, low-inflation environment.
Oddly enough, though, even UK equities have done well in an international
context. Leaving aside the horrors of Japan, where this year's total return
has been minus 29 per cent in local currency, the London market has managed
to outperform Wall Street, whose total return has been approximately zero.
But there is one important caveat. Almost all the return from the UK equity
market so far has been in the form of dividends. As the year proceeds, it is
becoming apparent that dividends paid to date have been posited on an
over-optimistic view of the economic cycle. This is the more unfortunate if,
as seems logical, it turns out that in a non-inflationary environment income
is all that matters.

FT  01 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Anglian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the UK companies which pushed the button for a midsummer float,
Anglian's decision looked smartest at the time. That apparent post-election
surge in consumer confidence, it was assumed, would not only translate into
economic recovery. The impact when it came would be demonstrated first by
renewed activity in the housing market on which double-glazing manufacturers
such as Anglian at least partially depend.
Such rosy expectations have since been shattered with the result that
yesterday's offer price is perhaps 12 per cent below what the company might
have hoped for just a couple of weeks ago, and 20 per cent less than what
some of the more optimistic venture capitalists had earlier pencilled in.
Even at 210p, however, the shares are not necessarily a bargain.
Admittedly the 12.2 times historic earnings multiple - or perhaps a point
less than this prospectively - looks attractive by comparison with
businesses which share some of the same features such as Hepworth, MB
Caradon and Wolseley. A 5.5 per cent yield, moreover, is hardly stingy:
Anglian's two times cover should permit some sort of dividend increase this
year. The difficulty is that the nature of the product and the company's
narrow dependence on it justify at least part of the differential. The rest
could arguably be explained by still unrealistically high ratings elsewhere.
The best that can be said is that there are few short-term risks in
subscribing; with institutions deeply reluctant to increase their weightings
in an unfashionable sector, though, investors should not expect much
excitement in the after market.

FT  01 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's interim figures contain fresh evidence of the perplexing rate at
which cash is draining out of the business. While the interim balance sheet
takes in disposals of Pounds 500m, net debt has fallen by only Pounds 192m,
to Pounds 903m. Allowance has to be made for Pounds 126m of off-balance
sheet debt consolidated in the period. But that still implies an underlying
cash outflow of Pounds 182m in the space of six months, which is somewhat
disquieting for a group whose market value is only just over Pounds 500m.
In such a context, the fact that the slashed interim dividend is only 5 per
cent covered by earnings seems almost irrelevant. That is not to say that
the profit and loss account makes cheerful reading. Net profit before
extraordinaries has fallen from Pounds 60m to Pounds 1m. That is struck
after Pounds 12m of property disposals taken above the line. From the
viewpoint of cash flow, it does not help that Pounds 13m of the interest
charge has been capitalised.
The market seemed to take some heart yesterday from Mr Rowland's promise of
much improved profits in the second half. But until it becomes clearer what
is happening to cash flow, there is no point in attempting to value the
shares on a fundamental basis.

FT  01 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The confidence factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first quarter jump in the UK savings ratio to 11.5 per cent is such
apparently depressing news that the natural response is to scramble in
search of mitigating factors. One possibility is that election uncertainty
prompted consumers to save more. Another is that bonuses paid early to
escape Labour's punitive taxation plans were all tucked away in savings
accounts. On both counts one could expect the ratio to have dipped again in
the second quarter. Add in the fact that real earnings have continued to
grow, and the first quarter rise could be dismissed as a blip.
The nagging worry is that this is only part of the story. The available
evidence hardly suggests a sustained pick-up in consumer demand since the
election, even though interest rates have been cut once since then. Indeed,
this week's Mintel survey showed consumers still unwilling to increase
credit card debt even to take advantage of discount prices in sales.
In today's disinflationary environment it has become much harder to predict
when consumers will become less wary. Part of the problem may be a painful
adjustment to the sharp decline in nominal pay settlements. Next year's tiny
pay increases will do little to reduce the burden of this year's debt. Then
again, rising real disposable incomes should eventually leave consumers
comfortable with their existing borrowings. But confidence will hardly
return until house prices recover and unemployment peaks, or at least starts
rising more slowly. Both developments require cuts in interest rates on a
scale which looks out of the question until well into 1993.
Most economists who have cut their growth forecasts to around zero for this
year have worked into their assumptions a savings rate stuck at around 10
per cent. So yesterday's figures do not suggest immediate need for a further
lowering of expectations for 1992. Still, it is becoming harder to rule out
the possibility that the UK will succumb to a vicious cycle in which chronic
lack of confidence condemns the economy to chronic recession.

Sir, An inaccurate and misleading article about the Harvard Business Review
appeared in the Financial Times on May 29 ('Those who teach. . .').
I remain editor of a financially strong and editorially excellent magazine.
I will not be relinquishing the duties associated with this leadership
position, as your story stated, but will be accepting responsibilities as
vice-chairman of the board of directors of a proposed new Harvard Business
School Publishing Group, which will include books and videos as well as
magazines.
I have been editor for more than two years; and I would characterise my

It is a sign of strength that we are preparing to establish a professional

FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: The choices undermined by Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM MONTGOMERIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Freedom of choice is quite properly a cornerstone of modern western
society, but classical liberals generally agree that our freedom must be
exercised within a conducive social framework. Adam Smith and Edmund Burke
deemed that framework to be one where there was a great deal of fellow
feeling or 'sympathy' for those around us with a particular stress on the
family, on the local and on intermediate institutions: Burke's 'small
platoons'.
In your advocacy of Sunday trading (leading article, June 26) you fail to
demonstrate any understanding that an extension of economic choice in this
area may undermine other choices.
Sunday is the day when families and friends can enjoy time together and it
is the day when elderly people receive most attention. It is the traditional
Sunday pause in the economy that allows space for vital social contact; to
examine the Sunday issue only in terms of individual choice neglects the
important family dimension. Many small, independent retailers may also be
forced into closure by big store competition and this could be very damaging
to some communities and especially pensioners and the less mobile who depend
on local outlets.
Given the relatively inelastic demand for most of the goods in question it
must also be highly doubtful as to the economic worth of Sunday trading.
Capital may be better used but labour costs will be higher. Any advantages
will go to the retailers who do open and win trade from six-day traders.
More and more traders will therefore be forced to open, causing an
escalation of costs - all in pursuit of a very limited amount of custom.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: Realities of airline competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DECLAN P CONROY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Thomas McDonogh (Letters, June 24) is badly misinformed. His most
seriously misguided allegation refers to airlines he considers to be
technically bankrupt. Aer Lingus utterly rejects any such allegation. The
company not only has its shareholder's original investment intact but has
also accumulated considerable reserves. The last published accounts show an
original investment in Aer Lingus of IRPounds 74m, with accumulated profits
of IRPounds 324m reflecting shareholder's funds of IRPounds 398m, with a
gearing ratio of 109 per cent.
On a number of other issues Mr McDonogh fails to include reality in the
picture he paints. Aer Lingus, a 'national carrier' whose staffing levels
and cost base are in line with both private and state owned airlines, is the
most punctual airline in Europe, hardly a sign of 'inefficiency'. In a
survey of the top 1,000 Irish companies conducted by Mr McDonogh's Air
Transport Users Committee, Aer Lingus has been voted 'Airline of the Year -
1992'. This award was secured in the face of competition from airlines such
as Lufthansa, Delta, SAS, and Air France.
To suggest that little or no competition exists on most routes in Europe is
absurd. In the markets Aer Lingus serves, over 30 airlines operate both
scheduled and charter flights.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: Environment is an issue for EC, not nation states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON HUGHES MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am a strong supporter of devolving power to the lowest level at which
it can most usefully be wielded, which is one way of interpreting the
Euro-doctrine of subsidiarity. But the proposal being aired at the Lisbon
European Community Summit to return many environmental powers to nation
states are, quite frankly, bonkers.
Take the example of bathing water quality. Your article on the Summit
outcome ('A state of limbo in Lisbon', June 29) suggested that Chancellor
Kohl of Germany viewed bathing water quality as a prime candidate for return
to nation states. He is ignoring the simple fact that pollution and
environmental degradation are no respecters of national boundaries nor
coastlines.
The toxic waste which Britain still dumps in the North Sea does not
necessarily stay in British territorial waters, but could well end up
blackening beaches of other EC nations. Mr Kohl should have learnt that
lesson from the decades of unchecked pollution that the old West Germany
suffered from its East German neighbours.
As Britain takes up the presidency of the Council of Ministers one of the
key tasks of the Community in the next few years will be to bring together
nations to protect and promote the environment.
If Britain cannot break the diplomatic deadlock over the setting up and
siting of the proposed European Environmental Bureau then the environment
secretary, Michael Howard, should push forward with his idea of an
environmental inspectorate.
It is better compliance with EC law that is needed - not a retreat from
Community-wide laws to protect one country from the pollution of others.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Harmonising EC taxes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCIPLES MUST be flexible. This seems to be the conclusion reached by Mr
Norman Lamont after years of battles between the UK and most of the rest of
the European Community over harmonisation of value added tax and excise
duties. It is a sensible conclusion. A Britain 'at the heart of Europe' has
to behave like a 'good European'. One of the characteristics of good
Euro-peans is that they are extremely uncomfortable about competition among
fiscal - not to mention, other regulatory - regimes. What is more, the UK
has already shown that it is less than fully attached to the principle of
free fiscal competition.
In the case of value added taxation, the UK's original position was that
neither minima nor maxima were needed. That position has much to recommend
it. The US, for example, manages to survive very well without constraints on
the freedom of individual states to impose taxes. In the EC, however, some
member countries would not eliminate border controls without prior agreement
on minimum rates of indirect taxation. Furthermore, the concern about
revenue erosion in regions of the EC where dense populations fall close to
international borders was at least understandable.
Last year, the UK government accepted a political agreement that the
standard minimum VAT rate would be 15 per cent. This concession came in
return for acceptance by the rest of the EC of the UK's (admittedly absurd)
attachment to zero rating of food, fuel, transport and children's clothing.
The UK had also long agreed that there should be minimum rates of excise
duty on tobacco and alcoholic beverages, mainly for health reasons, but
also, no doubt, to protect as much as possible of the Pounds 11.9bn in
revenue expected from these two sources in 1992-93. While not impossible, it
is somewhat difficult to desire EC-wide minima for some taxes and reject the
principle for others.
Sensible conditions
Past compromises, not to mention commitment to the goal of a single market,
make it difficult for the government to fight to the death for its refusal
to enshrine the 15 per cent VAT minimum in a legally binding directive. It
was reasonable, therefore, for the chancellor to accept the principle at the
meeting of EC finance ministers on Tuesday. But he did so subject to equally
sensible conditions: that the directive would be limited to four years, that
it would require unanimity to reimpose it and that it would be part of a
broader deal.
The problem is that 'broader deal'. There is an argument for taxation of
alcoholic beverages on health grounds. The absence of border controls would,
therefore, seem to make either some minimum rates of taxation or some
controls over imports necessary.
Enfeebled regime
The EC has already agreed on the latter. People may import certain
indicative quantities for their own personal use, these levels being 800
cigarettes, 10 litres of spirits, 20 litres of fortified wines and 90 litres
of wine. But 90 litres of wine here, 90 litres of wine there, and one would
soon be talking of a significantly enfeebled excise duty regime. The case
for minimum excise tax rates remains.
The problem is that the EC has agreed to a minimum rate on wine of zero, the
initial level in several member countries. This means that any positive
minimum on spirits would be discriminatory. With the health case for minimum
excise duties already lost in the case of wine, the chancellor is inevitably
more concerned about the discrimination against the spirits, which the UK -
or rather Scotland - makes.
The chancellor's ability to argue persuasively against discriminatory
taxation of spirits is weakened by the discrimination in the UK's own
taxation. But the principle is self-evidently correct.
By now a logical position on indirect taxation cannot be achieved. No minima
at all might have been best of all, in which case competition would have
delivered a degree of tax convergence. No minima for VAT, but health-related
minima for tobacco and alcoholic beverages, would also have been defensible.
But this too is now out of reach. The UK was right in its initial positions.
But, given what is at stake in the single market, it is right to try to
compromise as well.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Foreign Affairs: A Greek tragi-comedy - Macedonia should be
recognised without further delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In any contest for the silliest political statement of 1992, the following
paragraph from Monday's FT will surely be a strong runner:
'Under pressure from Greece, EC leaders said they were ready to recognise
Macedonia's independence provided it chose a name which does not include the
term Macedonia.'
With this affair the absurdity of nationalism has reached its acme. Not that
the absurdity is all on one side. A Greek friend has given me a copy of a
Macedonian leaflet which not only shows Macedonia stretching to the Aegean,
with the southern half of it 'under the Greek terror of occupation since
1913', but insists that Alexander the Great and Aristotle were not Greek,
and that the Macedonians of today are not 'Slavic'. You and I may imagine
that Macedonian is a Slavic language closely related to Bulgarian and more
distantly to Serbo-Croat, Russian, Polish etc, but apparently the boot is on
the other foot. 'The Macedonians were not 'Slavicized',' the leaflet says.
It was the Slavs who were 'linguistically 'Macedonianized', ie they accepted
the ancient Macedonian language as their own which deteriorated over the
centuries into the languages we know today as Russian, Ukrainian, Polish,
Slovakian, Serbian etc.'
A lot of the blame seems to fall on the Byzantine empire, under which 'the
Macedonian and all other nations were subdued to massive denationalisation
and assimilation, a process that entails the denial of the most fundamental
human rights . . . To an Australian this may seem absurd,' the leaflet adds,
'but is not unusual when an Athenian government has territorial aspirations
towards her neighbours.'
Indeed, Australians might not be alone in deploring the human rights record
of the Byzantine empire. The leaflet's citation of such ancient injustices
to support a contemporary cause makes it a classic nationalist document,
worthy to be included in political science text books. But it is only a
leaflet, published by (or in the name of) the Macedonian community in
Australia. By using it and other similar documents to prove that the very
use of the name Macedonia is a threat to Greek territorial integrity, the
Greek government is bringing itself down to the authors' level.
The Macedonian government has given assurances that it harbours no such
irredentist claims, and has even written those assurances into the
constitution of the state. Greece does not accept them as sincere, given the
history and ideology of Macedonian nationalism. But why should a change of
name be any more sincere or permanent?
It is an old mistake to suppose that you can legislate away the ideology of
other people's nationalism. Arabs have thought the same about Jews, and
Israelis about Palestinians. You can make agreements with people about what
they will do or not do, and you can take precautions against their failure
to deliver. But people's beliefs and desires can only be changed by
experience, not by requiring them to sign loyalty oaths or friendship
treaties, and still less by asking them to change their name.
If the Greek principle were to be accepted throughout the EC, Belgium should
long ago have withdrawn recognition from the Grand Duchy of 'Luxembourg', a
state which by so calling itself lays claim to the adjacent Belgian province
of the same name. And France can hardly continue to recognise a neighbouring
country as 'la Grande Bretagne' without fearing the loss of the smaller
Bretagne on its own side of the Channel.
It would all be irresistibly comic if it were not so likely to end in yet
another Balkan tragedy.
Of all the ex-Yugoslav republics, except Slovenia, Macedonia is the one that
best qualifies for international recognition. Its government controls its
territory, and has won the support of the ethnic Albanian minority. Yet if
not helped to consolidate itself rapidly it is vulnerable to destabilisation
and even partition, especially if fighting breaks out between Serbs and
Albanians in neighbouring Kosovo. Albanians in Macedonia would want to help
their kith and kin. Suspecting that they were doing so, Serbia would all too
likely take action against Macedonia. Bulgaria and even Turkey might then
feel they should come to Macedonia's assistance, while Greece would be
tempted to come in on the Serbian side.
The stage would thus be set for a full-scale Balkan war, vintage 1913. The
best way to avert this would be to recognise Macedonia now and admit it to
the UN, so that all UN members would be obliged to respect its integrity. If
the EC is held back from doing this by its need for unanimity (though this
did not seem to inhibit Mr Francois Mitterrand on his excursion to
Sarajevo), then let the 'sole remaining superpower' take the lead.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Scandal touches emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK markets in the developing countries have been exerting an increasingly
powerful attraction on investors in the developed world. The trend towards
liberalisation across the globe; the ready supply of equity stemming from
privatisation in countries as diverse as Mexico and Malaysia; the potential
for above-average investment returns in the developing world - all these
things have combined to promote capital transfers on a growing scale. Yet
the unfolding scandal on the Bombay Stock Exchange, one of Asia's more
febrile markets, raises an awkward question about future access to the
developed world's savings. Will malpractice kill off the potential inflow of
capital?
On the face of it, the Indian market, from which foreigners were excluded
until last month's Dollars 150m international equity offer by the Reliance
petrochemical group, has been shown to be a treacherous repository for risk
capital since prices started to slide at the end of April. The biggest of
India's exchanges, Bombay, which trades in nearly 700 companies, suffers
from an undercapitalised jobbing system. Liquidity is poor, insider trading
is rife and settlement is grossly inefficient.
That sounds like the very definition of a market worth avoiding. Yet it is
not so different from the British and American capital markets in the 19th
century. And the starting point for the recent surge in the Indian stock
market, which took the average earnings multiple to a Japanese-style 57 at
the peak, was not unreasonable. Investors were anticipating the increased
returns from a policy shift towards export-led growth and the opening up of
the economy to foreign direct investment.
Powerful incentive
The heady rise prompted by the prospect of liberalisation in the real
economy collided with a combination of over-regulation and under-supervision
in the financial sector. Because of tough regulations that required state
banks to put a high proportion of deposits into government paper at the
Reserve Bank of India, the banks had a powerful incentive to divert funds
into an inter-bank promissory note market.
This market in IOUs overheated as banks issued paper out of all proportion
to their capital. Money raised in the inter-bank market was then used for
speculation in the stock market. Since the central bank lacked the resources
and computer capacity to register securities transfers quickly or to monitor
events more generally, the outcome was disaster.
It is too early to be certain about the impact on foreign investors'
confidence. While the Reliance issue went ahead, Grasim, a large cement and
textiles concern, has been forced to delay a similar Dollars 90m issue
because of the halt in trading on the Bombay exchange. But outside investors
are not the chief victims of the scandals; and the extent of the damage may
ultimately depend on the Indian government's regulatory response.
Better regulation
At a time when foreign exchange is scarce in India the case for better stock
market regulation is not hard to make. For developing countries generally
that case may be reinforced by the fact that savings ratios in the developed
world have been in long-term decline and international bank lending has
temporarily been contracting. Competition for savings is set to intensify as
formerly state-controlled countries in Latin America and the former Soviet
bloc move progressively towards more open markets.
The importance of external capital can nonetheless be exaggerated. With a
savings ratio of 21 per cent, India would scarcely expect external portfolio
capital to make a dramatic impact. It is also noteworthy that of the four
spectacularly successful Asian dragons - Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea
and Taiwan - only South Korea relied heavily on foreign private capital to
finance its rapid economic growth. But elsewhere in the third world,
domestic savings ratios do not always have the support of Confucian, or
plain Asian, habits of thrift. More open capital markets can compensate for
that lack, especially when first-world investors feel short of third-world
assets. As long as the wider policy framework remains broadly liberal, greed
will outweigh fear. Foreign investors will probably take the odd stock
market scandal in their stride.

The new agony aunt chat show series Fighting Back today features former

only open heart surgery could save his life. Then, after two major
operations, he was told he had been infected with Aids via a blood
transfusion (7.30 BBC1).
Radio 3 has a live relay from Covent Garden of the new production of The
Flying Dutchman (7.55) with James Morris in the title role and Julia Varady
(much admired by FT opera critic Max Loppert) as Senta. According to
Loppert, the production goes off with a bang.
A new season of BBC2's filmed single dramas, 'ScreenPlay' begins with The
Countess Alice by Alan Cubitt. Wendy Hiller, 80 this summer, plays a
countess who caused a scandal as a young woman when she married a Prussian
count. Her daughter, played by Zoe Wanamaker, decides that, following the
demolition of the Berlin Wall, she will visit the old family home in
Mecklenburg.
Channel 4's collection of sitcom pilots, Bunch Of Five, has been a pretty

FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: The Berlin Ballet's 'Giselle' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlin Ballet opened its first London season on Monday night with
Giselle. This is the staging - by Peter Schaufuss, director of the company -
on which I reported during the company's visit last summer to the Edinburgh
Festival. It is a view of this gem of the 1840s which dots every dramatic
'i' and crosses every Romantic 't', and, having quite a few dots and crosses
left over, lavishes them on various other matters in the action. Nothing in
drama or character is unexplained: this is a Giselle for neurotics (or the
very literal-minded) who must know the why and wherefore of every least
moment. The peasantry in Act 1 have all acquired names - though I'd go to
the stake before I could tell Gundolf from Bernward - and behave with the
sort of vivacity and 'Gosh, here I am, on stage in a ballet' romping that I
thought was the province of the rankest amateurs.
It is excessive, and a pity, since Schaufuss has sensible ideas about the
dramatic logic needed to make the old repertory vivid for a new audience.
Lightly sedated, and rid of its puppyish enthusiasms, the production would
make greater sense, though nothing can rival the blessed simplicity, the
let-the-dance-do-its-job clarity, of the Kirov production, which is the
ideal Giselle. Of course, the Kirov version is the fruit of 150 years
uninterrupted life in the theatre. Schaufuss's compensatory procedures - a
Pelion on Ossa of detail - are a means of supporting and sustaining his
novice casts. It is production as substitute for interpretation, and on
these terms it worked helpfully on Monday night when Lisa Cullum and Bart de
Block were the central figures.
Miss Cullum is a young dancer, and her Giselle is a tender, very immature
portrayal. She has a slender physique, and a touchingly vulnerable profile
for the peasant girl, but as yet her reading is a matter of lessons repeated
rather than a masterpiece illuminated. The dance is innocent in style as in
means; the interpretation touches by its gentleness, but it must learn to
explore both the mystery and the steely technical demands that lie at the
heart of the role. (The staging might come in to focus with a great Giselle
at its heart). Bart de Block makes Albrecht altogether too lightweight a
figure; able as a dancer, he is overcome by the drama.
Christine Camillo was a fine and brilliant Queen of the Wilis, and in
subsidiary roles, I salute the bold clarity of the men in the first act
solos - strong,vital dancing - and shall long treasure the assembled
peasantry bent double when the Courland hunting party arrives, avoiding
looking above the gentry's knees as if Princess Bathilde were a visiting
Gorgon. The decision to show Giselle's hands smeared with blood as she stabs
herself is lamentable. Desmond Heeley's designs of trees and misty vistas
are ravishing, and his costuming is uniformly attractive. The cover for
programme and souvenir book - a naked soft-focus lady with arum lilies
burgeoning on her strategic bits - is hilariously inapt except as an
advertisement for a deodorant.
The Berlin Ballet is at the Coliseum until July 4. Programming varies.
Support for the season comes from Montblanc (UK).

FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: Eos - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eos is a young ensemble in the senses that it is recently formed, comprises
young (talented) players, and has a young-hearted, cobweb-sweeping attitude
to concert presentation. To its concert on Sunday evening in the unusual
venue of the Royal Court Theatre, it attracted a sizeable, young audience
which was not made up of London classical music regulars and had an above
average quota of children. The latter would have been roundly entertained by
the colourful staging (by Adam Spiegel) of Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale which
formed the programme's second half; while conductor Charles Hazlewood' s
enthusiastic, knowledgeable spoken introductions to the items were designed
to win over all age-groups.
The first item was unconducted. Amid the toppled potted plants of the
Stravinsky set, some of the string players, violins and violas standing in
'camerata' fashion, nicely intoned the opening instrumental sextet from
Strauss's opera Capriccio. The theatre's intimate acoustics were perfect for
the piece, and the performance was led with quiet strength by first violin
Philip Dukes, who used portamento judiciously and often. Then came Frank
Bridge's exquisite 1908 Suite for Strings, conducted by Hazlewood in bare
feet (several of the players went similarly and seasonally unshod, and one
of the girls seemed to have forgotten to put on her dress). There was a
different lighting plan for each of the four movements. The third of these,
a deeply touching Nocturne, was beautifully brought off. The finale was
slightly warped by wrong intonation.
Philip Dukes impressively switched to viola to play the solo part in
Britten's 1976 orchestration for strings of his ruminative, astringent
Lachrymae on a song by Dowland (1950), and played it superbly. As his
all-important violin contributions to The Soldier's Tale confirmed, he is a
wonderful natural musician. The world premiere planned for this evening
having been postponed, we were left with the Stravinsky, about which Mr
Hazlewood's chat told us much of interest but not who had devised the slick
rhyming doggerel couplets of this English translation. The seven-piece band
sounded keen and fresh, and the actors were spirited if under-rehearsed.
They lived dangerously - the absence of a dancer-Princess towards the end of
the work had the honey-voiced narrator Samuel West hopelessly fumbling to
fill the gap; but a bit of dangerous living is what Eos is all about.

FT  01 JUL 92 / People: Line-up to review pensions law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The presence of Professor Tony Atkinson, architect of the Labour party's
controversial tax plans, and Alastair Ross-Goobey, a former adviser to
Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, on the government's
newly-established Pensions Law Review Committee should ensure that it is not
unduly influenced by the powerful pension industry lobby.
Atkinson, of the London School of Economics, an acknowledged expert on
income and wealth distribution, and Ross-Goobey, chief investment strategist
at stockbrokers James Capel, are among the nine new members of the committee
which has been set up to examine the administration and regulation of
pension schemes in the wake of the abuses thrown up by the Maxwell affair.
The appointment of Sue Ward, a freelance journalist and former TUC expert on
pensions policy, to the committee is a further sign that the government
wants to get as wide a range of opinions as possible before it drafts any
new pensions legislation.
The other members of the committee, chaired by Roy Goode, professor of
English Law at Oxford, are: David Berridge, Scottish Equitable Life's chief
executive; Harvie Brown of William Mercer Fraser; Bryan Hines, a former
general manager, insurance and investments at ICI; Stuart James, a partner
of Rowe and Maw; Terence Libby, chairman of Morrisflex; and Patricia Triggs,
a partner in KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock.
The committee, set up on June 8, will report within 12 months.
Its terms of reference are: 'To review the framework of law and regulation
within which occupational pension schemes operate, taking into account the
rights and interests of scheme members, pensioners and employers; to
consider in particular the status and ownership of occupational pension
funds and the accountability and roles of trustees, fund managers, auditors,
and pension scheme advisers; and to make recommendations.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / People: A nuclear grasp of options pricing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Street (left), who holds a DPhil in theoretical nuclear physics from
Oxford University, is later this month joining Mitsubishi Finance
International as director and head of equity and commodity risk management.
Street, who was previously with Nomura International, heading equity
derivatives training, says his work on a neutron's path through the core of
a nuclear reactor is indeed a valuable aid to grasping options pricing
theory.
Mitsubishi Finance International, with noted derivatives academic Desmond
Fitzgerald as head of arbitrage, has been a leader in developing exotic
derivatives products such as average rate warrants and look-back options.
Street, in turn, has worked with Fitzgerald on a number of projects over the
past five years.
'I have been brought in to Mitsubishi to run the desk on a day-to-day basis,
leaving Desmond more time for the 'big picture' strategic view. He is wasted
on the desk,' says Street.
His reasons for leaving Nomura after 15 months?
'As a securities house, Nomura has not been a credit intermediary,' he
points out. By contrast Mitsubishi, as the sixth largest bank in the world,
can inhabit a strong position in a market where creditworthiness and a hefty
balance sheet is crucial.

FT  01 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Mareva extension for fresh claim
</HEADLINE>

AIGLON LTD AND ANOTHER v GAU SHAN &amp; CO LTD
GAU SHAN &amp; CO LTD v AIGLON LTD AND OTHERS
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: June 23 1992
A MAREVA injunction which would have been discharged as against one of two
associated companies on grounds of non-arguability of the claim on which it
was based may be extended as a result of a post-argument amendment to the
claim of the party in whose favour it was made, if the amendment raises a
fresh claim which is arguable, and which is so inextricably interlinked with
the original case against the other company that in the interests of justice
it should be heard.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when granting an application by Gau Shan Ltd to
extend a Mareva injunction and ancillary order obtained by it against
L'Aiglon SA ('SA') in respect of an arbitration award against SA and its
associated company, Aiglon Ltd ('Ltd').
HIS LORDSHIP said the litigation comprised two actions arising out of an
award by the Technical Appeal Committee of the Liverpool Cotton Association
in favour of Gau Shan against Ltd and SA, a Swiss company.
On May 1 1992 Mr Justice Gatehouse granted applications against Ltd and SA
for worldwide Mareva injunctions and orders for disclosure of worldwide
assets.
At that stage the sole substantive claim on which the injunction against SA
was based was Gau Shan's counterclaim for leave under section 26 of the
Arbitration Act 1950 to enforce the award in the same manner as a judgment.
On a previous application to the present court SA applied to set aside the
Mareva and disclosure orders as against it.
Judgment was given on June 10 (FT, June 26 1992). The conclusion was that
Gau Shan had no good arguable case against SA for an order under section 26.
On that footing the court was prepared to discharge the Mareva and ancillary
orders against SA.
One of the grounds on which that conclusion was based was that the evidence
then before the court failed to substantiate a good arguable case that SA
was party to the contract of sale on which the arbitrators' jurisdiction was
founded.
Gau Shan now applied to extend the Mareva and ancillary order on entirely
fresh grounds, including a claim against SA under section 423 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 first put forward in an amendment to the counterclaim on
June 1, and a possible claim under section 238 by liquidators of Ltd.
Mr Colman for SA made it clear that he was not able, at present, to dispute
that there was a good arguable case on the merits of those two contentions.
However, he counter-applied to strike out the amendment.
Section 423(2) of the 1986 Act provided that where a person entered into a
transaction at an undervalue, the court might make an order 'restoring the
position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into'.
By 423(3) the court should only make such an order if satisfied that the
transaction was entered into for the purpose '(a) of putting assets beyond
the reach of a person who is making, or may at some time make, a claim
against him'.
Evidence sworn on behalf of SA was directed to showing that as part of an
allegedly legitimate tax avoidance scheme, Ltd had stripped itself of its
assets, partly by transfers to an Irish company of the same name, and partly
by payments of management fees and commission to SA.
Mr Falconer for Gau Shan submitted that the evidence demonstrated a strong
case showing Ltd had entered into a transaction with SA offending against
section 423, in that assets were put out of Gau Shan's reach, apparently at
an undervalue, by transfers to SA at a time when the arbitration award had
been made. He said that ground alone substantiated continuation of the
Mareva and the order, there being no contest from SA to Gau Shan's case on
the risk of dissipation of assets.
Those submissions were accepted. Even if SA's explanation of the
asset-stripping exercise was sound, it by no means followed that the purpose
of the transaction was not the section 423 purpose.
Section 238 of the Act provided that the liquidator of a company might apply
to the court to restore the position where the company had entered into a
transaction at an undervalue.
Mr Falconer submitted that since Ltd was now a shell company, it would be
insolvent if Gau Shan were entitled to enforce the award against it. As a
result a liquidator could apply for an order under section 238. He submitted
the court had jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction against a third
party such as SA, as ancillary to the relief sought against Ltd under
section 238 (TSB v Chabra (1992) 1 WLR 231, 242).
A good arguable case was established, on the footing that there was credible
evidence that SA's assets might in part be the assets of Ltd which had, as a
result of the asset-stripping operation, put it out of its power to meet the
arbitration award - so that an injunction against Ltd alone was likely to be
inadequate to protect Gau Shan.
Those conclusions provided a firm basis for continuing the Mareva, subject
to the court's overriding discretion - and subject to Mr Colman's striking
out application.
Mr Colman submitted first that the amendment was an abuse of process in that
it was made between time of argument in May, and time of judgment; and that
it fundamentally altered the position to the unfair detriment of SA, since
it had no relationship to SA's attack on the award as having been made
without jurisdiction.
The flaw in that argument was that it ignored the original case against Ltd,
which included a section 423 claim. Irrespective of the failure of the
original section 26 application, Gau Shan would have had a cast iron case
for joining SA as an additional defendant under RSC Order 11 rule 1(1)(c),
on the ground that it was a necessary and proper party. The court would
inevitably have had regard to the fact that the section 423 claims against
Ltd and SA were inextricably interlinked and in the interests of justice
should be heard together.
The amendment did not involve abuse of process.
Second, Mr Colman submitted that the amendment should be struck out under
Order 28 rule 7, in that 'the subject matter of a counterclaim ought to be
disposed of by separate action'.
There was a significant connection between the amendment and SA's original
claim, seeing that Gau Shan's subsequent efforts to enforce the award were
directly connected with the arbitration. The amendment ought not to be
disposed of by separate action.
Third, Mr Colman submitted that having regard to the Lugano Convention 1988
the proceedings against SA on the amended counterclaim should be brought in
the Swiss courts as the forum conveniens.
Switzerland and the UK were contracting states to the Convention, which was
implemented by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1991. Article 6(1)
provided that a person domiciled in a contracting state might be sued '(1)
where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where
any one of them is domiciled'.
Article 6(1) gave the plaintiff an unfettered right of choice.
It followed it was not open to Mr Colman to invoke the forum non conveniens
doctrine. Even if the court had reached a contrary conclusion on principle,
it would not have accepted his submission as to appropriate forum.
There were no grounds for striking out the amendment.
The worldwide injunction against SA was fully justified. Part of the
asset-stripping operation was the allegedly improper payment of excessive
management fees and commissions to SA in Geneva. The case for a worldwide
Mareva against SA was every bit as strong as that against Ltd.
The worldwide Mareva injunction and associated order would be continued
against SA.
For SA: Anthony Colman QC and Graham Dunning (Weightman Rutherfords,
Liverpool).
For Gau Shan: Charles Falconer QC and Alastair MacGregor (Middleton Potts).

FT  01 JUL 92 / People: Sir John Banham moves in as ECI chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Venture capital firms are always impressing on the companies in which they
invest the value to be gained from taking on non-executive directors. Few
follow their own advice.
ECI Ventures has taken a leap ahead of the pack with the appointment of Sir
John Banham, until yesterday director general of the Confederation of
British Industry, as non-executive chairman.
He adds the ECI appointment to the five other directorships already under
his belt but since none of these comes with an office he will be moving into
ECI's premises on the north side of Waterloo Bridge.
Sir John, who is 52, has had no previous direct involvement with the venture
capital industry, according to ECI managing director David Wansbrough. But
in his five years at the CBI the organisation did take up the cause of local
venture capital funds which were to be known as Local Investment Companies.
The CBI lobbied, unsuccessfully, for tax breaks to allow the creation of
such companies.
ECI is one of the veterans of the UK venture capital industry and now
comprises 11 partners; it was set up in 1976 as Equity Capital for Industry
to finance small listed companies, particularly those in difficulties, but
since 1980 it has shifted to providing finance for unlisted companies and
now manages four funds with assets of about Pounds 170m.
ECI does not expect to need to raise new funds for a year or so but having
Sir John on its letterhead will do it no harm, with UK investors at least.
Sir John's business skills will be especially welcome in an industry which
has not distinguished itself by its ability to market its services.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Jobs: Where to find future company leaders - The scrapping
of whole layers of management leaves less room for top talent to show itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the numerous prized qualities possessed by Jobs column readers, it
seems, not the least is an unusually long memory. Take for instance the
antiquated pop song, 'How do you speak to an angel?', cited here four weeks
ago. No fewer than 29 of you claimed to recall same - over half identifying
it, I think correctly, with Dean Martin in the early 1950s - including a
civil servant who sort of sang the whole thing over the telephone.
Nevertheless I doubt that as many of you can come up with the goods on
today's test, even though the quotation which needs to be identified is a
good dozen years more recent. It goes:
The most intangible and yet by far the most important factor in improving
industrial efficiency is the quality of industrial management. There is now
a growing interest in management education, and it is expected that in the
next few years the increased quantity and quality of management education of
all kinds will be making an important contribution.
The source, in fact, is Britain's one and only National Plan, published in
September 1965. And my reason for recalling it is that now, after nigh on 27
years, there appears to be a possibility that one of the assumptions buried
in it may at last prove justified.
Even so, there is no shame in failing to remember the plan as originally
formulated, because besides being a unique exercise it was an extremely
short-lived one. Just about the only aspect of it that remains at all
contentious is why the British security services were sent to comb London
for a pre-publication copy which went missing just before the launch.
(Certain government officials of the day allege that the Jobs column's
esteemed colleague Samuel Brittan, who advised on the plan, left the said
copy on a bus; Sam himself dismisses such claims, saying he only thought
he'd left it on a bus.)
By contrast, almost everything planned in the plan was swiftly and
conclusively decided by events, in the adverse direction.
Perhaps the prime example is referred to in my quotation. For the thing to
which management education was officially expected to contribute was a
projected average growth in national output of around 4 per cent a year.
Indeed such was the planners' faith in management education that, if I
remember aright, they expected it alone to generate an eighth of the
envisaged growth rate. And while the quotation talks of all kinds of
management education, the faith was mainly invested in one sort: the
master's-degree courses then being set up, particularly in the specialist
university business schools at London and Manchester. The expectation was
that the Masters of Business Administration and such produced by those
courses, would soon take over the topmost tiers of British management.
The fact that they largely haven't done so vindicates the few sceptics of
the time. Their argument was that the executives already in post, while
perhaps ignorant about Bayesian decision-trees and the like, had certainly
gained political skills in fighting their way up the promotional ladder.
They would therefore find ways of stopping the MBAs from being inserted
above them.
But although the past quarter century has seen the sceptical view prevail,
the last three or four years have brought changes that could well
countermand it. With organisations scrapping whole tiers of management,
there are not only far fewer people in middle-rank blocking positions, but
often no longer enough lower rungs on the ladder for it to provide adequate
training for work on the highest perches. So where are the future
big-company leaders to come from?
Well - while the answer given by some observers of the British scene goes
'Eton, Winchester . . . and Oxford, of course' - the majority of senior
managers and headhunters I've sounded are less cynical. They're more
inclined to think MBA courses may at last come into their own, despite the
bad effects of importing earmarked 'crown princes' on the motivation of
other employees.
There is, however, at least one exception in the headhunting field who
maintains there is no need for companies to court such dangers. He is
psychologist Rob Irving of the Whitehead Mann consultancy in London, who
besides having tested some 2,000 managers of all ranks over the past six
years, has made a special study of 300 senior executives ranging upwards
from functional directors of subsidiary companies to group chief executives.
As a result, he believes that far from having to recruit outside, all
companies need do to find their future leaders is look searchingly at those
working in their more junior ranks. For the traits making for success at the
heights are identifiable by the time people are in their late 20s.
Moreover, when it comes to intellectual skills such as verbal and numerical
reasoning, the 300 proven performers' test scores cast doubt on the
relevance of the MBA qualification to practical company leadership. While
they resembled the generality of managers in scoring in the top 15-10 per
cent of the population, they did not show the still more rarefied
intellectual cast of mind associated with academic degrees at master's
level.
Where the 300 do differ from managers in the large sense is in personality.
They are somewhat more extraverted than pure chance would predict and, at
the very highest rank, considerably more intuitive and visionary. But their
most marked differences are in three particular areas.
First, they have a voracious need for power. 'In a group of managers picked
at random, they'd stand out as domineering,' Rob Irving says. 'It's not just
that they like taking charge; it's that, try as they might, they couldn't do
otherwise.'
Second, they are avid for personal achievement, not only having extremely
high aims, but being tireless and ruthlessly competitive in pursuing same.
Their third big distinguishing mark is a propensity for planning ahead in
the sense of making a firm decision as to what is going to happen, and
getting others to bring it into being. Typically, too, they find calculated
risk-taking attractive, whereas the bulk of managers are averse from it.
True, the picture emerging from the study is something less than humanly
appealing. But that's not the point, Rob Irving says. As things are, people
of the sort portrayed seem to be the best at heading big companies, which in
turn are essential to modern economies. So if the rest of us want to prosper
materially, we'll just have to grin and bear it.
NOW to a job offered by Greek headhunter John Piperoglou of the Stedima
consultancy on behalf of one of his country's banks. As he may not name it,
he promises to abide by applicants' requests not to be identified to his
client at this stage.
Being about to open an office in London, the bank wants someone to run and
build it swiftly into a fully fledged branch, with emphasis on private
banking and portfolio management, and currency and other asset dealing.
Besides familiarity with same, candidates need success in managing and

FT  01 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Company reports leave vital
queries unanswered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPANIES will probably have to be forced by law to report fully on their
environmental performances if they are to be made environmentally
accountable, according to a study of annual accounts released today.
Companies increasingly include environmental matters in the annual report,
say authors Peter Kirkman and Chris Hope of Cambridge University, who
analysed 237 UK company reports.
Most, however, tend to focus on positive activities which have public
relations value and they fail to provide substantial information.
Large companies were the most likely to disclose environmental information
(54 per cent), compared with 23 per cent of medium-sized companies and only
nine per cent of unlisted companies.
Large companies also provided a broader range of information. There was
little difference between company reporting in different industry sectors.
Most of the environmental information provided was partial and selective -
with few numbers provided - and many companies did not give any evidence to
substantiate their claim of being environmentally responsible.
For some companies, environmental reporting amounted simply to the fact that
the company report was printed on environmentally friendly paper.
ICI was the only company to say in its accounts exactly how much it had
actually spent on the environment: Pounds 350m.
Only four companies voluntarily disclosed 'bad news' about their
environmental performance, with ICI and Thames Water, for example, reporting
that they were being prosecuted for environmental offences.
Pressure from institutional investors and other initiatives to encourage
'green reporting' would most likely need to be backed by legislation, the
study says, with a compulsory independent audit to ensure accurate
disclosure.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Green fashion dulls edge of
German chemical industry - Paul Abrahams asks whether the big three are
crying wolf or justly grieved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's chemicals companies have seen off legions of foreign competitors
since the Second World War. Now they are facing an internal challenge from
green politics that threatens their prime position.
The three chemicals giants BASF, Bayer and Hoechst claim that the cost of
domestic environmental legislation threatens to cripple the industry by
reducing competitiveness.
The chairmen's protests are part of a wider battle waged by German
companies. German industrialists are struggling to contain costs of all
kinds.
Dr Jurgen Strube, chairman of BASF, warns: 'Given rising costs for
environmental protection purposes, high personnel expenditure, and a
continual decrease in working hours, we run the risk of forfeiting our
position in international competition'.
Mr Strube, with his counterparts at Bayer and Hoechst, has conducted a
carefully co-ordinated protest against the German government's planned
environmental legislation. Are the chairmen crying wolf, or is the industry,
a cornerstone of the German post-war economic miracle, really under threat?
The proposed legislation includes:
A charge next year of DM200 on each tonne of hazardous waste produced. Dr
Frank Schendel, head of environmental policy at Bayer, says that preventing
its introduction is the industry's first priority.
A levy on carbon dioxide emissions which may cost the industry as much as
DM500m a year, according to Bayer. That would be much higher than the carbon
tax currently proposed by the European Commission.
A solid waste charge on non-hazardous by-products used in land fills. That
could add DM80m a year to BASF's costs and DM290m to Bayer's.
At the best of times the impact of such charges would be significant. These
are the worst of times. The German economy, burdened by the costs of
reunification, is slowing down. Chemicals companies face falling demand and
struggle to maintain prices.
All three groups reported a fall in first quarter profits this year. At
Hoechst, profits fell 24 per cent, at BASF 25 per cent. Even at Bayer,
protected by its pharmaceuticals business, profits slipped 8 per cent. For
the first time in a decade, dividends at both Hoechst and BASF were cut. The
outlook remains gloomy. Dr Strube warned that there were few indications of
a quick recovery. Hoechst's chairman, Mr Wolfgang Hilger cautioned that 1992
would be a difficult year.
Dr Jurgen Dormann, Hoechst's finance director, says 'The good results of the
last few years perhaps gave the wrong signals to the politicians who thought
we could always afford the measures they threw at us. But we can't'.
The German groups argue they have already cleaned up their act considerably.
BASF says it has reduced its effluent load into the Rhine by 95 per cent
since 1973. Air emissions are down between 80 and 85 per cent during the
same period.
Such improvements do not come cheap. BASF spent DM500m between 1988 and 1992
on capital projects to reduce pollution, according to Dr Wolfgang Jentzsch,
BASF deputy chairman. The group plans to spend DM900m between 1990 and 1994
on environmental capital projects, while between 1992 and 1996 it will spend
as much as DM1.6bn.
The cost of environmental protection does not end with the initial capital
investment, the groups argue. BASF reckons that, for each D-mark it spends
on environmental capital projects, 40 pfennigs are added to running costs.
Operating costs generated by environmental measures in Germany alone reached
DM1.07bn last year; equivalent to 5.2 per cent of sales. Pre-tax profits in
Germany during the same period were only DM1.49bn.
Bayer reckons that the cost of running environmentally related plant in
Germany has doubled in six years and is now equivalent to 8 per cent of
sales. Mr Hermann Strenger, Bayer's chairman, estimates it needs to spend
DM1.9bn on environmentally related capital projects during the next five
years.
Such expenditure on the environment is much greater than that of foreign
chemical groups, the trio insists. Imperial Chemical Industries, the British
group, spends 2.8 per cent of its turnover on environmental protection.
The groups question the motivation behind further legislation. They argue
the levies are prompted more by political considerations than by a desire to
reduce pollution. They suspect politicians have found a popular source of
raising income and easing constraints on federal government budgets.
They argue too that the levies would be ineffective. Politicians have failed
to understand the economics of pollution control, says Dr Jentzsch. 'There
comes a point when its costs DM100 to reduce pollution 90 per cent. But for
the next 5 per cent, it costs another DM100m. That is not a sensible use of
resources.'
If the proposed measures are implemented, the German chemicals companies may
have to switch more investment abroad, warns Mr Hermann Strenger, Bayer's
outgoing chairman. High environmental costs and delays caused by pressure
groups have already forced the trio to invest outside Germany.
Mr Strenger is now calling for a consolidation phase. That appeal has some
merit, according to industry analysts in Germany and overseas. German groups
do tend to spend more on the environment than their competitors.
Such a disadvantage would clearly be increased by the added burden of the
proposed environmental legislation. Claims however by group chairmen that
the German chemicals industry's trade surplus of about DM35bn could be wiped
out are exaggerated.
The German industry can minimise the impact of rising environmental costs by
cost-cutting measures; a strategy in which the German chemicals companies
lag behind their European counterparts.
When groups such as ICI and Akzo of the Netherlands recognised recession two
years ago, they launched cost-cutting programmes. The Germans reacted
sluggishly. Costs per employee at all three groups remain far higher than at
ICI, according to Mr Alasdair Nisbet, chemicals analyst at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew: 'If one takes two similar groups like ICI and Bayer, on every form of
analysis, the German company is less productive than the British.'
The German companies now have little choice but to grasp the nettle of
restructuring. Ironically, the end result may be to make them even more
formidable competitors on the international stage.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Management: Cutting HQ down to size - Andrew Jack looks at a
new trend towards hiving off specialist work functions to outsiders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a tense meeting in Cleveland, Ohio next week, four consulting firms will
put their case for taking over an important headquarters function of BP: the
preparation and submission of all state and federal tax returns for the
group's US operations.
The contract - which should be awarded by the end of this month - will be
the latest in a series of such moves by the hard-pressed oil company in
recent months. On both side of the Atlantic, these are contributing heavily
to BP's ability to cut sharply and repeatedly the size of its various head
offices - divisional, regional, and corporate.
The contract also represents part of a new trend throughout industry of
handing to outside contractors the operation of functions that are not part
of a company's core business. The idea of 'contracting out', or facilities
management, is not new. Catering, cleaning, transport, internal mail and
security have long been managed externally. One recent estimate put the size
of the existing UK market at Pounds 4bn a year, dominated by giant business
services companies such as BET.
But in the last few years, a new type of function has begun to be awarded to
a new breed of outside contractors, which is often labelled 'outsourcing'.
It involves a different kind of contract, covering much higher-level
headquarters functions such as computing and accounting services. It rests
on the doctrine propounded by consultants and business school academics in
the last few years that companies should concentrate on their 'core
competencies', while leaving other functions to specialist contractors.
David Andrews, head of financial markets at Andersen Consulting in London,
draws a clear distinction between two types of contracting out. The first -
the old-fashioned facilities management function - is at what he calls the
commodity-end of the business. 'The tasks are simple, well defined, and
choice is based on price,' he says.
The second, on which Andersen Consulting is concentrating, has emerged
during the last five years. It involves, says Andrews, contracts based less
on price than a range of more intangible benefits, with a strong continuing
relationship between the client and contractor.
Andrews stresses that some functions - particularly policy and
decision-making - will always remain with senior internal management. But
many others can be hived off. He says the litmus test is that management
remains in control of the product or service it is delivering to customers,
and not whether it controls the resources which contribute to that
end-product.
Peter Falconer, an associate director of Hoskyns Group, a consultancy which
specialises in information technology work, is rather more sceptical about
the labels being attached to the trend.
'The definitions have been over-complicated by marketing people,' he says.
He classifies contracting-out as the day-to-day management of service
functions by an independent company, while facilities management
encapsulates a wider range of projects to bring about change for a client.
He says that outsourcing is merely an American phrase for contracting-out.
Whatever the concept is called, there is no question that there is growing
demand for more sophisticated, higher-level functions to be handed to
outside contractors, albeit with a close level of supervision. 'Two years
ago it was difficult to find a financial organisation willing to even
contemplate outsourcing its services,' says Falconer. 'Today they are the
most active.'
The attractions can often include substantial cost savings. But they also
include the benefits of economies of scale, as well as intangibles such as
the expertise that a specialist contractor can bring, and the ability to
release management time for more important issues.
In April, the International Stock Exchange in London appointed Andersen
Consulting on a five-year contract, believed to be worth more than Pounds
60m. It has taken over operation of the computer systems, and brought 305
staff onto its own payroll. A further 30 were made redundant. Over five
years, it expects to reduce its IT costs by 40 per cent.
Jane Barker, finance director at the exchange, says management recognised
that its systems were becoming elderly and increasingly difficult and costly
to maintain. 'We knew we had to do something and to do something quite
fast.'
Barker says that outsourcing has enabled the exchange to focus on its core
purpose, which is running and regulating the market. Andersen has brought in
the skills to bring about change in the operations needed to achieve that
end.
While most outsourcing has been focused on the operations and management of
information technology, it is also now spreading into other headquarters'
functions. Last June, BP Exploration (Europe), now based in Glasgow but
scheduled to move to Aberdeen, announced that its accounting services would
be handed to Andersen Consulting on an initial four-year contract.
Since then, 300 people have been transferred to a special Andersen centre in
Aberdeen. A further 60 were offered severance payments, and now some new
employees have been recruited. Colin Goodall, chief of staff and general
manager for business support, will only say that the savings negotiated will
be more than 20 per cent in the department, which had a budget of Pounds 13m
before the contract began.
He says the oil industry has had a long tradition of contracting out
services. But the need to reduce costs even in headquarters has been
triggered recently by the stable price of crude oil, and disappointing
corporate results. 'Outsourcing is part of our drive to reduce costs and
improve efficiencies,' he says.
'Many of the savings not were not immediately apparent,' he says. 'We are
increasingly recognising intangible benefits that we could not quantify. We
are adding value as well as reducing cost.'
In London, BP's corporate headquarters has also begun to apply more of the
lessons of outsourcing. Two years ago, most of its IT work was contracted
out.
Its corporate tax work has just been contracted to Price Waterhouse, which
will assume responsibility for 19 of its existing 22 staff in July. BP
continues to make important decisions on the tax returns once they are
prepared.
Aside from the preparation of federal and state taxes for its US operations,
BP is also considering outsourcing its petroleum revenue tax work in the UK,
and some personal tax work for its expatriate staff.
Peter Hobbs, head of tax, says one of the main difficulties about
introducing outsourcing was persuading his own management that it would not
be compromised by allowing sensitive material to be handled by those outside
the organisation.
He says that the issues of confidentiality and staff sensitivity were among
the most testing during the initial negotiations. 'Outsourcing is not a
popular thing at any level. A lot of time needs to be spent trying to win
over the staff.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / Management: Food for thought on the vexed question of sugar
 -Dr Michael McGannon says an inadequate diet can hamper your ability to
take decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The human brain is acutely sensitive to all substances that pass through it.
The quality of the food you eat will be reflected in the working of your
brain. If it is to function well, the brain needs a regular supply of
nutrients and vitamins. A diet which is inadequate can hamper your ability
to make critical decisions and colour your judgment about people around you.
After eating some foods you feel energetic and lucid, and life seems good.
On other days, you seem to be dragging your body and mind around with you.
Is it the menopause? Or have the electromagnetic fields gone awry? The
chances are you have eaten inferior food and your brain is letting you know.
There are biochemical explanations for this 'food-to-mood' phenomenon:
indeed scientific findings increasingly support a link between full blown
psychiatric disorders and inadequate food.
However most people do not know how to feed their brain. When asked to name
the most common brain stimulants, managers tend to point to caffeine or
nicotine (younger, racier ones may mention cocaine). However by far the most
widely used stimulant is, of course, sugar.
Sugar or glucose is the body's energy currency. The brain has a voracious
appetite for sugar, and even though the organ accounts for only 3-4 per cent
of the body's weight, it can consume up to 30 per cent of its body sugar.
Unlike other organs, the brain cannot convert other foods, such as fats and
proteins, to glucose when supplies run low. To keep the brain happy, the
body orchestrates all its efforts to deliver the proper level of glucose to
the brain. The entire body is geared to the survival of the brain.
The brain can get its energy supply from simple sugars (choose fruits and
honey over refined table sugar) and from complex sugars (starchy foods like
rice, potatoes, pasta and grains). It can also get energy from glycogen,
stored in the liver.
In the healthy body, a certain level of blood glucose will stimulate the
secretion of insulin by the pancreas. Insulin makes possible the shuttling
of glucose into the body's cells including those of the brain, for
generating energy.
The problem comes when you eat too much refined sugar, stripped of its
essential nutrients and vitamins. Large quantities eventually overwhelm the
body's ability to react smoothly by producing insulin. Instead the pancreas
overreacts by secreting excess insulin, violently driving the glucose level
below that consistent with proper functioning of the brain, causing a
condition known as hypoglycaemia.
Once the brain senses that its primary fuel is running low, it panics and
sends out shock waves to all systems.
These distress signals are immediately reflected in anxiety, depression,
poor concentration and loss of memory. Then the heart rate quickens,
sweating begins, you become tired and suffer headaches. If the hypoglycaemia
is severe enough it can lead to loss of consciousness.
The only natural response is to get more refined sugar into the system
quickly. This will instantly make you feel better, but by the time you get
home, you will be exhausted and anxious. A well-balance meal and a few hours
sleep will not be enough to get you right again.
A longer-term strategy is needed. You should:
Develop a healthy fear of refined table sugar and sweets. Stay away from
soft drinks, coffee, canned vegetables, salad dressings and breakfast
cereals.
Eat yoghurt, fresh fruit and unsalted nuts to provide your high-energy fuel.
Take part in decisions about what is served in your office cafeteria or
dining room. Pay attention to the sugar bombs that are served at meetings
and conferences.
Opt for fruit juices instead of sweetened caffeinated drinks or colas.
Convert your coffee break into an 'energy break'.
At a time when businesses are spending millions to improve performance, a
little maintenance of the company's most valued resource, the decision
maker's brain, would seem a wise investment.

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
COUNTRIES hoping to join the European Community remain confident their
applications will not be disrupted by the imbroglio caused by the Danish
'no' vote.
Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland have already applied for
membership. Norway is expected to apply by the end of the year.
The decision to delay official negotiations until after ratification of the
Maastricht treaty will not stop preparations for entry taking place under
the British presidency. Britain will press for better economic treatment of
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey to sugar the pill of temporary rejection of their
applications.
Clearly, further delays to Maastricht ratification would have great
potential to hold up enlargement talks. Additionally, there is unease that
scepticism about the EC in countries such as Germany will spread among the
electorates of the Nordic and Alpine countries.
These countries see full membership as a natural progression from the
greater economic links they are due to forge under the European Economic
Area free trade zone between the EC and the European Free Trade Association
due to start on January 1.
The five Efta countries would all bring political stability to the EC
'club'. Their per capita gross national products are all equal or superior
to that of united Germany. Most can even calculate their net balances in the
EC budget; Austria, Sweden and Finland together will pay Ecu3bn (Pounds
2.1bn) more to Brussels than they get back.
Despite these prospective members' wealth, negotiating exclusions from EC
rules in areas such as agriculture will in some cases pose problems.
Difficulties are likely in adjusting countries' laws not simply to the
demands of the Treaty of Rome but also to the Treaty of Maastricht. 'If it
weren't for Maastricht, things would be a lot more simple,' says - with
understatement - a pro-EC Swiss diplomat.
In particular, most Efta applicants will have to adapt traditional policies
of neutrality to the need to participate in a common EC foreign and security
policy.
The Swiss, throwing off their traditional aversion to greater European
openness, seem less fearful about the consequences of EC membership than
other Efta countries.
The Swiss government has recently been dropping hints - as have the Swedes -
of willingness to participate in some form of common European defence
policy.
A Swiss poll in May indicated that 61 per cent favoured joining the EC while
only 27 per cent were opposed and 12 per cent undecided.
The Danish 'no' vote may even have been a blessing in disguise for pro-EC
forces in Switzerland. The EC has responded to the Danish vote with an
attempt to intensify 'subsidiarity', heartening the many Swiss advocates of
a decentralised community.
Not only the Swiss but all have to submit their EC applications to national
referendums. The question is whether a time of slower economic growth across
Europe makes voters more or less ready to accept change.
Worries about the effects of EC membership are apparent in most applicant
countries. Since the Danish vote public opinion has been moving against the
EC in the Nordic region. The 'no' campaigners claim the EC will undermine
their countries' democracies, weaken their generous welfare systems, and -
in the case of Sweden and Finland - draw them into a western military
alliance.
Across the Efta area, there are strong signs that the enthusiasm for EC
membership among the political parties and business elite is not fully
shared by the people. In Norway, where scepticism is particularly strong,
the latest opinion poll showed that 53 per cent of respondents were against
EC membership, and only 33 per cent were in favour. In Sweden the political
consensus on EC entry - forged last year - is still holding.
But Swedish opinion seems to be growing in favour of an early referendum on
EC entry. Surveys show misgivings coming to the surface. Only a few months
ago, polls indicated that more than 60 per cent of Swedes backed membership.
But a recent survey found that only 31 per cent supported Swedish entry, 36
per cent said they were definitely or probably against the idea, and 33 per
cent were undecided.
EC doubts are also noticeable in Austria. The country's main parties and
business groups, which - like those in Sweden - hope to join in 1995, see
Austria as a de facto EC member in the economic field.
Political leaders are increasingly willing to modify or even dump the policy
of neutrality. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky has repeatedly stated his
government's support for Maastricht, including the common foreign and
security policy. However, surveys show 80 per cent of the population would
rather forgo EC membership than abandon neutrality.
Even though Austrian supporters of Community membership outweigh the
Euro-sceptics, the margin is narrowing. In May, the ratio was 51-to-41.
Austrians seem suspicious of the Brussels bureaucracy and of further
dominance of German businesses. They want to preserve the country's strict
environmental and consumer-protection laws.
While the two largest Austrian parties are clearly pro-EC, the leftist
Greens have only recently abandoned their strict anti-Community stance for a
somewhat more flexible position. Mr Jorg Haider of the right-wing Freedom
party was previously one of the most ardent supporters of EC membership. But
he has become critical since the Danish referendum, and observers expect him
to campaign against the EC if he feels the popular mood is moving that way.
Efta governments will be doing their best to dampen the potential of
populists like Mr Haider. But uncertainty about the future of the EC may
allow such figures - and the negative message they carry - to proliferate.

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
THOSE who recall Mrs Margaret Thatcher's table thumping tactics over the EC
budget in the early 1980s will be in no doubt that, when the Community falls
out about money, nothing much else gets done.
That is the prospect facing the UK presidency. After the 12 failed at last
week's Lisbon summit to agree a compromise budget to succeed the 1988-92
finance package, the British presidency will be dominated by the need to
bring in a deal at the Edinburgh summit in December.
On top of this, of course, will be the presidency's duty to create a climate
conducive to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But conflicts over
money could sour public attitudes in countries from Germany to Spain.
A veteran German negotiator of EC finance packages said even before the
Danish referendum he had never seen such an uproar in the press on the
financing. 'For the first time politicians are going to have to take public
opinion into account; this is new in European affairs.'
The 'Delors II' package presented by the European Commission to the Twelve
is not just a budget, but the financial framework within which Brussels
thinks the political and economic integration agreed at Maastricht will
work.
The 1988 'Delors I' package, agreed in more prosperous times, sets the
precedent. It started a momentum which enabled the EC to advance further in
four years than in nearly four decades - towards the Single Market, and to
the Maastricht treaty.
To consolidate this, the Commission wants an increase of nearly a third in
EC revenues, from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47bn) this year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997 at
today's prices. Half the increase would go towards 'cohesion' or fiscal
transfers to help poorer states catch up, at a time when the stringent
financial targets for monetary union are forcing them to tighten public
spending.
The rest of the rise would underpin the common foreign and security policy
agreed at Maastricht; finance the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) agreed in May; and boost spending on research and training to sharpen
European industrial competitiveness.
All members want CAP reform, and firmer prices in commodity markets mean it
can probably now be financed without increasing the farm budget ceilings
fixed by Delors I. Joint spending on foreign aid and policy, equally, is
uniformly regarded as good value for money which would have to be spent
anyway. These two items were informally ticked off at Lisbon.
But amounts for 'cohesion' are nowhere near being agreed. The Commission
wants to double the funding available to Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Greece. Only a promise at Maastricht to boost funding significantly
persuaded Spain to sign the treaty.
Redeeming this pledge is part of the bill for Maastricht, in the view of the
cohesion states, supported by the Commission and with some sympathy from
France. But the two main net contributors to the budget, Germany and the UK,
do not accept this means a doubling of aid.
They argue that there is no short-term need to raise the EC revenue ceiling,
from 1.2 per cent of combined gross national product now, to 1.37 per cent
in 1997, as Brussels proposes. This is because the current budget is well
under the ceiling, and economic growth over the next five years will
increase revenue automatically.
The UK says the Commission can get three-fifths or more of what it wants
with no change, and through savings on farm spending. British ministers also
point to the significant net contributions from early entry into the EC of
rich Nordic and Alpine countries.
German officials say the Delors package means an increase to Ecu105.5bn in
1997, based on Commission assumptions of 2.5 per cent economic growth and
4.5 per cent inflation a year. With these same assumptions, but no increase
in the revenue ceiling, 'you get to Ecu92.4bn anyway, a gap of only
Ecu13.1bn,' an official in Bonn says.
The British presidency will be handicapped in handling the budget as a
presidency cannot openly steer negotiations in favour of its own interests.
Germany, for instance, has said it wants the British budget rebate won by
Mrs Thatcher in 1984 - cumulatively worth Pounds 12.5bn - to be reduced. The
UK, otherwise allied with Bonn against the size of cohesion funding, says
the rebate is not to be touched.
In the end Chancellor Helmut Kohl is likely to compromise with Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, probably resulting in a significant
increase in aid. But these increases will put great fiscal strain on
countries like Italy and Belgium, which will have to contribute much more
than they do now.
Nevertheless British officials are confident they can square the money
circle by 'five minutes to midnight on the last day of the Edinburgh
summit'.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: Contradictory criteria for
membership of Club Emu
</HEADLINE>

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
THE SACRIFICES come now, the rewards later: only a select band of
'converged' countries will be allowed to join Europe's monetary union when,
and if, it occurs later this decade. But the convergence criteria for Emu
are proving painfully tough to meet. Most countries aspire to join, but few
currently make the grade.
The Maastricht treaty has set a high standard of economic rectitude against
which the performance of EC member states is now being judged. The
convergence criteria impose limits on acceptable inflation rates, long-term
interest rates, general government budget deficits and the stock of
outstanding public debt.
At first sight, the recent record of inflation convergence looks promising.
Progress towards nominal convergence within Europe is illustrated on the
left-hand chart. It shows Europe's progress since 1988, when this latest and
most serious attempt to establish a single European currency was born at
that year's EC summit in Hanover. Only those countries which pass both
inflation tests are located in the shaded box.
The number of qualifiers has increased from three to five since 1988. The UK
and Denmark have shown the most impressive shift from high to relatively low
inflation; but Italy, Spain and Portugal have made no progress towards
inflation convergence. The three missing countries, for whom no long bond
rates are available, currently have inflation rate differentials of 0.8 per
cent (Luxembourg), 5.8 per cent (Portugal) and 15.4 per cent (Greece).
The discipline of the European exchange rate mechanism is part of the reason
for this inflation convergence. Germany, the anchor country within the ERM,
was understandably unwilling to relinquish the D-Mark unless Germany's
single currency partners had first proved their commitment to low and stable
inflation.
Yet Europe's success is not all it seems. The average inflation rate of the
three lowest countries has increased from 1 per cent in 1988 to 2.7 per cent
today. Convergence has been as much about rising inflation in the low
inflation countries as falling inflation elsewhere. The most significant
deterioration has been the sharp rise in Germany's inflation rate since
unification in 1990.
While Europe's record on inflation convergence is good, if relative to an
upwardly mobile target, the fiscal policy performance has been almost
universally bad. The fiscal rules set absolute limits for permissible
deficits and debt ratios; but most EC member countries have been moving away
from this target range, as the right-hand chart shows.
Five EC member states would have passed both fiscal rules in 1988, with
Spain not far away. That number has now fallen to just two - Luxembourg and
France. Even these two countries have seen their fiscal deficits increase,
although not as dramatically as that of the UK. Ironically, Germany,
previously the most committed advocate of fiscal rectitude and critic of
Italian profligacy, now fails to pass the deficit test.
Only Ireland has bucked the trend and moved decisively towards fiscal
sobriety, although it still has some distance to travel. Of the other high
debt countries, Italy and Greece have staggered in the opposite direction.
Why has this general fiscal deterioration occurred? The economic strains
that German unification has imposed on the European economy is part of the
answer. Germany's rising fiscal deficit has forced up real interest rates
across Europe; while the accompanying inflationary pressures in Germany have
set a painfully high floor for short-term interest rates across the ERM.
The inevitable result of this prolonged period of tight monetary policy and
high real interest rates has been slow or no economic growth across Europe.
As usual when growth is slow and unemployment rising, governments have spent
more and collected fewer taxes: hence the growing fiscal deficits.
Yet German unification is not a good enough excuse. It may have made the
fiscal targets harder to meet, but it has made inflation convergence less
demanding, if only for the time being. The Bundesbank has proved its
determination to reduce German inflation to its previous levels; and even
after this long period of slow growth, most European countries, including
the UK and Ireland and France, still do not meet the 1988 inflation
criteria. Without German unification, they would have needed at least as
tight a monetary policy as they have currently have.
Reducing inflation to very low levels is costly and implies rising budget
deficits unless the government is also prepared to cut public spending. The
suspicion remains that, for many countries, the pursuit of low inflation may
be inconsistent with meeting the fiscal rules set out in the treaty, unless
the fiscal rules are fudged. The fiscal convergence criteria may eventually
be interpreted as aspirations rather than pre-conditions, or refer to
cyclically-adjusted rather than actual budget deficits.
Yet no country, especially the fiscally profligate, can rely on a lenient
hearing from their fellow members. If all four criteria are strictly
applied, only France and Luxembourg now qualify to join Club Emu. Even
Germany fails two of the four conditions - although Emu without Germany may
not be a club worth joining.
CONVERGENCE CRITERIA
INFLATION: a consumer price inflation rate within 1 1/2 points of the
average of the three lowest national rates;
INTEREST RATES: a long term interest rate within 2 points of the average
rate of these same three countries;
BUDGET DEFICITS AND DEBT: no 'excessive deficit', defined as a general
government budget deficit greater than 3 per cent of gross domestic product
or a ratio of gross public debt to GDP greater than 60 per cent  - unless
this debt ratio is falling 'at a satisfactory pace';
DEVALUATIONS: no devaluation within the ERM in the two years before joining
the monetary union.

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
THE REAL trouble for the British government may start the day after its EC
presidency ends.
On January 1, 1993, it is a fair bet that some publicity-seeking federalists
 -possibly led by a posse of continental European MEPs - will try to enter
the country without passports.
If they are stopped at immigration, that could mark the beginning of a long
and potentially embarrassing legal challenge to Britain's refusal to lift
border-checks on people - just two weeks after an Edinburgh summit at which
Mr John Major is certain to proclaim the European market open for business.
Britain's position is simple. It says the 1986 Single European Act does not
oblige the UK to lift its border controls on non-EC citizens. Consequently,
it must maintain at least enough checks to ensure that unwanted
non-Community travellers do not slip through the EC passport lane at sea and
airports.
The European Commission maintains that the Act requires an end to all
controls from next January 1, and believes the European Court would uphold
that opinion.
To the great irritation of the Commission, that difference of opinion has
been easily finessed by politicians and journalists into a simmering row
between Brussels and Britain, spiced with the emotive issues of compulsory
identity cards (essential if controls are dropped, the sceptics claim) and
illegal immigration.
In fact, the position is more subtle. Broadly speaking, all continental
members except Denmark - the members and associate members of the 1990
Schengen free travel zone - back the Commission's legal interpretation. But
most are worried it will be impractical and imprudent to lift border
controls at the beginning of the year unless certain 'compensating measures'
are introduced.
They would include a database linking customs, tax and immigration
authorities, a convention on asylum (signed but not yet ratified by all
member states), and a convention aimed at strengthening external frontiers.
This last measure would be the easiest way of encouraging national
immigration authorities to trust one another, but signing has been held up
for more than a year by the Anglo-Spanish dispute over Gibraltar.
Denmark and Ireland are in a slightly different situation. Denmark disputes
the Commission's interpretation and intends to maintain controls, but it
might eventually be persuaded to drop them if sufficient safeguards were
brought in. Ireland is worried that if it joins the Schengen bloc, Britain
will reinstate passport checks for Irish travellers, 70 per cent of whom
pass through the UK.
In May, when the Commission published its hardline interpretation of the
Single European Act, it looked as though the dispute was bound to end in
tears. But since then, the Danes have voted down Maastricht - partly, it is
said, because of worries about open borders - and the atmosphere has
changed.
Three weeks ago in Lisbon, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary,
told fellow interior ministers they should not underestimate the all-party
opposition to lifting border controls in the UK. With ratification of
Maastricht uppermost in governments' minds, that warning seems to have had
an impact, and a full-scale confrontation now seems unlikely.
More likely is a postponement of the January 1 deadline - the Commission
prefers to say that 'the clock will be stopped' - while concerted efforts
are made to bring in the compensating measures.
It is at that point that the boatload of passport-less federalists comes in.
But short of instructing immigration officers to wave through any litigious
MEPs on New Year's Day, British officials admit there is not much they can
do about that.

THE European Commission is poised to complete a liberalisation of the
insurance market more comprehensive than anyone could have imagined when the
single market was first laid out in 1985.
EC finance ministers on Monday agreed the Third Life Assurance Directive
which will largely complete the single insurance market.
The Third Non-Life Insurance Directive was adopted ten days ago. A third
plank, the Insurance Accounts Directive was adopted last year.
The legislation, which governments must implement from 1994 onwards, will
open Europe's most protected markets to more competition and represents a
victory for advocates of a more liberal market, headed by Sir Leon Brittan,
the responsible commissioner.
Under the 'single licence', insurers from any member state will be free to
trade in any other member state, under home country rules.
Advocates of greater deregulation argue that the single licence should
benefit insurers from countries with more liberal rules and encourage a more
liberal framework across Europe as a whole.
Other changes include: Governments cannot demand prior approval of policy
conditions or premium rates or require companies to invest in a particular
category of assets.
This will lead to big changes in Germany and Italy, where private motor
insurance is highly regulated. Under the insurance accounts directive, which
introduces a greater degree of disclosure than hitherto, insurers are
obliged to state the value of their assets at both historic and market cost.
Companies from countries such as Germany, which have traditionally only
stated the value of their assets at historic cost, are most affected by
this.

THE LEGAL framework for a single market in banking was put in place in 1989
with the Second Banking Directive. British bankers long ago accepted the
idea of the single market in financial services and later a single currency.
Since then British bankers have concentrated on the practical problems of
making the single market work and ensuring the arrival of Emu.
Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, the largest UK banking group,
speaking in Frankfurt in May warned that banks faced enormous changes in
their markets and systems.
He said banks should be thinking about a host of practical problems such as
changes to their computer systems needed for a single currency, to the
minting and distribution of coins and notes. And he singled out cross-border
payment, wholesale and retail, as one of the biggest problems for banks.
The Second Banking Consolidated Supervision Directive was approved in May
and should make BCCI-type scandals impossible. One member country may send
inspectors to another to check information.
'One still wonders how rigorously the rules will be enforced. How severely
will branches of undercapitalised banks in other member states be treated by
the Bank of England for example?' one banker asks in private.
Other bankers worry that new rules on credit reference agencies or codes of
conduct for credit card companies could mark a step backwards.
By and large however, the banking community bends with the European wind.
But one issue where the Commission is eager to press ahead, banks still find
it difficult to follow. A cheap cross-border retail payments system,
enabling people to send money from one country to another at costs
comparable to those of internal money transfers still seems some way off.

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
JUST BEFORE midnight on December 31 a match will be put to the first in a
chain of bonfires lit to mark the end of the British presidency of the
European Community.
Those beacons should also celebrate the achievement of the single European
market - one of the British presidency's principal aims, and the culmination
of seven years' hard work since Lord Cockfield, then EC internal market
commissioner, kindled the first flame in June 1985.
But however joyful the celebrations, however vigorous the back-slapping, and
however useful the measures which will come into force on January 1, 1993,
the project is riddled with actual and potential problems, linked to the
completion, implementation and enforcement of the Cockfield programme.
Until June 2, when Denmark voted 'no' to the Maastricht treaty, sins of
omission looked likely to be the biggest stain on the virtue of the single
market. Internal market hardliners argued that even if Lord Cockfield's
target of nearly 300 measures was achieved, free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital would be hampered by derogations (time limited
exceptions), deferrals and the EC's understandable tendency to ignore
politically sensitive candidates for harmonisation.
But the Danish referendum result has focused the attention of nervous EC
governments on the more pressing problem of subsidiarity - the real or
imagined 'sins of Commission'.
This concern is easier to understand if one recalls that this is the same
single market which spawned a series of notorious 'rows' between Brussels
and member states over alleged threats to the British sausage and the
prawn-cocktail-flavoured crisp, the Spanish tilde, German beer and countless
other objects of national pride.
Critics of the Commission's supposed over-centralising tendency say such
apparent meddling in the nooks and crannies of Europe's daily life was one
reason for the Danes' narrow rejection of Maastricht.
Commission officials are quick to stress that single market legislation is
the direct result of the EC leaders' decision to sign the Single European
Act in 1986, and that each measure is debated by ministers and their
officials before it is agreed. What is more, they say, ministers are happy
to hide behind 'Commission plans' if it shields them from domestic political
flak.
But the criticism has struck a chord with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president. Since the Danish vote he has regularly underlined the fact that
January 1, 1993 should end the wave of EC single market legislation, and
last week he suggested that the principle of subsidiarity could override the
objective of a flawless single market.
That creates a new headache which the Commission, Britain and the other
states must try to solve over the next six months. How can the Community
ensure implementation and enforcement of measures without encouraging an
image of the EC as a haven for nit-picking legislators? And at what point
will member states settle for an imperfect single market in the interests of
subsidiarity?
This is a particularly delicate problem for the British government. Although
it is a strong supporter of the single market and meticulous in its
attention to the detailed impact of harmonising measures, many Brussels
bureaucrats believe it has also contributed to the poor image of the
Commission.
A committee of experts, chaired by Mr Peter Sutherland, competition
commissioner from 1984 to 1988, is examining ways of ensuring the European
playing field is properly levelled and stays level after 1992. With an eye
to the subsidiarity principle, some form of co-operation between member
states is certain to be at the heart of the committee's proposals. That
could be combined with an enhanced role for national courts.
For example, a Dutch widget-manufacturer having difficulty exporting to
Spain after 1992 could appeal to an arbitration council - a sort of clearing
house for single market concerns - or take his complaint to a national
court, thus relieving the Commission and European Court of the burden.
But one senior Commission official points out that such solutions have
several fundamental flaws, which could lead to new distortions of the
market. 'The problem is that national enforcing machinery is very varied,
quite apart from the problem of which national authority is more efficient.
Even those which are equally efficient are efficient in different ways.'
At the same time, the Commission would still have a role as watchdog, and
national courts' decisions on EC law would still be subject to appeal to the
European Court. The burden on the central institutions would be almost as
great.
As for a 'de minimis' rule, establishing once and for all that the
Commission would only intervene in large cases of market distortion - that
solution might hamper the development of the internal market for the small
and medium-sized enterprises which Brussels believes are at the heart of
future European prosperity. 'I'm a bit reluctant to accept that an obstacle
to free trade which puts a small firm out of business is less important than
something which has an impact on a big company,' says the same Brussels
official.
In the meantime, the British presidency has to work towards the symbolic
completion of the internal market. Much of it is already there. The final
directive giving insurance companies a single European passport was slotted
into place at Monday's meeting of finance ministers, for example, and the
essentials of a single market for banks have been agreed. Mutual recognition
of qualifications - praised by Mr Delors last week as a prime example of
trust between member states - has also been achieved, allowing EC citizens
to work in any Community country.
But apart from the practical difficulties which may arise after January 1,
there are still some notable omissions.
Mr Ben Patterson, a British MEP, is preparing a report on the internal
market which will be presented to the European parliament in Strasbourg next
week. 'What's becoming quite clear is that there are a lot of quite tricky
tidying-up matters which need to be done,' he says. 'If you're talking about
having a complete single market as Big Ben strikes midnight on December 31,
we're not going to have it.'
Politically, the trickiest outstanding objective is an end to border
controls on people by 1993, which could be scuppered by British opposition.
In the economic field, however, it is Britain which will have its work cut
out persuading member states to liberalise EC road haulage,
telecommunications (the UK wants an end to monopolies over ordinary phone
calls) and the energy market. All are priorities for the UK, but energy and
telecoms are such sensitive national interests that Lord Cockfield did not
even include them in his original list of measures.
Even getting close to a full house of single market measures during the next
six months will require some sleight of hand and a great deal of hard work
by Community institutions. Some redundant or unwanted measures may be
postponed or dropped altogether. Britain could also find itself cajoling
ministers into extra meetings and frog-marching MEPs into special plenary
sessions of the parliament to clear the backlog of single market measures.
'One thing is sure,' says a British official, 'we will make sure that by the
end of the year we will have got between 90 and 95 per cent (of the original
Cockfield measures).'
Whether the outstanding directives are then used to light the New Year's Eve
bonfire will presumably depend on how sensitive member states are by that
stage about the pernicious influence of Community legislation.

WHEN Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the UK Board of Trade, and Mr Martin
Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, met last weekend to discuss
Community industry policy they may have found they were closer
philosophically than they expected to be.
'There aren't significant disagreements between us and the UK,' said a
Brussels industry official. 'But when it comes to political discussion and
rhetoric we tend to be far apart and that makes things much more difficult.'
The official Brussels line is that the Commission should promote a generally
applicable 'horizontal' policy - such as funding for research and training -
rather than sectoral measures aimed at, say, the motor or electronics
industry. Britain would clearly like the Commission to hold that line.
But over the next six months the fight between free-market and
interventionist governments is likely to intensify. The main battlefields
will be the Commission's budget plans for 1993-97 and Brussels' centralised
competition powers.
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, would like his budget package
to be approved as written - complete with plans to enhance industrial
competitiveness through improved research and training programmes. Community
liberals worry that such plans could be hijacked by ailing industrial
sectors. But faced with opposition to the whole budget, Mr Delors has hinted
that research and training funds may have to be scaled back to ensure more
aid for the EC's poorer regions.
Meanwhile, the Commission is under pressure from some countries, notably
France, to hand some of its competition powers back to national authorities.
The UK will be counting on Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible,
to fight his corner.

BRITAIN may well feel it has been robbed of a victory. Shortly before
Portugal handed over the presidency of the EC to Britain, European Community
finance ministers reached an agreement on the key aspects of the Investment
Services Directive (ISD), paving the way for the creation of a
Community-wide market in financial services.
The breakthrough on Monday evening - after two years of wrangling - has
received a cautious welcome from City institutions. 'All that remains to be
achieved is some tidying up of the text . . . there is every prospect of the
Directive going through and its legal adoption will take place under the
British presidency of the EC,' said one Community official yesterday. The
three main points of the ISD which have been clarified are 'Transparency',
'Concentration' and 'Freedom of Access'.
Transparency - referring to the reporting of information about the price and
volume of securities traded - was the main stumbling block in the
negotiations, but a breakthrough was achieved on Monday evening with EC
members agreeing on the following conditions:
Publication at the beginning of each day's trading of the weighted average
price, highest price, lowest price, and volume traded on the market on the
previous day.
The highest and lowest prices, calculated over a rolling two-hour period,
which would be published every 20 minutes, with a delay of one hour.
Publication requirements could also be delayed or suspended to preserve the
anonymity of firms and investors dealing either in very large quantities or
in particularly illiquid stocks.
Many City institutions have been particularly concerned about the question
of Transparency. With the market-making or quote-driven system which
operates in the UK, dealers must be prepared to hold large blocks of shares:
revealing sensitive price and volume information to the market immediately
could put them at a disadvantage.
However, City institutions yesterday gave a cautious welcome to the
reporting delays which have been agreed. Progress was also made on the
question of 'Concentration', whereby investors will have the freedom to
choose which of the regulated financial markets to use, or whether to go
'off-market' - in other words, to buy or sell securities without going
through an exchange.
The final agreement concerned 'Freedom of Access' or the right of EC banks
to become members of the stock exchanges in other EC countries. The decision
should allow banks which conduct investment business to become members of
the stock exchanges in other countries without having to set up subsidiaries
in those countries.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: Fading fervour for monetary
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S industrialists see plenty of advantages from the single market. But
plans for a single currency have been dealt a setback by post-Maastricht
squabbling, according to foreign exchange practitioners at some of Europe's
largest companies.
The Commission has long viewed a single currency operated by a European
central bank as essential to a unified market. And the idea of irrevocably
fixed exchange rates appeals particularly to small and medium businesses
without the resources to manage large currency fluctuations.
But many large companies see only limited advantages in monetary union
because they already have sophisticated mechanisms for dealing with currency
changes. Some, indeed, use currency trading as a modest profit source.
More important, European businessmen know that Emu will not come about
unless Germany - the strongest economy in the EC - wants to see the project
completed. And there is little doubt about the cooling of desire for
monetary union among German public opinion in recent months.
Mr Heinrich Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI),
caused a stir last week by calling into doubt the Emu timetable.
He said monetary union was only worth carrying out 'if it does not undermine
currency stability' - a condition which at present, was not assured.
He also cast doubt on the underlying motives for the EC's campaign towards
Emu. 'Currency union will bring some small advantages. But it is not
necessary for the performance of the single market.'
Mr Rutbert Reisch, group treasurer at the Volkswagen car company,
illustrates the fall in German support for Emu. Mr Reisch, who terms himself
'very sceptical' about chances for Emu's realisation, says the project is
'unrealistic' and could be inflationary.
The politicians have been pushing plans for Emu based on 'unsound' analyses
of its benefits for business, Mr Reisch says. He says larger companies can
benefit from a degree of exposure to currency fluctuations. Mr Reisch says
that only 'foolish' corporate treasurers would take action through 'hedging'
to cover 100 per cent of their EC currency exposure.
A more optimistic line on Emu comes from Mr Jean-Dominique Senard, treasurer
at Saint Gobain, the French glass and engineering group. Saint Gobain has
pioneered use of the European currency unit (Ecu) in its company accounts
and internal transactions.
Mr Senard is certain that Emu will take place. But he believes that monetary
union is now more likely to come about in several stages, with two or three
countries - led by Germany and France - forming a smaller union by 2000, and
others joining later. Mr John Grout, director of treasury operations at
Cadbury Schweppes, the UK food and drinks group, also believes a currency
union will be delayed until after 2000.
Emu attempts to deal with the problem of exchange rate fluctuations - even
though 'this is one of the few things that industry knows how to cope with',
Mr Grout says. He suggests that politicians might be exaggerating the
importance of dampening exchange rate changes, which have remained
relatively stable in Europe during the last five years. Instead, more
attention could be focused on the fluctuations in economic performance
caused by the strict economic convergence conditions drawn up at Maastricht.

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
BRITISH diplomats may have long lost an empire to run, but every few years
they get a superpower, albeit a rather odd one, to manage for six months.
Britain has always been the great enthusiast for foreign policy
co-ordination among the Twelve. The reasons are simple. Britain, like
France, tends to see EC foreign policy as an extension of its own.
The overriding British interest has been to keep foreign policy
co-ordination an informal affair between consenting foreign ministries, as
far as possible out of the clutches of EC institutions like the Commission
and the parliament.
Feeling comfortably closeted over the past 20 years within this
inter-governmental system, known as European Political Co-operation (EPC),
Britain has pushed for maximum co-ordination. In 1980 it urged extending EPC
to security issues. In 1984 it got EPC to list the areas in which diplomats
of the Twelve and of the EC based in third countries should pool
information. In 1985 Britain championed a tightening of foreign policy
co-ordination, an initiative which snowballed into the Single European Act.
There is an irony to some of these initiatives. Britain is suspected by its
partners of refusing to put sensitive information on the Coreu telex network
which links the foreign ministries of the Twelve. It also has a reputation
for not freely pooling information with EC partners in some capitals.
But, in general, Britain is keen to stretch inter-governmental co-operation
in foreign policy to the utmost, so as to avoid demands by some of its
partners for action through Community machinery. Such demands were largely
fended off in the Maastricht treaty, with one exception. Although the
treaty's 'pillar' on a common EC foreign and security policy is firmly
inter-governmental, it provides for the (very communautaire) possibility
that implementing measures can be decided by majority verdict.
The Foreign Office - from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, on down -
firmly believes this to be a nonsense. Thus, for example, one should expect
no real UK presidency pressure for Greece to be outvoted on the issue of
recognising Macedonia.
The Maastricht treaty has led to certain changes which may live on even if
the pact fails to be ratified. The EPC co-ordinating unit in Brussels is to
be expanded from six to 23, and merged with the Council of Ministers
secretariat.
The UK also plans that political directors of the Twelve should start from
this November holding their monthly meetings in Brussels, rather than in the
capital of the presidency country. The idea is that political directors
(senior foreign ministry officials from each member country) should have
more input into foreign ministers' meetings. Mr Hurd also intends these
meetings to be more businesslike. At present, general foreign policy issues
tend to be discussed over lunch, with no papers prepared or officials
present; confusion often results.
Of course, most of the EC's impact on the outside world is still in the
arena of the Community's trade and economic business. In so far as the
deadlock in the Gatt talks is the result of the EC's failure to translate
the price and subsidy cuts in its farm reform speedily into concessions in
Gatt, the UK presidency has almost certainly come too late. For, President
George Bush has no time for anything from now until polling day in November
but to lock electoral horns with Messrs Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. But
there will still be plenty else to test British diplomatic skills this
autumn - the negotiation of the pan-European energy charter, getting the new
Europe accords with central European states off to a good start, and, of
course, paving the way for a beginning to entry negotiations for Efta
countries.

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
MR JOHN MAJOR'S stated ambition is to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'.
The problem is that during 20 turbulent years in the EC it has never
ventured more than a few yards beyond the perimeter.
But the angry debates over the Maastricht treaty being played out at
Westminster should not be taken as a signal that Britain is about to retreat
again into surly isolationism.
Mr Major is serious in his judgment that a middle-ranking power stranded off
the coast of Europe can no longer afford to be a reluctant participant in a
game whose rules are constantly adjusted on the other side of the Channel.
The noise generated by those at Westminster who would prefer Britain to cut
loose from anything more than the 'Common Market' is in inverse proportion
to their numbers.
Led by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, they are by and large of the generation which
harbours personal memories of the second world war. It is a generation which
has still to come to terms with the economic and political might of a
once-defeated Germany; one which still looks instinctively to Washington.
But the nation's ruling classes - at Westminster, in the City of London and
among captains of industry - see no option but to bind Britain's future to
Europe's. As one businessman turned senior minister puts it: 'Europe is the
future. It is such a pity it has taken us so long to admit it.'
The people too have begun to come to terms with Europe. A generation which
has grown up accustomed to Mediterranean package holidays has become less
certain of the assumption that British is best.
And yet. If as a nation Britain is reconciled to a future bound to that of
its European partners, it is reluctant still to welcome the prospect.
Mrs Thatcher and her allies know well that the frequent tabloid tirades
against Brussels bureaucracy, French farmers and fisherman and German
economic success strike a chord with a sizeable chunk of the electorate.
The demonology which surrounds Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president,
reflects a deep-seated ambivalence among politicians as well as voters about
any transfer of sovereignty - illusory or otherwise - to Brussels.
And while the decline in the country's relative prosperity reminds political
and business leaders that there is no option other than to compete and win
in Europe, for others it stokes nationalist resentment.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: Hurd prepares to fight on
two fronts - Britain's foreign secretary explains his priorities to Philip
Stephens, Robert Mauthner and David Marsh

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
DURING THE next six months Mr Douglas Hurd will find himself at the centre
of two sets of equally delicate political negotiations. Both will test his
formidable diplomatic talents. Either or both may prove intractable.
As chairman of the Brussels Council of Ministers, the foreign secretary is
charged with steering the European Community's efforts to salvage Maastricht
from the wreckage of the Danish referendum.
At home he will be in the front line of Mr John Major's campaign to persuade
the Tory party that the treaties on monetary and political union are worth
rescuing.
In between he will be expected to add substance to the Community's
disappointing and often fractious efforts to end the fighting in the former
Yugoslavian republics.
If the issue is not settled at next week's Munich summit, any remaining
hours will be spent trying to break the deadlock between Brussels and
Washington in the Gatt trade talks.
The 62-year-old former professional diplomat is well-suited to the task. Mr
Hurd is loathed by a handful of anti-European irreconcilables in his own
party who see him as the architect of a 'surrender' to Brussels. But he
combines the confidence of his prime minister and of the mainstream of his
party with the respect of European colleagues.
Sitting in his office in Whitehall, he does not underestimate the
uncertainties. He is unsure whether the Danish government can finesse its
electorate's 'no' vote. The treaty's future must await also a French
referendum. In the House of Commons the case for Maastricht has to be made
all over again.
But Mr Hurd is an optimist. The Danish referendum has changed the game.
Britain no longer has to fight to get other EC leaders to negotiate on its
chosen agenda. He is reluctant to talk of a turning of the tide: 'Because
tides turn in all directions'. But: 'There are three things for which we
have been arguing for a long time and where the flow of ideas is in our
direction'.
The three - enlargement, subsidiarity and Community finances - will dominate
the presidency. Mr Hurd's task is to lay the groundwork to wrap them into a
deal at December's Edinburgh summit.
Despite a setback in Lisbon last weekend on the precise timing of
enlargement negotiations with the Efta applicants - Austria, Sweden,
Finland, Switzerland and, possibly, Norway - he says few have appreciated
the change of mood.
'A year ago a lot of people were very sceptical of letting in the Eftas, let
alone going further east. What we saw this last weekend was a consensus that
we should let maybe three or maybe four or maybe five join the treaty of
Maastricht.'
Just as importantly: 'It is agreed that they should be permitted, should be
allowed, should be encouraged without reopening all the institutional
questions'.
His European colleagues insist that formal negotiations cannot start until
Maastricht is ratified. But the preparatory work can be done this year. From
there: 'I think there is no reason that negotiations for this first wave
should not be completed in 1993, with ratification in 1994 and entry in
1995. That has always been our preferred timetable and I think it is
realistic.' And a wider Community means a more decentralised one.
That takes Mr Hurd on to subsidiarity, the cumbersome word his government
hopes to translate into the overriding philosophy behind Community
decision-making.
Everyone has his own definition. Mr Hurd prefers to call it 'minimum
interference' by the Brussels bureaucracy. Its current acceptance now is
another case where 'the flow of ideas is in our favour'. His task is to give
substance to the concept, to define the division of responsibilities between
Brussels and national and regional governments.
'Now, its not straightforward because there are plenty of places where it is
British interests which want the Commission to achieve a level playing
field.'
But Britain and Germany had ensured the principle was enshrined in
Maastricht. At Lisbon, others shared the ambition to make the Community less
intrusive: 'The Commission volunteered after discussion with us and others
not to wait for Maastricht but immediately to set in hand procedures by
which future legislation and existing legislation - this was a change I
proposed - should be examined against this principle.'
Anything that tames the Commission will win plaudits among Tory MPs. But Mr
Hurd intends to explain also that Brussels is not as omnipotent as some
often suppose. The Commission has the monopoly initiative on trade talks and
so on: 'But what are the big decisions for the Community? The handling of
Yugoslavia. How are we to deal with the former Soviet Union? What is to be
the future structure of European defence?'
On these, the pillared structure of Maastricht leaves the Commission without
authority: 'These are matters which are now quite clearly .. to be dealt
with inter-governmentally. It means that there is not a conveyor belt.' It
is a structure incidentally that leaves him happy to compliment President
Francois Mitterrand for his spectacular (and unilateral) mission to
Sarajevo.
Mr Hurd wants improvements to the way that ministers seek to co-ordinate
foreign policy; there is too much 'coffee-cup' diplomacy over lunch without
officials and detailed papers. That means the 'quality' of decisions is not
always as high as it might be. But the structure - intergovernmental and
without majority voting - is right.
Nor does Mr Jacques Delors quite live up to the demonology. The Commission
president would have liked a federal structure at Maastricht but that is not
what happened. Now: 'He is a realistic man. He is beginning to realise -
though not all his colleagues have - what harm has been done.'
That brought Mr Hurd on to his third strand: financing and, in particular,
the scale of the 'cohesion' funds needed to help the poorer countries of the
south. It was this which provoked the bitterest arguments in Lisbon, with
Britain among others refusing a commitment to double financial flows to the
southern countries.
Mr Hurd judged this a victory. In the past Britain's partners had tended to
make 'political decisions' which always resulted in more expenditure. 'Now,
the politics have changed and the political decision is not necessarily one
to spend more money.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl had been particularly helpful
in setting out the limits for his taxpayers. Reconciling the differences at
Edinburgh would not be at all easy, but Britain was no longer alone in
preaching prudence.
There is, though, a much bigger uncertainty than rows over money. However
skilfully Mr Hurd negotiates the obstacles to enlargement, subsidiarity and
a financing deal, Maastricht can only survive if the Danish people change
their minds.
Here he becomes cautious. Some weeks ago he provoked a flurry by suggesting
that a protocol might be tacked on to the treaty to soothe the Danish
electorate. But now he declines to second-guess the Copenhagen government.
'The Danes said in Lisbon that they needed time and it is for them to come
forward with ideas and then we can judge whether they can be put into
practice.' That they have promised to do in September. There can be no
question of coercion: 'I think they are under pressure from reality. . . .
But it would not be right to coerce them and they cannot be excluded. That
puts them in a key position. They accept that.'
If Denmark does deliver, can Britain? Tory rebels at present outnumber the
government's slim parliamentary majority. With the opposition parties they
might prolong debate on ratification indefinitely.
Assuming the treaties win approval in the French referendum, the government
will bring back the legislation to Westminster once Denmark has clarified
its position.
There is a clear hint Mr Major would seek to tame the rebels by making the
issue one of confidence in his government: 'What the prime minister has done
has been to make it clear that this is not a peripheral matter. It is an
essential part of government policy.' On precise timing though, Mr Hurd is
oblique. 'We shall have to judge when is the right time.' Much care had been
taken to explain the position to Britain's partners.
Edinburgh might yet demonstrate that Britain has at last moved to the
Community vanguard. But even for a natural diplomat, the game starts with a
lot of worrying 'ifs'.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: EC states play for high
stakes - The issues may ring a bell from UK's last time in the chair, but
more is riding on them

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
WHEN Britain last took over the EC presidency six years ago, the issues of
the moment were the Community's internal market, squabbles about money and
uncertainties about ratifying a certain treaty.
But if the issues sound vaguely similar, the stakes riding on their outcome
are not. 1992 is a world apart from 1986.
Then, the EC was making what the Financial Times described as a
'tortoise-like' start to a barrier-flattening exercise which few took
seriously. Now, it is in the final legislative stretch towards a single
market that has attracted world-wide hopes, fears and investment.
Then, the Community was mired in a year-by-year haggle over farm spending.
Now, it is debating a 30 per cent increase, over the 1990s, to a budget
already double the 1986 level, and arguing about how much of that should go
in a further transfer of real resources from richer to poorer states.
Then, a solo court challenge by a litigious Irishman, Mr Raymond Crotty, was
threatening to delay ratification of the Single European Act, a treaty whose
import few understood or cared about. Now, the governments of 11 EC states
have desperately appealed to their parliaments and peoples to endorse the
historic step to a European union they took at Maastricht.
Meanwhile, Denmark's government even ponders whether its voters' rejection
of Maastricht leaves them any future at all in the EC.
Today's uncertainties about the future shape of the Community are as great
as the stakes are high in the EC leaders finding a degree of unity with
which all their peoples feel comfortable. Failure of Maastricht would not be
the nightmare Euro-enthusiasts fear, simply because too many people have put
so much into the Community for the entire enterprise to be allowed to fall
apart.
But the Maastricht debate is a turning point in the EC's future. Denmark may
have done the whole Community, if not itself, an enormous service by
bringing the 'subsidiarity' issue to the fore. If the EC can succeed in
passing back to national governments, and even better to regional and local
authorities, some of the powers and controls that have flowed to Brussels
over the past 35 years - without ruining the single market - then it may win
popular backing not only for Maastricht, but further integrationist moves.
Down the road lies another constitutional revision, set in the Maastricht
treaty for 1996. Among other things, it is supposed to move the Community
towards common European defence. This may not suit countries like Austria,
Sweden, Finland, maybe even Switzerland, which should be members by then,
though their neutrality has rapidly lost its relevance with the end of the
Cold War. But common European defence may be more necessary then, if the US
Congress continues to push for a speedier reduction in American troop
strength in Europe than the White House wants.
So, by the late 1990s, it might be possible to have a European union, whose
members, including new Scandinavian and Alpine ones, feel comfortable in
having big decisions (on money and defence) taken at the centre, because
more little decisions (on water purity, lawn-mower noise, food additives,
and so on) are taken locally.
If Maastricht fails, there is a risk, not of the Rome Treaty-based Community
breaking up, but of some of the Twelve deciding to pursue future ambitions
separately. The most likely form would be Germany and France making joint
monetary and defence arrangements (the latter is already under way), perhaps
with a few smaller satellites. This would not be a pleasing prospect for the
excluded - be they Britain, Italy, new members or potential EC candidates in
central Europe.
But there are also some certainties about the EC today which did not exist
six years ago. It has become the pivot around which the wider Europe now
turns. Indeed, its example may be partly responsible for creating the wider
Europe. 'The success of this great European experiment (the EC), perhaps
more than any other factor, has caused east Europeans to recognise that
people as well as nations co-operate more productively when they are free to
choose.' The tribute was made in 1989 by Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state.
Second, the Community's economic impact on the outside world, once confined
mainly to its role in Gatt, has grown enormously. This is due to its single
market, with the opportunities it bestows on non-Europeans and Europeans
alike, and the reciprocal bargaining power it gives Brussels.
The logic of EC states getting together to regulate air pollution or
deregulate air transport inside the Community is that they will end up
negotiating with the outside world on these issues together. They did not do
so at the Earth Summit in Rio, nor do they do so yet in airline agreements.
But they probably will eventually. In addition, the EC has that unique
capacity for extending its single market and for peaceful
self-aggrandisement that goes under the name of 'enlargement'.
Third, there are the ambitions for a common foreign policy. So far, this is
the most feeble aspect of the Community's impact on the world. Indeed, the
most striking or admired acts of foreign policy emanating from Europe - the
military contributions of some EC states in the Gulf war or President
Francois Mitterrand's mercy mission to Sarajevo - defy the consensus needed
for a truly common EC policy.
But the undramatic fact that the Community's foreign policy is slow to
change, as well as slow to act, gives it a predictability particularly
valued by its neighbours.
These are some of the reasons why Prime Minister John Major said this week
that he was not prepared to see Britain 'sit on the sidelines' in the
Community.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Europe, the state of the union: Hurdles en route to Emu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
IF THE Maastricht treaty were ratified, which now seems to depend mainly on
French voters, economic and monetary union would appear to be certain. Not
later than January 1999 - just six and a half years from now - the Ecu is to
become the single currency of an economic and monetary union (Emu) covering
some members of the European Community.
Things are not quite that simple. Even before the Danish 'no' vote,
financial markets did not believe that an Emu embracing all members of the
European Community would be established; or, if they did, believed that
substantial realignments of some currencies were likely to occur beforehand.
The Danish vote, however, has significantly changed the markets' views of
the odds only in the cases of Denmark itself, Spain and Italy.
If Greece and Portugal, which are improbable initial participants, are left
aside, and Luxembourg is left aside as well, as a virtually certain one, the
financial markets currently divide EC members into three groups vis a vis
Germany, the country without whose presence Emu is deemed pointless:
The Netherlands, which has a long-term bond yield differential in relation
to German Bunds of three-tenths of a percentage point and thus an expected
depreciation against the D-Mark of a mere 2 per cent by 1999.
France, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark and the UK, where long bond yield
differentials range from three-quarters of a percentage point in the case of
France, to 1.1 percentage points in that of the UK. These imply overall
depreciations of between 5 and 7 per cent by 1999.
Spain and Italy, where yield differentials are 4.1 percentage points and 5.1
percentage points, respectively. These imply expected depreciations of 23
and 28 per cent.
Once markets digested the Danish 'no', Dutch yield differentials have
declined. Those in the second group have increased rather little, by most in
the case of Denmark, which experienced a jump of about three-tenths of a
percentage point. But Italy's differential has risen by almost four-tenths
of a point and Spain's by almost half a point.
Markets expect a high degree of exchange rate stability within the ERM.
Their view is consistent with an Emu covering, in descending order of
probability: Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Ireland
and the UK. Denmark would be able to join if it wished. But Spain and Italy
are deemed outside chances, like Portugal and Greece.
How do these market expectations compare with the performance of countries
against the convergence criteria agreed at Maastricht? At present, only
France and Luxembourg meet all the criteria precisely. Meanwhile, Belgium
seems to be much too far away on the fiscal criteria.
But remember the escape clauses:
The government fiscal deficit can exceed 3 per cent of gross domestic
product, provided at the time of evaluation it has declined substantially
and continuously, reaching a level close to 3 per cent.
The ratio of government debt to GDP can exceed 60 per cent, provided it 'is
sufficiently diminishing' and approaching that level at a satisfactory pace.
If the criteria are not applied too strictly, the eight countries now most
favourably judged by the markets should be able to join. Spain might be able
to join too.
It appears then that the convergence criteria, judged against current and
expected performance, would allow a move to Emu, even in 1997. What could
still go wrong?
The Maastricht treaty could fail to be ratified.
Countries could refuse to do what they are committed to do, with the already
known exception of the UK, One reason might be high unemployment, low growth
and a desire for large currency realignments. Another might be the German
desire to retain the D-Mark.
Such recantations, even just realignments, could create a serious crisis.
If, as now seems possible, the recantation would be by Germany, the crisis
could be terminal.
Yet even the end of the project for an Emu need not end hopes of greater
monetary integration within Europe. Moves towards irrevocably fixed exchange
rates without divergence bands would be possible. The financial markets are,
in fact, convinced that a high degree of stability is likely. It is up to
the governments to prove them right.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Timetable for Monetary Union
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JANUARY 1 1994. Beginning of the second stage of Emu.
  All controls on exchange and payments are to have been eliminated.
  'At the start of the second stage a European Monetary Institute shall
be established.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
DECEMBER 31 1996. Last date for the first evaluation of entry into the
third stage.
The Council shall decide:
  whether 'a majority of the Member States fulfil the necessary
conditions for adoption of a single currency'; and
  'whether it is appropriate for the EC to enter the third stage;'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JANUARY 1 1999. Last date for the start of the third stage:
  Before July 1 1998, the Council shall 'confirm which member states
fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.'
  Either after the date for the beginning of the third stage has been
set, or after July 1 1998, the European System of Central Banks and the
European Central Bank shall be established. 'The full exercise of their
powers shall start from the first day of the third stage.'

With the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the EC's future has been
thrown into uncertainty. Today Britain takes over as president of the
Community. Can John Major give it new direction? In a special four page
pull-out FT writers assess the prospects
IN SIX short months, the European Community has come down off its Maastricht
high, and is sunk in a slough of self-doubt and inertia. At Maastricht the
Twelve negotiated with fanfares the most ambitious programme for European
integration since the Rome Treaty 35 years ago. Today, in the wake of the
Danish referendum on June 2, they are no longer sure if this treaty can ever
come into force.
Uncertainty about the juridical future of a treaty which has been rejected
by one of the 12 partners, is obviously the most immediate reason for the
gloom, but the change of mood also goes much deeper than that. In a purely
procedural sense, the treaty could perhaps be rescued in its present form,
if the Danish government were to discover a reasonable pretext for holding a
second referendum which reversed the verdict of the first. But no new
referendum could wipe out the dramatic impact of the earlier Danish No vote.
In fact it has sent a double message to the governments of the Twelve. The
first is that the Maastricht treaty cannot enter into force unless they can
secure the support of their national electorates. The second is that, even
if ratified, the treaty will not become a reality unless the member
governments continue to enlist much greater popular national support for its
objectives than they have needed to do in the past.
When Europe's ministers invoke the concept of a 'democratic deficit', as
they do so frequently in their Community conclaves, what they usually mean
is that the European parliament should have greater powers. Seldom or never
do they admit that it is their own national electorates which are being
crucially left out of the game.
That is the first lesson of the Danish No vote. The political establishment
in Copenhagen shared a broad-based consensus in favour of the treaty; but
the people felt differently, and said so.
In its wake, the Danish vote has released a wave of criticism of the treaty,
as well as a large measure of outright opposition, in a number of other
member states, starting with the three largest.
In Britain it has precipitated the emergence of a significant
anti-Maastricht rebellion inside the governing Conservative Party, furiously
urged on by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, Mr John Major's predecessor as prime
minister. In the last resort, Mr Major may be able to reimpose party
discipline, but British officials do not sound over-confident.
In Germany it appears that the Maastricht treaty probably commands a
sufficiently large consensus among the political establishment to ensure
eventual ratification in parliament. Yet it has become the lever for a
significant renegotiation of the power relations between the federal
authorities and the Lander, while certain aspects of the treaty, starting
with the target of a single currency, are vigorously contested in the
populace at large.
In France, a very large proportion of the political establishment has
indicated its support by voting overwhelmingly for the required reform of
the constitution. But popular opinion, which will be tested in a referendum
in September, is not only more evenly divided but also more volatile.
Opinion surveys have regularly pointed to a majority in favour of
Maastricht; but the size of the expected majority has tended to fluctuate
quite widely, and is usually matched by a large unknown in the shape of the
don't-knows.
The second lesson of the Danish referendum is a salutary reminder that the
Maastricht treaty marks a political watershed in the extension of EC policy
areas. If the Community is to make a reality of the planned economic and
monetary union, for example, or of the proposed common foreign and security
policy, it will need a much greater degree of popular political support than
for the low-intensity economic objectives of the past; and it will need this
greater support, not just once, but on a continuing basis.
If the Twelve want to save the treaty in any meaningful form, and then make
it workable, they will have to give much greater thought to the democratic
deficit: not in Strasbourg, but in the capitals, regions, counties, and town
halls of the member states.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clash on boundary body role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S acceptance of the impartiality of the parliamentary boundary
commissions was reaffirmed by Mr Alistair Darling, opposition home affairs
spokesman, last night.
His assurance was seized on by government supporters as a repudiation of a
'corruption' charge levelled against the English commission last week by Mr
Ken Livingstone, the Labour MP for Brent East.
Moving the third reading of the Boundary Commissions Bill, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, home secretary, confirmed that the parliamentary commission for
England could propose changes to London constituencies that involved
crossing local-government boundaries.
He said the existing rules allowed the commission to make such
recommendations where it was judged necessary to reduce disparities in the
size of constituencies.
About 20 Labour MPs ignored Mr Darling's call not to vote against the third
reading, which was carried by a government majority of 166 (221-55).
The government has delayed publication of a bill on employment legislation,
originally intended for introduction this week, until after the
parliamentary recess. The bill would require unions to obtain members'
consent every three years before asking employers to deduct subscriptions
from salaries.

PRIVATISATION has been a great success, according to senior managers of
privatised utilities - but customers appear less convinced.
Interviews with 30 senior managers in the utilities, transport groups and
manufacturing companies privatised over the past decade showed that they
rated success highest for shareholders, followed by employees, with
customers gaining the least.
'It will not come as a surprise to managers that the customer does not rate
the success of privatisation so highly,' says Mr John Mattison, author of
the report, published by public-relations consultants Burson-Marsteller and
Corporate Counsel.
All the managers recognised that one of their main jobs was to provide
quality service at a price customers found acceptable.
For the public, the most positive benefit of privatisation was improved
service, although nearly half of those questioned could not name any
positive aspect. Results were based on more than 1,000 telephone interviews.
Comparisons of the leading privatised utilities - British Telecom, British
Gas, electricity and water - showed that customers thought quality of
service had improved most at BT, with 48 per saying service was better,
followed by British Gas with 29 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Smoker acts to test liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLICITORS acting for a smoker with a rare circulatory disorder who is suing
Gallaher, the US cigarette manufacturer, said yesterday his case could
provide the first test of the duty of care that tobacco companies owe to
smokers.
Mr Cormac Fitzpatrick, of Belfast solicitors Vincent P. Fitzpatrick &amp; Co,
said he was confident that it could be proved his client's disease was
attributable to smoking.
Mr John Dean, 37, of Ballywalter, Co Down, suffers from Beurger's disease,
which causes constriction of the arteries and in its most severe form can
lead to gangrene and loss of limbs. The disease is incurable but can be
controlled.
Although the disease has not advanced to the serious stage in Mr Dean's
case, he claims that he has been unable to work for seven years and his
family life has been adversely affected. Mr Dean began smoking in his early
teens.
Mr Fitzpatrick said the uniqueness of his case lay in the fact that
Beurger's disease is thought to be caused directly by smoking. With other
smoking-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer it is very
hard to prove that nothing else could have caused the disease.
Mr Fitzpatrick said Mr Dean had a strong case because he had only ever
smoked one brand of cigarette, Benson &amp; Hedges, made by Gallaher.
The case will revolve around the extent of the tobacco industry's knowledge
of the harmful side effects of its products, when it took action to warn
people of those side effects and whether the warnings it gave were
sufficient.
He said: 'Just because a company complies with the statutory obligation to
warn about the dangers of smoking does not necessarily mean it has complied
with the wider common-law duty of care owed to consumers.'
The court will have to look at what warnings were available to Mr Dean
during the period when he was smoking and what advertising and promotion was
being pursued by the tobacco companies at the time. His lawyers will argue
that there has been an attempt by the tobacco industry to disarm the
statutory warning through advertising suggesting that the warnings are
included on packets and in advertisements only because the government
insists on them.
Mr Mark Mildred, a personal-injury and product liability lawyer with London
solicitors Pannone Napier, said
that to succeed in a damages action against a cigarette manufacturer under
English law, a plaintiff had to prove negligence by the manufacturer in
promotion of the product; that the negligence resulted in damage; that the
injuries were caused exclusively by tobacco; and that the manufacturer of
the product which caused the injury could be clearly identified.
Gallaher said yesterday it could not comment on the case but it would be
defending it vigorously.
The company is expected to argue that Mr Dean was addicted to smoking by the
time there was a duty to warn him of the danger of Beurger's disease.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Shephard investigates training shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION into why Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) are
failing to meet the guarantee of training places has been launched by Mrs
Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary.
Employment ministers are said to have asked for more information on how
training provision compares with the government promise that everyone aged
16 or 17 who was not in work or in education would be guaranteed a place on
the Youth Training programme. The information, which is due to be provided
in the next few weeks, will be used in the department's discussions on
spending with the Treasury.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the junior employment minister, insisted last month
that the guarantee of YT provision was 'broadly speaking' being met, and
that funding this year was also 'broadly in line' with last year's
allocations, although more were staying on at school. In private, though,
ministers are embarrassed by the failure to meet the guarantee in the light
of the withdrawal of income support from people aged 16 and 17.
Labour said last month that up to 60,000 school-leavers might find
themselves without YT places after a survey of Tecs in which three quarters
of the 82 organisations took part.
Tecs have argued for more freedom to tailor programmes at local level, and
say the guarantee of a place on either ET or YT programmes cannot be met
without extra funding.
The department is believed to support the idea of greater flexibility for
Tecs, and to be ready to argue for more money if it can be shown that the
extra cash is needed to meet the guarantee.
One element in the public-spending discussions is likely to be a move
towards making more of the Tecs' funding related to the outcome of their
schemes. That would be either in terms of how close they are to meeting the
guarantees or in terms of whether those for whom they provide places go on
to jobs.
The leaders of the Tecs have already warned the government that unless there
is 'major reform' the 1,000 senior executives running the organisations
would leave.
In particular, they criticised Whitehall interference and said that Tec
successes were jeopardised by 'a welter of administrative procedures'.
Mr Henry McLeish, an opposition employment spokesman, said yesterday that
the government was 'scapegoating' Tecs for the failure to deliver the
guarantee.
He is today putting down parliamentary questions to ministers urging them to
publish information about the real state of the programmes.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Initiative to reduce local red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government launched an initiative yesterday to reduce the amount of red
tape businesses encounter in their dealings with local authorities.
Nine councils will establish partnerships with local business groups to draw
up guidelines to help businesses conform with regulations, under a pilot
programme announced by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry.
Small businesses in particular frequently have difficulty in complying with
a range of regulations covering such areas as trading standards,
environmental health, social services, planning, building control and fire
safety.
The local authorities taking part in the project will set up consultation
groups with businesses to discuss issues and to draw up a range of booklets
explaining the regulations.
The booklets will set out the authorities' regulatory responsibilities,
explain what information is available and where it can be found, and state
the authorities' policy objectives and their enforcement procedures.
They will lay down performance standards that businesses can expect from the
authority on, for example, the response time to inquiries, and explain how
businesses can complain or appeal against a decision. The booklets are due
to be published at the end of this year or early next year.
A small team at the department will help the local authorities to spread
best practice throughout the group. Business representatives will monitor
the progress of the initiative.
The authorities represent a cross-section of metropolitan and rural areas,
large and small councils and different political hues. They comprise county
and borough councils from Kent, Tunbridge Wells, Suffolk, Ipswich,
Nottinghamshire, Gedling, Barnsley, Hounslow and South Ribble.

<TEXT>
ENGLISH ESTATES, the government's commercial property developer, is to seek
a buyer for 100 industrial estates worth a total of between Pounds 40m and
Pounds 50m.
The agency believes it can find one purchaser for the portfolio, in spite of
the recession. It comprises 1,750 small factories and workshops in northern
England and is the largest single package it has put on the market.
The sale is part of disposals aimed at raising up to Pounds 120m this
financial year to support the agency's development programme.
Although particulars about the 100-estate portfolio will not be available
until next month, English Estates is already receiving inquiries about the
3.15m sq ft of floorspace which produces Pounds 6.5m a year in rental
income.
Rents on the units, 85 per cent of which are occupied, mostly on short-term
tenancy agreements, average less than Pounds 3 a sq ft, but English Estates
says there is scope for growth once the recession ends.
English Estates, set up in 1936 to develop factories in the depressed areas
of England, is now also active outside the assisted areas.
It was told in 1990 to sell its Department of Trade and Industry-funded
assets to generate income.
In 1991-92 it raised Pounds 92m by selling 756 units totalling 5m sq ft.

<TEXT>
SIX MEN accused of swindling stamp collectors by dealing in Commonwealth
stamps with deliberate printing mistakes were acquitted yesterday at
Southwark Crown Court.
One defendant, Mr Clive Feigenbaum, a former chairman of Stanley Gibbons
stamp dealers, remains on trial charged with fraudulent trading.
The judge directed that there was insufficent evidence against the six: Mr
Aart Lagerwaard and Mr Ronald Wallen, stamp dealers, of Southampton; Mr
Frederick Hughes, a printer, of Thornton Heath, south London; Mr Ronald
Grover, another former Stanley Gibbons chairman, of Beaulieu, Hants; Mr
Brian Pillinger, managing director of Bristol stamp dealers Urch Harris; and
Mr John Charles Smith, a director of the Crown Agents stamp company.
Mr William Peeling of Woldingham, Surrey, a former managing director of a
printer's, changed his plea to not guilty of fraudulent trading and had been
discharged, Judge Cotran said.
Giving evidence, Mr Feigenbaum said he had seen nothing wrong in the
manufacture of stamps with deliberate misprints provided the contract with
the national government did not prevent that.
The trial continues.

<TEXT>
MINERS' leaders were told yesterday by Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy
spokesman, to accept that they would probably lose the battle against
privatisation of the mining industry.
Mr Dobson said at the National Union of Mineworkers annual conference in
Scarborough he now believed 'the cards are stacked heavily against keeping
coal in the public sector'.
The NUM should draw up plans to protect the most vulnerable pits and
maintain safety standards, he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, disagreed that privatisation was now
inevitable. If contingency plans were discussed, then 'everyone in Britain
knows we have conceded the argument', he said.
Mr Scargill outlined a campaign of action against sell-offs that would
include legal appeals to the European Court. The NUM is to argue that
British Coal or future mine owners should repay money saved by taking
pension contribution holidays. The union also wants to see the repayment of
some EC grants if privatisation goes ahead.
Mr Scargill added that the conference 'should not rule out any additional
action' if other strategies failed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S parliament was dissolved yesterday ahead of a new general
election on September 13, leaving Mr Anand Panyarachun, the interim prime
minister, only 10 more weeks in which to consolidate his economic reform
programme and curb the influence of the military in politics and business.
Mr Anand, appointed after the killing of at least 50 pro-democracy
demonstrators by troops in May and the resignation of Gen Suchinda
Kraprayoon, his unelected predecessor, said his administration would
continue to function at full capacity.
'We get used to the term 'caretaker government',' he said. 'There is nothing
in the constitution which states that after the dissolution of parliament,
the government in charge is a caretaker government.'
Although his government cannot introduce new laws, his cabinet and the
monetary authorities have already shown themselves determined to build on
the economic liberalisation measures fostered by his previous administration
between February 1991 and the elections in March this year:
The Transport and Communications Ministry has ordered an investigation into
allegations of corruption at Thai Airways International, the national
airline whose shares are due to start trading on the stock market next
month.
The Bank of Thailand, the central bank, is this week studying plans to allow
foreign banks more scope to operate in Thailand and considering tax
incentives to encourage them to finance projects in Indochina from Bangkok.
Thailand's new Securities and Exchange Commission says it is establishing a
team of 100 investigators to examine dubious stock market deals, and is
already probing suspected irregularities by an unnamed, listed stockbroking
company believed to have lent money to one of its related companies to buy
its own shares.
A privatisation drive continues despite the bad blood over the flotation of
Thai International. Electricity Generating Co, a subsidiary of the
state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, is to buy Egat's
Bt20bn Rayong power plant and be sold to the public next year in the first
stage of Egat's privatisation.
The cabinet this week approved the award of a contract for 1m telephone
lines in the provinces to a consortium led by Loxley of Thailand.
On the political front, Mr Anand is expected to seek the resignations of
senior military commanders blamed for the killings in May before he steps
down.
He urged Thai voters to elect decent representatives in the September poll.
The elections in March which brought Gen Suchinda, himself not an MP, to
power at the head of a coalition of pro-military parties were marred by
widespread vote-buying.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Malaysia confronts dilemma of foreign workforce:
Registration drive highlights problem of 'illegals' in a fast-growing
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past few days Kuala Lumpur's immigration offices have had a frantic
air about them. Crowds have been milling at every counter, trying to harness
the attention of harassed officials. Tempers have frayed, arguments have
broken out. Many have waited in vain all day.
Midnight last night was the deadline for registration of all those working
illegally in Malaysia. Those who have not registered, says the government,
will be put into camps and deported.
In each of the past four years Malaysia's growth has been more than 8 per
cent, creating a serious labour shortage. Foreign workers, many of them
illegal, have become a key element in the economy.
Indonesian 'illegals' make up a large percentage of those employed on the
rubber and palm oil plantations of peninsular Malaysia. In East Malaysia,
particularly in the resource rich state of Sabah, Indonesian and Philippine
workers outnumber locals on the big plantations and in the timber industry.
Malaysia has a population of 18.5m. Foreign workers, while the figures vary
widely, are estimated to number more than 500,000 in peninsular Malaysia and
possibly more than 1m in the east of the country.
Gross National Product per capita in Indonesia is Dollars 600, in Malaysia
Dollars 2,500. An Indonesian working on a building site in Kuala Lumpur can
earn up to 10 times the wage back home. Malaysian officials say that last
year worker remittances from Malaysia to Indonesia were about MDollars 2bn
(USDollars 800m)
'The problem of illegal immigrants is a big one and has to be resolved
before it gets out of hand,' says Mr Ghafar Baba, Malaysia's deputy prime
minister. Mr Ghafar has warned of tough action against those who have not
registered, with the imminent launch of a nationwide police operation.
The government says Malaysians themselves are suffering because of the
foreign influx. Markets have been taken over by illegal Indonesian traders
who undercut the locals and that unscrupulous employers take on 'illegals'
rather than Malaysians because they can pay the foreigners lower wages.
But the Malaysian authorities realise they have to tread carefully. Any
wholesale exodus of 'illegals' and the economy could suffer. As the economy
industrialises, more Malaysians are moving to the urban areas - to work in
factories or service industries.
The Agricultural Producers Association says output in the plantations sector
could drop by as much as 30 per cent if all 'illegals' were deported.
Traders in palm oil - Malaysia is the world's biggest producer - say a
recent sharp reduction in stocks is partly due to workers rushing to Kuala
Lumpur and other centres to register.
Most of the unskilled labour in the booming construction industry is
Indonesian. Employers complain that work on several projects has slowed
because of workers' absence for long - and what they consider excessively
bureaucratic - immigration procedures.
There are other difficulties for the Malaysian government. For the past week
a group of Indonesians from the strongly Moslem state of Acheh in the north
of the island of Sumatra has been camped in UN offices in Kuala Lumpur. They
say they will be mistreated by the Indonesian authorities if sent home and
are demanding political asylum. Amnesty International has appealed to the
Malaysian authorities on behalf of the Achenese.
Government opponents say the authorities are acting too late and that the
increased immigration - mainly from Moslem areas of Indonesia and the
Philippines - threatens Malaysia's delicate racial balance of more than 50
per cent ethnic Moslem Malays or Bumiputras ('sons of the soil') and the
rest mainly Chinese or Indians.
Opposition claims that the governing United Malays National Organisation
(Umno) - has in fact encouraged such immigration in some areas, particularly
in Sabah, are denied by the government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S labour market showed clear signs of slackening in May in response to
the steep slowdown of the Japanese economy, although employment remained at
high levels, according to government statistics released yesterday.
The Management and Co-ordination Agency said unemployment in Japan inched up
by 0.1 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 2.1 per cent in May. The ratio of
job offers to applicants, however, declined from 1.17 to 1.14, according to
the Labour Ministry, indicating a considerable loosening of the labour
market compared to March last year, when the ratio stood at 1.47.
However, some economists believe that the labour market will have to show
even stronger signs of softening before a recovery of the economy can get
under way.
In the manufacturing sector, which has been hit hardest by the slowdown in
Japan's economy, employment fell by 100,000 compared to April, when 20,000
jobs were lost.
Although not reported in the survey, overtime and part-time work in
manufacturing industries is known to have been cut back sharply as well.
Job losses in manufacturing were more than offset by an increase of 580,000
jobs in the service sector.
Also yesterday, the Economic Planning Agency said its index of leading
indicators in April fell from 40.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent, pointing to
weak economic activity in the months ahead. The EPA report showed
across-the-board weakness of the economy, with the exception of the housing
sector.
An expected recovery of the housing sector, however, was yesterday brought
into question by the Construction Ministry, which reported a 0.1 per cent
year-on-year decline in housing starts in May, following a small increase in
April. Starts of private-owned houses increased by 9.1 per cent, while
construction of houses for sales fell by 33.4 per cent. Condominium starts
were down by 45 per cent.
The Japan Machinery Federation said that planned spending on plant and
equipment by the country's largest machinery makers is down 13.2 per cent
this fiscal year, compared to actual spending last year.

MR Fidel Ramos, sworn in yesterday as the new president of the Philippines,
declared as his priority the restoration of 'civic order' in order that
business and the economy may prosper again.
In a speech capping the inaugural ceremonies, Mr Ramos said that 'without
stability, businesses cannot run, workers cannot create wealth, liberty
cannot flourish, and even individual life will be brutish and precarious'.
He also said he would seek amendments in the constitution to 'make our
political system fairer to all and more representative of the vastness and
variety of our country'.
That declaration was seen as Mr Ramos' consent to calls for a shift in the
form of government to a parliamentary system from the multi-party
presidential system, which over the past six years has contributed little to
development efforts.
Mr Ramos, who won the May 11 election with only 23.6 per cent of the vote,
said he would continue to reach out to all groups that participated in the
poll with the aim of putting an end to 'petty rivalries that have kept us
down'.
To 'nurse the economy back to health,' Mr Ramos said his administration
would concentrate on providing basic services and pursue deregulation and
privatisation.
The new president also paid tribute to former president, Mrs Corazon Aquino.
Yesterday's ceremony was the first peaceful transfer of power since 1965.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S new government, to be led by the Labour party following its
election victory last week, will be committed to market reforms of the
sluggish economy, a key economic policy adviser to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister-elect, said yesterday.
But Mr Avraham Shochat, a senior Labour MP who is a leading candidate to
become finance minister, admitted in an interview that the party had not
formulated a detailed plan for the immigration-burdened economy. This was
despite calls from the US during the election campaign for an urgent
liberalisation programme.
Mr Shochat added that, although Labour backed privatisation, it opposed
allowing at least four of the biggest state-owned companies to slip out of
government hands. They were Israel Chemicals, Israel Aircraft Industries,
the telecoms monopoly Bezeq, and the Israel Electric Corporation utility.
He suggested a majority of the shares in these four could be sold through a
stock exchange flotation, but the government would keep a form of control as
the biggest shareholder through a stake of 'at least 26 per cent'. Mr Rabin
has said he also favours keeping El Al, the state airline, under similar
control.
But Mr Shochat insisted the party's commitment to socialism had changed,
reflected in the endorsement of market-oriented reforms at a party
convention last year.
Accelerated privatisation is one measure being urged on the new government
to help cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. It is
supported by the Bank of Israel as well by as the US, which provides Israel
with Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in annual aid.
Mr Shochat said he accepted much of the central bank's advice, saying
Labour's privatisation plans would achieve 'quite a release of government
control over the economy'.
He said about Shk1bn (Pounds 217m) a year would be diverted from spending on
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to boost infrastructural
investment in Israel 'proper'. Labour hopes this will persuade the US to
provide Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to boost investment. Mr Rabin said
yesterday he sought 'continuous negotiations' with Palestinians in an effort
to reach an interim settlement in the occupied territories. He wanted to
abandon the previous custom where the parties met for a few days only every
two months.
His call was welcomed by Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, who said in
Washington: 'We were very pleased to see the statement by Mr Rabin saying,
let's engage and let's stayed engaged and let's get something done.'

FT  01 JUL 92 / Seoul moves to curb debt of 'chaebol'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government, in its latest action to curb the power of the
country's industrial conglomerates, yesterday imposed a freeze on
cross-payment loan guarantees among the 30 biggest business groups.
Subsidiaries of the family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, frequently
guarantee loans given to other units of the same industrial group. The
government wants to tighten credit to the chaebol in an attempt to reduce
their dominance of the Korean economy.
Officials claim that the loan guarantees have encouraged excessive lending
to the chaebol, while depriving loans to small and medium businesses. 'The
chaebol have built up such huge debts as a result of the cross-payment
guarantee system that they have made hostages of the commercial banks,' said
Mr Suh Sang-mok, a government MP and a leading critic of the chaebol.
'The banks fear that the collapse of one chaebol subsidiary would lead to
the downfall of the entire business as a result of the guarantees. So they
keep lending,' he explained. The government said that the total amount of
the cross-payment guarantees among the 30 chaebol amount to Won113,400bn
(Pounds 77.2bn), while their total equity capital is only Won31,400bn.
Hyundai, the chaebol that has been the subject of recent politically
motivated attacks by the government, would suffer the most under the reform.
It accounts for almost a quarter of the loan guarantees. Yesterday's action
is only considered a preliminary step. The government is expected to soon
set a ceiling on the total amount of loan guarantees, with the ceiling
gradually lowered over the next few years.
There are doubts, however, whether the government will fully implement the
reform of the guarantee system. The government has mainly relied on credit
restrictions to control the chaebol during the last few years, but to little
avail. There are indications that the government may be consequently
changing its reform strategy. Officials have recently discussed offering
incentives to the conglomerates to encourage them to specialise in a few
core businesses and dispose of unproductive assets. Attention has also
focused on measures to widen ownership and dilute the control of the family
owners. Officials believe that this would lead to more professional
management.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Reserve Bank, the country's central bank, yesterday warned
the government that any structural deterioration in the financial deficit in
tomorrow's budget could force it to tighten monetary policy.
In April, Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister, warned that the deficit was
likely to double this year to NZDollars 3.4bn (Pounds 997m) from a forecast
NZDollars 1.7bn. Financial markets have been expecting a deficit of between
NZDollars 2.7bn and NZDollars 3bn to be announced for the coming year in the
budget.
The Reserve Bank, which has been given an independent role in setting
monetary policy to secure low inflation, said in yesterday's six-monthly
statement that it was comfortable with the present fiscal position, but any
structural deterioration would pose a significant risk to the inflation
outlook.
Mr Don Brash, the governor, said that the bank's key concern was that the
fiscal outlook remained sustainable over the medium term, and that this was
how it was seen by financial markets.
In its statement, which is seen as important in forecasting the bank's
response to economic developments, the bank said it expected actual
inflation would rise from 0.8 per cent in the year ended March 1992 to 1.8
per cent by the end of the current year.
However, this increase was still well within the bank's target range for
inflation of zero to 2 per cent. It forecast that inflation would fall to
0.9 per cent by the end of next year, before rising slightly to 1 per cent
at the end of 1994.
Mr Brash said that the bank was shifting its emphasis on reducing inflation
to ensuring that low inflation was maintained in a growing economy.
'We believe the economy is entering a period of sustainable growth and feel
reasonably optimistic this recovery will not reignite inflation.'
He said people now accepted that the bank would act to suppress inflation,
leading to a drop in inflationary expectations.
However, there was still some uncertainty over how effective the employment
contracts act, which has drastically weakened trade union power, would be in
a period of economic growth, Mr Brash said.

FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: 'Dango' habit brought to book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CANDY-striped book landed on the desks of Japanese building executives
yesterday, instructing them in the fine arts of competition and the dangers
of dango, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo.
Dango are the cosy cartels arranged by Japanese construction companies to
'smooth out the bumps of competition', as one executive once put it, by
awarding contracts, fixing prices and generally rigging bids. The dango
created a harmony in the Japanese industry, but angered Washington, which
has tried to prise open the market for US contractors, a point made in the
book, Questions and Answers on Anti-Monopoly Regulations in the Construction
Industry.
Publication coincides with a warning by the construction ministry to 66
companies found to have rigged bids for government projects worth Y81bn
(Pounds 344.6m) in Saitama Prefecture, part of Greater Tokyo. Ministry
officials have generally been reluctant to crack down because their
responsibilities include representing the construction industry.
The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) had earlier decided not to prosecute the 66
companies, prompting the Japanese media to conclude the commission had
buckled under the political influence of the industry, an important supplier
of funds to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). By publishing such a
book, the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors also hopes to show
the US the industry is serious about tackling the problem.
Subtitled The Enhancement of Fair and Free Competition, the book explains
executives are not supposed to decide the outcome of tenders; a common
method is for dango members to submit higher estimates than the chosen
company, which then wins the contract.  They are told the new responsibility
to ensure free competition is a by-product of 'globalisation' and are warned
the FTC has intensified monitoring anti-monopoly laws.
While the US has presumed Japanese companies knew their method of sharing
out contracts violated laws, the federation thought it necessary to include
the question 'What is a cartel?'. The answers include a warning that
'scientific research associations' sometimes favoured as a front for dango
violate the anti-monopoly law. Some executives may be enlightened, but the
US will remain suspicious that dango are widespread.

<TEXT>
THE presidents of the four member states of Mercosur, South America's
nascent common market, have sent a signal they will press on with regional
integration, despite increasing doubts about the market's viability by the
end of 1994.
At their second presidential summit, the presidents of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay have agreed a timetable for discussing issues ranging
up to harmonising macroeconomic policies.
The presidents of Bolivia and Chile also attended, ostensibly to sign
bilateral accords with Argentina. Chile, seeking a free trade pact with the
US, is understood to be sounding out Mercosur on possible association.
Bolivia's President Jaime Paz Zamora wants full membership, meaning his
country would have to withdraw from the Andean pact, of which it is now a
member.
Bolivia is being drawn into the Mercosur orbit through its increasing trade
links with Brazil. It plans to build a gas pipeline to southern Brazil, and
has signed an agreement to develop, with Mercosur, the Paraguay and Parana
rivers into a navigable waterway.
Officials said it was vital for companies and nations to believe in the
Four's determination to meet their deadlines, now that issues such as
harmonisation of industrial standards, customs procedures and taxation are
being analysed in detail. The timetable requires work to start on removing
barriers to capital movements in March 1993, with a proposal ready for
approval by governments nine months later.
Some Argentine companies resent Brazilian 'assymetries', a codeword for
subsidies, export incentives and an undervalued exchange rate, that have led
to a flood of Brazilian imports. Brazil says no subsidies exist. But
regional trade is increasing rapidly. Trade between the Four rose from
Dollars 1.37bn (Pounds 740m) in 1985 to Dollars 3.94bn last year. It is
expected to reach Dollars 6bn in 1992.

A FREE trade pact between Czechoslovakia and the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) comes into effect as planned today,despite uncertainty
over the future of the Czech and Slovak republics.
Mr Hans-Jorg Renk, Efta spokesman, said both sides would pursue 'business as
usual', pending a review of the accord in September. Efta officials hope
that, whatever happens, the two republics will maintain a customs union and
common currency, making renegotiation of the pact unnecessary.
Efta, grouping Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland, also hopes this month to conclude negotiations on free trade
pacts with Hungary and Poland. Mr Renk said talks with Hungary had made good
progress, despite earlier complaints by Budapest that Efta countries were
insisting on tougher terms than the EC, with whom Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia all have association accords.
Outstanding problems concern trade in farm goods, where Efta countries have
shown themselves reluctant to open their markets to cheaper east European
produce.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Colombia clarifies foreign investors' tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Colombian Congress has passed legislation clearing up uncertainty about
the tax treatment of foreign investors, although such investment will still
be treated less favourably than originally proposed by the government.
The legislation had been stuck in Congress for months; legislators made
various proposals that would have set tax levels so high that foreign
investors would have been driven away.
Although the tax burden on foreign companies will initially be fairly heavy,
the rate will drop significantly in succeeding years, particularly for those
reinvesting part of their profits in the country.
Mr Rudolf Hommes, finance minister, said: 'I like this bias in favour of
investment.' Although the government would have preferred more favourable
terms for foreign investors, 'it clears up the situation of uncertainty in
relation to economic policy, and puts public finance near equilibrium.'
The government needed to raise tax revenues, in part to replace lost income
from reduced taxes and duties on foreign trade. The 1991 fiscal deficit is
forecast at about 1.4 per cent of GDP, but 1 per cent of this is due to weak
coffee prices, which increase government transfers to growers.
Foreign companies will be liable for the basic income tax rate of 30 per
cent and a surtax charge of 7.5 per cent. The tax on profit remittance
starts at 12 per cent in 1993 and, for non-oil companies, falls to 7 per
cent by 1996.
For oil companies, the rates are higher because of a 600 peso/barrel (92 US
cent) production tax and because the profit remittance tax will stay at 12
per cent.
Although the reform allows for a withholding tax of up to 30 per cent on
incoming foreign currency, it is unlikely the rate will be anywhere near
this level.
As high tax would encourage black market dealing and evasion, the figure
will probably be nearer 10 per cent.
Plans to raise value-added tax from 12 per cent to 18 per cent had to be
scrapped and VAT was set at 14 per cent; the long list of exceptions include
agricultural machinery.
Duties on luxury items such as spirits and private vehicles range from 35 to
45 per cent.
The change in VAT and many of the other reforms apply up to 1997, when a new
package will be needed.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Fears grow over pace of US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CONSUMER confidence stalled in June, adding to fears that the recovery's
momentum is flagging, a New York business analysis group reported yesterday.
The Conference Board's widely-followed confidence index registered a
disappointing 71.7 last month, fractionally lower than in May and far below
the 100 plus level normal in a vigorous recovery.
Separately, the Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators
rose 0.6 per cent in May, in line with expectations.
The figures were released as Federal Reserve governors and regional
presidents met in Washington to review monetary policy. The meeting
continues today. The Fed is under strong political pressure to lower
interest rates.
Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary, said it 'mattered a lot' that the Fed
had allowed the money supply to undershoot its targets 'week after week'. If
the Fed was uncertain about the significance of weak money numbers, the
prudent course would be to 'over-insure'.
Mr Brady said the Fed should heed President George Bush's explicit call last
week for lower interest rates.
The Fed's decision on rates is likely to be heavily influenced by employment
figures for June, due out tomorrow. But even if the figures are bad it may
delay a rate cut to avoid the impression of bowing to political pressure.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the levelling off in
consumer confidence after increases in the preceding three months indicated
the recovery was 'still quite feeble'. He said consumers' buying plans had
weakened between May and June.
The number of respondents reporting bad business conditions outnumbered
optimists by a margin of more than three to one. On employment prospects,
the negative margin was even greater.
The index of leading indicators rose 0.6 per cent in May following increases
of 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent in April and March.
The May increase was led by gains in commodity prices and an extension of
the average factory work-week. Six of the 11 components of the index,
however, made negative contributions, including orders for consumer and
capital goods and the money supply.
The leading index's reliability is widely doubted. Last year it rose
steadily from February to July, failing to give early warning of a sharp
economic slowdown in the autumn.
An index of coincident indicators designed to gauge the economy's current
health failed to rise in May, having been flat in both March and April. This
points to sluggish growth in the second quarter.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN is hoping to secure a commitment from all the leading industrial
countries to set the end of 1993 as the deadline for implementing many of
the decisions taken at the Rio Earth Summit.
The prime minister, Mr John Major, has written to the heads of government of
all the European Community and Group of Seven countries proposing an
eight-point plan to preserve the momentum created by the event.
The points were agreed by EC leaders at their recent Lisbon summit. They
will now be put to the G7, which includes the US, Japan and Canada, at next
week's summit in Munich.
Mr Major wants industrial countries to ratify the Rio convention on climate
change and draw up plans to implement it by the end of next year.
He is proposing a similar deadline to draw up plans for the second Rio
treaty, on protecting bio-diversity, though he is not pressing for
ratification because the US has already refused to sign. Other points in his
letter include a suggestion that countries say how they will implement
Agenda 21, the Rio action programme, and give financial support to help
poorer nations implement it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE was yesterday hit by a series of strikes and demonstrations as
farmers, dockers, airline pilots and lorry drivers stepped up campaigns of
industrial unrest.
Traffic ground to a halt on a number of roads and motorways when lorry
drivers protesting against changes in the driving licence system set up
dozens of road blocks. Under the new system which comes into force today a
driver can lose his licence by accumulating penalties for traffic offences.
The Nord/Pas de Calais and Rhone-Alpes regions were badly affected. Tourists
arriving from Britain and Belgium found most of the roads to Paris from the
south blocked.
Farmers, who have for the past fortnight been demonstrating against the
European Community's agricultural reforms, yesterday staged another day of
protest. The town centre at Bourg-en-Bresse, north of Lyon, was brought to a
halt by 200 demonstrators. A high speed train was forced to stop for 30
minutes on the Toulouse to Paris line. Nearly 200 farmers cemented up the
entrance to the Saone-et-Loire police headquarters at Macon.
Elsewhere there were protests against the Maastricht treaty. Coachloads of
French dockers joined Spanish and Italian counterparts to seal off the
customs post at Perthus in the Pyrenees. More than 1,500 dockers arrived at
the scene as part of a 24-hour strike.
French air travel was disrupted by the start of a two day strike by pilots
and mechanics at Air Inter, the French domestic airline. Air Inter said a
quarter of its 416 scheduled flights were cancelled because of the strike.
This industrial unrest is taking place against the background of a steady
rise in French unemployment, adds Ian Davidson.
It reached a new peak of just over 2.9m last month in seasonally adjusted
figures, the Labour Ministry announced. The total, equal to 10 per cent of
the active population, is an increase of 0.5 per cent on the previous month
and 8.6 per cent on the year.
The stricter definition of the Geneva-based International Labour Office,
however, produces a smaller figure of just under 2.5m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK presidency of the European Community, which starts today, is likely
to be saved considerable embarrassment following the Commission's decision
to postponepending European Court cases for alleged British environmental
infractions.
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, will, moreover, be handling the
environment portfolio personally, following the departure of Mr Carlo Ripa
di Meana, the environment commissioner, to join the new Italian government.
Mr Ripa di Meana was perhaps the sharpest Commission thorn in the UK's side,
leading to the celebrated remarks of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
before last December's Maastricht summit that Brussels was seeking to 'exert
its influence in every nook and cranny of daily life'.
Officials in Brussels and Luxembourg made clear yesterday that the
Commission was anxious to help the UK presidency, which has the uphill task
of steering through ratification of the Maastricht treaty after Danish
voters rejected it on June 2.
At the Commission's request, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has
postponed hearings, scheduled for today, on the UK's alleged failure to
comply with an EC directive on bathing water purity. Brussels is also likely
to hold off on other cases which Mr Ripa di Meana had been preparing,
notably the UK's alleged failure to carry out environment impact assessments
before allowing through road and construction projects. These have not yet
reached the Court.
'We wouldn't like to see the Court sentencing the UK at the very moment the
Commission is meeting the British government in London,' an EC official
explained. The Commission and the British government kick off the UK
presidency at a special meeting today.
The Court invariably grants the request of either of the litigants if they
request postponement, provided the other agrees. This usually signals an
out-of-court solution and lightens a heavy workload.
In the bathing water case, however, legal sources, Commission and UK
officials concur that Brussels and London have cut a political deal to
smooth Maastricht's ratification, probably following last week's meeting
between Mr Delors and Mr John Major, the British prime minister.
The bathing water case was rescheduled once before, prior to April's general
election in the UK. See supplement - Europe: state of the union.

FT  01 JUL 92 / Brussels investment directive receives a cautious welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN banks and brokers gave a cautious welcome to the terms of the
Investment Services Directive (ISD) agreed by European Community finance
ministers on Monday.
The agreement gives investment firms a 'single passport' to deal in shares
throughout the European Community. It covers three key issues - of
transparency, concentration and freedom of access - leaving only minor
details to be resolved in the next few weeks, EC officials said.
The deal seems unlikely to pull international trading away from the City of
London, where much of the European equities business is currently conducted.
The issue of transparency - the distribution of information about prices and
volumes of securities trades - proved a stumbling block in the negotiations,
as market environments vary sharply.
The UK had wanted the directive to allow some delay before price and volume
details are released to the market, for fear that rapid disclosure would put
City marketmakers at a disadvantage, whereas some of the Mediterranean
countries wanted the information to be released more quickly. Many UK houses
are pressing for more details concerning the exclusion clauses agreed in the
directive, which would allow them to delay the reporting of large
transactions or deals in illiquid stocks.
Individual exchanges will be free to define what constitutes a large or
illiquid trade.
For French brokers, the new directive represents a less restrictive system,
since reporting requirements are already very stringent. The Bourse's
screen-based system reports price and volume information immediately.
Commerzbank, one of Germany's biggest banks, said it did not expect the new
directive to have much effect on the country's larger financial institutions
which were already represented on important EC stock exchanges.

UKRAINE is seeking a Dollars 1.52bn (Pounds 820m) stabilisation fund from
the west to support its currency, the hryvnia, after it has quit the Russian
rouble zone, Mr Vadim Hetman, chairman of the Ukraine National Bank, said in
London yesterday.
Mr Hetman said Ukraine plans to leave the rouble zone, which maintains
parity between Russian and Ukrainian currencies, by October 1. It will then
allow its interim 'coupon' currency, at present used domestically, to float
in value. Technical preparations for introducing the hryvnia should be
completed by next January. But it is unclear whether Ukraine will introduce
the hryvnia and new hryvnia bank notes then.
Mr Hetman said Ukraine had not yet decided whether to peg the hryvnia to a
specific currency, though the Ecu and a basket of western currencies were
being considered.

FT  01 JUL 92 / All roubles are free, but some freer than others: Leyla
Boulton on a very Russian convertibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY was the magic date set by the Russian government to begin a decisive
march towards a convertible rouble and achieve a central goal of its
ambitious market reforms. However, as is often the case in Russia, the facts
on the day look somewhat different.
Internal convertibility, one of the most seductive yet elusive goals of the
reforms, was supposed to begin with the introduction on July 1 of a single,
free-floating exchange rate for all current transactions. This was to be
followed a month later by attempts to defend the rouble at a fixed exchange
rate - with the support of a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund provided
by the west. The latter part of the timetable has since been recognised as
over-ambitious and will only happen some time next year.
But only yesterday, the Russian authorities were locked in last-minute
arguments, among themselves and with the International Monetary Fund, over
whether to let the market decide the new rate today despite an announcement
by the foreign economic affairs ministry only last week that a market rate
would be applied.
Mr Igor Knaziev, head of the Russian Central Bank's exchange rate
department, said yesterday he had received orders to post not a market rate
 -which was Rbs144 to the dollar on the Moscow inter-bank currency exchange
yesterday - but the weighted average for last month's trades on the exchange
 -calculated at Rbs125.26.
Such a move, prompted by official fears that the market would not generate a
'correct' exchange rate, will mean that more than one exchange rate will
remain in place, postponing a central goal of reforms planned by the
government and desired by the IMF.
It also illustrates the chaos and temptation of half-measures as the
government attempts to push through reforms which will attract both foreign
support and appease domestic critics at home.
It would also mean that the main changes to come into effect today would be
ancillary measures on taxation - which were supposed to go hand in hand with
a single rate.
These include an obligation for all exporters (and not just exporters of key
raw materials) to sell half their foreign exchange earnings to the state.
But the whole point of the reform was to encourage enterprises to sell their
foreign exchange at a market rate - rather than at a less favourable
controlled rate.
The other changes will be a re-introduction of an import tax of 5 per cent
for all goods except medicine and food which will remain tax free, and
luxury goods such as cars which will be taxed at 10 per cent. State
organisations will have to receive additional subsidies to enable them to
continue to buy imports after the specially subsidised exchange rates for
imports disappear.
Mr Knaziev said he was not sure whether the controlled rate would be
maintained beyond today but he thought it likely that it would be kept for
the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the government has not yet spelled out at what rate foreign
investors will be able to convert rouble profits into hard currency,
although they are likely to continue to use the currency exchange.
The row over convertibility also illustrates the difficulties for the IMF as
it tries to hammer out concrete assistance for Russia. A visiting IMF team,
which is trying to finalise an agreement granting a Dollars 1bn loan to
Moscow, was yesterday attempting to persuade the Russian authorities to
stick to their original idea of floating the rouble so that market forces
would come to play. One possible outcome was that nothing would change today
to give the authorities more time to sort out a final decision.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serbian government yesterday announced wage and price controls, blaming
international sanctions for the deterioration of the economy.
At the same time, Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, reported that the
Yugoslav federal government would devalue the dinar by 85 per cent from
today.
The currency has plummeted over the past year as the already weak Serbian
economy has been hit by the cost of waging war with Croatia and Bosnia and
the severance of trade ties with the former Yugoslav neighbouring republics.
Mr Radoman Bozovic, Serbia's prime minister, said the sanctions were unjust
and 'causing enormous social and material damage'. Industrial production
would drop by an extra 40 per cent in the next quarter as a direct result,
he claimed. It fell by 30 per cent in the first three months, the same
period in 1991. He added that 100,000 workers had already been sent on
compulsory vacation.
The Serbian economy was already in decline before the UN sanctions were
imposed last month, cutting off all economic ties including an oil embargo.
Monthly inflation last month hit 102.3 per cent, according to official
figures released yesterday. Mr Bozovic said wages had to be curbed and
prices strictly controlled. The prices of basic goods, including medicine,
flour and sugar, would be frozen.

FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (7): Doors open to
reveal hotbed of hostility - Mergers and acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has become a hotbed of hostile mergers and acquisitions activity - a
hotbed by German standards, that is.
German companies have traditionally conducted their M &amp; A business behind
closed doors and done their deals on friendly terms. This still remains the
case for the majority of transactions, but at least four recent 'situations'
show how aggressive tactics have started to creep into the German M &amp; A
market place.
The four cases are Pirelli's assault on Continental, a battle between two of
Europe's leading tyre companies; in the insurance sector Aachener und
Munchener Beteilgungs' (AMB) tussle with Assurances Generales de France
(AGF); Krupp's takeover of rival steel-maker Hoesch and - less prominent but
still significant - the takeover of Sabo-Maschinenfabrik - a manufacturer of
lawn-mowers - by the German subsidiary of the US-based John Deere group.
The Conti-Pirelli saga started in late 1990 when Pirelli, the big Italian
tyre company, initiated a campaign to get control of Continental, its German
rival.
The Italian company never went so far as to make a takeover bid, it merely
agitated for control. Meanwhile, Continental fought tooth and nail for
independence, losing a chief executive in the process but ultimately forcing
the Italians to retreat.
On December 1 last year mounting financial problems led Pirelli to withdraw
from talks and consequently from its takeover attempt. However, there has
been a resurgence of hostilities during the past few months.
The two companies, which say they have not ruled out the idea of a full
merger in three or four years' time, are now squabbling once again. Pirelli,
which has a 5 per cent stake in Continental plus options over a further 34
per cent, will early this month launch its second attempt to overturn voting
restrictions which limit a shareholders' vote to 5 per cent no matter how
big that shareholders' stake.
For its part, Continental has hit back by demanding repayment of the
dividend it paid to Pirelli last year.
The situation is complicated by the fact that the two companies are still in
friendly talks over the sale of some of Pirelli's non-tyre businesses -
which Continental would like to buy - and Continental would like Pirelli's
support for a move which allow it to raise its share capital by a nominal
DM150m.
If the Continental/Pirelli saga has been marked by complexity and
vituperation, the AMB/AGF affair has been even more complex and
vituperative. So far, it has proved equally inconclusive.
AMB, Germany's second biggest insurance group, is fighting off the
attentions of AGF, the big state-owned French insurance company which has
amassed 25 per cent of the German company's shares.
AMB first approached the French company in April 1990 with a view to
co-operation in the run-up to a single European market for insurance. When
the French company came up with concrete proposals, AMB decided that AGF
wanted control not co-operation. Then relations between the two companies
became sour, and have become steadily more so.
AMB is now refusing to register the voting rights on the bulk of the AGF
holding - which it is entitled to do under an arcane part of German company
law. AGF is planning to attack Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, AMB's chief
executive, at AMB's forthcoming annual meeting.
Audit firms have been retained by both parties to prove the legitimacy, or
otherwise, of a series of transactions entered into by AMB. AGF is trying to
bring in Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank, as a buyer for BfG Bank,
AMB's troubled banking subsidiary.
By comparison, the Krupp/Hoesch takeover seems a model of sweet-tempered
co-operation. This is not, however, how it would have seemed to the Hoesch
management board, and in particular to Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who was appointed
chief executive last summer.
Mr Neukirchen had ambitious plans to restructure the group on his own - but
was taken somewhat by surprise last October when he discovered that Krupp
had acquired a 24.9 per cent stake in the company.
At this point, Mr Neukirchen said that Krupp's tactics were 'unfriendly'. He
did not repeat this allegation - probably because he did not have time. Mr
Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Krupp, said in the autumn that a majority
of Hoesch shareholders were in favour of his plans. By the end of the year,
Krupp had taken its direct holding in Hoesch to more than 50 per cent. There
was little that Neukirchen could do to preserve Hoesch's independence.
Relations between the two companies never degenerated into outright
hostility. Nevertheless Krupp's tactics represented a break with tradition.
Krupp and Hoesch had flirted with the idea of co-operation for decades, and
it is likely that they would have carried on talking for another decade or
two had it not been for Krupp's share purchases. Krupp moved rapidly and
decisively, leaving Hoesch with minimal room for manoeuvre. By German
standards, the stratagem counts as hostile.
The Sabo affair received less publicity than that of Hoesch/Krupp - the
company is small, with turnover of DM125m last year - but its consequences
for the future of German M &amp; A may be far-reaching, too.
In March last year a group of German institutional investors - including the
Colonia insurance company - mounted a successful challenge against Sabo's
voting rights restrictions.
Once these were overturned, it was only a matter of time before the company
lost its independence and in August John Deere of the US announced that it
had bought majority control of the German company.
Like Krupp/Hoesch, the episode was unusual for Germany - first because the
institutions took such an active role in removing the voting restrictions
and, second, since it was done against the express wishes of Deutsche Bank,
Germany's biggest bank, which sided with the management of Sabo against the
insurers at the vote last year.
Scenting that the German M &amp; A market is undergoing a fundamental change,
increasing numbers of Anglo-American investment bankers have set up shop in
Frankfurt over the past two to three years. These include Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs, Wasserstein Perella and Kleinwort Benson.
Whether there is enough work to go round, is another question: German
companies rely on their commercial banks or on in-house expertise and it is
noteworthy that neither Krupp nor Hoesch employed an investment bank until
after Hoesch's fate was sealed.

FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (6): Barriers are
blurred at the edges - Banking and insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN GERMANY, as in other European countries in the late eighties and early
nineties, there has been a gradual blurring of the barriers between
insurance and banking.
Driven on by the idea of Allfinanz - providing a range of services which
straddles the traditional divide between insurance and banking - German
banks have moved into insurance and insurance companies into banking.
The rationale for this is straightforward. Banks profit from adding
insurance to their product range, while insurance companies prosper from
getting access to the bank's distribution network and customer base.
As in other European countries, co-operation has taken a number of different
forms: one leading insurance company has bought a majority stake in a bank;
banks and insurance companies have exchanged share stakes and set up
cross-marketing agreements; a number of banks have set up their own
independent life assurance subsidiaries, including Deutsche Bank, the
largest in Germany, which set up its own operation in 1989.
In practice, a number of serious complications have arisen, highlighted
earlier this year by the Bundeskartellamt's (Federal Cartel Office) attack
on links between Dresdner Bank - Germany's second biggest bank - and
Allianz, Germany's biggest insurance company.
The Berlin-based cartel office has ordered Allianz to reduce its 22.3 per
cent stake in the bank, accusing it of exercising undue dominance over
Dresdner's management. It said that Allianz exercised enough influence over
the Dresdner board to prevent it from taking a decision to set up its own
life subsidiary, as Deutsche Bank did, thereby restricting competition in
Germany's DM60bn-plus market.
It also ordered the two institutions to cut back their marketing
co-operation in western Germany and to abandon plans to pursue further
co-operation in the southern part of eastern Germany. The cartel office
believes that - taking account of a web of shareholdings in other German
insurance companies - Allianz has an unhealthy dominance of the domestic
market.
The two parties jointly denounced the cartel office's ruling. They say that
it is nonsense to suggest that Allianz dominated decision-making on the
Dresdner Board, and dismiss the argument that Allianz is stopping Dresdner
from setting up on its own as hypothetical. They point out that as long ago
as 1987 Dresdner took a decision not to set up on its own. The bank cannot
be prevented from doing something it has never wanted to do, they argue.
Analysts suggest that there is considerably more to this imbroglio than
meets the eye. Dresdner is rumoured to have been astonished - and
disconcerted - at the size of the Allianz stake when it emerged last year.
Moreover, there is speculation that it may now regret its decision not to
set up on its own.
Deutsche Bank's own life subsidiary - DB Leben - has been a success and
Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche's chief executive, never tires of stressing how
pleased the bank is with its investment. Contrary to widespread fears at the
time DB Leben was founded in 1989, Deutsche does not appear to have
alienated the insurance industry. At the time it was thought likely that
Deutsche would lose business from its insurance clients - especially on the
securities and investment management side - but this has not happened.
Thus - conspiracy theorists argue - Wolfgang Roller, Dresdner's chief
executive, may indeed have started to entertain the idea of setting up its
own subsidiary, but is now prevented from doing so because of Allianz
breathing down its neck. The theory is lent credence by Mr Roller's decision
to retire as chief executive earlier than expected and to take up the post
of chairman of the Dresdner supervisory board. Had he not done this, the
post could have gone to Wolfgang Schieren, Allianz's recently retired chief
executive.
Of course, this interpretation of the situation is denied by the two
institutions. In public they remain committed to their marketing agreement
and they have rebuffed the cartel office's criticisms, thus opening the way
to a long drawn-out legal battle. In a recent interview with the Financial
Times, Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, Schieren's successor as Allianz's chief
executive, said that Dresdner was quite free to take whatever strategic
steps it liked, even if they conflicted with Allianz's own interests.
'It is simply not true that we in any way dominate the management of the
bank,' he insisted. 'We are not in a position to do that, given the size of
our holding - nor do we have the ambition to do that. It would be in
conflict with our basic philosophy as an investor. The shareholding in
Dresdner is a very good long-term financial investment for us.'
The Allianz/Dresdner affair has caused a few headaches for the management of
the two institutions, but nothing on the scale of the complications caused
by the decision of Germany's second largest insurance group to buy a
controlling stake in its own bank.
Aachener und Munchner Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's number two insurer after
Allianz, bought a majority stake in BfG Bank - a big German bank  - in 1987.
As a result of a series of disasters, the bank has cost its parent company a
colossal DM2.65bn so far. AMB itself is now on the receiving end of what it
calls a hostile takeover attempt from Assurances Generales de France, the
big French state-owned insurer which has amassed a 25 per cent plus stake in
the German company.
This was more than AMB bargained for when it acquired a stake which was
supposed to offer an opportunity for cross-selling. Nor is it a good
advertisement for the Allfinanz concept.

FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (5): Envy mixed
with deep suspicion - For years, the Bundesbank has been at or near the
centre of world monetary affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S central bank, the Bundesbank, is regarded with envy, respect, and
sometimes awe by its admirers and with scepticism or deep suspicion by its
critics and detractors.
For years, the Bundesbank has been at or near the centre of world monetary
affairs, its importance increased by western Germany's steady post-war rise
to economic prominence and bolstered by its legally guaranteed independence.
Today, the D-Mark is by far the most important currency in western Europe
and a vital element in the move towards economic and financial cohesion in
the EC.
But it is these very attributes which lead to concern among those who
dislike the Bundesbank's dominance of EC monetary affairs and the European
Monetary System (EMS). On the one hand, the link with the D-Mark has enabled
countries such as France to pursue stability-oriented policies which have
brought inflation down to a level lower than that in west Germany, currently
bearing the burden of trying to integrate its new eastern states.
But this French success has not been without economic cost, especially in
terms of employment. The UK, which belatedly joined the EMS - though with a
wider margin of currency fluctuation than the core members - is also
bringing down inflation successfully, but is finding that the cure for past
monetary laxity is painful. It is hardly surprising that those opposed to
the Bundesbank's dominant role in EC financial affairs find it easy to point
the finger of criticism at the Frankfurt central bankers.
The truth is, though, that the Bundesbank did not seek out this role. It is
a natural consequence of the so-called anchor position of the German
currency within the EMS and its part in helping to promote economic
convergence in the European Community. This reflects both the efforts of the
Bundesbank to help promote growth in Germany at the lowest inflation rate
possible - it would like to see the latter back to 2 per cent from the
present 4 per cent plus level - and the strength of the country's economy.
However, an assessment of the Bundesbank now has to take two outstanding new
factors into account, neither of which featured in the four decades after
the Second World War. The first is German unification, which has put massive
pressure on public finances and left the Bundesbank struggling to contain
the impact. The second is the drive towards European monetary union (Emu)
and economic union, with political union also on the agenda.
The rejoining of west and east Germany was a momentous event, but it has
left the united country with a big financial headache. After first promising
voters that no tax increases would be necessary to pay for the consequences
of unification, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition government
found it quickly had to backtrack. It has also had to borrow heavily to help
meet the spending commitments in east Germany, which turned out to be in a
much worse economic and environmental state than most experts had realised.
This year, everything seemed to come to a head. Inflation advanced to a peak
in March of 4.8 per cent, well above what the Bundesbank and most German
citizens regard as acceptable in a country which suffered grievously from
the horrors of runaway prices earlier this century. Wage negotiators slapped
in demands of around 10 per cent and the country was threatened with a wave
of damaging strikes at a time when economic growth was less than robust. And
public confidence in the Bonn government's ability to keep control over its
finances sunk to a new low.
In the midst of all this, the Bundesbank has been trying to steer a tight
monetary course. Last December, it lifted official interest rates further to
try and ward off inflation and make clear to employers, employees, unions,
and the government that it was not prepared to accommodate unreasonable pay,
price, and spending rises. This left the discount rate at 8 per cent and the
more important Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent, levels which are uncomfortably
high for the rest of Europe.
Coming just as the Maastricht treaty on EC monetary and economic union had
been signed, the German rate increases led to accusations that the
Bundesbank was operating selfishly and without enough regard for the needs
of other countries. Those charges have faded as it has become clear that the
central bank is faced with a serious problem of inflation and that it has
proved hard to convince the west German public of the need to tighten its
collective belt to meet the financial challenge of unification.
But German interest rates do not look like coming down for some time yet,
maybe not even this year. The Bundesbank regards the 1992 wage deals as
still too high, even though they were below 6 per cent compared with the 7
per cent of last year. Unit labour costs will rise by some 4 per cent this
year, a figure that the bank said recently was 'not reconcilable with the
aim of price stability'.
Even so, it is hopeful that next year's pay deals will be more moderate, now
that a damaging strike has been avoided in the car and engineering industry
with an agreement for a 5.8 per cent rise this year and one of 3.4 per cent
for 1993. It is still worried, though, by the price rises of 6 per cent or
so in the building and service sectors, stating that 'considerable
inflationary tensions still exist'.
In outlining its determination to tackle these, the Bundesbank also brings
its wider European responsibilities into the argument, thus countering those
who allege it has acted against the spirit of Maastricht. Because other
countries like France, the Benelux countries, Italy, the UK and Spain have
tied their currencies to the D-Mark through their membership of the EMS, the
performance of the German currency is vital to the process of economic
convergence which precedes Emu, if it ever comes about.
Thus the Bundesbank sees it as its domestic and European duty to bring down
Germany's inflation rate and preserve the monetary stability upon which the
EMS is based and on which Emu will depend. It is also concerned about the
fact that German money supply has been growing far more rapidly than the
target figure, partly because of bank lending to finance east German
corporate investments but also because of the attractiveness of high
short-term interest rates.
With Mr Helmut Schlesinger's presidency of the Bundesbank due to run for
just over another year, the institution's stern anti-inflationary efforts
are set to continue in force. But it is not just Mr Schlesinger's legacy
that is at stake. His successor, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the present deputy
president, will be in charge over the crucial period preceding the attempt
to introduce Emu. He believes that countries wishing to participate will
have to make strenuous efforts to meet the Maastricht criteria - and that
goes for Germany, too.
