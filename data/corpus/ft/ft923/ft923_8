</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following an order from Bergamo Airport, contracts to supply communications
recording equipment to Italian airports won by RACAL RECORDERS have now
exceeded Pounds 1m. In the past two years the company has sold equipment to
both major and secondary airports as part of the country's civil aviation
authority upgrade programme.
The order from Bergamo Airport is for a Wordsafe voice logging recorder.
This desktop, multi-channel voice logging recorder, provides a range of
configurations from 4 to 32 channels and over 24 hours of continuous
recording on a single VHS cassette.
During the last two years, significant contracts have been awarded by the
AAAV (Azienda Autonoma Assistenza al Volo) to Racal Recorders for its ICR64
multi-channel communications recorder, used to record voice communications
between air traffic controllers and aircrew.
Racal's ICR64 recorders have been installed at a number of airports in Italy
including Milan-Linate, Rome-Fiumicino, Napoli, Turin, Bologna and Brindisi.
Racal Recorders, part of the Racal Electronics Group, is based in Hythe,
Hampshire.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: UK financial reports repay a diligent
reader - The need for skill in interpreting company accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE DAVIES, RON PATERSON and ALLISTER WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATE of UK financial reporting has provoked some agitated debate in
recent weeks, even verging on a state of panic. It has been suggested that
accounts have become so unreliable as to be valueless. We fundamentally
disagree.
After months researching UK accounting policies and their application in the
accounts of several hundred leading British companies for a book published
next week, we feel equipped to offer a different view.
No one would claim that the present rules on financial reporting in this
country are ideal. But we believe British company accounts compare very
favourably with those of most other countries, and provide a great deal of
useful information for those with the skill to interpret it.
Regrettably, we sometimes wonder how many users of accounts really have that
skill. Although this might be considered the fault of over-complicated
accounts, we think it might equally be seen as a criticism of the users.
One perennial problem lies in the widespread misunderstanding of what
accounts can, and cannot, do. Their arithmetical neatness suggests to the
layman a precision and completeness that is in fact wholly unattainable. The
affairs of large companies are highly complex, and can no more be
encapsulated in a few simple measures than can the workings of the British
economy.
Accounts should not be regarded as objective statements of fact, but only as
a subjective and stylised description of a company's financial affairs.
The underlying reality which they seek to describe is to be found in the
transactions which the company undertakes, and the cash flows which are
derived from them. This is where objective reality stops, and subjective
interpretation has to take over.
There is an extensive framework of rules and practices which govern the
presentation of accounts. But their application requires considerable
professional judgment, and different people will make different choices in
exercising that judgment. In addition, accounts have to deal with estimates
as well as known amounts, and there is obviously room for differences of
opinion when making these estimates.
Sophisticated investors know this, and also understand the political
motivations which influence the manner in which boards of directors wish to
present their companies. Consequently, they treat the accounts with an
appropriate degree of circumspection.
They also appreciate that the accounts are only a small part of the total
information available about a company to assist their investment decisions,
and give them appropriate weight alongside these other sources.
Despite this, we frequently hear cries such as: 'How can Polly Peck go bust
when its last accounts reported record profits?' Such a question can easily
be answered by anyone diligent enough to have read the last accounts in
full, as they clearly demonstrate that this was a high risk investment and
not suitable for widows and orphans.
Both the low UK tax charge and the segmental analysis showed that most
profit was not earned in the UK but in much more risky economies. A simple
rearrangement of the statement of source and application of funds into the
format of a cash flow statement would have revealed a very large outflow of
cash from operating activities. It was also quite evident that the group had
just taken on a very significant debt burden in connection with the Del
Monte acquisition.
This is not to imply that the accounting profession can be self-satisfied
about the state of UK financial reporting. Many companies produce excellent
annual reports, and their boards clearly take their reporting
responsibilities very seriously. But some others are much less praiseworthy
and convey a shifty and devious impression, using creative accounting to
prop up their otherwise sagging performance.
One positive feature of UK accounting rules is that they require extensive
disclosures. These usually make it abundantly clear to the informed reader
that the company is presenting a somewhat generous view of its financial
position. For example, even though the existing standards on accounting for
acquisitions are weak, the disclosure requirements are strong.
The unfortunate thing is that so few analysts and other commentators seem to
be capable of recognising these signs. If they were, the market place itself
could act as a more effective force for good accounting.
In the absence of a stronger influence towards good accounting from the
market place, do the accounting rules need to be improved? In principle,
yes, but this is easier said than done. We certainly do not need more rules.
Accounting standards which seek to regulate every conceivable circumstance
are ultimately self-defeating because they get bogged down in their own
complexity and often open more loopholes than they close.
More insidiously, they risk changing the nature of financial reporting from
a process of communication to a compliance exercise, in which anything which
is not explicitly forbidden acquires a spurious legitimacy. That spawns an
avoidance industry which sees accounting rules in the same light as tax
laws.
Passing more laws does not make people more honest. What we need is clearer
principles, which make it harder for preparers of accounts to rationalise
dubious treatments both to themselves and to their auditors.
Based on our review of company accounts, we believe that some of the areas
which are most open to abuse do not correspond to the apparent priorities of
the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). These include fair value accounting,
and the treatment of fixed assets and depreciation.
There are also a number of existing accounting standards which are in urgent
need of reform. We would highlight SSAP 15, on deferred tax, and SSAP 24, on
accounting for pension costs. Although the ASB commissioned studies on these
issues a year ago, we have yet to see any results.
In addition, we have doubts about some of the topics already tackled by the
ASB. Just ten months after the new cash flow standard was introduced, for
example, our research shows that widespread inconsistencies have already
developed through what we identify as deficiencies in the standard.
We are glad to see that the ASB has embarked on the most difficult challenge
of all laying down a framework for accounting in its Statement of
Principles. While we are not convinced that their proposals under this
project so far are heading in the right direction, we entirely endorse their
decision to undertake the quest.
But the main problem is one of interpretation. It is not that UK accounts
fail to provide useful and reliable information. They convey a great deal to
the diligent and skilled reader. What we most need is to expand the number
of these readers with these attributes.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting new life
into the business of death - Kate Button lifts the lid on American funerals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the streamers unfurl, balloons pop and the calypso band clatters
castanets, you could be forgiven for thinking you were attending a birthday
party. However, in California it is quite likely to be the celebration of a
loved one's death.
A new-found enthusiasm for the macabre on the west coast of America has led
to the transformation of the traditional funeral into a more personalised
event; an innovative and lucrative market has developed to cater for the
eccentricities of the deceased and the bereaved.
In the US, the Federal Trade Commission calculates the cost of a funeral -
on average Dollars 4,000-5,000 excluding a headstone and cemetery plot - is
the third largest single expenditure an individual is likely to make, after
a home and a car. Casket mark-up can be 15 times cost and traditional
funeral administration fees have risen sharply in recent years.
The high cost of dying has encouraged enterprising individuals to arrange
their farewell celebrations before they depart, thus ensuring that the
ceremony reflects their personality and they receive value for money.
Memorial celebrations range from fancy dress parties, pre-taped video
performances by the deceased and champagne cruises to scatter ashes at sea.
With increasing awareness of environmental issues, cremation is fast
becoming a popular alternative to customary funeral burials. In an effort to
meet the increased demand for unconventional requests, start-up funeral
service businesses are appearing all over the west coast offering a variety
of options which the traditional funeral directors fail to supply.
For Dollars 1,500, the deceased can be cremated and have their ashes
scattered at sea or laid to rest in a flower garden designed specifically
for that purpose. The more adventurous can have remains encased in a
mini-rocket and catapulted into outer space to orbit the earth for eternity.
Dale Suess, historian and consultant to the industry says: 'The traditional
funeral industry doesn't offer options and if you want cremation you are
considered cheap. The businesses that succeed in this industry will be those
that provide what the people want.'
In San Francisco, a 'death boutique' called the Ghia Gallery opened in 1990
offering custom-made urns which can double up as table lamps or high-tech
robots. More bizarre is jewellery designed to carry the ashes of the dearly
departed. For those who still prefer burial, the Gallery has an
Egyptian-style sarcophagus at Dollars 7,995 or, specifically for female
customers, a coffin lined with mirrors, which doubles as a vanity mirror
prior to 'departure'.
'The lid has been taken off the last taboo', says Alex Ghia, the gallery's
founder. 'The institutionalised way of dealing with death showed us a
glaring lack of individuality and personal meaning. We offer the public
choices for dealing with death.'
Funeral venues are also benefiting from the less traditional west coast
approach to death, as it becomes increasingly acceptable for mausoleums and
cemeteries to be used for events other than funerals.
The Neptune Society Columbarium (NSC), a mausoleum in Richmond, California,
regularly stages ballet performances, Himalayan bells concerts,
Shakespearean plays and recitals for the San Francisco Saxophone Quartet,
which recently recorded its latest album there. The giant rotunda, with its
stained glass windows and tiered balconies, houses the cremated remains of
more than 15,000 people and promises any performing artist a capacity crowd.
For a percentage of the ticket sales, the venue can be used for almost any
performance 'within the realms of good taste', says Ron Cox, the Neptune
Society manager. In May, it hosted its first wedding.
While the cost of staging a performance at the NSC is considered reasonable,
the cost of buying a niche in which to store the deceased's ashes is less
economical. A niche shared by 10 or 12 unrelated individuals starts at
Dollars 1,500, and a personal niche ranges from Dollars 3,500 to Dollars
30,000. This does not include cremation, a service or an urn.
Such expenses are encouraging innovative Californians to reject the
traditional brass or marble urns for anything from milk churns and tobacco
jars to cookie tins. And for the purposes of cremation, chipboard caskets
are used, draped in satins and velvet.
As the US begins to draw back the shroud which envelopes the funeral
industry in macabre and sombre tradition, individuals are able to choose
from options never before considered tasteful or acceptable. And while the
environment benefits, a new market is born to cater for the demand of civil
choice. In California at least, where there is death, there is a livelihood.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why grown men dream
of a future with Barbie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The history of the US Mattel Toys company is the tale of everyday business
folk and a highly successful piece of plastic called Barbie. Last year the
company sold 54m fashion dolls.
This year it is likely to be 65m. 'When you do the arithmetic, that means
somewhere around the world we sell two Barbie dolls every second of every
day of every year,' says John Amerman, Mattel's silver-haired chairman and
chief executive. 'We think we are pretty good at meeting the desires and
dreams of little girls.'
Although Barbie's appeals have waned little throughout its 33-year history,
Mattel's shareholders have not always seen the rewards of it. Five years
ago, the company slumped to a net loss of Dollars 113m (Pounds 57.3m) as it
struggled with high overheads and an unresponsive management structure. But
since then, the company has staged a strong turnaround and last year
recorded operating income of Dollars 113m with analysts expecting further
improvement this year.
The main architect of the revival has been Amerman who has pragmatically
followed some classic marketing prescriptions to return the company to
profitability.
'I like to view Mattel as a consumer packaged goods company that just
happens to sell toys,' he says.
One of the most striking characteristics of the process has been the
constant product innovation which has been essential to increase sales. 'In
the US, about 95 per cent of girls between the ages of three to eight have a
Barbie doll and these girls have an average of seven dolls each. It is
important with a product like Barbie to have clear market segmentation,'
says Amerman.
Mattel boasts a standard My First Barbie doll which retails in the US for
less than Dollars 5.
But in her time, Barbie has also been a beach babe, a Mod, an airline pilot
and a Unicef ambassador. Mattel expects that one of her latest incarnations
as the Ultra Hair Barbie - complete with curlers and styling gels - will
sell 10m items in more than 100 countries.
At any one time there are about 50 models on sale, including limited-line
collectors' items. Mattel has recently discovered it can push the price of
special dolls far higher than previously imagined, breaking through the
Dollars 10 barrier.
Ideas for new dolls stem from several sources. The company conducts 'focus'
group work with girls in different countries to see how they respond to
concepts and has built up an extensive library of girls' magazines to keep
track of changing trends. The company employs 500 designers, development
engineers and model makers who constantly review and revise the Barbie line.
But Mattel has also learnt that it continually has to stimulate the consumer
market by means of heavy advertising and in-store promotions. Analysts
estimate the company spends up to 17 per cent of turnover promoting its
brands.
Mattel has also been able to generate greater consumer interest by winning
additional display space from retailers. To this end, Mattel began a
customer service programme three years ago visiting the biggest toy retail
chains and devising ways of improving operational relationships. Lower
prices have also led to increased sales volumes.
But there are signs that Barbie in the US is reaching the limits of growth
and Mattel is now rapidly expanding into other toy markets and pushing
Barbie harder overseas, where it already accounts for half of all sales.
'The future of our company is in international markets. The wants and
desires of little girls are the same around the world, whether it is combing
a doll's hair, changing their clothes, playing with Ken or thinking about
being an astronaut,' says Amerman.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Technology: Fighting the war with magic bullets - Continuing
a series on drug discoveries, Clive Cookson looks at cancer treatments that
destroy tumours but save healthy tissue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   A 'magic bullet' against cancer
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a drug that destroys tumour cells without harming healthy tissues - has been
one of the longest-postponed promises of medical research. Now at last,
after four decades of patchy progress, several candidate bullets are
undergoing clinical trials and they could be available commercially within
five years.
The idea of using the immune system to create antibodies specific enough to
seek out and eliminate disease-causing cells, without doing any other
damage, was proposed 90 years ago by the German microbiologist Paul Ehrlich.
And anti-cancer antibodies linked to radioactive iodine were first tested in
the 1950s at the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute in the US.
There were a few promising experiments during the 1950s and 1960s but the
'polyclonal' mixtures of antibodies available at the time did not give
reliable results. The real excitement started in the late 1970s, after
scientists at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge
discovered how to make pure 'monoclonal' antibodies. Researchers could then
produce large quantities of identical antibodies, all designed to home in on
a single target.
The first generation of antibody-based cancer products is now reaching the
market. They are magic paints rather than magic bullets - diagnostic tests
to give doctors a more accurate image of the tumour than traditional methods
such as physical examination or X-rays.
The tests contain antibodies which bind to proteins that are found only on a
specific type of cancer cell; they are linked to radioactive isotopes whose
radiation is detected outside the body with a special camera.
The first such test to receive marketing approval - an imaging agent for
colo-rectal cancer produced by Cytogen of New Jersey - went on sale in
Europe at the end of last year. Although the US Food and Drug Administration
has not yet licensed an antibody-based cancer imaging test, several are
expected to receive FDA approval within the next year or so, including one
for lung cancer from NeoRx of Seattle.
The development of antibody-based drugs, designed not to show up cancer
cells but to destroy them, has been slower. However a variety of drugs are
now in clinical trials, following recent progress towards overcoming some of
the problems that held up research during the 1980s.
Monoclonal antibodies were originally made from mouse cells which provoked
an unwanted immune response in patients. As a result, many of the antibodies
were destroyed before they reached their target. The solution is to make
genetically engineered 'humanised antibodies' in which only the active site
that binds to the cancer cell comes from the mouse and the remainder is
human. For example the Campath-1H antibody, developed at Cambridge
University and now undergoing clinical trials with Wellcome, the UK drug
company, contains only 1 per cent rodent material and does not provoke any
adverse reaction.
To the immune system, cancer cells look extremely similar to normal cells.
There has been a serious shortage of distinctive 'marker' proteins which
distinguish the tumour well enough to make it a clear target for an antibody
drug, and some of the early candidates cross-reacted unexpectedly with
normal tissues. Steadily, however, researchers are discovering better
markers. And once a diagnostic antibody against a distinctive marker has
been made, it can often be developed into a drug.
Only small quantities of antibodies can reach cells inside solid tumours
with poor blood supplies. Researchers are testing various techniques for
getting larger amounts of antibody to the site where it is needed. One
method is to 'pre-load' or 'pre-target' the tumour with a non-toxic marker
antibody and then to administer a second antibody to kill the marked cells.
The bullets are becoming more lethal. There are three ways in which an
antibody-based drug can destroy a cell: knock it out with radiation from an
isotope; poison it with a toxic drug; or activate the immune system's
natural cell-killing mechanism. The problems which exist with all three
methods are gradually being tackled.
In principle, the most elegant and safest approach is to use the antibody to
activate the body's own killer cells. Wellcome's Campath-1H, which is now
being tested on about 50 lymphoma patients, works in this way. And
biotechnology companies are trying different ways of boosting the natural
mechanism.
For example, Medarex, based in New Jersey, is developing 'bispecific'
antibodies - two antibodies joined together, one of which binds to the
cancer cell and the other which directs killer cells towards the target. The
company plans to test them next year in patients with melanoma, the most
lethal skin cancer, and glioma and neuroblastoma, two cancers of the brain
and nervous systems.
But antibodies on their own are not powerful enough to destroy most solid
tumours. For these, the antibody has to be linked to a radioactive isotope -
the traditional approach - or to a toxin. Then there is a risk of serious
side effects if the warhead becomes detached before reaching its target;
much research effort over the past 15 years has been devoted to finding ways
of joining the isotope or toxin firmly to the antibody without interfering
with its power to bind to cancer cells.
Several different isotopes are being tested, including iodine-131,
yttrium-90, astatine-211 and indium-111. NeoRx is developing products based
on rhenium-186, starting with an ovarian cancer treatment.
The range of powerful drugs and toxins linked to experimental antibodies is
even greater. A favourite is ricin, one of the most powerful plant toxins
known - a single molecule will kill a cell. Companies developing
ricin-linked antibodies include ImmunoGen of Massachusetts, whose Oncolysin
B has been tested on leukaemia and lymphoma patients, and ICI of the UK,
whose D0490 is about to start clinical trials.
Celltech of the UK and American Cyanamid of the US are collaborating on
another promising project: an antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent
cytotoxic drug derived originally from fungi. It is due to begin clinical
studies in leukaemia and breast cancer patients within the next few months.
An alternative approach, pioneered by Kenneth Bagshawe at London's Charing
Cross Hospital, with funding from the Cancer Research Campaign, is
Antibody-Directed Enzyme/Prodrug Therapy (Adept). This is a two-stage
process: the patient is treated first with an antibody linked to a bacterial
enzyme and later with a 'prodrug' - a chemical that is relatively non-toxic
but is converted by the enzyme into a potent cell-killing drug. Small-scale
clinical trials of Adept treatments against colo-rectal cancer have been
taking place for the past 18 months, in collaboration with ICI.
Despite the recent progress, however, more research is required to hone
antibodies into reliable cancer drugs. 'Antibody engineering' will make it
possible to design artificial antibodies - far smaller and more accurate
bullets than anything available today.
Another possibility is to use a hormone or growth factor instead of an
antibody to guide toxins to receptor sites on cancer cells. The company
pioneering this approach is Seragen, based in Massachusetts, which is
testing a range of 'fusion toxins', consisting of diphtheria toxins linked
to interleukin or epidermal growth factor.
Since conventional chemotherapy, radiation and surgery still fail to cure
most tumours, there is a potential market for innovative cancer treatments
worth several billion dollars a year. Although new genetic technologies -
anti-sense drugs and gene therapy - offer a promising alternative, magic
bullet enthusiasts will be disappointed if they are not selling at least
Dollars 2bn a year worth of cancer drugs within a decade.
The series continues next month with a look at heart drugs.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Technology: Whither the IT department?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Information technology directors have been foisting computerisation upon
corporate professionals for several years - forcing people to change the way
they work and realigning responsibilities in the workplace.
Now it is their turn to adapt. Rapid changes in information systems
technology are undermining the traditional role of the information
technology manager and in some cases making the role redundant.
The open systems phenomenon, client-server environments and software that
makes computers easier to use are designed to 'empower' the end user. They
are not, however, designed for the convenience of the IT manager.
At the same time, the expertise of the IT manager is increasingly challenged
by users and customers.
These issues are prompting a basic reassessment of the IT function. And in
some organisations the IT department is ceasing to exist.
Timex, the Dundee watch-maker, is replacing an ageing mainframe-based system
with new integrated software on an open distributed platform.
Peter Hall, the company's vice president, says the investment will improve
service levels to the business and cut costs. Ultimately Timex thinks the
system will run itself - and the company will not need a formal IT
department.
This option may not be open to many organisations, but doing away with the
IT function is not so far removed from 'outsourcing' it.
A survey from IT consultancy CSC Index reports that 71 per cent of its
respondents in Europe plan to outsource some information systems activity
this year - compared with 36 per cent in 1991. This ranges from applications
development to telecommunications and software maintenance. According to
Robert Morison, CSC vice president: 'Outsourcing information systems
activities is no longer a question of 'whether', but of 'what'.'
Ironically, says Morison, the activity most often associated with
outsourcing - data centre operations and management - is among the least
frequently sent out. 'The idea of giving up the data centre sends most
systems managers scurrying for performance benchmarks to prove that their
shops are as efficient as their neighbours,' he says. Yet, he argues, it is
often the data centre which should be the first to go.
Not surprising, many IT managers prefer to think of outsourcing as
facilities management. Yet their companies are beginning to treat
outsourcing IT no differently from business activities where, in advertising
or distribution, for example, there is a reliance on 'outsourced' specialist
skills.
If, as CSC concluded, most organisations are outsourcing their IT
activities, then just as many are involved in a serious rethink of how their
IT department works - about who should own it, and to whom it is
responsible.
'Re-engineering' the IT department is one of the biggest consultancy
opportunities, comments David Narrow of Price Waterhouse Management
Consultants.
'It is a very high priority. Costs are going up in IT faster than in any
other corporate area - people just have to do better,' he says.
But this is not just a matter of cost saving. Some organisations are moving
towards a small cadre of specialists who plan, design and oversee the
company's IT, while contracting out most of the traditional work.
The pressure on IT to maximise the business value it delivers may be
undermining some traditional IT regimes, but it also coincides with a
generation of technology which will not only allow IT to deliver the goods,
but which on any large scale probably demands more specialised IT
disciplines and requires more managing than the technology that it replaces.
And it is this new level of complexity that should ensure the future of the
IT function, if not the traditional department.
According to Des Lee, IT director of B&amp;Q: 'There may not be an IT department
as such - but there will be an area of IT excellence. These are very
exciting times for IT people. There is great opportunity - and there is no
doubt that we'll emerge as the agents of competitive advantage at last.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: D-Mark bloc advances amid hopes of cut in
Bundesbank rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS that the Bundesbank would announce another cut in interest rates at
its regular council meeting today and speculation about a further
realignment in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) sent bond markets in the
D-Mark bloc sharply higher in hectic afternoon trading.
The rumours were fanned by sterling's chronic weakness, which forced the
announcement of two interest rate rises during the day. The market had
closed long before sterling was eventually suspended in the ERM, with the
second of the rate rises - due to take effect today - reversed.
Other signs that led the bond markets to believe the Germans would ease
interest rates again today were: the Dutch central bank's cut in its key
rates for the second time this week, independently of the Bundesbank;
Belgium's cut in the discount and emergency lending rates, also for the
second time this week; and the Bundesbank's injection of short-term funds
into the money market yesterday at rates of around 9.25 per cent.
UK government bond prices yesterday managed to shrug off most of the bad
news from the currency markets and the two announcements of interest rate
rises, leaving many traders perplexed.
'It's difficult to explain,' one trader said. 'It appears that gilt market
investors seem more convinced about sterling's long-term position in the ERM
than foreign exchange speculators.'
Another said that higher interest rates would further undermine an already
weak economy, a positive development for bond prices.
Long gilt futures bounced strongly yesterday afternoon after opening the day
at 96.10, a whole point lower than their close on Tuesday. By late in the
afternoon, after trading a massive 92,000 contracts, the futures price had
jumped sharply to 98.08. In relatively thin trading, meanwhile, cash prices
slipped in medium and longer-dated gilts, with losses of up to  5/8 of a
point.
Despite the fears for sterling - confirmed by the later suspension of the
currency in the ERM - there was steady, if slow, buying of gilts, both from
UK and overseas investors.
One UK investor said: 'Gilts are really a one-way bet. Either there is a
devaluation, in which case rates come down, or the government holds on and
rates stay up, which is good for gilt prices because it pushes the economy
further into recession.'
Other observers also said that higher interest rates would further dampen
the economy and kill off any danger of inflation, so helping longer-dated
gilts.
THE Italian government bond market was largely paralysed in the face of the
country's latest foreign exchange crisis yesterday. The lira fell like a
stone to its floor in the ERM, prompting analysts to suggest that the
currency may have to be taken out of the system until some semblance of
stability returns.
Bond prices, though, eased back by only about a quarter of a point. Foreign
investors have largely abandoned the market in recent weeks, and domestic
investors were reported to be largely inactive as they waited for the crisis
to be resolved.
GERMAN bond prices were boosted by the Bundesbank speculation and an influx
of foreign capital. The purchases drove the average yield on German
public-sector debt to a new 1992 low of 7.91 per cent, after 8.02 per cent
on Tuesday.
The benchmark 8.0 per cent July 2002 Bund rose to 103.47 from 102.69 while
in London, the December Bund future jumped to 91.20 in late trading from
90.19 in a volume of 12,082 lots.
DUTCH 10-year bonds outperformed their German counterparts following the
central bank's 25 basis point cut in its three key official rates. Dealers
reported that there was active domestic buying across the board, while the
seven-year bonds made the biggest gains.
The yield on the 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 dropped to 7.87 per cent
from 8.01 per cent, while the 10-year Dutch-German yield spread narrowed to
39 points from 41 points.
YIELDS on Swedish bonds closed sharply higher but trading ground to a
standstill after the Riksbank raised its marginal lending rate to 500 per
cent from 75 per cent in the early afternoon. After the move, the central
bank said the market could close if traders wished.
Dealers said that a krona devaluation was still very much on investors'
minds, but that 'there was not a lot one could do against rates of 500 per
cent'.
Three-month Treasury bills were some 550 basis points higher at 33 per cent
while the 11-year bond rose 27 basis points to 11.50 per cent.
FRENCH bonds ended a volatile session about a half point higher than
Tuesday's close on speculation of a cut in German interest rates and an ERM
realignment.
Matif bond futures were pushed lower in early trading on the ERM tension and
on news that President Francois Mitterrand had prostate cancer. They then
lifted on statements that the president was not seriously ill but this was
offset by the UK rate rises.
The September futures contract settled at 107.92, 46 basis points up on
Tuesday's close, having briefly tested resistance at 108.00. It had hit a
low of 106.90 after the first rise in UK rates.
In the cash market, the 2002 OAT finished 0.82 higher at 99.74 to yield 8.53
per cent after 8.65 per cent.
The Matif will open pit trading of its key French Treasury bond future at 7
am local time next Monday, a spokeswoman for the French futures and options
exchange said yesterday. The French vote on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday.
SWISS bonds were in demand as investors switched out of EMS
currency-denominated markets. A rise in the Swiss franc against the D-Mark
also pushed the market higher.
Short-term rates continued to fall, with the benchmark three-month eurofranc
rate down at 6 bid in late trading after 7 per cent on Tuesday. In the
futures market, December government bond futures jumped to 95.15 from 94.49.
At the long end, the Swiss government's 7 per cent bonds due 2005 rose to
102.05 from 101.65.
THE long end of the US Treasury bond market dipped slightly yesterday,
adding to Tuesday's sharp drop, as Wall Street was further buffeted by the
extraordinary developments in the European currency and money markets.
After a weak opening, the bond market moved off its lows, encouraged by
rumours that the European monetary crisis might force the Bundesbank to cut
interest rates further. However, those hopes dissipated when Britain
announced its suspension from the Exchange Rate Mechanism to ease the
currency crisis.
Sentiment was helped, however, by further evidence that the US economy
remains extremely sluggish, with the Federal Reserve reporting that August
industrial production fell 0.5 per cent, greater than Wall Street's
consensus expectation of a 0.3 per cent dip.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was quoted in late trading at around
99, down  7/32 to yield 7.327, but the short end saw a slight rise, with the
4.25 issue due August 1994 quoted up  3/32 at 100  13/16 to yield 3.797.

FT  17 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Banks underwrite planned
Swedish loan of Ecu8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S proposed Ecu8bn loan from international banks, part of its move to
bolster currency reserves and defend the krona, has been successfully
underwritten, despite continued disarray in the country's financial markets.
There had been concern, when the proposed loan was first announced last
Friday, that banks would hesitate at taking on greater exposure to Sweden in
the current climate. This feeling was exacerbated by the requirement for any
bank taking part as an underwriter to take Ecu350m of the loan, before
selling on the loan to other banks.
However, JP Morgan, which co-ordinated the loan, announced yesterday that 25
banks had come forward to act as underwriters. The banks represented in the
underwriting group are drawn mainly from Germany, the UK, Japan, Sweden and
Switzerland, with only two big US banks - Morgan and Citibank - present.
According to one underwriter, the yield on the three-year loan, around twice
that offered in the similar facility launched by the UK in late August, made
it sufficiently attractive to guarantee widespread support.
Meanwhile, it emerged that the UK has not accelerated the draw-down of its
own foreign currency banking facility, despite the heavy intervention to
defend sterling yesterday. As originally planned, half of the bank loan has
already been drawn down, with the remaining half due to be drawn on 25
September. By late yesterday, that timetable had not been brought forward.

FT  17 SEP 92 / International Bonds: New issues go forward despite turbulent
trading conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank and the Kingdom of Spain both ventured out in
turbulent markets to launch large issues yesterday, only to find that
investors' attention was on other matters - such as whether and when an ERM
realignment would come.
The European Investment Bank's Y50bn, five-year deal was its first since the
Italian government abolished its withholding tax exemption for multilateral
agencies, and so a test for the market's appetite for the EIB. According to
one bank, the yield on the bonds - brought at 13 basis points above the
seven-year Japanese government bond No 104 - was only 8 basis points higher
than that talked about last week, before the tax change.
However, this may give little indication of the overall extra cost that the
EIB and other agencies - and the entities to which they lend - will have to
pay as a result of the tax change. The yen is not a currency bought heavily
by Italian investors: a greater test will come when the EIB next attempts to
borrow in a higher-yielding currency such as the lira, peseta or Ecu.
Despite reports that the issue had been well-priced, and that many banks had
succeeded in placing their portion of the issue, the bonds traded as much as
50 basis points down during the afternoon on the general malaise in the
markets. Morgan Stanley, one of the joint leads, bid 98.80 for the bonds to
put a floor under the price, compared with an issue price of 92.32 - and
found itself forced to buy up Y10bn of the issue, to add to the Y18bn it
said it had already placed.
The Kingdom of Spain's Dollars 1.5bn issue, to be priced today, caused
greater concern among underwriters, with several questioning the wisdom of
bringing the deal so close to the French referendum on Sunday. The issue had
already been delayed in the hope of some stability returning to the markets
 -only to shift its launch into the most turbulent point of the week so far.
At an indicated range of 42-45 basis points over Treasuries, the bonds were
regarded as fairly priced. The issue compares with a yield of 32 basis
points above Treasuries offered recently by the Council of Europe  - an AA1
borrower, compared to the AA2 Kingdom of Spain. About a third of the bonds
were reported to have been sold in Europe, leaving a substantial part still
to be placed.
The fate of the transaction could echo that of the Dollars 2bn deal for
Ontario, launched earlier in the week. After an indicated spread of 46-48
basis points, the bonds were launched at 48 and were trading yesterday at 54
basis points above Treasuries.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rates soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION AND turmoil hit the UK money markets after the Bank of England
announced it was raising its minimum lending rate to 15 per cent in an
attempt to stop the pound falling through its floor in the European exchange
rate mechanism, Emma Tucker writes.
Overnight rates soared to 100 per cent as liquidity was squeezed and the
government did everything it could to avoid a devaluation of sterling. 'The
authorities have been pulling out all the stops to show that they are not
going to devalue,' said one analyst.
Speculation of a rise in base rates was already rippling through the market
early yesterday morning after intervention by European central banks on
Tuesday had failed to lift sterling off its DM2.7780 floor.
In the early round the Bank of England announced a forecast liquidity
shortage of Pounds 650m. This was followed at 11am by the news that it was
reintroducing a minimum lending rate of 12 per cent, which triggered a
two-point rise in base lending rates to 12 per cent from 10 per cent.
But on the foreign exchanges it soon became apparent that the authorities'
action had little effect on sterling.
Later in the morning the Bank announced that any discount houses wanting to
borrow from the Bank were invited to do so at 2.30pm, but diverged from
normal practice by not stating the rate.
This suggested another rate rise in the afternoon. At 2.30pm the Bank
announced a three-point rise in the minimum lending rate to 15 per cent.
This time, however, the clearing banks said they would wait until today to
announce their intentions.
By the end of the day the Bank said it had lent Pounds 920m to the market at
12 per cent.
Interbank rates eased in later trading as the market started to come to the
conclusion that sterling would be devalued.
The key three-month interbank rate stabilised at around 16 per cent.
One-week money came down to around 25 per cent, while further out, one-year
money closed at around 12.5 per cent.
Sterling futures also rallied in the middle of the afternoon on the back of
speculation that the pound would be devalued. The December short sterling
traded in a 155-point range in heavy trading.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Massive selling of sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY pressure on sterling yesterday culminated in the suspension of the
currency from the exchange rate mechanism after the end of European trading,
writes Tracy Corrigan.
During the day, two consecutive rate rises by the Bank of England and an
estimated Pounds 9bn of concerted central bank intervention failed to halt
massive selling of sterling in the foreign exchange market.
In spite of an increase in the minimum lending rate from 10 per cent to 15
per cent, the pound remained under intense pressure throughout the day,
repeatedly falling below its ERM floor of DM2.778. The second rate rise was
cancelled when sterling was suspended from the ERM.
Sterling slid further after 4pm, the cut-off point for obligatory
intervention by European central banks to support weak currencies in the
ERM. By the close of London trading, the pound had fallen to DM2.75, nearly
3 pfennings below the official floor.
A trader said: 'The market has really got the bit between its teeth now, but
the assault on the currency would never have been so effective if it were
purely speculative.' The shift of capital from UK markets by fund managers
and corporate treasurers proved irresistible.
By the end of the day, the task of keeping sterling within its ERM band
seemed insurmountable, as rumours of a realignment - or even an abandonment
of the ERM - swept the market. The scale of the sterling crisis overshadowed
worries about the French referendum on Sunday, which is now being viewed
almost as a secondary issue.
The first UK rate rise, from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, followed repeated
intervention by the Bank of England, which was joined by the Bundesbank and
the Banque de France. The swift draining of foreign exchange reserves failed
to boost the pound, which hovered around its floor against the D-Mark as
foreign exchange dealers and fund managers sold sterling.
Continued pressure on the pound then prompted a further rate increase to 15
per cent at 2.15pm. But this second rate rise served to increase selling
pressure further, as speculation mounted that some sort of devaluation of
sterling was becoming inevitable.
Meanwhile, the lira, peseta and Swedish krona also came under pressure. The
Bank of Italy bought lire for D-Marks, but failed to prevent the currency
from falling below its new ERM floor of L820.68 per D-Mark. The Bank of
Spain, which bought pesetas aggressively at a higher level, was somewhat
more successful in stemming the Spanish currency's decline, which ended at
Pta67.64 to the D-Mark.
The Swedish authorities again hoisted their marginal lending rate, this time
to 500 per cent, in an effort to stem a further outflow of capital from the
Swedish financial markets.

FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow erratic as Europe holds
sway

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS moved erratically in a narrow trading range yesterday as Wall
Street tried to absorb the bewildering events in European money markets,
writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3,319.21, down 8.11, after
retreating in the late afternoon from a minor gain. Trading volume on the
New York Stock Exchange was an active 231.6m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index ended a slight 0.15 up at 419.92 and the Nasdaq composite was
finally 1.97 off at 585.89.
The blue chip Dow index declined some 16 points in reaction to the Bank of
England's interest rate rise, but then began to rally as rumours swept New
York that the Bundesbank would move quickly to cut German interest rates. US
equities reversed direction again when Britain suspended its currency from
the European exchange rate mechanism and hopes of a German rate cut faded.
A further domestic damper on the market was the US industrial production
figures for August, showing a seasonally adjusted fall of 0.5 per cent,
compared to a consensus forecast of a 0.3 per cent decline.
International Business Machines fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 in
active trading after several more analysts lowered their ratings on the
stock and cut back their earnings forecasts. The move followed news late on
Monday that another manufacturer of mainframe computers, Amdahl, was
expecting a third-quarter loss because of poor market demand.
Federal Express, which reported a sharp fall in first-quarter net income
after the market closed on Tuesday, dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 7/8
. Yesterday several analysts lowered their earnings forecasts for the group
and at least one downgraded the stock.
In the energy sector, Exxon rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 . Atlantic
Richfield moved ahead Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 119 3/4 as an analyst raised
his forecast for the company's third-quarter earnings, citing firm crude
prices. Occidental Petroleum eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after an
analyst's downgrading of the stock due to chemical market conditions.
Polaroid was unchanged at Dollars 32 3/4 in spite of news that the company
had unveiled a new compact, autofocus instant camera.
General Dynamics gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 79 1/4 after a meeting with
analysts on Tuesday at which the defence company produced evidence that its
efforts to improve efficiency were bearing fruit. Several analysts yesterday
lifted their 1992 and 1993 earnings forecasts for the group.
Canada
TORONTO closed near the day's low as uncertainty surrounding European
currencies and interest rates depressed bank shares, but the overall market
was only moderately down. The same uncertainties boosted gold shares, the
sector's index advancing 183.2 to 5,660.3.
The TSE 300 index finished 10.3 off at 3,453.8 and falls outscored rises by
318 to 247 after volume of 39.6m shares.
Among golds, American Barrick climbed CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 39 7/8 ,
Echo Bay CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 8 3/8 and Placer Dome CDollars 5/8 to
CDollars 13 1/2.

bourse rewards

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES drew a clear distinction between weak and strong currencies in
yesterday's pandemonium although Sweden, like the UK, seemed mollified by
the extreme reaction at central bank level, writes Our Markets Staff.
On London indications, Switzerland and the Netherlands put up the best
performances yesterday afternoon, and Spain and Italy the worst. Mr Reinhard
Fischer, head of equity research at Paribas Capital Markets, noted that the
Germans, in a so-called hard currency market, were paying DM1.14 for a Swiss
franc compared with DM1.07 a few months ago.
STOCKHOLM had little time to evaluate the increase in the central bank's
marginal lending rate, back to 75 per cent from the 20 per cent announced in
the morning. The later rise to 500 per cent, as the bank moved to protect
the currency against devaluation, came after the close. In a turbulent day
the Affarsvarlden index lost 5.1 to 740.0 in turnover of some SKr430m, down
some SKr599m on Tuesday.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel said that the massive interest rate rise
would stop any speculation against the krona, but such a rate could only be
held for a few days. The Riksbank later said that 'considerable inflows of
currency' had been noted after the rate rise was announced.
A stronger dollar helped some sectors, especially forestry, with Stora free
shares rising SKr9 to SKr220 and SCA free shares gaining SKr2 to SKr285.
PARIS moved from lows in the morning session, reflecting news that President
Francois Mitterrand had had cancerous tissue removed and the first of the
day's two rises in UK interest rates, to gains in late trading.
Some analysts said that the market was given the boost by expectations of an
EMS realignment today, accompanied by a devaluation of sterling and a
further cut in the German Lombard rate.
Currency movements and a rise in the bond market fed through into equities
and the CAC-40 index closed up 23.63 or 1.3 per cent at 1,859.78. The index
had earlier seen a low of 1,786.37 while turnover rose to FFr3.4bn from
FFr2.4bn.
FRANKFURT see-sawed but ended almost even, the DAX index closing just 2.99
lower at 1,584.56. Investors returned to German shares near the end of the
session, via orders from the futures market, after the Netherlands and
Belgium announced cuts in key interest rates; by then the market was talking
seriously about further German cuts and realignments.
The speculation on another German interest rate fall - with the weekend cuts
reflected in a further drop of 11 basis points, to 7.91 per cent, in the
Bundesbank's average bond yield - prompted active trading in bank shares.
Deutsche Bank rallied DM3.50 to DM650.50, putting on another DM5 in London
later.
However, the accompanying strength in the dollar did not do much for
carmakers; while BMW recovered in the afternoon, by about DM5 after an
official close DM2 lower at DM547, Volkswagen lost DM1.00 in the session to
DM330.00 and recovered little thereafter.
MILAN incorporated the losses seen in London on Tuesday afternoon, and after
opening indications of an 8 per cent drop the Comit index fell 18.21, or 4.9
per cent to 354.93 during the official session. There were wide fluctuations
in London's lira-denominated equivalent, but it ended less than 0.5 per cent
down on the day.
Turnover in Milan was extremely heavy by recent standards, estimated at
around L200bn after a climb from L78.2bn last Friday. Banca Commerciale
Italiana bucked the bearish domestic trend, closing L212 higher at L2,766 on
speculation that the government wanted to sell its 57 per cent stake in the
bank, and quoting L79 higher at L2,845 in the post-bourse.
Fiat fixed L320 down at L3,505 and lost another L5 on the kerb.
ZURICH stood out like a good deed in a naughty world, the SMI index rising
20.3, or 1.1 per cent to 1,871.7 and, in London, the Swiss component of the
FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index putting on 39.97, or 3 per cent to 1,357.01.
Dealers mooted the prospect of gradually lower European money market rates,
and there was strong buying interest in interest rate-sensitive equities. In
banking, SBC advanced SFr6 to SFr266; Zurich Insurance rose SFr55 to
SFr1,955.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by the 0.25 percentage point cut in interest rates by
the central bank and the CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 higher at 112.7.
Financial stocks were among the day's gainers with ABN Amro up Fl 1.50 to Fl
46.90, AMEV up Fl 1.70 at Fl 56.30 and Aegon Fl 1.40 higher at Fl 67.00.
MADRID came off intraday lows as the general index lost 2.63 to 211.25. The
market was unsettled by activity in the rest of Europe and fears that the
peseta may have to be devalued today, some analysts said. Post-bourse
trading in the Spanish component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index,
calculated in D-Marks, reflected these fears with a 47 point fall to
1,000.79.
There was heavy trading in Telefonica which went against the trend, rising
Pta30 to Pta1,085 with some 2.7m shares traded.
BRUSSELS, another strong currency market, put up a 2.64 point rise in the
Bel-20 index to 1,110.60. Petrofina eased BFr10 to BFr8,740 with some 15,800
shares traded.
Banks were heavily traded following interest rate cuts elsewhere in Europe.
Generale de Banque fell BFr70 to BFr6,800 while Kredietbank climbed BFr40 to
BFr4,930 with 15,800 shares traded. In chemicals, Solvay fell BFr150 to
BFr11,800.

FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: ERM worries evident in August trade /
Analysis of turnover trends masked by the holiday break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European markets had plenty to consider during the traditional August
holiday break. The overall 24 per cent fall in turnover for the eight
markets covered in the analysis masks the fact that trading was at times
extremely volatile, and that rising mayhem in currencies reflected itself in
equity markets.
Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, who compiles the monthly data, notes
that the main reason for the turnover weakness, leaving aside the fact that
many equity dealers were on vacation, 'was growing pessimism about European
currency unification following French opinion polls pointing strongly, for a
time, to a No vote in the referendum.
'Investors stayed away from the potentially weak currency markets,
presumably because, even if they had a view on which way the referendum
would go, they were unwilling to make a bet on the result.'
Belgium was the only market to improve on July figures, advancing by 19 per
cent. In a recent review Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson comments that the
strong local currency and the lowest inflation in Europe, then around 2 per
cent, were the lures attracting an inflow of funds.
However, she adds: 'In absolute terms the market performance over the last
month has been lacklustre. During the otherwise quiet period attention has
focused on Petrofina, following the disappointing interim results mid-month
and the weakening dollar.
'General market activity has been so low that trade in the stock has
sometimes accounted for around half the daily market volume. With little
counteractive positive news to dilute this effect upon the index, the market
weakness has been principally due to the slide in that stock price.'
Italy saw the month's biggest fall in activity, down almost 50 per cent from
July, as the country was almost paralysed by political uncertainty and a
deteriorating economy. On one day in the middle of August turnover shrank to
L43bn, the lowest level of the year.
Activity in Spain also slowed substantially last month, declining by 41 per
cent, with daily turnover sometimes slipping as low as Pta5bn, from a
reasonably healthy daily average of Pta10bn.
This is another market that has been unable to excite inward investment,
with foreigners becoming sellers during August. In its overview of the
market, James Capel reports that in the three months to the end of August
the construction and food sectors were the worst performing areas,
underperforming the market as a whole by some 14 per cent.
Madrid-based broker FG Inversiones remarks that even a Yes vote in Sunday's
French referendum is unlikely to have a dramatic effect as nervousness over
the Spanish budget and a further batch of disappointing first-half results
overhang the market.

FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.8 per
cent to below the 18,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO CAME back from a day's holiday to a fall of 2.85 per cent in low
volume, on weak overseas markets followed by index-linked selling, agencies
report from Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 526.70 down at 17,944.70, below 18,000 for the
first time since September 2, after registering a high for the day of
18,422.82 and a low of 17,853.57. Volume rose slightly, to 250m shares from
Monday's 228m, and arbitrage was said to account for a lot of the business.
Declines outnumbered advances by 845 to 166, with 128 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 30.51, or 2.2 per cent, to
1,352.60, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 5.88 to 1,075.53.
Many investors had run out of ideas after the recent rally, which took the
market up by 32 per cent in just over three weeks to September 10. They were
tired, said brokers, of buying special situations, and while Germany's rate
cut encouraged people on Monday, they decided yesterday that the recent
rally has little to do with overseas factors.
Notable declining sectors were brokerage, banking and lending companies,
non-life insurance, pharmaceuticals, warehousing, airlines, food and real
estate. Transport was mixed, with railway and bus shares down and the
trucking sector making the only advance of the day.
Aids-related issues were also mixed. The most heavily traded stock of the
day, Nippon Mining, gained Y3 to Y505, but Green Cross fell Y60 to Y1,670,
Meiji Milk was Y30 lower at Y1,060 and Nippon Zeon lost Y31 to Y692.
Biotechnology company Nihon Nohyaku receded Y40 to Y1,140 on profit-taking
after Monday's jump.
Roundup
WEAK sentiment abroad was reflected in most of the Pacific Basin equity
markets yesterday.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index dropped 24.0 to 1,506.4, with BHP's 50-cent
fall to ADollars 11.98 responsible for a third of the decline. Overall
turnover was a moderate ADollars 226.2m.
Brokers said that there was increasing concern about BHP's newly acquired 32
per cent stake in Foster's Brewing, which posted an ADollars 950m loss and
made an ADollars 1bn rights issue on Tuesday. BHP came under more pressure
after it offered to buy a further 5 per cent of the Foster's equity from
Citibank. Foster's shed 8 cents to ADollars 1.38.
HONG KONG saw steep early losses pared by bargain hunters, the Hang Seng
index closing 20.71 down at 5,633.13 after touching 5,599.10. Turnover fell
further to HKDollars 1.18bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 1.29bn.
Trade talks and Sino-British negotiations on airport financing ended
yesterday morning, but there was no report of progress from either. However,
Jardine Matheson gained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 53 on hopes of pleasant
surprises as its group companies announce interim results.
SINGAPORE fell on institutional selling of blue chips, the Straits Times
Industrial index losing 15.65 to 1,367.77 in volume of 34.6m shares.
TAIWAN sank in sluggish trade on continued worries over last week's arrest
of textile tycoon and major market player Oung Ta-ming, and the weighted
index ended 52.20, or 1.4 per cent, down at a 20-month low of 3,664.52.
Turnover fell to a very thin TDollars 13.8bn from Tuesday's TDollars 18.2bn.
Brokers said overall selling was not too heavy as many investors believed
prices were already low. However, stocks related to Oung continued to
plunge, with Hualon Preferred losing TDollars 6.50 to TDollars 89.
MANILA just managed to buck the trend, the composite index closing 4.17 up
at 1,433.44 in increasingly active trade. A strong showing by Philippine
National Bank, in spite of reports that it expects a sharp drop in 1992
profits, was taken as a mild bull point for the market. PNB gained 5 pesos
to 285 pesos, as combined turnover at Manila's two bourses rose from 173m to
264m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR's institutional investors remained largely sidelined ahead of
the Malaysian budget next month. Profit-taking countered support for
selected second-liners and situation stocks, and the KLSE composite index
closed 0.76 off at 585.15.
NEW ZEALAND followed overseas trends to end lower on less than average
turnover, the NZSE-40 capital index easing 10.39 to 1,469.87 in NZDollars
18m, of which NZDollars 6m was in Telecom. The utility was one of the few
leaders to rise, ending one cent higher at NZDollars 2.32.
BANGKOK took profits as trade slowed down in anticipation of the formation
of a new government after Sunday's general election. The SET index ended
4.41 lower at 813.33 in turnover of Bt8.92bn.

FT  17 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer after erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRISIS DAY in the foreign exchange markets inspired wildly erratic trends in
UK equities, which closed firmly as predictions of an imminent sterling
devaluation mitigated the effects of the two announced increases in Bank of
England minimum lending rate. News that the second rate rise, from 12 per
cent to 15 per cent, had been cancelled, along with the suspension of
sterling from the ERM, came well after the market close. Strength in the US
dollar boosted overseas earning stocks.
The turnround in the stock market from an early fall of more than 78 points
on the FT-SE Index to a net rise of 8.3 for a close of 2,378.3 reflected the
stock market's conviction that, since the day's increase in British interest
rates had failed to rescue sterling, some form of European currency
revaluation would be introduced.
The first half of the day passed with equity traders glued helplessly to
their money market and foreign exchange trading screens. The Footsie opened
28 points down and plunged to minus 78.7 after the Bank of England
annnounced its first, two-point, rise in interest rates.
This took the index down to 2,291.3, at which level the market rallied,
hoping that the rate rise and the Bank's intervention would save sterling.
But a partial recovery of about 24 Footsie points was quickly reversed at
midsession when London money markets virtually ceased trading ahead of the
Bank's second increase in rates, this time of a further three points.
Share prices turned down again, but only for a while. When equity
strategists saw that the pound was still weak, they suggested that the UK
authorities might now be forced to shift to a devaluation policy, albeit at
some cost in political credibility.
A good recovery, supported by increased although selective institutional
demand, received a further boost when the dollar's strength brought buyers
in for oils, pharmaceuticals and similar international stocks.
Losses in interest-related sectors such as construction and retail stocks,
as well as in banks, which would suffer from increased bad debts, were
reduced towards the close. The swing in confidence was reflected in the
revival of several bid features, including Fisons, the drugs group. Somewhat
to the surprise of market traders, one securities house operated a trading
programme across the range of the market, with second-liners prominent.
Seaq volume, slow at first, jumped to a total of 640.3m shares for the day,
compared with 507.3m or Pounds 895m retail business on Tuesday.
Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull commented that the stock market might be
'assuming an awful lot' on the political and investment scene in looking for
a sterling devaluation, which would probably have to be greater than 5 per
cent if it was to achieve its purpose.
Mr Nicholas Knight, long term bear at Nomura Research, switched to the
bullish tack yesterday, commenting that adjustments to higher base rates and
possible sterling withdrawal from the ERM were now in place.

FT  17 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS another heavy trading session in derivatives markets as securities
houses and private investors struggled to come to terms with higher interest
rates in the UK, as well as the possibility of an ERM revaluation, writes
Terry Byland.
The September future on the FT-SE Index, which expires tomorrow, had traded
just over 23,000 contracts by the official close and remained active later
as sterling came under further pressure.
The contract swung between a low of 2,285 and a closing quotation of 2,410,
the final figure showing a premium of around 8 points against the underlying
cash index.
Throughout the day, stock index futures took their cue from the London money
and foreign exchange markets. Traders continued to attempt to roll business
over from the September to the December contract, which takes over market
leadership on Friday, but all other factors were overwhelmed by the increase
in UK minimum lending rate.
Traded options volume jumped from 33,293 contracts to 51,062, one of the
highest daily totals since April. The FT-SE option took the lion's share,
with 26,669 against 15,459, with the Euro FT-SE also active on 2,848
contracts.

FT  17 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar boost for oils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST collapse in the sterling/dollar rate, which has seen the UK
currency slide from the Dollars 2 mark to Dollars 1.78 in less than a week,
provoked a heavy burst of overseas buying of the oil sector.
With oil priced in dollars, the sector was seen as a big beneficiary of
recent currency moves. The big US institutions were said to have chased all
the quality oil shares. A specialist at one of the big US investment banks
said: 'At recent exchange rates it looked as if some big earnings downgrades
would have to be implemented, but that no longer seems to be the case.'
BP advanced 8 to 210 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 16m, although analysts made
the point that the majority of the group's huge debts are in dollars. Shell
raced up 16 to 492 1/2 p on 6.3m traded.
Enterprise Oil shares remained in positive territory even during the
market's darkest hour, with stories of big US buying interest noted
throughout the day. The stock delivered the best individual performance in
the Footsie, closing 29, or 8.6 per cent, higher at 365p. Around two weeks
ago the shares dropped to 323p as a block of 9.6m was placed in the market
by a UK institution.
Lasmo, in which a hefty 6.5m shares were traded, was also aggressively
sought by US investors, adding 7 1/2 at 132 1/2 p.
Body Shop plunges
Not even the wild swings in the market could hide the shock of a profits
warning from health and beauty group Body Shop, one of the rapid growth
stocks of the 1980s, and the shares retreated sharply to become the
session's worst performing stock in percentage terms.
The retailer, once regarded by some as one of the 'stars' of the stores
sector, warned that first-half profits, expec-ted to be announced in
mid-October, would be below previous market forecasts but would reach at
least Pounds 8m, against last year's Pounds 9.1m.
Dealers rushed to sell the stock, sending the price plunging 126 to 140p at
one stage, its lowest point since December 1990. Analysts moved to cut
full-year forecasts, and Ms Julie Ramshaw at Morgan Stanley reduced her
estimate by Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 25.5m for the year to February 1993 and
shaved the following year's figure by Pounds 7m to Pounds 32m.
Bargain hunting later in the day left the stock a net 108 down at 158p.
Turnover amounted to 3m, the highest daily total for more than two years in
the tightly held stock. Commenting on the day's fall Ms Ramshaw said: 'In
the short term the worst is probably over, but investors will be cautious
until the interims.'
Fisons wanted
Fisons, the pharmaceuticals/chemicals group, bucked the overall trend as
marketmakers responded to revived hints that a takeover bid for the group
could be in the offing.
There have been numerous bouts of takeover speculation surrounding Fisons,
especially since the group issued a profits warning in June, when the shares
plunged more than 100p in a single session.
At the close of trading, Fisons shares were 9, or 5.4 per cent, higher at
175p. Turnover came to a higher than usual 5.2m shares.
Dealers said Boots had been mooted as a potential predator. Other possible
bidders, according to dealers, included ICI and a number of overseas groups.
ICI shares settled 4 higher at 1058p.
The two successive rises in UK interest rates triggered several waves of
selling pressure throughout the big banks, already suffering from the
implications of the unprecedentedly high rate of customer bankruptcies
inflicted by the prolonged recession in the UK.
Barclays and National Westminster are seen by analysts as likely to suffer
most from the fresh wave of corporate failures likely to be caused by
yesterday's move to crisis-level interest rates.
The former dropped to 281p before stabilising to close a volatile session 19
down at 291p after exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m shares. NatWest was
finally 22 off at 306p, after 301p, with 10m traded. Abbey National, one of
the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, plummeted to 249 1/2 p but embarked on a
good rally which left the stock a net 7 off at 262p.
The jump in interest rates caused dismay in the insurance sectors,
especially among companies involved in mortgage indemnity business, one of
the biggest business cas-ualties of the recession and the plunge in house
prices.
Fears that an imminent and probably large increase in mortgage costs, which
would leave many mortgage holders unable to meet payments, and worries about
the effects of higher interest rates on property values and equity market
valuations impacted heavily on Sun Alliance, which retreated 15 to 239p.
The shares were additionally unsettled by speculation that the group had
lost a golden opportunity to place its near 15 per cent stake in Commercial
Union on Tuesday. CU dipped 8 to 475p.
Royal, heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity, fell 11 to 126p, while Legal &amp;
General, due to announce interims today, ended 18 down at 299p.
In the rest of the stores sector, the poor sentiment in Body Shop spilled
over into Boots, the shares declining 8 to 454p on 3.1m traded. It was,
however, news of higher interest rates that sent several of the stocks in
the sector into retreat. Kingfisher, supported on Tuesday by the release of
figures at the top end of expectations, receded 15 to 459p.
Among brewers, investors focused on overseas earning stocks which offered
some protection against interest rate pressures in the UK. These included
Allied Lyons, 19 stronger at 564p, Grand Metropolitan, which gained 17 on
balance at 409p, having fallen to 371p earlier in the day, and Guinness, up
13 at 529p ahead of today's interim figures.
It was once again a sorry tale in Queens Moat Houses as financial worries
continued to hang over the stock, and the shares finished 6 1/2 weaker at 27
1/2 p on high turnover of 7.9m.

Wood joins a little-known quango, but one moving to the centre of the

Thatcher's policy unit at No 10, and an out-and-out revisionist.
A solid core of the other members are Tories and enthusiastic members of the
'back to basics' school, including four well-known academics: Lord Skidelsky
(Keynes's biographer), John Marks, John Barnes and Gillian Peele.
No doubt Wood's background as an audit partner at Price Waterhouse for 14
years is intended to take the counter-revolution on from Shakespeare to
times tables. But alas, not that many accountants can do the sums themselves
these days.

FT  17 SEP 92 / After the US, the world / Examining the risky global
ambitions of British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conquistadores del Cielo is an exclusive club of aviation industry
heavyweights who meet twice a year in a Californian ranch to eat, drink and
talk in an informal manner about business. But last week's gathering of the
self-styled 'conquerors of the sky' was anything but relaxed.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, and Mr Stephen Wolf, head
of United Airlines, were reported to be lobbying other airline bosses, as
well as aircraft and engine manufacturers, to put pressure on the US
government to block the proposed Dollars 750m acquisition by British Airways
of a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth-largest American carrier.
Political infighting has now reached a rare level of intensity on both sides
of the Atlantic, as the US government prepares to approve or reject the
BA-USAir deal. Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, is flying to
Washington next week for consultations with Mr Andrew Card, his American
opposite number. Yesterday, Mr Card dashed the airlines' hope of a decision
by September 19, and the decision could be delayed because of the political
sensitivity of the issue in a US presidential election campaign.
The stakes are high. Mr Lawrence Nagin, executive vice-president of United
Airlines, describes the proposed BA-USAir deal as 'one of the rare defining
moments' in aviation history. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and
deputy chairman, says the combination with USAir would set BA 'well on the
way to becoming probably the first truly global airline group'.
This has long been BA's ambition. After failing during the past three years
to link up first with United Airlines, then with Sabena of Belgium and more
recently with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the UK carrier has finally succeeded
this year in negotiating a string of alliances and equity investments with
other carriers in an effort to secure its longer-term future as one of the
world's dominant airline groups.
Apart from the USAir investment, BA is establishing a new Moscow-based
international airline with Aeroflot, called Air Russia. It has acquired a 49
per cent stake in a small German carrier called Delta, which has since been
renamed Deutsche BA to strengthen its position in the German market. It
expects to complete next week the acquisition of a large minority stake in
Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), a French regional airline, which will
enable BA to challenge Air France in its home market.
'The missing link is still the Far East,' concedes Lord King, BA's chairman.
But BA is also hunting for partners in the Asia-Pacific market and has
expressed interest in taking a stake in Qantas, the international carrier
being privatised by the Australian government.
Other airlines have also been scrambling to forge alliances, equity
partnerships and close marketing ties with other carriers. The trend towards
globalisation is not new. It is simply the strategic response of the
industry to increasing deregulation, progressive privatisation of state
carriers, the competitive necessity of the stronger airlines to expand, and
the need of financially strapped airlines for fresh capital and partnerships
to survive.
Air France has acquired a large minority stake in Sabena and CSA of
Czechoslovakia this year; Swissair, Singapore Airlines and Delta of the US
have formed a trilateral alliance involving cross-equity stakes between the
three carriers; KLM has a large stake in Northwest Airlines of the US; Air
Canada and Canadian Airlines have just merged and are seeking to combine
with the bankrupt Continental Airlines of the US, in which Scandinavian
Airlines System had earlier bought a costly equity stake; and Lufthansa
yesterday joined the fray by announcing it was considering a joint bid for
Continetal with Mr Marvin Davis, the US financier.
The process is expected to lead to significant concentration in the
industry, with a few large airline groups dominating the international
market. 'Ultimately, there will be, perhaps, no more than 10 or 12 global
airline combines, perhaps fewer: three or four will evolve from the existing
European industry, with similar numbers anchored in North America and the
Far East-Pacific area,' Sir Colin predicts.
But by aggressively challenging the big three US carriers - American, United
and Delta - in their own market with the USAir deal, BA has turned the
battle, which has been building up all year over the North Atlantic, into
all-out war. The three see BA as their biggest threat, not only because of
the UK carrier's financial and marketing strength but also because they feel
BA continues to enjoy unfair advantages under the existing US-UK bilateral
aviation agreement.
This bilateral agreement, claims Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, 'is one of
the most restrictive in the world'. He says it grants BA more access to the
US than any other airline, and severely restricts the rights of US carriers
to compete in the UK market. While BA serves 18 destinations in the US,
American carriers complain the aviation treaty limits the number of US
airlines in the UK market as well as the number of seats they can offer.
They argue the BA-USAir deal would worsen the competitive imbalance by
creating an integrated airline network with European and US market access
that could not be matched by any other US airline because of the restrictive
bilateral agreement. In a joint policy document, the big three US passenger
airlines and the two specialised American freight carriers, Federal Express
and United Parcel Service, have urged their government to negotiate a new
'open skies' agreement with the UK and not place a 'for sale' sign on the US
airline industry.
'This is not a question of British Airways acquiring a toehold in the
lucrative US market, but a potential stranglehold over access to 55m USAir
passengers and 200m freight tonne-kilometres of air cargo a year,' they
claim. They further argue that the BA-USAir deal breaches US airline foreign
ownership rules because the agreement would give BA 'substantial and
effective control over virtually all business aspects of USAir'.
BA scoffs at these charges. 'The fact is that the deal, meeting existing
regulations, has no implications for the UK-US air services agreement
whatsoever: rather, the boot is on the other foot,' Sir Colin says
defiantly. Under the terms of the deal, BA would secure a 44 per cent stake
and 21 per cent of the voting rights in USAir, complying with current US
rules limiting foreign ownership in airlines to 25 per cent of voting
rights.
Moreover, Sir Colin argues that if US carriers want to table new demands
from Britain they should provide commensurate concessions for UK airlines,
including the relaxation of restrictive ownership rules.
The UK has also complained that US carriers have long enjoyed advantages
denied to their international competitors by continuing to dominate their
domestic market with large hub and spoke networks. While BA controls 39 per
cent of take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport, American
controls 65 per cent of slots at Dallas; United 68 per cent at Washington
National and 48 per cent at Chicago; and Delta 70 per cent at Atlanta. Two
years ago, the UK also scrapped traffic restrictions at Heathrow, allowing
American and United to replace the now defunct Pan American and the
struggling TWA at London's biggest airport and BA's traditional home base.
The North Atlantic has traditionally been a big money earner for BA. Even in
a depressed market savaged by a ferocious fares war, America contributed
Pounds 119m of BA's Pounds 344m operating profits for the year ended March
1992. By comparison, Europe made only Pounds 20m.
But there are also risks. Although the USAir investment, involving Dollars
750m of preferred stock carrying an annual dividend of 7 per cent, gives BA
some financial protection, it is still paying Dollars 750m for 44 per cent
of a company currently valued at about Dollars 600m.
It is also betting on a recovery of the US market in which USAir,
revitalised through the BA partnership, would be in a stronger position to
compete against the big three US carriers. But so far there is little sign
of that recovery. 'The situation has reached the point of absurdity in the
US where the fare war is taking on an air of collective suicide,' says Mr
Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, which has marketing links with
USAir.
American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, sparked off the latest
conflict this year by reducing domestic fares by close to 40 per cent. 'Last
year, American lost Dollars 240m. . . Small matter, for what counts is
killing the others,' adds Mr Attali.
A bigger risk for BA is over the north Atlantic itself. A liberalisation of
the existing bilateral US-UK aviation treaty could undermine the airline's
strong profitability on these routes.
The US airlines and their government are pressing European countries to
negotiate new 'open skies' agreements similar to the deal negotiated with
the Netherlands last week. But large European carriers fear this could turn
the North Atlantic market into a free-for-all similar to that which has
shaken the deregulated US market in the past 10 years.
To secure US approval for the BA-USAir transaction, the UK is expected to
make some concessions next week to give US carriers more access to the UK
market, but it is unlikely to link directly any concession with the BA deal.
The question is whether these concessions will be big enough to satisfy the
US carriers' appetite for expansion into the UK and Europe.
Mr Crandall of American has already drawn up an extensive shopping list:
better access to slots at Heathrow; new US destinations to London; allowing
US carriers as many routes out of Heathrow as UK carriers have; unlimited
access to secondary UK cities; more liberal capacity and fares controls;
rights to fly beyond the UK to other European destinations.
Unless the US carriers can secure all or most of these rights, Mr Allen of
Delta argues that US government approval of the BA-USAir deal would be
'tantamount to the USA declaring unilateral economic disarmament'. Such a
reaction, says Sir Colin, only serves to reassure him that BA's agreement
with USAir is 'a good one'.
Whatever the outcome of the current US-UK negotiations, BA's move on USAir
has already triggered a process likely to lead to fundamental change in the
airline business and the way aviation is regulated.
'The transaction holds the prospect of making enormous inroads in the
protectionist thinking that still pervades much of the international
aviation regime, and could well be the lever with which to open Europe and
the US to a free competitive environment,' says Mr Nagin of United.
It could turn the Conquistadores del Cielo into an original script for a
Spielberg blockbuster.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Sterling over the cliff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END was both swift and expensive. With base rate up to 15 per cent and
perhaps as much as Pounds 9bn of foreign exchange intervention thrown in
too, the UK government put the public's money where its mouth has long been.
But it was not enough. The ERM policy became unsustainable because no
British government can defend a parity at the price of a slump. Now the
policy has collapsed and the government must start afresh.
The crisis is not limited to the UK. The ERM itself is under threat, at
least outside its inner core. The 7 per cent devaluation of the lira over
the weekend already seems insufficient, while the Spanish peseta is also
falling fast.
The British government must have wanted to hold on until this weekend's
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Yet it would be wrong to
exaggerate the significance of this vote. French affirmation of the treaty
had earlier been expected to renew the journey towards economic and monetary
union. But that vote may now not make much difference to the future of the
ERM, since the prospect of Emu is so remote as to be almost invisible.
The dwindling plausibility of Emu has left the ERM naked. What has been
needed to clothe it is reconciliation of the Bundesbank's desire for lower
inflation with the hope of the rest of Europe for sustainable economic
growth. This conflict of objectives, following German unification, has not
created purely economic difficulties. It has undermined the European harmony
that the ERM was intended to promote.
Evident conflict
Nowhere has this been more evident than in comments made sotto voce by
German policymakers about British policy and, more openly, by far too many
British politicians about the Germans. The conflict was evident at the
meeting of European finance ministers in Bath earlier this month. It was
implicit in naive remarks from Downing Street that Monday's tiny German
interest rate cuts had 'probably brought forward the time when British
interest rates will move'. They did, but the direction was inevitably
upwards.
Some will criticise the British government's tactics: its failure to raise
interest rates earlier, for example, or more sharply at first yesterday. But
either measure might have been viewed as a sign of panic, not of
determination. It is easier to criticise the way the government reiterated
its desire for lower interest rates, except that the wish would have been
evident even if it had never been expressed.
Less feasible
Continued economic stagnation is what made this policy impossible to pursue.
Indefinite continuation of rates of interest of 15 per cent would have been
still less feasible. When the government said the chances of realignment
were zero, it was being economical with the truth. The chances were hugely
greater than zero, because the costs that would be endured to avoid
devaluation were bound to be limited.
Now, with the sensible decision to suspend sterling from the ERM, the
macroeconomic policy of the government is in a shambles. First it tried
monetary targeting. Then, starting in 1985, the Treasury tried to target the
exchange rate. Now it must think policy out from scratch.
One possibility is to try to clamber back into the ERM as swiftly as
possible. But the argument for joining an ERM that seemed to have credibly
fixed exchange rates is different from the one for joining the present
unstable version, even if it survives in a recognisable form.
The alternative is to continue floating. This would give the government a
higher degree of interest rate flexibility. That, combined with a
depreciation, should allow some recovery, though inflation will probably
continue to fall for some time. The challenge would be to take advantage of
the new opportunity, while preventing the loss of all those hard won
disinflationary gains.
This is a defeat. It is a defeat for the British government's economic
policies, just as it is a defeat for European co-operation. But life goes
on. The British government will have to find new ways of achieving
non-inflationary growth. It will also want to renew co-operation in Europe.
Despair cannot be afforded, still less envenomed recrimination.

KISSINGER: A BIOGRAPHY By Walter Isaacson Faber &amp; Faber. Pounds 25, 893
pages
In the annals of modern American statecraft, no one occupies a more
prominent place than Henry A Kissinger. For eight years under Presidents
Nixon and Ford he dominated the conception, formation and execution of US
foreign policy, at times appearing to act with an authority more solid than
that of the president himself. With Nixon, he extended, then terminated,
America's disastrous entanglement in Indochina, and as the Nixon
administration crumbled, he represented one of Washington's only anchors of
stable government. He initiated detente with Moscow and made the historic
opening to Beijing. Like some other-worldly chess player, he manipulated and
managed foreign crises more single-handedly than any US government officer
before or since.
Yet Kissinger's reputation remains as hotly contested today as it was when
he departed office in 1976. Still admired for his dazzling intellect and
sought after for his international expertise, he is also blamed for much
unnecessary slaughter in far-flung places and held responsible for a lasting
tendency towards duplicity in the US executive branch's handling of foreign
affairs. To his many critics, he is enduringly tainted with the bad smell
that stifled the Nixon presidency - the wire-taps, the petty in-fighting,
the lies.
Walter Isaacson's book is an attempt to pin down this contradictory and
elusive figure once and for all. It is, of course, not the first - if
anything the task is complicated by the existence of Kissinger's own
voluminous, highly readable but subjective memoirs, not to mention the large
corpus of sycophantic and bitterly hostile literature that has appeared in
the past 16 years. But it is undoubtedly the most successful. Isaacson, an
editor with Time magazine, writes with wit and insight; he is also greatly
helped by having had extensive access to his subject without conceding any
editorial control.
This is no hatchet job. The author has weighed the merits and the mistakes
of Kissinger's career. Nevertheless, the portrait that emerges is of a
deeply complex, even bizarre, personality: a mixture of preening arrogance
and foot-stamping paranoia; of irresistible charm, vindictiveness and an
almost pathetic desire to be liked; of strong, but highly changeable,
convictions.
Isaacson plausibly attributes many of these traits to Kissinger's early life
as a Jew in Nazi Germany, where 12 of his relatives perished. But in his
case the refugee's desire for recognition was a mania. As a young academic
at Harvard, he spent much time seeking to ingratiate himself with the
powerful and famous, and from his army days he attached himself to a series
of influential patrons who - recognising his brilliance - secured him
advancement. Having been adopted by the most important patron of all, he
craved celebrity, becoming the darling of the Georgetown dinner circuit, of
TV talk shows, and of the Hollywood starlets whom he conspicuously but
celibately dated.
These personality issues are central to an understanding of Kissinger's
statesmanship. Partly as a result of his background, his world view was
dark. He was heavily influenced by gloomy European thinkers such as
Spengler, and more or less consciously modelled himself on Metternich, of
whose aptitude for intrigue and manipulation he wrote approvingly while at
university. He felt strongly the need for international order, and dismissed
the moralistic or idealistic arguments that often prevail in US foreign
policy debates. This could lead to misjudgments: Kissinger's tendency to
view all regional conflicts through the prism of the cold war, for example,
even when there was no evidence of Moscow's hand, and his disregard for
home-grown political forces in countries he perceived as friends or foes.
What Kissinger felt most strongly of all, however, was his urge both to
command the stage and to direct the performance. His style was devious; he
preferred 'back channels' to formal diplomatic communication, stealth to
openness. On occasion this paid dividends by enabling Kissinger to cut
through the conventional wisdom. As Isaacson argues, the stunning China
initiative would not have been possible had it been conducted through
regular state department channels. But at other times, Kissinger seemed to
choose the cloak and dagger for their own sake. To quote Napoleon on
Metternich, he tended to 'confuse policy with intrigue'. As often as not,
the intrigue was directed at rivals within the administration.
Kissinger might respond to these charges by saying that the means were
justified by the end, which was to steer the US out of its Vietnam debacle
and establish a new balance of global power. In that he succeeded, for a
time. He was certainly more alive than most of his peers to the limits on
American power in the 1970s, and that remains an important legacy at a time
when the US may be on the brink of electing its first Vietnam-generation
president. Where Kissinger erred most substantially, perhaps, was in failing
to understand that Americans need a more compelling justification for an
active involvement in the outside world than his calculating realpolitik.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The Bundesbank and Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PRESTIGE and pride, performance and power, the German Bundesbank is an
exceptional central bank. Prestige stems from its statutory mandate to
maintain German price stability independent of government 'instructions'.
Pride is a result of its anti-inflationary track record, and its
contribution to the stability of a country which in the first half of this
century unleashed two world wars. The Bundesbank's performance feeds and is
fed by the credibility it has established on the financial markets. Power
has been augmented by the postwar circumstances which have made Germany
Europe's strongest economy, and turned the D-Mark into the anchor of the
European Monetary System.
The bank which in all but name has become Europe's central bank is not a
machine. Yet, as an institution, it can prove dangerous for politicians.
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer once complained that the bank was 'responsible to
no one'. Bundesbank policies contributed directly or indirectly to the
breakdown of three German governments, those of Mr Ludwig Erhard in 1966, Mr
Kurt Georg Kiesinger in 1969, and Mr Helmut Schmidt in 1982. High German
interest rates may yet play a part in the downfall of Mr Helmut Kohl. The
Bundesbank is an organism with which governments tangle at their peril.
Exacting standard
All this was known to Mr John Major when, as chancellor of the exchequer, he
took Britain into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in October 1990. In
anchoring themselves to the D-Mark, ERM members have set themselves an
exacting standard; the Bundesbank has often wondered aloud whether Britain
could live up to it. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the president between 1980 and 1991,
forecast in September 1990 that, if it tried to link sterling to the D-Mark
'for all time', the UK could face 'mass unemployment and enormous payments
problems'.
The challenges for all ERM members have risen greatly because of the Bonn
government's policy errors over German unification. Large German deficits
have given an inflationary boost to German growth. This has forced the
Bundesbank to raise interest rates far higher than foreseen two years ago.
Countries - within and outside the ERM - which had hoped to hitch a ride to
price stability on the Bundesbank's coat tails have suffered a bumpier
journey than they imagined. Such countries have also seen their own efforts
to reduce inflation (in France, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium and
Sweden, to below German levels) disregarded by the financial markets. If
there is a culprit, it is, however, Mr Kohl and his fellow politicians, not
the Bundesbank. An important reason for Mr Pohl's resignation was his
unheeded criticism of Mr Kohl's mistakes.
Not unblemished
For all this, the Bundesbank has not emerged unblemished from the fray.
Under Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Mr Pohl's successor, the Bundesbank has placed
too much emphasis in the past 12 months on trying to cut growth in M3 money
supply - an indicator which, partly because of unification strains, has
become a less reliable yardstick of future inflation.
More important, Mr Schlesinger has laid himself open to charges of
disingenuousness or worse through Tuesday's hints of sterling devaluation.
As an academic economist, Mr Schlesinger is entitled to believe that the
pound's level against the D-Mark is too high; he may also have been put
under exceptional strain by this month's pressures for lower German interest
rates. But as a practising central banker, he should know when to keep his
mouth shut - especially when foreign exchange turbulence adds to the
speculative German currency inflows, the disruptive effect of which Mr
Schlesinger most fears.
Britain cannot blame the Bundesbank for its economic problems. But under the
rules of the European Monetary System, it is entitled to assistance, rather
than to sniping. Whether or not Europe proceeds towards economic and
monetary union, central banks and governments will need a modus operandi for
better monetary co-operation. Europe's interests will be ill-served if the
Bundesbank contributes to a climate in which it becomes a scapegoat for
troubles outside Germany.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Devaluation defeat - how '92 differs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every experienced economic journalist who supports a government policy ought
to know that the likelihood is that the rug will be pulled from under him by
the government itself. So I was not surprised by the decision to suspend the
ERM parity, but was aghast at the follies which passed muster for the
defence of sterling.
As a veteran of many sterling crises, I am always astonished by the
astonishment of the official world at the size of each new run on sterling.
During the long period since the end of Bretton Woods, British ministers and
officials seemed to have forgotten about the art of operating a system of
semi-fixed exchange rates. The combination of German unification pressures,
the weak dollar, the hysterical atmosphere surrounding the French referendum
and the Bundesbank's ever more open advocacy of sterling devaluation have
been evident for a long time for those with eyes to see; and a crisis like
this week's has always been very much on the cards.
The government spent far too long waiting to raise interest rates and thus
paraded its reluctance to do so. An independent Bank of England would have
acted earlier, even if only by a few vital hours yesterday.
But the Bank itself is at fault in not doing more to push up the very
short-term rates covering the French referendum period. Yesterday afternoon
dealers were quoting 70 per cent for borrowing sterling until next Monday.
This compared with the overnight marginal lending rate of 500 per cent
imposed by the Swedish Riksbank for its overnight lending rates. In any case
it arrived too late.
There were also the usual piffling political mistakes, such as the prime
minister and chancellor expressing hopes for lower interest rates when the
only thing to have said was that they would go up as much as needed.
Another tactical mistake was to say too little about the resources available
to defend sterling, most of which were apparently still not used. There was
also a technical problem at the highest level, which should have been
resolved years ago.
This was the reluctance of the Bundesbank to fulfil its legal obligation to
give unlimited support to currencies at the bottom end of the parity grid.
The Bundesbank's passionate conviction was that such intervention involved
the creation of more D-Marks and was thus inflationary. This was in sharp
contrast to the attitude of the Fed and the Bank of England, which was that
sterilisation of these inflows was possible and almost automatic. It would
require a medieval scholastic to determine the issue. But the practical need
to establish a modus vivandi was neglected.
The next few days will determine whether the British defeat has been in a
battle or in a war - and not just for the Major goverment but for national
hopes of price stability and non-inflationary growth. It is not a good sign
that having raised MLR to 15 per cent in a panic, the government was not
prepared to stick it out for the few remaining days until the French
referendum result is known.
If the UK were to rejoin the ERM after a French Yes vote at a central rate
somewhere within the previous parity grid, there will be hope. But the
prospects are not promising, as the financial talking classes, the rightwing
xenophobes and the inflationist Left have all tasted blood and will exert
the maximum pressure, both on the government directly and on the foreign
exchange markets, to prevent this happening. The UK's partners will also
want some assurance that Britain's renewed membership is not going to
disrupt the system yet again. One question to be asked in a very necessary
post mortem is why France has been so much better able to withstand the same
pressures.
* * *
Many people have compared the currency pressures today with the events
leading up to the British devaluation of 1967. The two periods have much in
common: numerous passionate official denials of any intention to devalue, a
prime minster and chancellor staking their reputation on maintaining the
parity, and heavy losses in the defence of sterling.
There was, however, one big difference in policies between now and then.
When the Wilson government came to office in 1964 it was asked to choose
between restricting domestic demand and devaluing the pound. It chose
neither and tried to muddle through by overseas borrowing, incomes policies
and marginal industrial intervention. By contrast the Major government
thought it was committed - like the French Socialist government - to a
monetary and fiscal policy giving top priority to maintaining the ERM parity
rather than to 'growth' objectives. It was thrown off-course this time by a
combination of political and market events, having little to do with
fundamentals.
I was present at the fateful press conference at Number 10 Downing Street to
explain the 1967 devaluation, and was booed because the Downing Street
crowds thought that the departing journalists were Cabinet members. I may
well have deserved it. For I had been actively campaigning for devaluation
wherever I could find an outlet. This was rarely. For one difference between
the two periods is that in the 1960s nearly all publications had adopted
self-censorship and never mentioned the 'D' word. This time it became a
cliche - and common ground between left and right-wing critics of John
Major, never previously known to be interested.
Why have I changed my attitude? The main reason is in the realm of ideas. In
the 1960s I wanted governments to increase demand more quickly to stimulate
growth and employment. Devaluation, it was hoped, would remove the balance
of payments constraint against their doing so by making British goods more
competitive. Yet at almost the very same time Milton Friedman gave his
famous 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association,
showing that there was no long-term choice between inflation and
unemployment. The implication was that the main impact of demand stimulation
was just on the price level: growth and employment were determined by the
labour and goods markets - the 'supply side'.
There might still be some short-term arguments about how quickly to reduce
inflation or whether the exchange rate was a useful buffer against outside
shocks. But these were all second-order questions and not the key to growth
and jobs. If this was so, financial policy might as well concentrate on
obtaining the very real gains from stable prices. I came to think that this
could be best achieved by aligning sterling against a currency with a good
record for staple prices, such as the D-Mark.
There was nothing in all this to suggest that stable prices would themselves
lead to rapid growth, as sound money advocates are caricatured by their
opponents as saying. The most that can be asserted is that low inflation is
a precondition for successful growth policies and that British - unlike, for
instance, Italian - business has not been very nimble at adjusting to high
inflation.
A devaluation is fool's gold. Once it has been forced, the foreign exchange
market expects another; and to insure sterling holders the UK needs a higher
level of interest rates.
Moreover, estimates of comparative purchasing power suggest that sterling
was not overvalued except against the dollar. The heart of the
devaluationists' case is embodied in John Muellbauer's suggestion in the
Financial Times of September 14 that relative UK competitiveness was some 20
per cent less than it was over the average of 1964-79, despite the
purchasing power estimates.
There are many dubious aspects of such a remote index number comparison. If
it was the whole story it would be difficult to understand why - as shown in
the second chart - the UK share of world trade was falling when sterling was
supposed to be very competitive, but has roughly stabilised since the early
1980s when sterling has been supposedly overvalued. This does not dispose of
the UK's high propensity to import; but it is difficult to demonstrate that
it is higher than other countries', especially if account is taken of the
implications of inward Japanese investment, which has already turned the UK
into a net exporter of television sets and is likely to eliminate the
deficit on cars by the mid-1990s.
More insight is obtained by looking at competitiveness against the US and
Germany separately. On the OECD unit labour costs index, Britain is just as
competitive against Germany as it was over 1965-79. The deterioration has
been against the US. This fits in with the complaints of British business
which have been against the low dollar rather than the D-Mark parity. But
this affects all European countries, and Japan cannot be met by unilateral
British action. As a matter of fact Britain looks more competitive against
Germany than it does against other members of the ERM - a fact which makes
me all the more sceptical of how useful the indices are for currency fine
tuning.
All this is shadow boxing. What really influences me now is the UK's long
history of repeated self-defeating currency depreciation, The first chart
shows that sterling has dropped from DM 11 to less than DM 2.8 since 1965.
Against the basket it has fallen by more than 50 per cent since 1970. Yet
the result has been either no improvement in competitiveness, or a
deterioration if Muellbauer's indices are right. Clearly the nominal
depreciation has been offset by inflation.
Even the most sophisticated devaluation advocates overlook the distinction
between a one-off adjustment and a succession of downward adjustments. The
latter become entrenched in the labour as well as the financial markets and
become just part of an ongoing inflationary process.
Periodic devaluations are rather like trying to get up earlier by shifting
the clock. On a one-off occasion it may work; but repeated many times over
it is self-defeating and worse.

Organisers of Sovereign, the Victoria and Albert Museum's long-running
exhibition (of which Pearson was one of the sponsors) have the pensioners of
Ambridge - rather than the tabloid newspapers - to thank for a late rally in
attendance figures.
The show, which marked the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession, at
first did abysmally. However, after a final gate of 180,000 by the time it
closed last Sunday, it is now being hailed as a 'popular success'.
In August, Sovereign's visitor figures did improve - coinciding with
revelations about the Windsors' marital difficulties. But then the V&amp;A had
the bright idea of contacting The Archers, BBC Radio 4's immortal soap about
Midlands village life.
In the first week of September, an audience of around 7,500,000 heard Jack
and Peggy wave off the coach containing Ambridge's Over Sixties Club on its
annual summer outing - to see Sovereign.
The result, gloats the V&amp;A's upmarket press office, was a final week which
was 'absolutely heaving'.
A plug on The Archers must now be every pr's dream.

How do Russia's new business managers compare with their longer experienced
counterparts in Britain? Like energetic and ambitious youngsters set beside
cautious conservative oldies, according to Moscow researcher Mark Urnov who
has been studying samples of both as part of his work at the Academy of the
National Economy, and the Gorbachev Institute.
The study, made in collaboration with the UK's Sundridge Park Management
Centre, showed that a mere 13 per cent of the British set great store by
outperforming everyone else around, as against a third of the Russians.
Moreover, whereas nearly half of Urnov's home-country sample thought it very
important to work for a highly regarded outfit, the same was true of only 14
per cent of the UK contingent.
'British managers are a little tired of life,' he said - and that was before
the hike in base rates.

Half an hour before the first base rate increase of the day, Pearl Assurance
was yesterday biking around the City the latest results of the Pearl
Investor Confidence Index - which proudly showed a rise for the first time
since May.
'Tough,' says Pearl's insouciant marketing manager Martin Fox. 'It
accurately mirrored people's views two weeks ago' - when the interviews were
conducted.
But Pearl's mistiming is as nought compared with that of Bundesbank
president Helmut Schlesinger who, had he nothing else on his mind, might be
wishing he had chosen a different title for the speech he delivered at the
Institute of World Economics in Kiel on Monday.
Receiving the Bernhard-Harms medal for contributions to world economic
affairs, he spoke on the subject of 'Progress in the monetary integration of
western Europe'.

Yorkshire-based Spring Ram Corporation likes to have a bit of a do to mark
its results meetings. Last year, for instance, the bathrooms and kitchens
group brought 15 carnation-sporting directors to London, to give them a view
of City types. This time the mountain is going to Mohammed - or Bradford, at
any rate.
Bradford is the venue for the announcement of its interim figures, so a
'Spring Ram Train' has been chartered to ferry analysts, fund managers and
journalists - animals that companies normally try to keep in separate cages
on such occasions.
They will be herded round two factories (the group is spending more than
Pounds 100m on new plants) and fed in Tong, an upmarket village on the
city's outskirts.
Whether the junket will improve sentiment is another matter.
Having grown rapidly to make Pounds 37.6m pre-tax profit last year, the
company has recently sparked an outbreak of doubt among some analysts. In
the summer came a downgrading of profit forecasts, from Pounds 45m to Pounds
40m for the full year, and the share price fell sharply.
With questions being raised about accounting techniques, some companies
might think it time to keep their head down, but thenRam was never noted for
its cautious quiescence.
Perhaps it is hoping it will be easier to work the old magic on its home
turf.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Observer: Those darn foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Haven't we been here before? Yesterday's activities in London bear some
uncanny similarities to events 61 years ago, when the very same date saw the
start of the countdown to Britain's departure from the gold standard on
Monday September 21.
As international financial confidence in Britain's policies drained away,
the Bank of England lost Pounds 3.5m in reserves on Wednesday September 16.
With foreign exchange tension increased by a mutiny in the Royal Navy,
together with fears of an early general election, the reserve losses
increased to Pounds 10m on Thursday, and Pounds 18.75m on Friday.
The government made frantic efforts to arrange fresh loans from New York to
shore up the pound, with a certain Thomas Lamont - a senior partner in JP
Morgan - playing an important part in the negotiations. But the decision to
end the link with gold was made on Friday evening.
Announcing the decision, as well as a rise in bank rate from 4.5 per cent to
6 per cent, the government issued the following soothing statement, carried
in Monday's newspapers:
'This emergency measure, it must be recognised, clearly is in no sense a
reflection upon the internal conditions of the country. It arises from the
fact that foreigners, largely because of a lack of confidence in the
stability of their own countries, have thrown such pressure upon sterling
that it has become temporarily necessary to arrest the abnormal withdrawals
of gold which have resulted.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Greater frequency of realignments only way forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN HOFFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Some feel that Monday's rate cut damaged the independence of the
Bundesbank. But the key violation of independence happened five years ago.
Monday's rate cut was only an example - admittedly, the most dramatic so far
 -of the results of the exchange rate mechanism procedures introduced in
1987 (the so-called Basle-Nyborg Agreement), which require the Bundesbank to
finance intervention that is in principle unlimited, to stop another
currency from breaching its lower ERM limit. By inflating the German money
supply, such a requirement directly conflicts with the Bundesbank's
statutory responsibility of safeguarding the D-Mark.
Surely the lesson of Monday's cut is that the Bundesbank cannot be expected
to operate in the face of such direct conflicts of interests. That is why
the ERM has no choice but to go forwards - to EMU - to more frequent
realignments; the present state of limbo is completely unsustainable.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Inflexibility meets naivety: What Schlesinger said
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an institution that prides itself as a paragon of conservatism and
stability, the German Bundesbank seems suddenly to have become remarkably
accident-prone.
Twice in a matter of days, the mighty central bank has been forced to issue
agonised denials of statements attributed to it, on each occasion too late
to prevent a blood-letting on the currency markets.
First it was a confidential report by a leading French bank, saying the
Bundesbank believed the lira, peseta and sterling were all 'candidates for
devaluation'.
Now it is Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president, who denies having told two
business newspapers that the problems of the currency market have yet to be
resolved, more currencies will come under pressure, and a more comprehensive
realignment within the European Monetary System would have been better.
What is up? Is it all a terrible plot by the beastly Bundesbank to bash the
Brits? Or is it a tale of incompetence, a chapter of accidents by a
lumbering institution, a public relations nightmare and no more?
The latest tale of woe is certainly indicative. Mr Schlesinger decided to
give a simultaneous session on Tuesday afternoon to Germany's Handelsblatt
and the US Wall Street Journal. His intention was apparently to answer the
barrage of criticism, at home and abroad, that the Bundesbank had lost its
credibility as an independent institution. The charge is that it was
pressured politically into easing its interest rates in exchange for a
limited realignment in the EMS on Monday.
The interview was only granted on the guarantee that the subsequent
publication would be carefully cleared by the bank's press department - a
common German practice, but a considerable concession for the Journal. What
Mr Schlesinger failed to take into account were the inflexible deadlines of
his own national newspapers.
An interview at 4pm was clearly a challenge for the US publication, but it
managed to clear the article in time. A respectable, but unexciting version,
warning against expectations of further interest rate cuts, duly appeared
yesterday. Only one slightly dubious quote slipped through: 'One can see
that the problems aren't finally solved,' Mr Schlesinger was quoted as
saying. 'But it looks much quieter than it did last Friday.'
The same cannot be said for Handelsblatt, a paper with a reputation almost
as worthy as that of the Bundesbank. It was quite unable to process an
entire interview in time for its late afternoon deadline. So it decided to
run a brief summary, and publish the interview today. Even then, the summary
story only made the last few thousand copies of the print run. But the
result caused consternation in the corridors of Europe's central banks -
above all in London and Frankfurt itself.
As German newspapers often do with a good story, Handelsblatt sent a summary
of the story to the news agencies in advance, and it was humming on the
wires by 8pm on Tuesday. As soon as the news got to London, the Bank of
England rang the Bundesbank, demanding an explanation. It was told the
interview was 'unauthorised'. Nothing shocking would appear. By then the
uncensored summary was coming off the Handelsblatt presses. It was too late
to stop it, even though it was barely 9pm.
Did Schlesinger say, or did he not, that he would have preferred a more
comprehensive alignment? 'He did not say that, and he did not mean that,' a
Bundesbank spokesman replied. Yesterday, Handelsblatt and the bank's press
department were locked in what one participant called 'a damage limitation
exercise'.
Mr Werner Benkhoff, the head of the newspaper's currency and capital markets
department who conducted the interview, is unrepentant. 'We stand by the
story. The content accurately reflected what he said,' he insisted
yesterday. 'But we also admit that it was not the authorised version.'
One person closely involved says the Handelsblatt excerpts were simply 'the
direct quotes in indirect speech'.
The whole truth will probably never be published. But it does say something
about inflexible German press practices, and the naivety of the correct and
courteous Mr Schlesinger. He was stating, or leaving the impression of,
little other than the obvious. The fact that it came from the president of
the Bundesbank is what caused the consternation. 'Your boss is too honest
for his own good,' was the comment made to a Bundesbank official overheard
in the corridor after the interview.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, As the government struggles daily to maintain the existing parity of
sterling against the D-Mark one may recall J M Keynes's warning to the prime
minister, Ramsay MacDonald, in August 1931 when unemployment was approaching
3m and sterling was under pressure:
'It is now nearly certain that we shall go off the existing parity at no
distant date. When doubts as to the prosperity of a currency such as now
exist about sterling have come into existence, the game is up.'
In less than two months Britain left the Gold Standard and sterling
depreciated quickly and sharply against the German mark.
Will the present government's resolve be allowed to last as long?

FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Body Shop environmental initiatives defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID WHEELER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, the Body Shop simply cannot win. It was the first company to produce an
independently verified environmental statement in line with the proposed
European Community eco-audit regulation. It is the only company to campaign
publicly for mandatory comprehensive environmental audits for industry. It
is one of only a handful of companies genuinely trying to move from
conventional principles of environmental management towards real sustainable
development - recently announcing its intention to go energy self-sufficient
using renewable sources only.
And yet the Financial Times uses the Body Shop's recently published Green
Book as a convenient peg on which to hang some pretty obvious arguments
about the need for independent, objective scrutiny of companies'
environmental performance ('Style without substance', September 16). Rather
than homing in on any number of 'green gloss' efforts which have been
published by major companies in recent months, the Financial Times chooses
one of the very few absolutely honest statements to make its case.
This is a cheap shot, and one which does no credit either to the reputation
of financial journalism or to the arguments which are being made. If the
Financial Times had taken the trouble to consult those in the environmental
profession or in environmental journalism who are familiar with the
substance behind the Body Shop's environmental initiatives a different story
would have emerged.
At the very moment when the UK government is preparing further to dilute the
European eco-audit regulation, the Financial Times has handed industry the
perfect argument for avoiding mandatory auditing altogether. If the Body
Shop, with its reputation and record, gets cheap commentary for producing
independently vetted environmental statements, what hope is there for anyone
else?

FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Not a cause of sick buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES E ROSSITER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Catherine Milton quotes from a conference paper by Alan Hedge and
colleagues suggesting that man-made mineral fibres are a cause of sick
building syndrome ('The answer might just be blowing in the wind', September
8). I have serious reservations about the paper's conclusions.
The most serious concerns the sampling methodology for determining man-made
mineral fibre exposure, and the statistical methodology. I question the use
of settled, rather than airborne, dust measurement. I also believe the
analytical technique for assessing the fibre concentrations was such that
the numbers of organic fibres were not measured. Yet the majority of
airborne fibres are usually organic, from paper, carpets, furnishings, etc.
The entire statistical conclusion of a significant effect of exposure to
man-made mineral fibres is based on just one exceptionally high measurement
of only one office site. An alternative, proper statistical analysis shows
no statistically significant association between sick building syndrome
findings and the amount of settled man-made mineral fibre dust. It can even
be inferred from this study that sick building syndrome findings may be
caused by the cleaning policy in a particular office park.
In brief, this paper provides no supportable information for or against the
suggestion that man-made mineral fibres released from ceiling tiles can
cause sick building syndrome. The conclusion that the fibres can cause the
syndrome conflicts with a larger recent Health and Safety Executive study
which did not implicate man-made mineral fibres.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Britain blames the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING STREET last night launched an unprecedented attack on the Bundesbank
by laying most of the blame for the unfolding sterling crisis on the German
central bank.
In a breach of convention that served only to stress the extent of the
British government's anger, Downing Street detailed at least five occasions
on which senior Bundesbank board members or unknown bank sources had used
language that had undermined the pound.
In unusually frank terms, senior officials said the straw that had broken
the camel's back had been the reports yesterday of an interview given by Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, to the Handelsblatt and the
Wall Street Journal newspapers.
'If, within a system like the ERM, someone is openly saying something about
a currency, then it becomes a one-way bet,' a senior government official
said.
Downing Street said that late on Tuesday Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
had repeatedly interrupted a formal dinner at the home of the US Ambassador
to London to call Germany in a bid to suppress comments by Mr Schlesinger
that implicitly sug-gested the pound would be devalued.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, was also
frantically telephoning his colleagues in Frankfurt as part of the
fire-fighting operation.
But in the end the advance reports of Mr Schlesinger's words proved a fatal
combination with the weakening dollar, high D-Mark interest rates and the
unease provoked by the approach of Sunday's French referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty.
The Bundesbank last night rejected the criticisms. The British government's
decision to leave the ERM was its own and did not involve the German central
bank or the Bonn government, though there had been telephone consultation,
said an official.
The Bundesbank could 'neither welcome nor regret' the decision.
The official added that problems of the UK could not be blamed on the
Bundesbank. 'Other factors are involved than the interest rate policies of
the Bundesbank.'
As sterling's value slipped yesterday afternoon, prime minister John Major
telephoned Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, to explain the UK's
decisions and why they were being taken. A Downing Street official tersely
described the prime minister's tone as 'firm'.
The five occasions on which Bundesbank comments affected the pound cited by
Downing Street included:
August 25: Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making
council, sent tremors through the markets by suggesting an ERM shake-up
could be in the offing;
August 28: Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the seven-man permanent
directorate, expressed the view that there was no reason to cut German
interest rates;
September 10: 'unknown sources' suggested that the pound should devalue;
September 15: newspapers and news agencies reported sources in the
Bundesbank and Bonn as suggesting that a sterling devaluation could not be
ruled out;
Yesterday: Mr Schlesinger was widely quoted as saying that Europe's
financial problems were unresolved in spite of Sunday's realignment which he
did not deem to be enough.
Faced with this barrage of comments from Germany, it was hardly surprising
that the strenuous efforts of both the prime minister and the chancellor to
sustain confidence in the pound had foundered, the official implied.
Once the market had decided that a sterling devaluation was inevitable
interest rates could have been raised by 'hundreds of per cent' without
having any impact on the markets, the official added.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Mortgages safe until next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial and Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE lenders reacted with dismay at the prospect of a sharp increase in
mortgage interest rates yesterday, but said the market was in such disarray
that no decision about a new rate could be taken before next week.
Halifax and Abbey National, the largest mortgage lenders, forestalled a
mortgage rate rise by small lenders by indicating swiftly that they would
not raise rates immediately.
There were widespread fears that any tentative recovery in the housing
market could be seriously set back even though the higher level in lending
rates is to be limited to 12 per cent.
'Confidence is bound to be damaged,' said Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive
of National Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank.
Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, the biggest bank, said that 'some
companies may go down' if economic recovery is delayed.
Leading UK industrialists reacted with dismay yesterday to the rise in
interest rates before the announcement last night that the second increase
would not take place. They also expressed fears that this would deal a
further blow to consumer demand and deepen the recession.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'We are disappointed that the government has been blown off course by
the currency markets.
'We think the Government should urgently restore some certainty to its
financial policy, because the absence of clear guidelines will further
weaken business confidence and the prospects for economic recovery.'
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation,
said: 'This crisis demonstrates the need for a single currency in Europe.
But what is essential now for the UK - irrespective of what happens to the
pound - is to formulate an industrial strategy which will promote recovery
and sustained economic success.'
A minority, led by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, the industrial
conglomerate, argued that sterling should be taken out of the ERM entirely.
'These are war conditions. We have to know what we are fighting for. Is it a
British pound or a D-Mark pound?' Sir Owen said. 'If we start to devalue,
all the precedents say we don't know what the rate should be. If we float,
we know what the real value is for the British pound and call up the
troops.'
Most industrialists reluctantly accepted, however, that the government had
little choice but to act as it did and supported its efforts to defend
sterling's parity within the European exchange rate mechanism.
For most businesses the most pressing concern was the outlook for demand.
Some argued that, almost regardless of what happened next, yesterday's
events had inflicted a devastating blow to consumer demand.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Sterling is suspended within ERM: Government forced to
retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, PETER MARSH and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S government was last night forced into a humiliating
climbdown from its attempt to hold sterling's value against the D-Mark. The
reversal came after an unprecedented 5 percentage point rise in interest
rates to 15 per cent failed to avert a full-scale sterling crisis.
The announcement that sterling's membership was being 'suspended' in the
exchange rate mechanism brought acknowledgment at Westminster that the pound
would be devalued against the D-Mark before rejoining the ERM. The decision
meant sterling was, in effect, left to float at the mercy of the markets.
The depth of the political and economic crisis was underlined last night
when the government bowed to opposition demands and announced that
parliament would be recalled next Thursday.
Sterling's fall below its ERM floor had begun after the close of trade in
Europe and finished in New York last night about 8 pfennigs below the floor.
The decision to suspend sterling plunged Mr Major's government into
political turmoil, undercutting the central plank of the prime minister's
economic strategy. Mr Major had repeatedly insisted that he would never
devalue.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the suspension meant that the second
of the two interest rate rises announced during yesterday's chaos would not
come into effect. Base rates will stand at 12 per cent this morning, against
10 per cent yesterday.
As senior EC officials began talks in Brussels - at the invitation of Mr
Lamont in his capacity as president of the EC finance council - on the
turmoil which engulfed the European exchange rate mechanism, there was
speculation among Tory MPs that Mr Lamont might be forced to resign  - but
the initial signals from 10 Downing Street were that he would remain in
office.
Mr Lamont was understood to be hoping that sterling would rejoin the ERM on
Monday, after the French referendum. However there is no precedent for a
currency suspending its ERM membership.
No decision has been taken on the level at which sterling would rejoin the
mechanism.
As the atmosphere of crisis engulfed Whitehall, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
the Bank governor, joined ministers to discuss whether the government would
have to abandon the central plank of its anti-inflation strategy -
maintaining sterling's DM2.95 central rate in the ERM.
In spite of yesterday's increase in UK interest rates and massive central
bank intervention to support the pound, sterling had closed in London at
DM2.7500, down 3 pfennigs on the day and below its ERM floor of DM2.778.
The government's vain efforts to defend the currency began with large-scale
buying of pounds by the Bank of England. Next came the announcement of two
rises in interest rates and finally, the suspension of the currency in the
ERM coupled with a reversal of the second of the increases in borrowing
rates.
Yesterday was the first time in modern history that the Bank had raised
interest rates twice in one day. It is also the first time on record that UK
interest rates rose 5 percentage points within 24 hours.
The rises in interest rates came as the Bank of England spent an estimated
Pounds 7bn - roughly a third of its foreign currency reserves - in buying
sterling for D-Marks. The Bundesbank and the Bank of France co-operated in
the intervention to prop up the UK currency, spending an estimated Pounds
2bn.
The increase in credit rates, coming as Britain remains in the grip of its
longest peactime recession since the 1930s, was defended earlier in the day
by Mr Lamont on the grounds that Britain would 'take whatever measures are
necessary' to maintain sterling's ERM parity.
The speculation against the present ERM parities also threatened to spark a
political crisis within the European Community, with Britain blaming the
Bundesbank for fuelling the speculators' selling of the pound.
The series of emergency meetings of government ministers yesterday had
prompted widespread speculation in Whitehall that Mr Lamont would have to
leave the government if there were a general realignment of ERM currencies.
One or two Tory MPs called publicly for the chancellor to resign
immediately.
Among those summoned by Mr Major to his temporary Whitehall office were Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary.
As the clamour grew, prompted in part by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
for a recall of parliament from its summer recess, Mr Major also consulted
party managers and senior Tory backbenchers.
The rises in interest rates had brought protests from business and the
threat of open revolt by some Conservative MPs. Mr William Cash, a Tory
backbencher and a stern critic of Mr Major's ERM policy, said: 'We are in a
state of political shambles.'
One suggestion last night was that the present ERM parity would be suspended
until after the result of Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht. Another
was that the pound would be devalued with the Italian lira and the Spanish
peseta in a general realignment of exchange rates which could include
another cut in German interest rates.
The two interest rate hikes effectively wiped out all the reductions in
interest rates since Mr Major took sterling into the ERM as chancellor two
years ago.
Labour officials were suggesting last night that the opposition would to
make the prime minister - rather than the chancellor - the principal target
for the party's attack when parliament is recalled.
The officials said: 'We are not going to accept that Norman Lamont might be
the ultimate fall guy, for it was the prime minister who could not have been
more categorical about staking his reputation on the value of the pound.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / ERM in turmoil after confusion in markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economic StaffF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S MEMBERSHIP of the European exchange rate mechanism was suspended
yesterday after the largest assault by currency speculators on the European
exchange rate system since its formation in 1979.
The move ended a day of extraordinary confusion on European foreign exchange
markets, and allowed the government to rescind the second of two interest
rate rises it had announced during the day.
The Bank of England had earlier announced rises in the benchmark minimum
lending rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and then to 15 per cent.
The turmoil came after foreign exchange traders pounced on the uncertainty
surrounding next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on
European union to increase speculation about an imminent realignment of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
An emergency meeting of the European Community's monetary committee - with
powers to decide on currency realignments - was also called last night after
intense talks among senior economic policymakers in European capitals.
Attempts by European central banks to discourage the speculators had failed.
The announced 5 percentage point rise in UK interest rates and huge
purchases of sterling by the Bank of England left the pound beneath its
permitted floor against the D-Mark in the ERM. Other big interventions in
Europe did not alleviate renewed pressure on the Italian lira - devalued by
7 per cent at the weekend - and the peseta.
Although the pressure was highest in London, most of Europe's financial
capitals were in turmoil:
In London, overnight money market rates spiked to 100 per cent, while the
one-month rate climbed towards 30 per cent. The stock market, however,
rallied on expectations of an imminent devaluation of sterling and prospects
for German interest rate cuts. In New York trading, the pound was quoted
below DM2.73, compared with its official floor of DM 2.7780.
In Stockholm, the Swedish central bank raised marginal lending rates to
banks from 75 per cent to 500 per cent, in a bid to squeeze out speculators
against the krona. The krona is outside the ERM, but tied to the European
currency unit.
In Rome, the government was in meetings with the Bank of Italy, as the lira
fell through its permitted floor against the D-Mark.
In Madrid, economic policymakers expected a sharp rise in interest rates
from 13 per cent.
Efforts to ease the pressure were seen in countries with the stronger ERM
currencies.
The German Bundesbank intervened in the money markets to nudge domestic
interest rates lower, and rumours circulated that a further move was likely
today.
Belgium and the Netherlands announced one-quarter cuts in interest rates.
The ERM's last wide-ranging realignment was in 1987, but this was before
sterling - one of the five most heavily traded of the world's currencies -
joined the system in October 1990.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said in London that a further
realignment was likely soon.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries are expected to record, this year and next, their
strongest economic growth in a decade, the International Monetary Fund says
in its World Economic Outlook.
Output in the developing world is projected to grow by 6.2 per cent in both
1992 and 1993, compared with 3.2 per cent in 1991. Senior IMF officials say
this strength is one of the main reasons behind their forecasts for an
economic recovery in the whole world.
The fund says the outlook has deteriorated in southern and eastern Africa,
scene of drought and civil war. Elsewhere, however, lower US interest rates,
with debt restructuring agreements, have mitigated the sluggishness of world
demand and the weakness of commodity prices.
The IMF acknowledges the impact of lower interest rates but attributes much
of the improvement in performance to the efforts of a increasing number of
countries to overhaul their economic structures. The IMF says as many as 35
countries, accounting for more than half of developing world output, can now
be said to have embarked on successful attempts at this kind of structural
adjustment.
'The key to their performance has been determined efforts to reduce fiscal
deficits and to control inflation. Equally significant has been their
recognition of the importance of market forces: most of these countries have
acted to liberalise foreign trade, to cut subsidies and to privatise state
enterprises,' the outlook says.

Norman Lamont leaving the Treasury by the back door last night after making
this statement:
'Today has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day. Massive financial
flows have continued to disrupt the functioning of ERM.
'As chairman of the council of European finance ministers I have called a
meeting of the monetary committee in Brussels urgently tonight to consider
how stability can be restored to foreign exchange markets.
'In the meantime the government has concluded that Britain's best interests
are served by suspending our membership of the exchange rate mechanism.
'As a result the second of the two interest rate increases that I sanctioned
today will not take place tomorrow. The minimum lending rate will be at 12
per cent until conditions become calmer.
'I will be reporting to cabinet, discussing the situation with colleagues
tomorrow and may make further statements then. But until then I have nothing

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Outflow of funds in day put at Pounds
10bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXHAUSTED foreign exchange traders, many still at their desks after a
12-hour day of frantic dealing, were last night unfazed by sterling's
suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Dealers estimated that more than Pounds 10bn of capital flowed out of the UK
yesterday as fund managers and corporate treasurers tried to reduce their
exposure to sterling.
The suspension announcement, at the end of the most hectic day many traders
could remember, came after intense speculation that a devaluation of
sterling was inevitable.
'No one was really surprised. The pressure was just too great,' said Mr
Julian Simmonds, head of foreign exchange trading at Citibank. 'Another day
like today would have been impossible.'
Earlier, the announcement of a five-point rise in official interest rates to
15 per cent failed to stem a massive outflow of funds from the UK financial
markets.
International fund managers and corporate treasurers joined foreign exchange
dealers in a flight from sterling as their expectations of a devaluation of
the currency mounted.
One trader said: 'The central banks were buying sterling and the rest of the
world was selling. It was no contest.' Even a rise in overnight rates to 100
per cent - a level that makes it extremely expensive to take short positions
 -failed to dim the speculative ardour of foreign exchange dealers.
'Dealers have had such success in manipulating the central banks that they
are prepared to play very, very hard,' said Mr John Clark, an arbitrage
dealer at Tokai International. 'There is no fear of being caught the wrong
way.'
Traders continued to pursue the 'scent of blood', buoyed by handsome profits
won on the devaluation of the lira.
'As soon as the lira went, it was curtains for sterling,' said Mr Richard
Neville Rolfe, a foreign exchange trader at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. 'The
feeling that there was going to be a devaluation became much stronger
throughout the day, especially when the two rate rises made absolutely no
impact on the sterling/D-Mark rate.'
The extra 5 per cent on interest rates - later revised to 2 per cent with
the announcement of sterling's suspension from the ERM - actually pushed the
currency down further. 'In a currency crisis of this scale, interest rates
at the margin are no protection,' one trader argued.
While some analysts felt the market was getting carried away, others such as
Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Midland Montagu, argued: 'The
foreign exchange traders are behaving rationally in that they feel there is
a snowball effect behind the weaker members of the ERM. There has been one
devaluation, so why shouldn't there be another?'
In any case, it was not the speculative bent of foreign exchange dealers
that pushed sterling three pfennings below its floor in the ERM yesterday,
during London trading. The massive flow of capital from the UK market
yesterday could not have been orchestrated by speculative traders alone.
'Investors are selling pounds on an entirely rational basis,' said Mr Paul
Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'To
safeguard the value of their money, investors are putting their money in
D-Marks instead.'
While UK-based funds, which are generally sterling-based, were relatively
inactive, there was widespread selling of sterling by fund managers in Asia,
continental Europe and the US.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Uncertainty for homeowners until French
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS will probably have to wait until next week to see if the rise in
official interest rates is translated into costlier mortgages.
Building societies seem to be waiting until after Sunday's French referendum
on Maastricht before deciding. The hope is that the jump to a higher level
will be temporary and that the mortgage rate will not have to follow suit.
Societies are well aware that a rise in rates would further damage the
already feeble housing market.
The main reaction from some lenders was to withdraw offers of fixed-rate
mortgages below 10 per cent. Those tend to be funded by borrowing in the
wholesale markets and thus quickly become unprofitable when rates rise.
Savers might benefit from higher interest rates but will have even longer to
wait. Building societies are traditionally slower to raise rates for savers
than for borrowers. Given that societies have been complaining about
pressure on their margins, an increase in savings rates may be limited.
But investors may be able to look forward to increased income from
fixed-rate products such as guaranteed income bonds and annuities. Rates on
such products are determined by gilt yields, which rose yesterday.
Most banks will not decide whether to raise mortgage rates and other
'managed' interest rates for personal customers and small businesses until
financial markets stabilise. NatWest and Barclays may decide in the next two
days, although Lloyds said it would not alter rates until after the French
referendum.
Bank loans linked directly to base rates rose by at least 2 percentage
points yesterday.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Small business braced for impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS TUBBS, managing director of Tubbs Elastics, a family business with
turnover of nearly Pounds 8m and 200 employees, reacted swiftly to the
two-stage increase in interest rates.
He postponed the purchase of three new directors' cars, put off upgrading of
the company's computer system and cancelled a photocopier machine contract.
A more expensive, longer-term project to refurbish a factory will go ahead.
Mr Tubbs may have reacted more rapidly than most small companies, but his
concern at what proved to be a shortlived rise to 15 per cent was not
untypical.
Mr David Richardson, a Leeds partner of chartered surveyors Weatherall,
Green &amp; Smith, said: 'I don't want to speak of shock and horror . . but a
hike of 50 per cent in interest charges is horrific. Businesses cannot
sustain interest rates at that level given present rates of economic
activity.'
Small businesses are more sensitive to interest-rate movements because they
depend to a greater extent than large companies on borrowed funds. They are
often less sophisticated in financial management techniques and lack
negotiating muscle.
The banks calculate that only half their small business customers have
borrowings at any one time, but tend to use variable rate loans and are
often reluctant to take out fixed-interest term borrowings.
The Forum of Private Business calculates that 37 per cent of its members
have fixed-interest loans. Small businesses are also very dependent on
short-term overdraft finance.
The Federation of Small Businesses calculated that if yesterday's
5-percentage-point increase in official interest rates fed through into base
rates it would add Pounds 1bn a year to small businesses' interest charges.

STIMULATING an increase in private foreign investment is the key to
restoring prosperity in Russia and other former Soviet republics, senior
World Bank officials indicated yesterday.
Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, bank vice-president for Europe and central Asia, said
public sector agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund could provide a substantial share of the external financing needs of
eastern European economies. But they were unlikely to be able to meet more
than about 15 per cent of the needs of the former Soviet Union.
'The aim is to create conditions that quickly lead to large and increasing
flows of private capital. This must play a predominant role in the medium
term,' said Mr Russ Cheetham, the bank's director of operations in former
Soviet republics.
However, at present, private equity inflows were less than Dollars 500m for
all republics combined, a 'miniscule' figure relative to their needs.
Hungary, by contrast, had already attracted about Dollars 1.5bn in private
inflows. The Russian oil industry was one of the sectors most in need of
foreign investment and expertise. The sector's total capital needs were
about Dollars 25bn.
Mr Thalwitz said the bank planned to lend about Dollars 5bn to eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union in fiscal 1993, more than twice the total
for last year. Some of the planned loans, however, were conditional on
countries agreeing IMF programmes. The bank was earmarking Dollars
2bn-Dollars 2.2bn for Russia and other republics in fiscal 1993, which began
in July. Loans to former Soviet republics could rise towards Dollars
4bn-Dollars 5bn in future years but no precise targets had been set.
Mr Thalwitz said risks for lenders were considerable. 'I see a lot of
hesitation and social tension that will slow' reform efforts. However, the
bank hoped eventually for a return on its investments.
He said none of what were the centrally planned economies was likely to
regain pre-reform levels of output before the end of the century. In some
cases, the output decline would reach 40 per cent before a recovery began.

FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Fund reduces forecast of global
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has found little to cheer about in the five
months since it last produced a forecast on the world economy.
The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook says global economic activity showed
signs of revival in the first half of this year and it projects continued
recovery 'at a moderate pace' over the next 12 months.
However, the fund has trimmed its expectations of world output growth this
year by 0.3 percentage points since May, to 1.1 per cent, and cut its growth
projection for 1993 by 0.4 points to 3.1 per cent. It warns: 'The expansion
continues to be slow and uneven, and the balance of risks remains on the
downside.'
The IMF attributes this state of affairs largely to the failure of its
industrialised member countries to achieve important goals in the
medium-term growth strategies they set for themselves in the 1980s.
While progress has been made towards reducing inflation, the record in other
areas - such as cutting government deficits to encourage savings and
investment, job creation through structural reform and the elimination of
obstacles to efficient resource allocation - 'has been disappointing'.
The IMF laments the persistence of large budget deficits in many member
states. 'Major efforts to reduce fiscal imbalances are urgently required in
many countries to improve confidence and strengthen prospects for sustained
growth over the medium term.'
It remains particularly concerned about conditions in the US. The underlying
US deficit 'remains unsustainably large,' it says. The deficit 'rules out
discretionary fiscal expansion, which under current circumstances would only
put more pressure on interest rates and undermine confidence further'. It
calls for 'a determined new effort to reduce the federal budget deficit in
the US'.
Although there is widespread speculation that the US Federal Reserve could
cut US interest rates again before the presidential election in November,
the IMF warns that such action 'would not now seem necessary'.
Instead, the US authorities should be prepared to let interest rates rise as
the US recovery strengthens, 'to help keep aggregate demand on a sustainable
path'.
The IMF's interest rate advice reflects a very jaundiced view of the way in
which monetary aggregates are working in the three leading economies - those
of the US, Japan and Germany.
Variations in the three nations' yield curves and shifts in investments
between various types of bank deposits mean that the money supply figures
targeted by the authorities are failing to give clear signals.
In what amounts to an appeal to the Bundesbank in Germany to pursue a less
dogmatic approach to monetary policy, the IMF says: 'At this juncture,
monetary aggregates in all three countries do not provide an unambiguous
guide for the conduct of monetary policy; the authorities must therefore
rely on a wider range of indicators.' The IMF would like Germany, as well as
the US, to tackle its fiscal deficits. 'An early reduction of the budget
deficit will be essential to reduce the pressure on inflation and on
interest rates,' it says.
About the only industrialised country to emerge with much credit from the
IMF's report is Japan. The IMF says that country's medium-term outlook
remains strong. In particular, Japan has prepared well for pressure on its
public finances associated with the ageing of its population.
This fiscal policy success should enable the government in Tokyo to focus
more attention on structural reforms in such areas as financial markets,
competition policy, agriculture and land management.

FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Prospects bleak for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN before yesterday's events in Britain, the UK economic outlook was
bleak, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Alone of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Britain faced a
year of declining output in 1992. The World Economic Outlook forecasts a 0.8
per cent drop in real gross domestic product for 1992 - in line with the
latest London consensus forecast - after a 2.2 per cent decline in GDP last
year.
For 1993, the IMF has forecast 2.1 per cent growth for Britain. This is well
below the 2.9 per cent increase forecast for the industrialised countries as
a whole. It also takes no account of the effects of the latest sterling
crisis on business and consumer confidence.
Writing before the big interest rate increases yesterday, the IMF warned
that the UK had 'not yet emerged from recession' and that its short-term
interest rates were 'relatively high in real terms'.
The fund expects UK employment will drop this year by 1.8 per cent, after a
3.1 per cent decline in 1991. Britain's unemployment rate is expected to
rise to 10.1 per cent next year from 10 per cent in 1992 and 9.3 per cent
last year.
About the only encouraging news is the forecast that consumer price
inflation will drop to 3 per cent this year from 3.8 per cent in 1992. But
the IMF warned that earnings increases in Britain continue to outpace
productivity gains.

FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Output fall casts doubt on
momentum of US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve yesterday reported a 0.5 per cent decline in
industrial production last month, raising fresh doubts about the momentum of
the US recovery, Michael Prowse reports from Washington.
The drop in production - the biggest since January - was announced as the
International Monetary Fund forecast a moderate US recovery next year and
urged swingeing cuts in the federal budget deficit.
The IMF predicted growth of 2 per cent this year, rising to 3 per cent next
year. It based its optimism on recent falls in short-term interest rates to
20-year lows and on a strengthening of private sector finances as debts are
repaid and the maturity of loans extended.
However, Mr Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist, said there were few
precedents for the financial strains faced by the US and other countries as
a result of weak asset prices and the debt build-up of the 1980s.
The fund had been surprised by the abnormally slow pace of the recovery:
growth had been 'less than half the pace of the slowest previous recovery'
since World War Two.
Officials said subdued US business and consumer confidence partly reflected
failure to address severe budgetary problems.
The IMF indicated the US should cut the federal deficit by the equivalent of
four to five percentage points of gross domestic product over the next five
years.
This would require a combination of spending cuts, including restraints on
entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions, and tax increases.
Appropriate tax measures could include the introduction of a 5 per cent
value-added tax and a modest levy on carbon emissions. Together, these could
raise revenues equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP by 1997.
The Fed said US production had been affected by Hurricane Andrew, which
accounted for 0.1 per cent of the decline last month, and by a strike at
General Motors, the car company. However, even allowing for special factors,
the report was bleak: nearly every industrial sector registered declines in
output - some were considerable.
Manufacturing production fell 0.3 per cent and the capacity utlisation rate
in industry fell a sharp 0.5 percentage points to 78.5 per cent.
The drop in production follows recent reports of falls in retail sales,
employment, industrial orders and consumer confidence.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Union 'should still be the goal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE should continue to work towards introduction of a single currency
despite the recent turmoil, including sterling's suspension within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism, a leading German banker said last night.
Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank, said there was a need
to continue with establishment of a European monetary policy and a European
central bank.
Referring to sterling's suspension in the ERM, he said on television: 'We've
got to get the ERM back into line. . . to get the constraints back together
and set the parities in relation to respective economic situations (of
European countries).
'That can only mean a stronger D-Mark. . . one can be happy as a private
individual holding D-Marks but it makes life more difficult for industry as
we are an export country.' He said inflation was likely to fall as a result,
enabling the Bundesbank to lower interest rates.
Mr Roller said that the lira devaluation last weekend had not been enough to
get over the crisis within the ERM and the UK had had to 'pull its emergency
parachute' by leaving the ERM temporarily.
But European countries should carry on with plans for monetary union, he
said. Even if the French voted No in Sunday's referendum on the Maastricht
treaty, this would not mean the end of the process of European integration.
The suspension of sterling in the ERM might relieve pressure for action by
the German Bundesbank at its meeting today, according to some bankers.
The Bundesbank's policymaking council will hold its regular fortnightly
meeting, four days after agreeing to trim both its Lombard and discount
rates on Monday.
Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank, said last night: 'I wouldn't
expect too much from the Bundesbank at its meeting.'
Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of BHF-Bank, said the decision of the
UK government to suspend sterling from the ERM was a better solution than
constant intervention, which cost a good deal and achieved nothing in the
end.
However, he could not say whether the Bundesbank would take any action to
cut its interest rates further at today's meeting.
He noted that Monday's interest rate cuts had not been caused by domestic
pressures - the Bundesbank still thinks German inflation is too high and
money supply growth too rapid - but by external market forces and the
resulting need to intervene heavily to support the lira.
In France, Britain's decision on the ERM could provide ammunition for the
country's anti-Maastricht campaign in the final days before the referendum.
Critics of the treaty such as Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist MP who has
led the anti-Maastricht campaign, argue that monetary union could impose
artificial restraints on countries' freedom to conduct monetary and economic
policies.
They could seize on Britain's decision to pull sterling out of the ERM as
evidence that the current European Monetary System needs to be perfected
before closer monetary co-operation can be made to work.

charges

<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Exchange Commission said yesterday it had charged seven
people with insider trading violations in connection with the 1988 takeover
of US food group Pillsbury by Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks
group, agencies report from Washington.
In a civil complaint filed in a Manhattan federal court, the SEC alleged
that the defendants made more than Dollars 750,000 in illegal profits by
trading in Pillsbury stock before Grand Met's Dollars 60-a-share tender
offer was announced.
The SEC is seeking an order requiring the return of those profits, civil
penalties and injunctions against future violations.
According to the SEC's complaint, Mrs Theresa Billings Falbo, then a
secretary to a senior Grand Met executive involved in planning the tender
offer, told her husband Mr Robert Falbo about the deal.
Mr Falbo, who was then an electrician at Grand Met, bought Pillsbury shares
not only for himself but under the names of two other defendants, Mr Lorre
Meade and Mr Antony Capricuso.
The SEC said Mr Falbo or Mr Capricuso, or both, tipped off the three other
defendants, who also traded in Pillsbury securities.
The defendants sold their shares after Grand Met announced its offer on
October 4 1988, the SEC said. On that day, Pillsbury common stock closed at
Dollars 57.50 a share, up from Dollars 39.125 the previous day.
The SEC is continuing its investigation.
Mr Falbo's lawyer had no comment, while Mr Capricuso's lawyer said his
client would vigorously contest the charges.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: Aribert Reimann's 'Das Schloss' - Berlin Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kafka-esque: you don't even need to have read the novels to know what it
means - a nightmare vision of the world in which no-one gets anywhere. That
just about sums up Aribert Reimann's sixth opera, Das Schloss (The Castle),
derived from Kafka's posthumously published novel and the play which Max
Brod made out of it. The work has just been premiered at Berlin's Deutsche
Oper and makes a powerful centrepiece for this year's Berlin Festival.
The festival theme is Prague, Kafka's birthplace, but the topicality of Das
Schloss lies much closer to Berlin. The central figure - known only as K,
the protagonist of several Kafka works - arrives in a wintry, loveless
village with a commission to work as land surveyor at the Castle. His
repeated efforts to gain access to the Castle meet with indifference,
obstruction, betrayal and hostility. The villagers, who have learned to live
with the inescapable, invisible power of the Castle, treat K like an
unwelcome foreigner, and at the final curtain he is as helplessly isolated
as he was at the start.
The parallel with the bureaucracy and xenophobia of contemporary Germany is
inescapable. Neither Reimann nor the producer, Willy Decker, do anything to
point up the analogy: they don't need to. Divided into nine scenes with
interludes of Pelleas-like potency and a single interval, Das Schloss is a
bleak, three-hour, symbolist slog - but it was absorbed with extreme
concentration by a full audience on the night I attended.
Reimann has cut the Brod dramatisation by two-thirds and added some poems
and passages from Kafka's diaries. He should have cut more. As operatic
material, the main weakness is that we know almost from the start that K is
not going to make progress - which automatically reduces the scope for
surprise and tension. Another problem is that Reimann works in solo-speeches
of arduous length, sapping the dramatic punch of several key scenes. Nor do
his cantabile vocal lines offer much differentiation: of the 15 solo parts,
only Frieda, K's sympathetic mistress, has music that conveys a sense of
emotional turmoil.
The score, based on Reimann's adaptation of the 12-tone technique, is spare
and refined, as if the physical battery of sound in Lear has been turned
inwards to produce an atmosphere of abstract psychological oppression.
Reimann composes along the text, weaving and keening the music on a carpet
of subtle string sound and deploying the rest of the orchestra in oblique
compartmentalised blocks.
The quality of craftsmanship and invention is undeniable - above all the
prism-like textures Reimann creates within individual instrumental sections
 -but like the world K inhabits, the musical atmosphere is mysteriously
lacking in variety of pace and colour.
In common with the protagonists of Reimann's Shakespeare, Strindberg and
Euripides operas, K is a lonely figure involved in a struggle. But our
sympathy is compromised by his blind, self-defeating doggedness - as when he
falls asleep during a crucial meeting with an official from the Castle (a
spoken role), in a final scene of Beckett-like absurdity. The part, a long
and arduous one, was created by Wolfgang Schone, an experienced baritone who
knows how to blend lyrical poise and expression.
Of the remaining roles, the most distinctive are the two apprentices (sung
by Bengt-Ola Morgny and Ralf Lukas), a double-act haunting K at every turn
and providing some welcome comedy - not a quality previously associated with
Reimann.
Adrianne Pieczonka was a radiant Frieda, Isolde Elchlepp the neurotic
Hostess and Peter Maus the exploitative Schoolteacher.
Decker's lucid staging, designed by Wolfgang Gussmann, was built around a
black snow-swept bastion, with doors and a staircase opening from the inside
but strangely impenetrable from without. Michael Boder conducted with cool
precision. Further stagings this season in Hanover, Duisburg and Berne may
well reveal a less severe dimension to this worthy, uncontroversial modern
opera.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Germany may offer rate cut deal: Economists call for broader
realignment of European currencies

<TEXT>
SPECULATION grew last night that the Bundesbank was prepared to cut its key
interest rates further as part of a far broader realignment of European
currencies than last weekend's devaluation of the lira.
After a chaotic day on foreign exchange markets, culminating in the
suspension of the pound, economists and traders looked ahead to today's
fortnightly meeting of the German central bank's policymaking council.
'We need a more comprehensive realignment,' said Mr Hermann Remsperger,
chief economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. 'For years, the illusion has been
built up that exchange rates in the European Monetary System could remain
fixed.'
That illusion has been rudely shattered by the events of the last few days.
As sterling came under immense selling pressure yesterday, the Bundesbank's
interest rate cuts announced on Monday -  1/2 point off the discount rate to
8 1/4 per cent and  1/4 point off the Lombard to 9 1/2 per cent - looked too
modest to have any lasting effect, economists said.
'I think the Bundesbank will consider cutting rates further as part of a
broader realignment,' said Mr Richard Reid, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
in Frankfurt.
'The Bundesbank is obviously sticking to its principle that realignments are
still a policy option, since we do not have permanently fixed rates.'
The Bundesbank, still shaken by the effect of reported comments made by Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, its president, that a wider realignment last weekend
would have properly eased EMS tension, made no comment on rumours of further
rate cuts. Today's meeting would take place as normal and there would be no
press conference, it said.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, rejected speculation of
any imminent further realignment, saying he was not aware of any other
European Community government considering such a solution.
Mr Ernst Moritz Lipp, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, said a further EMS
realignment could be expected this week, with a further German rate cut.
Mr Remsperger of BHF-Bank said it might be best if European currencies
simply floated against each other. 'The Maastricht programme has come too
early.'
Speculation continued to rage about the contents of an interview given by Mr
Schlesinger to Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper.
A summary published yesterday, suggesting that he thought a more
comprehensive realignment would have reduced pressures in the market more
successfully, and that further currencies would come under pressure, was
denounced by the bank as 'unauthorised'.
A spokesman said that Mr Schlesinger had neither said it, nor intended to
say it. 'The words were put to him, and he did not answer them.'
In spite of the denial, the substance of the article was assumed to be
accurate by most people in the German markets.
An authorised version will be published today, but any direct quotes
substantiating the contentious extracts will have been edited out.

FT  17 SEP 92 / SIB replies to City critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the city's chief watchdog, yesterday
replied to critics who have accused it of dragging its feet over the
creation of a new regulatory body for retail financial services.
Ms Colette Bowe, director of retail markets at the SIB, said the body had no
power under the rules of the Financial Services Act to force firms into a
new proposed regulatory body to be known as the Private Investment
Authority, even if it wanted to.
Speaking at a Financial Times conference on retail investment regulation, Ms
Bowe defended the SIB's failure to take a hard line with the banks and
building societies whose financial services arms it regulates directly.
Those firms are under pressure from others within in the industry to join
the new body so that competing firms in the same business are regulated by
the PIA.
Ms Bowe also defended the SIB's new proposed disclosure regime for life
insurance products, which has been criticised by consumer groups and the
financial press for going too far to meet the concerns of the life insurance
industry.
She said: 'We believe very strongly in holding a dialogue with the industry
and with consumers as we frame regulation . . . For regulators not to do
this would lead us towards inflexible, onerous and finally unworkable
regulation.'
However, Mr Tom King, general manager of marketing at Standard Life
Assurance, said that in spite of criticisms levelled at the new regime by
consumer groups, it was still detrimental to the life industry.
'I believe that the bases that we now have to use to disclose expenses will
unfairly affect the sales of life policies.
'Many clients will not look past the costs to see the benefits - to their
own detriment,' he said.
Meanwhile, at the same conference, Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive
of Prudential Financial Services, said the life insurance industry would be
reluctant to support the Investors Compensation Scheme to the extent that it
has, unless banks and building societies joined the PIA, too.

LARGE retailers were accused yesterday of charging 'astronomic' rates of

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night issued about a warning about pork products sold in
several supermarket chains and distributed to small shops through a number
of wholesale operations.
It said there were 'indications of pre-formed clostridium botulinum toxin'
in uncured cooked pork products made by Baron Meats of Wisbech,
Cambridgeshire, a subsidiary of Hazlewood Foods.
The health department said it knew of no cases of illness associated with
the products, but advised that they should not be eaten. Hazlewood said it
was trying to establish how the contamination occurred and which shops were
involved.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Wellcome leads lobby over pay
</HEADLINE>

   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of large British companies led by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical
company, is to lobby urgently for changes in legislation on profit-related
pay after a sudden reversal of Inland Revenue practice last month.
In an unexpected statement in July, the Revenue issued a statement of
practice that disqualified from tax relief profit-related pay schemes using
certain formulae that it had previously allowed.
Mr Neville Machin, Wellcome's group employee relations manager, expressed
frustration that the Revenue's plans will bar its scheme, which it has drawn
up after several years' negotiations with the Revenue.
Wellcome had used a formula to calculate its scheme, which was geared to
rewarding improved rather than static performance.
Although tax relief for the current year is not affected, the scheme will in
future be disqualified.
Employees in approved schemes can receive the lower of Pounds 4,000 or 20
per cent of their salary tax-free.
The number of approved schemes more than doubled from 1,277 to 2,597 in the
year to March 1992.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Japan's downturn gathers pace
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Electronics Industry Association said yesterday it was preparing to
apply to the government for subsidies to help the industry through the
'employment adjustment' needed to cope with the recession, which has hit
hard at consumer electronics manufacturers.
The Labour Ministry's central employment security council, an advisory
panel, yesterday disclosed that five other industries had approached the
government over employment subsidies and a further eight were considering
doing so.
A company becomes eligible for the subsidy if its sales, production and
employment fall by more than 5 per cent in three months. Employment
subsidies cost the government Y40bn (Pounds 164.6m) in 1987, which was the
last time they were extensively used as the Japanese economy was hit by a
sharp appreciation of the yen.
While unemployment remains low, 'employment adjustment' refers to the
transfer of surplus workers.
The electronics industry's troubles present one of the clearest signals yet
of how the recession is starting to eat in to Japan's industrial heartlands.
The association's call for employment subsidies followed a warning that
electronics output, one of the mainstays of Japanese manufacturing, could
suffer its sharpest fall since 1975.
The association said it had scrapped its original forecast of growth of
about 5.6 per cent to a fall in the value of production of between 5 per
cent and 8 per cent.
The fall has been led by a sharp drop in the production of consumer
electronics, video cassette recorders, camcorders and audio products, which
are expected to be about 17 per cent below last year's output.
Electronics output in the first half of the year was 10.4 per cent down on
the same period in 1991.
Further grim economic statistics yesterday confirmed the parlous health of
the Japanese economy. Corporate bankruptcies were up 28.9 per cent in August
from a year earlier, according to a report by Teikoku Data Bank, the credit
research company.
Although the number of bankruptcies rose sharply, the debts owed by
companies which went bankrupt fell by 60 per cent from last year, reflecting
the fall in large bankruptcies and the growing number of small companies
falling prey to the recession. Bankruptcies in manufacturing were up by 68
per cent on last year, while real estate bankruptcies rose by 16 per cent. A
growing number of bankruptcies are due to the downturn in the economy rather
than the stock market fall, which had been the main force behind the rise in
corporate failures over the past two years.
Further evidence of the weak state of the manufacturing sector was disclosed
by official figures for orders of new machinery. Private-sector demand for
new machinery rose 12.9 per cent in July against the month before, according
to official figures from the Economic Planning Agency. However, most of the
rise was accounted for by non-manufacturing companies.
Investment in new equipment by manufacturers continues to fall sharply in
many sectors, with machinery orders 26.8 per cent down in the car industry,
13.8 per cent lower in textiles and 5 per cent down in the steel industry .

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Uncertainty for homeowners until after
French vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS will probably have to wait until next week to see if the rise in
official interest rates is translated into costlier mortgages.
Building societies seem to be waiting until after Sunday's French referendum
on Maastricht before deciding. The hope is that the jump to a higher level
will be temporary and that the mortgage rate will not have to follow suit.
Societies are well aware that a rise in rates would further damage the
already feeble housing market and intensify bad debt.
The main reaction from some lenders was to withdraw offers of fixed-rate
mortgages below 10 per cent. Those tend to be funded by borrowing in the
wholesale markets and thus quickly become unprofitable when rates rise.
Savers might benefit from higher interest rates but will have even longer to
wait. Building societies are traditionally slower to raise rates for savers
than for borrowers. Given that societies have been complaining about
pressure on their margins, an increase in savings rates may be limited.
But investors may be able to look forward to increased income from
fixed-rate products such as guaranteed income bonds and annuities. Rates on
such products are determined by gilt yields, which rose yesterday.
Most banks will not decide whether to raise mortgage rates and other
'managed' interest rates for personal customers and small businesses until
financial markets stabilise. NatWest and Barclays may decide in the next two
days, although Lloyds said it would not alter rates until after the French
referendum.
Bank loans linked directly to base rates rose by at least 2 percentage
points yesterday.
The American Life company raised its rate on a one-year Pounds 50,000
guaranteed income bond from 8.5 per cent to 9.3 per cent yesterday. But Mr
Colin Jackson of Baronworth Investment Services said he was advising clients
to sit tight until next week.
Private investors do not seem to have been panicked into selling equity
holdings. Fidelity Stockbrokers said its volumes were up substantially, but
as many small investors were buying as selling. Sharelink also reported a
busy day - with more buying than selling in the afternoon.
Mr James Higgins of financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, said: 'Private
investors can't move fast enough to take advantage of these markets, so they
shouldn't try.
'You should have paid off your overdraft by now, but cut down on credit card
and other borrowings.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Small businesses brace for impact of
'horrific' rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS TUBBS, managing director of Tubbs Elastics, a family business with
turnover of nearly Pounds 8m and 200 employees, reacted swiftly to the
two-stage increase in interest rates.
He postponed the purchase of three new directors' cars, put off upgrading of
the company's computer system and cancelled a photocopier machine contract.
A more expensive project to refurbish a factory will go ahead, since that is
a longer-term commitment.
Mr Tubbs may have reacted more rapidly than most small companies, but his
concern at what proved to be a shortlived rise to 15 per cent was not
untypical.
Mr David Richardson, a Leeds partner of chartered surveyors Weatherall,
Green &amp; Smith, said: 'I don't want to speak of shock and horror . . .but a
hike of 50 per cent in interest charges is horrific. Businesses cannot
sustain interest rates at that level given present rates of economic
activity.'
Small businesses are more sensitive to interest-rate movements because they
depend to a greater extent than large companies on borrowed funds. They are
often less sophisticated in financial management techniques and lack
negotiating muscle.
The banks calculate that only half their small business customers have
borrowings at any one time, but tend to use variable rate loans and are
often reluctant to take out fixed-interest term borrowings. The Forum of
Private Business calculates that 37 per cent of its members have
fixed-interest loans. Small businesses are also very dependent on short-term
overdraft finance.
The Federation of Small Businesses calculated that if yesterday's 5
percentage point increase in official interest rates fed through into base
rates it would add Pounds 1bn a year to small businesses' interest charges.
Mr Stephen Alambritis, federation spokesman, said: 'Our members are stunned.
We had been expecting a cut in interest rates.'
With Quarter Day - when companies pay their bank charges - less than two
weeks away on September 29, business owners do not have to wait long to see
the impact of interest-rate increases.
But higher bank charges are only the most immediate result of the increase.
Mr Stuart White, enterprise director of Midland Bank, said it could be
expected to have a knock-on effect on the payments behaviour of businesses
of all sizes, with the result that bills would be paid even more tardily.
The optimistic view was that this was a short-term measure that could be
relaxed if the French voted 'Yes'. Mr Richard Brown, policy director of
British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'I can understand the despair among
small businesses but they should not panic and lay staff off or close down
operations.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Hopes pinned on early reduction -
Property Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL property experts said yesterday it was too soon to judge the
effect on the market of the sudden interest-rate rise but suggested there
would be little damage in the short term.
Mr Gerald Blundell, head of investment strategy at Jones Lang Wootton, the
chartered surveyors, said: 'This is more to do with 24-hour money than
24-year property cycles. There will be no immediate impact.'
Mr Rod Grant, managing partner of surveyors Hillier Parker, said: 'We can't
class this as good news. We are not panic-stricken because we saw it coming,
but it is still a bit of a jolt.'
Mr Blundell said that if the French approved the Maastricht treaty on Sunday
there would be 'a quite rapid reduction' in UK rates. If they voted No there
would be continuing volatility, which might lead to money being shifted to
the US and harm corporate confidence in the UK, damaging lettings and
yields.
He said many property companies were locked into fixed interest rates, so
the base rate changes would not affect their gearing - the ratio of debt to
shares - in the short term.
If sterling was devalued, giving rise to inflation, property would become
more attractive as a hedge for investors.
Mr Nicholas Ritblat, chairman and managing director of British Land, said:
'I cannot see that a 15 per cent real interest rate is seriously tenable.'
He emphasised that his company would not be seriously exposed to the effects
in the short term because it was hedged against interest-rate fluctuations.
The increase might threaten commercial lettings in the longer term, however.
Mr Grant said the rate increase would have little immediate impact on
property values, which were already 'bumping along the bottom'.
But he said it would certainly influence the speed of recovery and the
general level of business confidence. 'There is a danger of a protracted
fight over the economy,' he said. 'It would be nice to have heard better
news.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Barometer for an industry takes an
abrupt tumble - TV Advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY hopes of sustaining the modest recovery in television net advertising
revenue seen in the first half of this year were dashed by yesterday's
interest rate rise.
TV advertising is regarded as a barometer for advertising as a whole. Where
it leads, press, poster and other advertising tend to follow.
After a dismal performance in 1990, TV advertising revenues picked up in the
second half of last year - growing by 6.4 per cent in real terms - and that
recovery extended into the first half of this year.
But growth in the first half slowed to a real 3.4 per cent, according to the
Advertising Association. This year's hopes of sustained recovery of the
order of 2 per cent above inflation now look very optimistic.
Analysts said this year's TV advertising revenue increase had been
narrow-based and tactical, particularly in the retail, motor, travel and
airline sectors. Such advertising - focusing on price reductions and special
offers - gave an artificial boost to the first half.
The net effect of yesterday's rate rises will be to prolong that type of
advertising but further deter the higher-spending, brand-name advertisers in
the consumer goods sector from any significant return to television.

THE EC monetary committee, which was summoned to a crisis meeting in
Brussels last night after sterling's suspension in the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, is a highly secretive body.
Senior European Commission and national officials in Brussels at first even
refused to confirm that the meeting would take place, let alone where. The
meeting began at the Borschette conference centre towards midnight, with
some officials indicating it could continue well into the morning.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, called the meeting in
his capacity as current president of the EC finance ministers' council.
The monetary committee groups senior EC treasury and central bank officials,
as well as their European Commission counterparts. It is chaired at present
by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the French treasury director. Britain is
represented by Sir Nigel Wicks, second permanent secretary at the treasury
with responsibility for international monetary affairs.
The 26-strong committee lies at the heart of EC economic and monetary
policy. In effect, it manages the ERM. It was the monetary committee that
issued the communique last weekend on the devaluation of the lira and the
cut in German interest rates.
The committee also has a strong interest in the intricacies of the
Maastricht Treaty on European union.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE quintessentially British Noel Coward once wrote a celebrated satirical
song, Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans.
Published in the second world war, his sense of humour was, for once, judged
a joke too far by the Blitzkrieged British public.
In thoroughly different circumstances just two years ago, comments by Mr
Nicholas (now Lord) Ridley, a cabinet minister, that Germany was 'already
running most of the Community' were deemed too intemperate to allow him to
stay in the government.
Today, however, beleaguered Britain appears to have lost its inhibitions and
declared an open season of vituperation on the awesome might of Teuton power
 -mainly on that of the boys from the Bundesbank.
Yesterday, Downing street officials refused through clenched teeth to make
critical comments on Germany's role in the sterling crisis. The Treasury
also followed Frankfurt's lead by insisting that newspaper reports saying Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, was again hinting at the need for
a further ERM realignment were a misinterpretation.
But there is no doubt that several senior British government officials,
ministers, and MPs would have little argument with the headline in one
mid-market tabloid newspaper yesterday morning: 'Sabotage by the Germans.'
The view, as one Tory MP put it, that 'we are paying for East German
reconstruction and the industrial expansion of Germany into Eastern Europe'
also has widespread resonance nightly in public houses across Britain.
In the last three weeks, comments by Bundesbank officials have appeared to
have come close to direct political interference in the UK economy.
On August 26 Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's policymaking
council, sent tremors through the markets by suggesting that an ERM shake-up
could be in the offing.
Evidence that his words had niggled came 10 days ago when Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor of the exchequer, seemed almost triumphalist in his
summing-up of the Bath EC finance minister's meeting which arm-twisted the
Bundesbank into ruling out higher German interest rates. But far from
concluding the matter, continuing leaks from Bonn and Frankfurt continued to
undermine London's attempts to convey a rosy scenario for interest rates and
the pound.
Reports citing senior German figures as saying they had offered to cut rates
substantially for a general ERM realignment was quoted by the markets as an
important influence in the crash in confidence in the pound. Denials by the
UK government and the Bundesbank that any such offer had been made were
deemed less credible than the original story, a City forex dealer said.
Arguably, of course, Britain's dire economic outlook could be blamed, in
part, on the traditional enemy - France. If President Mitterrand had not
chosen to try to bolster his ailing Socialist party by calling Sunday's
plebiscite, it is widely believed, the markets would be in a much more
tranquil mood.
Yet to many Britons, the current perception is that Germany has laid out a
metaphorical beach towel which is engulfing the City of London and
Whitehall.

FT  17 SEP 92 / EC officials hold emergency talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance officials were locked in emergency talks in
Brussels early today following the suspension yesterday of sterling's
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
The UK government's move to withdraw sterling 'temporarily' from the ERM
followed the largest assault by currency speculators on the exchange rate
system since its formation in 1979.
Sterling fell sharply against all leading currencies. In New York, it lost 5
per cent against the dollar from Tuesday's London close, and fell to
DM2.6951, against its former ERM floor of DM2.7780. Very slow dealings early
in Tokyo, as traders awaited the outcome of the Brussels meeting, saw the
pound at DM2.6850.
On the agenda at the Brussels meeting of the EC's monetary committee was
expected to be the temporary withdrawal from the mechanism of its other
weaker currencies - the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and perhaps the
Portuguese escudo - all of which were said by foreign exchange dealers
overnight to be trading below their ERM floor levels.
The move followed a day of deep confusion on European foreign exchanges,
which ended with the UK government rescinding the second of two interest
rate rises announced during the day.
The confusion came after foreign exchange traders in Europe seized on the
uncertainty surrounding next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht
treaty to increase speculation about an imminent realignment of currencies
within the exchange rate mechanism.
The meeting of the EC monetary committee - which has powers to decide on
currency realignments - had been called following intense talks among senior
economic policy makers in European capitals after the failure of central
banks' intervention to support the weaker EMS currencies.
Rises at one stage totalling 5 percentage points in UK interest rates and
huge purchases of sterling by the Bank of England failed to lift the pound
above its permitted ERM floor against the D-Mark.
Heavy intervention elsewhere in Europe also failed to alleviate renewed
pressure on the Italian lira - which had been devalued by 7 per cent at the
weekend - and on the Spanish peseta.
In London, overnight money market rates spiked to 100 per cent, while the
one-month rate neared 30 per cent. Stocks, however, rallied on hopes of an
imminent devaluation of sterling and prospects for German interest rate
cuts.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Industry's leaders react with dismay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING UK industrialists reacted with dismay yesterday to the rise in
interest rates before the announcement last night that the second increase
would not take place.
They also expressed fears that this would deal a further blow to consumer
demand and deepen the recession.
Most reluctantly accepted, however, that the government had little choice
but to act as it did and supported its efforts to defend sterling's parity
within the European exchange rate mechanism.
'We need 15 per cent interest rates like we need a hole in the head,' said
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry. 'But
if it is a choice between that and devaluation, then I suppose it will have
to be.'
Nonetheless, some businessmen feared the pressure on sterling could make
devaluation inevitable. A minority, led by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR,
the industrial conglomerate, argued that sterling should be taken out of the
ERM entirely.
'These are war conditions. We have to know what we are fighting for. Is it a
British pound or a D-Mark pound?' Sir Owen said. 'If we start to devalue,
all the precedents say we don't know what the rate should be. If we float,
we know what the real value is for the British pound and call up the
troops.'
For most businesses, however, the most pressing concern was the outlook for
demand. Some industry spokesmen argued that, almost regardless of what
happened next, yesterday's events had inflicted a devastating blow to
consumer demand.
'People will no longer be buying as of now. They will be stopped in their
tracks,' said Mr Neil Marshall, economist at the Retail Motor Industry
Federation. He warned of another round of business bankruptcies.
Others said much depended on how long interest rates remained at crisis
levels, and whether they passed through to mortgage rates. Several believed
that it would be politically and economically impossible for the government
to hold current interest rates for more than a few weeks.
Several companies yesterday called on the government to take steps to revive
the economy.

<TEXT>
THIS week's cut in German interest rates was insufficient, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, said yesterday in a rare outspoken
criticism of another country's economic policy.
Mr Miyazawa, speaking before the sharp rise in British rates, said the
half-point cut in the German discount rate to 8.25 per cent would not be
large enough to provide currency markets with long-term stability given the
strength of the D-Mark.
He made his comments amid a welter of grim reports on the gathering downturn
in the Japanese economy. Mr Miyazawa said Japan was unlikely to face
pressure at this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers
to follow the German cut.
His remarks put him at odds with Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of
Japan, who yesterday welcomed the German move as a step towards calming
international currency markets.
But Mr Mieno signalled opposition to a further cut in Japanese interest
rates, which were lowered by half a point to 3.25 per cent in July.
Mr Mieno said he wanted the yen to remain strong to help slow the rapid
growth in Japan's trade surplus.
The increase in British interest rates is likely to fuel concern in Tokyo
that the turmoil in European currency markets will eventually spill over
into Japan.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Spain hopes peseta will hold up
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN was fighting late last night to keep the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism alive and sharply criticised Britain's decision to suspend its
membership of the ERM.
'It is important to preserve the system and suspension of membership is a
bad decision,' a senior official at the economy ministry said. Nevertheless,
he was sympathetic to British charges that the German Bundesbank had been
less than helpful to sterling.
Spanish officials went into the late-night meeting of the EC monetary
committee in Brussels with a brief to persuade their partners that a
realignment within the system was by far the best option. The economics
ministry official said this option implied effective devaluation of certain
currencies within the ERM. This was favoured by both France and Germany.
Spain was still determined last night that the peseta could not be
justifiably grouped with sterling and the lira as a problem currency. The
official insisted that the peseta had fared far better than sterling and the
lira during yesterday's market turbulence. .
'By midday yesterday we ceased intervening and let the peseta find its own
market position within the mechanism and the peseta closed at Pta67.5 to the
DM, short of its 69.1 floor,' the official said. 'We were not tempted to
raise interest rates and at all times the peseta was within its band.'
The official said that the market's confidence in the peseta was
demonstrated yesterday by 'significant' orders to buy Spanish public debt.
Speaking in Berlin where he was attending a meeting of the Socialist
International, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, said the peseta was
resisting the crisis 'fairly well' and that despite the 'turbulence in the
markets' there was still 'a relative confidence in Spain'.
But he said the government was prepared to take 'whatever measures have to
be taken'.
Dealers estimate that on Tuesday the monetary authorities spent up to
Dollars 2bn to hold the peseta at Pta65.15 against the DM and that at least
as much had been spent last week.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Swedish marginal lending rate hits
500%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIKSBANK, Sweden's central bank, raised its marginal lending rate to a
staggering 500 per cent yesterday, the highest level ever, in an effort to
crush rumours of a devaluation in the Swedish krona and reverse the huge
outflow of capital seen earlier this week.
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister who heads a minority centre-right
government, summoned leaders of all the main political parties to a meeting
yesterday evening in an attempt to win support for proposed cuts in
government spending and restore some calm to the markets.
The government said it was supporting the Riksbank's measures to defend the
krona, (which is linked to the Ecu), and said a devaluation of the currency
was out of the question, given Sweden's commitment to a fixed exchange rate.
Following Britain's decision last night to suspend sterling's membership of
the Exchange Rate Mechanism, economists in Sweden warned that the krona
would probably continue to come under pressure today.
Dealers estimated that 'tens of billions of kronor' flooded out of Sweden on
Tuesday and yesterday morning.
At 8.30am, the Riksbank raised its marginal rate from 20 per cent to 75 per
cent, but this was insufficient to reverse the outflow and it was forced to
raise the rate again at 3.30pm, to 500 per cent.
Mr Bengt Dennis, Riksbank governor, said the move had the desired effect of
drawing back capital in the last half-hour of trading.
He said that the marginal rate would remain at a high level for 'days rather
than weeks' in order to support the krona.
The Riksbank's marginal rate applies to only the top tranche of the banking
system's borrowings from the central bank. The marginal rate of 500 per cent
affects just the top SKr2.2bn (Pounds 214m) slice of total bank borrowings,
which currently amount to SKr68.2bn.
As a result, the average borrowing cost for the Swedish banking system has
risen to 38 per cent, compared with about 24 per cent when the marginal rate
was 75 per cent last Wednesday.
Swedish interest rates have see-sawed over the last week. as domestic
political worries coincided with turmoil in the international markets. The
Riksbank raised its marginal interest rate to 75 per cent from 24 per cent
on September 9 in order to defend the krona after Finland's decision to stop
linking the markka to the Ecu. Sweden lowered the rate on Monday to 20 per
cent, after the Bundesbank's decision to cut German interest rates.
Swedish short-term interest rates shot up yesterday, with the yield on
three-month treasury bills closing at 35 per cent, compared with 25 per cent
at the previous day's close.
Yields on six-month bills climbed from 22 per cent to 30 per cent.
Longer-dated government paper underwent a slight fall in yields with
five-year bonds ending at 12.30 per cent, compared with 12.58 per cent the
previous day.
Mortgage rates have risen in response, putting pressure on some households,
although many homeowners in Sweden have fixed-rate mortgages.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sterling suspension severe blow to
ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE suspension of sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism has
dealt a severe blow to the credibility of the currency system which may
prove impossible to rebuild, foreign exchange dealers and market analysts
said last night.
It has also called into question the Maastricht treaty on European union, by
raising important doubts about the feasibility of an important element of
that agreement: monetary union.
A referendum is being held in France over Maastricht on Sunday, but some
analysts felt the vote had lost most of its relevance.
'This is a first, very large, nail in the ERM coffin,' said Mr Richard
Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney in London. 'What's more, one of the major
pillars on which Maastricht was built has been knocked away.'
According to Mr James Barty, senior UK analyst at Morgan Grenfell,
'Maastricht is a lot less likely to be ratified than it was even last
Monday, even if the French say Yes.'
Speaking before last night's meeting of EC monetary officials in Brussels,
they reckoned it would be difficult for the other weak currencies within the
ERM to hold out against a likely further speculative onslaught by currency
dealers.
Suspension of the membership of the lira, peseta and escudo was thus
considered likely.
Any attempt by sterling to re-enter the mechanism quickly might also prove
short-lived, since dealers would recognise that the Bank of England's
ammunition against further speculation has been depleted by a sharp drop in
reserves this week.
The British government had also suffered a sharp loss of credibility in the
financial markets and its position politically had been weakened
considerably - given Prime Minister John Major's description of devaluation
last week as a 'betrayal'.
Whatever the short-term developments, the ERM was seen as reverting
longer-term to a two-tier system with a group of stronger currencies
clustered around the D-Mark and others floating more freely.
The last major realignment of the ERM was in January 1987.
Sterling - along with the D-Mark one of the top five traded currencies which
makes it more difficult and expensive to beat speculators - did not join the
mechanism until October 1990.
Some analysts pointed out that the nature of the mechanism had changed since
1979 from one where periodic adjustments of currency parities were expected,
towards an almost fixed-rate system.
This was a development of which the Bundesbank was known to disapprove.
'Any mechanism such as this which attempts to fix exchange rates has a
limited life cycle,' said Mr Jeffrey.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Europe's governments resort to hard
sell - A tide of advertisements and publicity campaigns is sweeping the
continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, ALICE RAWSTHORN and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN governments are turning to public relations managers to sell
European union, a concept which once seldom needed marketing.
The continent-wide tide of advertisements, brochures and publicity campaigns
to increase the popularity of the Maastricht treaty seems, in many cases, to
be inspired less by idealism than by desperation.
The EC's regular Eurobarometer opinion surveys show majorities in favour of
the treaty in most countries. Yet among the 12 EC members, as well as in the
Nordic and Alpine states hoping to join the community later in the decade,
individual voters are becoming increasingly sceptical about whether the
treaty is good for them.
Governments are fighting a psychological battle, says Mr Svend Auken, a
pro-Maastricht Danish deputy who up until spring was leader of the Social
Democratic party. He was shocked to see 60 per cent of his party's members
voting against the treaty in the country's referendum in June.
'The rhetoric of Europe no longer sells. Three years ago Europe had a good
ring to it. It represented prosperity, the fall of the Berlin Wall. But in
1992 it spells Yugoslavia, racial turmoil in Germany and a Eurospeak further
and further away from everyday realities.'
According to Mr Philip Huckin, group account director at CME-KHBB, the
London-based advertising agency which has just established a European branch
network: 'One of the problems about the EC and Maastricht is that there is a
lot of ignorance.'
He says advertising can be a useful tool to enable people to make more sound
judgments, but adds that campaigns need to be conducted 'sensitively' to
avoid sparking anger among voters who believe taxpayers' money should be put
to more constructive purposes.
This is a particular problem for Britain, whose electorate has traditionally
been more sceptical about European integration than elsewhere in the
community. Assuming France votes Yes on Sunday, the UK Foreign Office is
pondering whether to step up promotional efforts in favour of Maastricht to
accompany planned parliamentary ratification later this year.
Negative feelings about Maastricht have been clearly evident during the
run-up to the French referendum. The French government drafted in Mr Jacques
Seguela, a prominent French advertising executive who is a close confidant
of President Francois Mitterrand, to orchestrate the Yes drive.
He devised a series of media advertisements focusing on the slogan 'L'Europe
est adulte. Donnons-lui sa majorite' (Europe has grown up. Let's give it a
majority). The government set aside FFr25m (Pounds 2.6m) to spend - but then
had to scrap plans for radio and TV campaigns after complaints from
broadcasting author-ities.
Press and poster advertisements went ahead as planned. But, in its attempt
to draw on extra media glamour, the French government has had to rely on
support from a group of 300 celebrities - academics, actors, pop stars and
industrialists - as well as on a big pre-poll pop concert.
The German government, preparing to push Maastricht ratification through
parliament from October, will launch its own pro-treaty campaign next month.
Large advertisements will be carried in the German press on October 1 and 8,
with special promotional 'packages' prepared for radio stations. The Bonn
press and information office, which is spending DM22.5m (Pounds 8m) on
Euro-promotion this year, is also sending a 272-page brochure on European
integration to 120,000 German executives and managers.
In view of growing popular opposition to abandoning the D-Mark, Bonn's
campaign will have to tread particularly warily over the issue of economic
and monetary union (Emu). An earlier advertising series aimed at increasing
Emu's popularity ran into difficulties when a leading Bundesbank official
complained that the campaign distorted the central bank's statements on the
issue.
If promoting co-operation within the EC is a struggle, the task is even
greater for governments on the outside. The Swiss government is facing
problems in developing an effective information policy on the question of
Switzerland's entry into the European Economic Area (EEA) next year and its
application to join the community by 1995.
Both decisions will be subjected to referendums - and the campaign promises
to be robust. Mr Jakob Kellenberger, state secretary for foreign affairs who
has the job of negotiating Swiss adhesion to the community, admits that many
Swiss view the EC with hostility.
The Berne government has decided on a SFr5.9m (Pounds 2.4m) EC information
campaign which, although modest, is more aggressive than anything previously
attempted.
The brochures produced by the campaign team carry phrases such as: 'The EEA:
a practical guide', or 'Being Swiss in Europe: Yesterday, today and
tomorrow'.
Throughout Europe, not just in Switzerland, governments trying to push their
voters down the trail of integration are emphasising practicality rather
than vision.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italians trace problems back to
budget deficit - A constantly shifting figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the lira collapsing and Italian equities in apparent free fall, the
focus has again shifted to the country's main source of its problems - the
budget deficit.
Understanding the deficit is like taking a bubble bath in numbers; there are
lots of them and they keep moving. The size of the figures stem from the low
unit value of the lira and the magnitude of the state debt. Their constant
changes derive from uncertainty even among experts as to how much Italy owes
and the dynamics of shifting interest rates and inflation.
Rising prices after Sunday's devaluation are one of the reasons why even the
latest set of forecasts, prepared each July by Italy's three economics
ministries, are already in doubt. The cut in the lira's value will add about
half a percentage point to this year's price rises, according to the
Confindustria employers' federation.
Until last year Italy had been making some progress on controlling its
vertiginous debt. In 1990 the so-called 'primary deficit' - spending net of
interest payments on the debt - was set to become positive, meaning
government receipts would exceed spending, excluding the huge cost of debt
servicing.
Expectations of a positive primary deficit have now been postponed to next
year, according to Mr Giuliano Amato, prime minister. The blame lies largely
with deteriorating state finances in 1991, which may mark a nadir in
political responsibility for managing the debt.
The prospect of elections made ministers reluctant to take unpopular moves
in the closing months of Mr Giulio Andreotti's government, even though it
was apparent that assumptions of a lower deficit, made when the 1991 budget
was presented in September 1990, were no longer valid.
As a result last year's deficit amounted to 10.7 per cent of GDP, while the
total debt reached 104 per cent of GDP.
Failing remedial action, this year's figure would have reached at least
L180,000bn (Pounds 81bn), equivalent to 11.8 per cent of GDP, while the
total debt would have hit 108 per cent of GDP, according to the new
government.
That was way above both the Andreotti government's original L127,800bn
target and the revised L160,000bn released in March. If allowed to run
unchecked the deficit would have reached more than 18 per cent of GDP in
1995, when the total debt would hit almost 141 per cent of GDP.
'Even the L180,000bn may no longer be valid,' warns the chief economist at
one of Italy's biggest banks. 'It's difficult to say how much it has drifted
but, 10 weeks from publication of the government's forecasts, we guess the
figure is nearer L190,000bn owing to recent rises in interest rates and
worsening economic conditions, which have lowered tax receipts.'
Mr Amato's first step on coming to office was a L30,000bn emergency budget
for 1992, bringing down this year's deficit to L150,000bn, or 9.9 per cent
of GDP. But it is his next move which is most important.
The 1993 budget, to be unveiled shortly, requires swingeing spending cuts
and new revenue raising measures. While economists predicted the total
package would be worth L83,000bn last month, the rise in interest rates and
economic slowdown has led to forecasts of at least L100,000bn now.
The increase in the expected size of next year's measures also stems from
doubts about the efficacy of the emergency budget and the assumptions on
which future years' forecasts have been based.
The emergency budget comprises extra revenue and lower spending. About
L16,500bn will come from increased charges for services like driving
licences and other permits.
But economists are doubtful about both the remaining components.
The government expects L7,000bn from privatisation, but with only four
months left to run this year it is hard to see the full amount arriving by
end-December. Bankers also doubt the government will make L7,000bn in
spending cuts in view of rising political opposition within the coalition.
'We reckon of the L30,000bn total, only L20,000bn is certain. So our
forecast for this year's deficit is L160,000bn, or around 10.5 per cent of
GDP,' says one economist.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italy suffers further run on the
lira
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIMITED breathing space afforded the Italian government by Monday's 7
per cent devaluation was wiped out yesterday by a sustained wave of
speculation against the lira, forcing the currency below its D-Mark floor.
The plight of the lira in another chaotic day on the European currency
markets - combined with a 5 per cent slide on the Milan bourse and a jump in
overnight money rates to 50 per cent - led to rumours the currency would be
allowed to float.
Ahead of the suspension of sterling in the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the
meeting last night of the European monetary committee, the Bank of Italy
denied the rumours. But an Italian treasury official said later, according
to the AP-DJ news agency, that the most likely scenario to emerge from the
committee's meeting would be a three-day suspension of the lira from the
ERM.
It was uncertain whether this referred to three working days, including
Monday, or whether the lira would re-enter the ERM when markets opened on
Monday.
The Italian official, who declined to be identified, said that sterling
would be suspended from the ERM for an indefinite period.
Italian ministers held a four-hour crisis meeting, lasting until early
today, to prepare for a full-scale cabinet session this morning which is due
to announce some emergency measures tackling spending, along with an advance
of the 1993 budget.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, and Mr Lamberto
Dini, managing director, were also brought in to join talks with Mr Giuliano
Amato, the prime minister, and economic ministers.
At one level, the meeting was intended to demonstrate that the cabinet and
the Bank of Italy were co-ordinating closely after suggestions that Mr
Ciampi was unhappy with the government's handling of Sunday's devaluation.
Earlier in the day Mr Amato went before the Chamber of Deputies to defend
his controversial decision last Wednesday to seek emergency powers to handle
the economy. He insisted such powers were necessary for the executive to
react in real time to a fast-moving crisis. However, he said he was willing
to negotiate the terms on which such powers were granted by parliament.
The lira's slide from its central position in the European Monetary System
realignment agreed over the weekend of L810 against the D-Mark to L828 in
late trading came despite heavy intervention by the Bank of Italy and the
Bundesbank.
The lira also fell sharply against the dollar and yesterday at L1,219 was
almost 12 per cent below its Friday fixing.
One banker said the lira's fall contained elements of market hysteria, apart
from the lure of speculative gains; but the pressure was also based on
assessments that the 7 per cent devaluation had been insufficient. Hopes
among Italian officials that the troubles of sterling would distract
attention proved groundless.
The one positive development yesterday was the approval by the Senate of a
special decree granting the government authority to carry out reforms of
pensions, health, regional administration and the civil service, the main
causes for overspending in the public sector. The decree looks set to be
endorsed by the Chamber of Deputies and this will enable the government to
prepare in detail the 1993 budget.
The reforms are expected to provide savings of L23,000bn (Pounds 10.8bn)
next year and L35,000bn in 1994.
The reforms will reduce state pensions and raise the pensionable age in
stages from 55 years for women and 60 for men to 65 for both through a
system of incentives.

FT  17 SEP 92 / A turbulent day in Whitehall: How ministers tackled a crisis
that threatened to spiral out of control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY which ended with sterling on the edge of a precipice and the
government's economic strategy in tatters was full of frantic comings and
goings in Whitehall and elsewhere.
It set the telephone lines humming between Westminster, Frankfurt and Paris
as the crisis threatened to spiral out of control.
Its last rites were performed amid gathering gloom at 7.36pm when chancellor
Norman Lamont emerged into the Treasury's circular courtyard, folded his
hands behind his back and announced tersely that Britain had decided to
suspend its membership of the exchange rate mechanism.
'Today has been an extremely turbulent and difficult day,' he said flanked
by advisers. For once, nobody in the assembled scrum of reporters and
cameramen was in a mood to contradict him.
The morning had begun early with a conversation between prime minister John
Major and his chancellor to discuss the mounting pressure on sterling.
This ended in time for Mr Major to attend a 9 o'clock meeting with a group
of senior ministers comprising Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip. The subject matter was
nominally Maastricht.
This inner circle would meet repeatedly during the course of the day as the
crisis grew.
At about 10.30am, with the pound wilting, Mr Major telephoned Mr Lamont  -
who was accompanied virtually throughout the day by Mr Robin Leigh
Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England - and agreed to a 2
percentage-point increase in base rates to 12 per cent.
This was announced over the newswires shortly after 11am.
The gathering broke up at about 11.30am. At each crucial juncture as the day
progressed, Mr Major made a point of consulting these senior colleagues,
thereby invoking the principal of collective responsibility.
An hour later - with the first interest rate hike having failed to bolster
sterling and huge sums still being expended to prop it up - the group of
ministers met again and consented to a further interest-rate rise to 15 per
cent.
As the afternoon proceeded, Mr Major spoke both to Mr Helmut Kohl, the
German chancellor, and twice to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime
minister.
At 5pm, with the pound still oscillating weakly around its ERM floor level,
the group met for a final time, with Mr Lamont and Mr Leigh Pemberton also
present.
It was at this gathering that ministers decided to bite the bullet and
suspend ERM membership. It was also agreed to dispatch Sir Nigel Wicks,
second permanent secretary of the Treasury, to Brussels.
At 6.23pm the delivery of a scarlet dispatch box told reporters outside the
black gates of Admiralty House that an important announcement was imminent.
At 7pm the word went out that a statement was expected at the Treasury. It
was about half an hour later that Mr Lamont made his hastily-arranged
entrance into the building's tranquil courtyard.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Racal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A visitor from Mars might wonder what was the point of the Racal/Chubb
demerger. Given that Racal expects both the separated companies to trade on
a similar rating, the deal will not unleash the value of a wildly
undervalued asset. Indeed, the inevitable duplication of some head office
functions means that separation may not release any value at all. It may
have been that when the plan was originally hatched Chubb's assets were
undervalued, but Racal shares have risen since then, reflecting better
management of Chubb and the prospects for Racal's recovery. The deal, and
its associated costs, is in the price.
But since the company is set on its course, investors must assess the
companies separately. Both have managed improvements in cash flow through
control of working capital, but there are worries about how hard Racal can
squeeze, and the stronger company is clearly Chubb. In the longer term,
Racal Electronics' dependence on defence and low-margin communications
business is also likely to depress its rating. Chubb may no longer be the
target for cheap acquisition specialists that it was, but it is still
attractive. Investors must be tempted to take the Chubb share and run.

Hard as the blow finally fell, the stock market was at least partly braced
for a sudden interest rate rise. Those investors who were betting that the
move hastened a sterling devaluation - and who were tentatively buying
building stocks yesterday on the back of it - might ponder the dazed state
of most homeowners and prospective housebuyers as they digested the news
last night. Confidence in the housing market was already fragile. Unless
interest policy is wholly reversed, housing transactions in the next six
months could completely dry up.
If the blow to confidence has made the short-term outlook even bleaker than
before, there can be no guarantee that a different exchange rate policy
would offer sure relief in the medium term. There remains a structural
problem in the property market. On the demand side, individuals and
companies are weighed down by debts accumulated in the heady days of asset
inflation in the late 1980s. On the supply side, house repossessions may be
flattening out, but the number of building society customers in arrears of
more than six and 12 months has been rising ominously.
Much the same sort of shadow overhangs the commercial property market, where
hopes are no doubt pinned on a resurgence of inflation. Property was much in
vogue as a hedge in the second half of the 1970s, but it is worth
remembering that in those days UK investors were shackled by exchange
controls and there was nowhere else to go.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the long months of struggle to maintain sterling's parity within the ERM,
it has become fashionable to see fixed rate bonds as a more attractive
investment than equities. The chancellor's decision to suspend ERM
membership means that question must now be re-addressed. Whatever
arrangements are finally made for sterling in its relationship with other
European currencies, the credibility of a policy designed to eradicate
inflation has been undermined. Had the government chosen a lower central
rate, or else to follow the Bundesbank in raising interest rates last
December, its ERM adventure might not have come to quite such a sticky end.
As it is, yesterday's 2 point rise in base rates was too late to establish
credibility. Not only is the policy now revealed as questionable; its
implementation was also cack-handed.
This is not to say, however, that inflation will immediately return with a
vengeance. Demand is so subdued and consumers have been so badly burned by
the great deflation that it is hard to see price pressures reasserting
themselves very quickly. Besides, much depends on how long base rates are
held at 12 per cent. To be sure, sterling is already some 10 per cent below
its peak against the dollar. There should be some economic stimulus from
that. But it will take much lower interest rates to restore confidence to
the housing market.
The equity market was thus right to dismiss yesterday's attempt to raise
base rates to 15 per cent as untenable unless the government was determined
to engineer a slump. Maybe the market is now at the turning point. In that
case investors must also address relative values, a process which will
favour cyclical stocks rather than defensive ones like utilities and
pharmaceuticals. Still, caution is called for. The ingredients for growth
are not yet in place and it is not clear how policy will settle down. The
government may hope to salvage some anti-inflation credibility by climbing
back aboard a reconstituted - though certainly weaker - ERM. Another
interest cut by Germany would help. But before Sunday's Maastricht vote in
France, there is no telling whether re-entry will be possible, or at what
exchange or interest rate.
What is clear is that there is little point in floating freely outside the
ERM and in keeping interest rates high in an attempt to track the system.
Sweden has shown the cost of life in the twilight zone. If there is any
logic in floating free, it must be to set interest rates at a level that
reflects the state of the economy and allows the exchange rate to find its
own, much lower level. Were that the government's ultimate plan, equities
would be an outstanding buy.
By the end of next year, however, inflation could then be more like 5 per
cent than 2. The gilts market could not ignore that, even though there are
some consoling factors. The premium over German government bonds has already
moved out to 200 basis points compared with around 120 after the election.
Yesterday's heavy intervention will reduce immediate funding needs. If
sterling were allowed to stabilise at a significantly lower level, foreign
buyers might not demand a much greater increase in the premium over German
paper. Even a large PSBR could then be quite easily funded.
That said, it is now no longer plausible to expect gilt yields to converge
with those in Germany. The attractions that seemed so real in April have
grown elusive. Equities have not quite regained their former glory, but
watch this space.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Mitterrand to work on despite cancer
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH president Francois Mitterrand is suffering from prostate cancer. His
doctors said yesterday it was not dangerous, but the announcement sparked
fresh speculation about the 75-year-old president's political future.
The Elysee palace said Mr Mitterrand was in no danger and would be able to
carry out his full presidential duties as normal. Yesterday afternoon he
left Cochin hospital in Paris, where he underwent surgery last week.
Mr Mitterrand said he saw no reason to resign. 'I don't think that they gave
me a lobotomy', he joked.
He plans to vote in his former constituency, Chateau-Chinon in central
France, in Sunday's referendum on European monetary and political union.
Political commentators speculated that Mr Mitterrand's condition might
attract a sympathy vote in the closely balanced weekend poll. However, it
could also increase pressure on Mr Mitterrand to retire before his
seven-year term ends in May 1995.
The medical bulletin sent equity prices on the Paris stock market down 1.7
per cent by mid-morning, but shares recovered to end the day up 1.29 per
cent when it became clear that Mr Mitterrand was in no danger.
The president's decision to broadcast the details of his condition contrasts
with the secrecy surrounding former president Georges Pompidou, whose staff
revealed that he had cancer only a few days before he died in office in
1974.
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
yesterday appealed to French citizens to vote Yes on the Maastricht treaty
out of economic self-interest. 'It is difficult to imagine how the French
can abandon the advantages (of monetary union) when they have already paid
the price for it in terms of budgetary and monetary rigour', he said in an
interview to be published in today's Les Echos.
Several Parisian bank and security house economists warned that a No vote
would create heavy pressure on the franc and force up interest rates.
Intense campaigning continued across France yesterday as politicians
appealed to the large number of undecided voters - 29 per cent according to
recent polls - who could swing the balance.
Opinion polls showed a small majority in favour of the treaty, within their
own statistical margin of error, in samples taken over the weekend.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (6): Bargains on offer -
Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PERU'S most serious sortie yet into privatisation it has put its
state-owned mining companies up for sale, including Centromin, which employs
some 15,000 at its seven central Andean mines and huge refinery complex as
well as Minero-Peru and Hierro Peru.
The government expects to have valuations by mid-November of Minero-Peru's
four principal operations (the Cerro Verde copper deposits, San Antonio de
Poto's goldfield, and two refineries, for zinc at Cajamarquilla and copper
at Ilo). Iron monopoly Hierro Peru should be disposed of before the year
ends.
Investors are likely to pick up state holdings - to be split into individual
production units for the purposes of sale - at bargain-basement prices. In
the present uncertain economic and political climate (the de facto regime
has called elections for November 22) Peru's government knows the
traditional valuation process is almost meaningless.
'Prices obtained will have little to do with real asset value,' says Mr
Carlos Diez Canseco, the National Mining Society's (SNM) vice-president.
'Projected cash flow will be the important factor.' He reports lively
interest particularly from Canada, Chile and Australia.
Geologically, Peru is the most interesting and varied country in Latin
America. It ranks among the world's top seven mining countries with between
10 and 20 per cent of total copper and silver reserves and about 7 per cent
of all zinc. There are also important deposits of many other sought-after
minerals, with gold rapidly emerging as a leader.
Minerals and metals exports bring in some Dollars 1.6bn a year in foreign
exchange, equivalent last year to around 57 per cent of all export revenues.
Yet it is estimated that only 12 per cent of Peru's mining potential is
currently being exploited. Since the military government's nationalisation
of leading foreign-owned companies in the early 1970s, the sector has
suffered from desperately inadequate levels of investment in new exploration
and modern technology.
The only large company with a track record of sustained growth is Southern
Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC), producer of two-thirds of the country's
copper - it has never left US hands.
For years, buoyant international minerals prices and low domestic costs
masked the growing crisis in Peru's mines. But a combination of plummeting
world metals prices, rocketing inflation and local interest rates, plus a
heavily overvalued currency, have hammered the industry since the late
1980s. To add to producers' woes, mining - treated by Peruvian governments
as a convenient cash cow - has borne a crushing fiscal burden. Indebtedness
within the sector is running at record levels.
But things are looking up. The SNM has recently had one success in its
long-running battle with the government: as from August, the sector is
enjoying some relief with the extension of a tax drawback scheme, previously
available only to Peru's beleaguered silver producers, to the entire sector.
'It's the equivalent of a 10 per cent currency devaluation for miners,'
comments Mr Diez Canseco., 'However, we still have to make the government
see sense and exempt the sector from the selective tax on fuel.' Severe
nationwide electricity shortages mean more and more mines are obliged
increasingly to rely on costly petroleum.
The tax reprieve came as the industry was claiming to be near total
collapse. Peru's thousands of small 'artisanal' mines have all but
disappeared while a quarter of the 60 or so medium-sized operations,
backbone of the country's industry, have been forced either to close
temporarily or to reduce personnel dramatically. The spectacle of
out-of-work miners begging from passing lorries on Peru's central highway
has become distressingly common.
Only two mining companies ended 1991 with a positive balance sheet - in
first half 1992 that increased to four, with SPCC clawing its way back from
a Dollars 39m 1991 loss to a still small profit after a severe cost-cutting
exercise.
SPCC, at least, is demonstrating faith in Peru's future. In the wake of
settlement of a long-standing dispute with the Peruvian government, the
company has embarked on a Dollars 300m investment programme over the next
five years. Two electro-winning plants scheduled to produce almost 40,000
tonnes a year of copper cathodes, a sulphuric acid capture plant and a
package of environmental improvements add up to SPCC's largest single
investment in Peru since the mid-1970s.
Newmont Mining Corporation, in conjunction with Peru's old-established
mining concern Buenaventura, is also putting an initial Dollars 36m into
what promises to be a highly profitable gold operation at Yanacocha,
northern Peru.
Given the operational problems in Peru - from terrorism to political
uncertainty - investments are almost certain to be joint ventures. Several
medium-sized mining companies which have long-established links with foreign
buyers are in talks over expansion or new investment.
The regulations are attractive for those bold enough to invest in a country
where two guerrilla groups still operate with relative freedom. Peru is now
arguably the most liberal country in the Latin American continent in
treatment of foreign capital; red-tape for foreign investors is a thing of
the past and all profits and royalties can be freely remitted.
Peru's notoriously rigid labour stability laws have become far more flexible
and labour is still cheap by international standards. Much room for
improvement remains in productivity levels, however.
Principal deterrents to investment remain high security costs (equivalent to
5 per cent of sales revenue for certain mining companies, according to SNM
estimates), and the still shaky macro-economic framework. But local managers
expect substantial high-level interest in Centromin. 'With decent
management, most of these state operations could be turned round very
quickly,' says one.

Chile

MINING in Chile is poised for a dramatic expansion in the mid-1990s.
The Chilean Copper Commission, Cochilco, estimates mining companies will
invest almost Dollars 5bn before the end of the decade to explore, develop,
or expand projects.
Chile is the world's leading copper producer, and about Dollars 4bn of this
foreign investment is being channelled into new copper mines. The country
has one-quarter of the world's copper reserves. Cochilco estimates new
investments will raise Chile's copper production from 1.81m tonnes in 1991
(almost a quarter of the western world's output) to 2.18m tones by 1994.
Some Dollars 560m in gold projects will move Chile up the ladder of the
world's top 10 gold producers (with silver as an important side product). A
further Dollars 405m is being invested in non-metallics, such as iodine and
nitrates.
More than half of Chile's copper is mined by Codelco, the state-owned
Chilean Copper Corporation. But Codelco's four mines, including
Chuquicamata, the world's largest, are old. Production is in decline,
operating costs are rising, and the powerful Copper Workers' Union, with
19,000 members, has blocked management plans to reduce overmanning.
'The strength of the labour unions in Codelco is of genuine concern ..and a
drag on the industry's development,' says Mr Heikki Solin, the chief
executive of Outokumpu Copper Resources. However, he notes that new mines
have been successful in dismantling restrictive labour practices.
At La Escondida, Chile's newest copper mine, for example, the 850 miners are
not unionised. They work four 12-hour shifts and have four days off. 'The
effects on productivity are astounding, with almost double the tonnes per
man-hour compared with the much older Chuquicamata mine,' Mr Solin says.
Other mining executives in Chile say they have side-stepped the union issue
by hiring the services of contractors.
Codelco has launched an exploration drive to find new reserves. It is close
to a decision on whether to develop Chuqui Norte, a large deposit close to
Chuquicamata.
Most of Chile's increased copper output, however, will come from private
sector projects. Leading the wave of foreign investment, La Escondida, the
richest copper deposit in the world, entered production in December 1990. La
Escondida is owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a consortium of Japanese
smelters led by Mitsubishi.
To finance the Dollars 900m venture, La Escondida sold 77 per cent of its
output in advance in 12-year contracts to smelters in Japan, Germany and
Finland. The giant project in the Atacama desert was completed six months
ahead of schedule.
Mr John Hannah, La Escondida's president, says this is a tribute to the
organisation and engineering skills of Chilean contractors. La Escondida is
gearing up to full capacity this year. It will produce the equivalent of
320,000 tonnes of copper (four per cent of world output) in the form of
concentrates (a semi-refined product) at its turquoise blue concentrator
plant in the Atacama desert.
The concentrates are slurried down a pipeline to its own port facilities at
Coloso, south of Antofagasta. La Escondida's production makes it the second
biggest copper operation in the world. In February, Mr Hannah announced that
La Escondida would step up production by a further 80,000 tonnes - the
output of a medium-sized mine - by 1994. It is testing a method to process
the extra tonnage into pure copper cathodes using a new electrolytic
technique that does not require smelting.
Exxon Minerals of the US is close to completing a Dollars 400m expansion
programme at its Los Bronces copper mine that will double production to
200,000 tonnes a year. Phelps Dodge of the US, which is expanding its Ojos
del Salado mine, also plans to develop a deposit known as La Candelaria,
which is being dubbed as Chile's new Escondida. The company is currently
searching for financial backers for the Dollars 400m-project which would
produce approximately 90,000 tonnes of copper a year.
Outokumpu of Finland is close to a decision on whether to develop its
Zaldivar deposit, a stone's throw away from La Escondida. Zaldivar would
require a Dollars 300m investment to bring into production. A similar amount
is being sought by Cominco of Canada for its Quebrada Blanca deposit.
Finally, Royal Dutch/Shell, Falconbridge and Chevron are exploring the
Collahuasi deposit close to the Bolivian border.
The wealth of mining projects, concentrated mainly in Chile's desert north,
is putting a strain on the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Finding
water in the driest desert in the world is as much a priority as striking a
rich mineral deposit. Electricity is also in short supply.
Port facilities are deficient. La Escondida chose to build its own, rather
than compete with Codelco for Antofagasta's overstretched docks. Phelps
Dodge, which would ship La Candelaria's concentrates from the small port of
Caldera, is encountering opposition from local fishermen.
Another frequent complaint of foreign mining companies concerns the
significant litigation costs incurred in defending property rights. 'There
are many savvy Chileans who have become millionaires by slapping property
claims on prospected sites,' says one executive in Santiago.
These concerns found their way on to a report to the US Congress on American
trade and investment in Chile. In the report, one US company said it had
abandoned its mining projects in Chile after spending Dollars 1.5m in legal
fees to defend its property claim. The company said 37 rival concession
claims were stacked against its claim on the basis of a typographical error
in its paperwork.
The Mining Ministry acknowledges that over-staking is a problem. It says it
is trying to improve its record keeping for property claims and simplify the
paper-work.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (7): Coal, gold, emeralds -
Colombia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINING has become one of the most dynamic sectors of the Colombian economy
in the last decade.
It now contributes about 17 per cent of foreign income, even though the
ambitious coal and nickel export projects have seen few ups and many downs
in prices.
Yet this is just a fraction of what it might earn if the government could
create the confidence needed to attract investors who currently perceive
lower risks in Venezuela and Chile.
Both the Cerromatoso nickel plant and the huge Cerrejon coal mine were joint
ventures involving substantial state investments. Coal prices are now far
below those forecast when El Cerrejon was approved and the state coal
company, Carbocol, accumulated a debt of more than Dollars 1.8bn as
production grew to 14m tonnes a year. Although the government recently
lightened the burden by shifting Dollars 1bn to the Colombian oil company
and the nation, the country's first large-scale coal investment has been a
bruising experience.
Partly because of this, the government wants to finance future mining
ventures with private and foreign capital. There has been talk of
privatising the state holding in Cerromatoso and several Colombian
companies, as well as Drummond, a US concern, by developing the country's
abundant steam coal reserve.
With exports worth Dollars 630m in 1991, Colombia is already the world's
fourth coal supplier and plans to increase its share of the international
market to more than 10 per cent. Domestic demand should also pick up as the
government encourages new thermal power stations to reduce dependence on
hydro-electricity.
But private companies operating in the La Loma-La Jagua region have been
bedevilled by guerrilla actions and extortion, and coal projects are behind
schedule. Although agreements with communities to put in water services or
other infrastructure help gain local support, guerrilla demands have
escalated in recent years. 'If a company wants to work, you have to talk
with people who represent the guerrillas,' warned a Colombian geologist.
Mr Jairo Cuevas, manager of the state mining company, Mineralco, says
investors are more concerned about legal and tax issues than about violence.
A constitutional clause referring to expropriation is apparently to be
defused by a congressional ruling. Recent tax changes allow all profits to
be remitted, though the initial 12 per cent levy on remittances and the
overall tax structure favour reinvestment. While the government is clearly
anxious to attract capital as part of the whole process of opening up the
economy, other sectors may discourage foreign investment in their
determination to milk it.
There is no lack of opportunities, says Mr Cuevas: 'Now more detailed
exploration studies are needed. Projects have been identified and Mineralco
has the technical - though not the financial - capacity to launch them.'
Mineralco's main programmes are linked to precious metals and stones,
particularly emeralds, but Mr Cuevas is also enthusiastic about finding
partners to explore and develop copper deposits in the south-eastern
foothills of the Andes. Products derived from phosphate-bearing rock nearby
could be used in the recovery process.
Colombia is famous for its high-quality emeralds - and equally famous for
the violence of the rival emerald mining gangs, which left more than 3,000
dead in the 1970s and 1980s. During the last two years an uneasy truce has
allowed production to settle down, and the main players are planning to
establish an international emerald bourse in Bogota. Some government
officials welcome this as a way of 'legalising' the emerald trade, but
others fear that it could act as a 'legal' umbrella for cocaine
money-laundering.
Emerald exports were officially worth Dollars 150m in 1991, with most of the
best stones going to Japan. Experts estimate that emeralds worth at least
another Dollars 150m are smuggled out of the country each year. An
exceptional deep green stone with good fire can fetch Dollars 25,000 or more
per carat. While the companies dynamite and bulldoze for veins at the rock
face, prospecting families sift through the black sludge and debris washed
down from the mines, looking for the tiny gem that might represent a fortune
once it gets past the thieves and sharp middle-men in the mining area.
Gold also attracts droves of prospectors, who are ravaging river-banks and
polluting streams with mercury. Mineralco plans to bring in technical
experts to improve the recovery rate and to find ways of reducing
environmental damage. There is a 5 per cent discount on amalgam purchases by
the Central Bank, partly to cover processing and partly to try and reduce
mercury use.
'The geological potential in precious metals is phenomenal,' said Mr Patrick
Gorman of the US-based consulting firm, Puma Resources. 'There is something
for everybody in the gold business here. I know a number of people who are
interested. But anything has to be done with a view to the long-term
development of the country and with respect for the people already working
in these areas.'
Guainia and the Vaupes, two areas on the eastern border of Colombia with
Brazil, are especially promising. Although the logistics would be
complicated, inaccessible jungle has its advantages and there is little
guerrilla influence in the area.
From the beginning of 1993, the gold market will no longer be controlled
entirely by the Central Bank. Although Colombia has a 1,500-year-long
tradition of fine goldwork, Italian technology is being used in the first
two industrial jewellery ventures - one plant is due to start exporting gold
chains next year. Already among the world's top 10 gold producers, Colombia
could benefit from its low production costs and abundant reserves in times
of relatively depressed international prices.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Helicopter company merger blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) blocked the proposed acquisition
of British International Helicopters (BIH) by Aberdeen-based Bond
Helicopters yesterday on the ground that it was against the public interest.
BIH was put into administration last December after the death of Robert
Maxwell, who had acquired the helicopter company from British Airways in
1986.
The MMC concluded yesterday that a merger of BIH with Bond Helicopters would
leave only two operators, each with about half the market providing
helicopter services on the North Sea to the UK offshore oil and gas
industry.
The MMC said that risked reducing competition and forcing up prices for
North Sea offshore helicopter services.
The biggest North Sea operator is Bristow Helicopters, with about 51 per
cent of the market, followed by Bond with 29 per cent and BIH with the
remaining 20 per cent. BIH also operates a scheduled passenger helicopter
service between Penzance and the Scilly Isles.
An earlier bid by Bristow for the former Maxwell-owned business was
withdrawn after it was referred to the MMC.
The MMC decision was criticised by Mr Stephen Bond, the Aberdeen company's
managing director, as demonstrating 'a complete lack of understanding of the
industry'.
He said it failed to recognise that foreign competitors were preparing to
attack the UK offshore market.
'The decision has been made from a UK point of view when it should have been
looked at from an overall European perspective,' he said.
'There are already 11 other European operators working in non-UK waters and
this decision severely weakens the UK helicopter industry's ability to
compete effectively and maintain market share.'
Mr Bond said KLM Helicopters and its US partner ERA had recently applied for
an operating licence for UK waters.
The MMC, however, said demand for helicopter services on the North Sea was
likely to remain stable or decline over the next few years.
It argued that if the merger went ahead, neither of the two remaining
operators would compete strongly for market share and prices would tend to
rise.
The MMC also said there was unlikely to be any successful competition from a
new firm entering the market.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Sell-off rebuff for party leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrat conference yesterday rejected the party leadership's
proposals to set up a rail holding company to franchise rail services and
stations.
The decision - by 314 votes to 309 - is a further rebuff for the
leadership's emphasis on the market and competition.
Representatives clearly rejected the assertion in the After Privatisation
policy paper that the debate between nationalisation and privatisation
'belongs to history'.
Mr Roger Liddle, chairman of the working group that produced the paper, said
it was 'most emphatically not a free-market paper', and urged the party not
to leave the Tories in sole possession of the rhetoric of competition.
But speakers were applauded when they said the paper seemed to have been
written by Conservatives and did not reflect the Liberal Democrat commitment
to accountability and the community, and to the involvement of employees in
their industries.
They also criticised it for too readily accepting that the privatisations
already carried out by the Tories could not be reversed and for entering too
enthusiastically into the language of the market.

BRITISH Rail confirmed yesterday that it was seeking an injunction against
the RMT rail union, which has organised a one-day strike at a Manchester
station.
The action, planned for tomorrow, is over the dismissal of four guards at
Manchester's Piccadilly station. BR says it sacked the four men because they
took illegal strike action, inciting others to do the same.
The RMT says BR breached a local staffing agreement.

A SEEPAGE of six gallons of plutonium nitrate is expected to halt
reprocessing at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield plant in west Cumbria for
a further four weeks, the company said yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
No radioactivity escaped into working areas or the environment, the company
said.
BNFL, which stopped reprocessing last week after the seepage from a
plutonium evaporator was discovered, is preparing a report, which will
require Nuclear Installations Inspectorate approval, on plans to recover the
liquid.
The company said no employees would be laid off. It still hoped to catch up
on its reprocessing programme, which is its core business.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Labour attacks retailers on cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE retailers were accused yesterday of charging 'astronomic' rates of
interest on their store cards by the Labour party after a survey showed that
many high-street retail chains charge an average of 30 per cent a year
interest on their store cards.
For the first time, Labour has called on the government to ask the Office of
Fair Trading to investigate store cards.
The survey shows that several well-known high street chains, including John
Lewis, Burton, Habitat, and Next, have not cut interest charges on their
store cards in the past two years even though base rates had fallen from 15
per cent to 10 per cent before yesterday's increase.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, described store-card
interest rates as a scandal. 'Some of these stores must be making more out
of their astronomic interest rates than they are making out of retailing,'
Mr Cook said.
'There is no point in the big stores' complaining about the lack of consumer
confidence if they are not prepared to help. Customers can hardly be
expected to take on more credit at these rates of usury,' he continued.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Lobby on performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of large British companies led by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical
company, is to lobby urgently for changes in legislation on profit-related
pay after a sudden reversal of Inland Revenue practice last month.
In an unexpected statement in July, the Revenue issued a statement of
practice that disqualified from tax relief profit-related pay schemes using
certain formulae that it had previously allowed.
Mr Neville Machin, Wellcome's group employee relations manager, expressed
frustration that the Revenue's plans will bar its scheme, which it has drawn
up after several years' negotiations with the Revenue.
Wellcome had used a formula to calculate its scheme, which was geared to
rewarding improved rather than static performance.
Although tax relief for the current year is not affected, the scheme will in
future be disqualified.
Employees in approved schemes can receive the lower of Pounds 4,000 or 20
per cent of their salary tax-free.
The number of approved schemes more than doubled from 1,277 to 2,597 in the
year to March 1992. The number of employees covered rose from 350,100 to
718,069 during the period.
'If you read between the lines, what happened is the Revenue's advisers said
that the schemes they had been approving did not conform to the
legislation,' Mr Machin said.
'You should not be using fiscal stimuli to reward static performance. If you
make Pounds 100m and have agreed 5 per cent profit-related pay, then make
Pounds 100m the next year, you have gone backwards,' he said.
Wives can now apply to the Inland Revenue to receive all or half of the
married couple's allowance, after changes announced in the budget earlier
this year.
The Revenue has issued a new document - Form 18 - which should be completed
before April 6 next year, when the new system begins.
Under the new arrangement, the wife is eligible to receive half - or, with
the consent of her husband, all - of the basic Pounds 1,720 allowance.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (2): Swing to nationalism
deters the investors - Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A result of its nationalistic restrictions combined with domestic
recession, Brazil's mining sector is suffering a dramatic investment crisis,
in spite of having one of the world's richest subsoils.
While other countries in Latin America have been busily changing their laws
to encourage and compete over inward investment, Brazil's mining code of
1988 seems positively designed to frighten off foreign investors.
Mr John Guzman, head of Rio Tinto Zinc in Brazil, says 'if there's one sure
way to discourage foreign investment it is the current law which is totally
out of step with the rest of the world. Instead of protecting the country it
is hurting it.'
According to figures of the National Mining Department (DNPM), investment is
now down to a fifth of what it was 10 years ago and fell from Dollars 122m
in 1988 to Dollars 46.2m in 1990. Last year it was even lower.
Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of tin, bauxite, aluminium
and iron ore. Its iron ore reserves are believed to be equivalent to about a
third of the world's total, its bauxite reserves are the largest in Latin
America and it has important deposits of manganese, zinc, gold, tin, copper,
kaolin, chromium and precious and semi-precious stones among many others.
Yet relatively few of these minerals have been produced in significant
quantities and Brazil's current mineral production represents only about 2
per cent of GDP - far below its potential. The fall in investment is
expected to result in an increase in mineral imports by the end of this
decade.
Mr Jose Mizael, executive secretary of the Brazilian Mining Institute,
attributes the situation largely to the restrictions on foreign investment
introduced in the highly nationalist 1988 Constitution. This prohibits
foreign companies from participating in the mining sector unless they have a
majority Brazilian partner. Those already operating in Brazil must find a
local partner to take control or industrialise production by this October to
process minerals, or leave.
Brazilian partners are hard to find in the current economic climate with
recession in its third year and interest rates at more than 30 per cent a
month, and Brazilian business has little tradition of investing in the
mining sector where returns can often take 10 years. Around half of current
total investment is provided by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the well
respected state mining company, but state companies have had their budgets
slashed as part of the government's austerity programme.
The 1988 Constitution could hardly have been more effective at deterring
foreign investment in mining. Those foreign companies that had already
industrialised such as RTZ, which has been in Brazil 20 years, stayed but
those which were exploring have pulled out or significantly reduced
investments.
The country's backward mining code is not the only impediment. Much of
Brazil's untapped mineral wealth lies in remote parts of the Amazon where
lack of infrastructure means high transport costs and environmental concerns
mean taking special, and often costly, measures. Some is in the territory of
Indian reserves where Congressional approval is required for exploration.
Consequently until now the Amazon has largely remained the territory of
garimpeiros - wildcat gold or tin miners who operate illegally throughout
the jungle. Efforts in 1990 by the government of President Fernando Collor
to wipe out the estimated 300,000 garimpeiros by dynamiting their airstrips
petered out but lower gold prices and an exhaustion of easily accessible
gold has reduced garimpeiro production. According to the DNPM, last year for
the first time production from mining companies outweighed that from
garimpeiros.
What formal investment is going on in mining is aimed at maintaining
Brazil's place in the world rather than advancing production. Last year
mining production fell around 2.8 per cent to around Dollars 10bn mainly
because of a decrease in gold and iron production. Gold production fell 12.4
per cent to 90 tonnes while iron ore production fell 1.5 per cent to 150m
tonnes. Exports increased 7.2 per cent to Dollars 3.05bn of which 85 per
cent was iron ore, but the country had a mineral trade deficit of nearly
Dollars 2bn largely due to petroleum imports.
The country's only new large project in recent years was Carajas, the
world's biggest high grade iron ore mine with estimated reserves of 1.4bn
tonnes. Built by CVRD, the Dollars 4bn project, which involves a special
railway and port, has been coming on line since 1983. Situated in the
Eastern Amazon the project has won worldwide credit for showing that
environment and development can coexist.
As a direct effect of falling investment, Brazil has had no significant
discovery for more than a decade despite its considerable mineral riches and
the situation is expected to deteriorate. More than half the country's
geologists are unemployed and Mr Otto Bittencourt, a director of DNPM, says,
'we've retarded the discovery of new minerals. Geological mapping is falling
further behind and this will have a very negative effect in the future'. He
points out that a recent World Bank report said Brazil's mining sector has
capacity to absorb average investments of Dollars 300m a year.
In response to the situation, the Collor government has sent a project to
Congress to end the discrimination against foreign capital as part of its
modernisation programme. Mr Bittencourt says, 'everyone's competing for
investments so we need to make sure we at least offer the same conditions'.
However, although there is considerable consensus behind the change,
constitutional amendments require a three-fifths vote and, with Mr Collor
currently besieged by a torrent of allegations of corruption which could
result in his impeachment, the new legislation is unlikely to be approved in
the near future. Moreover, if Mr Collor does not survive, his successor, Mr
Itamar Franco, the current vice-president, is expected to bring in as
minister of mines Mr Aureliano Chaves, a man known for his strong
nationalist tendencies.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (3): State giant fights a
losing battle - Bolivia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIAN mining has two faces. There is the public face which is crumbling,
and the private face which looks better with each passing day.
Unfortunately for cash starved Bolivia, potential private investors take one
look at the state mining corporation, Comibol, and get the jitters about the
industry as a whole. They should not do so because Bolivia has many thriving
private mining enterprises, which are the key to the country's long-term
prospects.
In the public sector, the present government has introduced a new mining
code and opened up Comibol to joint ventures with private corporations.
Unfortunately no amount of legislation will reform this loss-making, bloated
and inefficient organisation. Relatively strong mining unions realise joint
ventures mean the end of their political clout and are fighting them all the
way.
In contrast, the government is weak, disorientated and coming up for
re-election. Comibol's entrenched middle management and technicians, knowing
that joint ventures will cost them their jobs, seems to be doing their
utmost to delay and dismiss such deals.
Since the concept of joint ventures was first touted as the way ahead for
Comibol in 1991, only two deals have been signed, though leasing contracts
are fairly common. So far, three companies: Minproc, Cominesa, and a
subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema, are still unable to start up operations
due to industrial action.
Comibol recently acquired a new president, Mr Marcelo Perez, a committed
free marketeer with no mining experience, and the much criticised Comibol
board is strongly rumoured to be about to undergo a major shake-up.
But while the government continues to refuse to tackle middle management and
unions, potential joint venture partners with Comibol can expect much
frustration and disappointment.
Nevertheless, there is an incentive for change in the form of the World
Bank, which has been withholding a Dollars 35m mining credit originally
approved in 1989, Dollars 22m of which is earmarked for the restructuring of
Comibol.
A team from the World Bank has visited Bolivia to evaluate recent
rearrangements within the corporation, which, apart from a new president,
include a major redundancy programme. The team may release the credit, but
is likely to insist on Comibol jettisoning its mining interests and
concentrating solely on administering joint venture contracts. There is a
view, however, that it would perhaps be better if Comibol was starved of
funds and left to die a natural death.
Alternatively, under a new government, Comibol might be disposed of
altogether. This is the preference of planning minister Samuel Doria Medina,
who is convinced that the country's constitution will be altered to allow
the full-scale privatisation of the corporation some time next year.
In contrast, the Medium Mines Association, an umbrella organisation of
medium-sized private mining concerns, continues to go from strength to
strength, thanks to its ability to adapt far faster than Comibol to changing
market conditions.
Rolando Jordan, the Association's general secretary, explains: 'The 1985
crash in tin prices showed us that our industry was built on the basis of
continuing high prices. We have learnt our lesson. New mining operations we
subsequently embarked on used modern mining techniques and philosophies.'
Overall investment in mining continues to rise, from Dollars 53.1m in 1989
to Dollars 80.7m in 1990 and Dollars 96.1m in 1991. Although growth last
year was a disappointing 2 per cent, the dynamic period from 1987 to 1990
saw significant increases of between 14 and 53 per cent.
Growth in the Medium Mines was around 3.6 per cent for the first half of
this year. However, the ground is being prepared for an early revival. Inli
Raymi, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, is investing some Dollars 170m
in its existing gold and silver operations and investigating a promising
copper and gold deposit.
RTZ has uncovered a gold deposit in Puquio Norte, which is to be exploited
by Comsur - one example of a successful private joint venture partnership.
Cyprus Minerals is confident of finalising a joint venture exploration deal
with Comibol covering 100,000 hectares in the Los Lipez region.
However, Bolivia's traditional production - tin, tungsten, wolfram and
antimony - is geared to survival rather than profit at present. Mr Jordan of
Medium Mines acknowledges that five of his current 22 members may be forced
to drop out of the organisation by the year's end as a result.
In contrast, zinc and silver continue to break production records. Copper
and gold are also showing some promise. But it is polymetallic seams -
containing silver, zinc, tin and lead - which excite the most interest. The
problem in this field is that concentrations tend to be small and transport
costs will be crucial to determine viability.
Indeed, infrastructure in general is perhaps the greatest physical problem
facing mining companies in Bolivia. This is a country roughly twice the size
of Spain. Yet much of it is without roads, electricity or communications
links.
Mr Marcial Garcia, exploration manager with Cyprus Minerals in Bolivia,
says: 'The government needs to invest in infrastructure before many mining
projects can become feasible.'
This year's public investment programme is worth just Dollars 470m, although
the figure is up on last year and will continue to rise in 1993, according
to finance minister Jorge Quiroga.
One project which may help is a proposed road which would link Bolivia to
the Pacific Coast. And Peru recently granted Bolivia access to the sea
through the as yet undeveloped port of Ilo.
While labour problems significantly affect Comibol and its joint venture
partners, the situation could change as private ownership of mines becomes
more established.
Unions are utterly opposed to what they call 'privatisation through the back
door.' However, individual miners are aware that profitable private
companies provide better pay and conditions. Miners in existing private
operations are far less prone to industrial action than their public sector
counterparts.
The message for potential investors in Bolivia is that mining is composed of
two separate entities: public and private. Those brave souls ready to tackle
the public sector will need ample reserves of patience, perseverance and
political skill. In contrast, many private sector ventures in Bolivia do
work, and work well.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (4): The first signs of
progress - Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS in Venezuela have been talking for years about the country's
mining potential but have achieved few concrete results.
However, the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez, elected for a
five-year term in early 1989, is now making tangible progress. In 1990, the
Perez government broadly liberalised rules on foreign investment. Last year
it reduced the maximum corporate tax rate to 30 per cent, an important
advance for potential investors, since most mining activities previously
were taxed at around 60 per cent of operating profits.
These measures, with other reforms that are turning Venezuela into a more
open and competitive economy, have helped to make mining more attractive to
private investors.
In spite of these advances, the overall figures on Venezuelan mining in 1991
were not very encouraging. The Central Bank reported that mining, which grew
by 5.3 per cent in 1990, declined by 3.6 per cent last year even as the
economy expanded vigorously.
The 1991 results were due principally to a sharp decline in gold and diamond
production. A closer look, however, shows that some important advances are
being made, especially in coal and bauxite, while new gold investments are
under way. COAL: Output at Venezuela's largest coal mine, located in the
Guasare coal fields of the western state of Zulia, reached 1.2m tonnes
during the first half of 1992, close to the total of approximately 1.5m
tonnes for full-year 1991.
Carbones del Guasare, the joint venture company that operates the open pit
mine in Guasare, plans to reach total production of 3m tonnes this year. Its
two partners, Carbozulia (wholly owned by the Venezuelan national oil
company, PDVSA, and Agipcoal), are expected to decide later this year on
whether they will invest in a rail and port infrastructure to help raise
production to 20m tonnes per year by the end of the decade.
Cavoven, a joint venture of Venezolana de Cementos, a private company, and
Mitsubishi, produced more than 241,000 tonnes of coal in 1991 from its Fila
Maestra mine in eastern Venezuela. It plans to reach 300,000 tonnes this
year.
Other coal production, totalling less than 500,000 tonnes last year, came
from mines - some of which produce coking coal - in the western state of
Tachira. Coal exports in 1991 were 1.85m tonnes, up 122,000 tonnes - or 7
per cent - from 1990. Exports came from Guasare and Cavoven.
Most of Venezuela's coal is exported. The largest markets, in descending
order, are the EC, Scandinavia, the US and the Caribbean. Apart from
Agipcoal, which is considering a large investment to expand output at the
Paso Diablo mine, other international companies are studying new investments
at other sites in the Guasare fields, which have proven reserves of 353m
tonnes and identified reserves of over 2bn tonnes.
These companies include Shell Coal and Veba Oel, which last year completed
geotechnical and hydrological studies at the Socuy mine site; AT Massey Coal
and Cavoven, which explored the Mina Norte site; and Cyprus Coal which is
exploring the Cachiri site with Carbozulia.
BAUXITE: After years of delays, the government is also making progress in
increasing production at its bauxite mine in Los Pijiguaos, among the
jungles of southeastern Venezuela. Bauxiven, which runs the mine, produced
1.94m tonnes of bauxite in 1991, up sharply from 1990's total of 771,000
tonnes.
The company made a slow start this year, producing only 270,000 tonnes
between January and June. But officials say that production was down due to
the installation of new equipment designed to raise the mine's capacity to
3.5m tonnes a year and higher. Bauxiven is still shooting for a production
target of 3-3.5m tonnes for full-year 1992.
GOLD: Production of gold and diamonds (the latter are often found in
deposits of alluvial gold) declined sharply last year due mainly to a
contraction in the number of individual miners working sites in the
southeast state of Bolivar. The rich alluvial and underground gold deposits
in Bolivar are worked chiefly by thousands of free-lance miners, many of
them - like the 'garimpeiros' from Brazil - working in Venezuela illegally.
Gold is also mined by a variety of companies, including government-owned
Minerven, which produced two tonnes of gold in 1991 and 784 kilograms during
the first half of this year. Accurate production figures are not available
due to the large number of illegal miners. Private sector sources estimate
last year's total gold output at 11-12 tonnes, down from estimates in
previous years of around 20 tonnes. (The government said that production in
1988 may have reached 27 tonnes, but other sources consider this quite
high.)
Monarch Resources, a Bermuda-based company, is currently developing the
largest gold mining project in Venezuela. Monarch, which has been operating
in Venezuela since 1987, is investing Dollars 23m to develop a new mine - La
Camorra - in Bolivar state. It began developing the mine in June of this
year. Monarch also has 10 geologists and a support staff of 75 exploring
additional prospects, and is investing Dollars 3m on exploration this year
alone.
The company also operates a tailings mill (Revemin) which last year produced
800 kg of gold. Monarch, with a total payroll of 300 in Venezuela, has
invested around Dollars 40m in the country thus far. It reported a loss of
Dollars 2.9m in 1991. In addition, Canada's Placer Dome is exploring in
Bolivar state and is studying the possibility of a plant to process
tailings. Greenwich Resources also has a small gold operation in Bolivar.
IRON ORE: Iron ore, which is mined and marketed by the state-owned
Ferrominera del Orinoco, has been a staple export product for Venezuela for
decades. Ferrominera in 1975 took over mining operations formerly owned by
US Steel and Bethlehem Steel when the government decided to nationalise the
iron ore sector. However, the present government is studying the
privatisation of an iron ore pellet plant it owns and wants international
investors to build plants to produce pre-reduced iron-ore briquettes for
export.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Triton Europe at Pounds 3.89m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRITON EUROPE, the indep-endent oil and gas exploration and production
group, announced after-tax profits of Pounds 3.89m for the year to May 31.
Last time net profits amounted to Pounds 31.4m after an exceptional gain of
Pounds 34.8m arising from the sale of the company's North Sea assets.
At the pre-tax level there were losses of Pounds 335,000 (Pounds 45.1m
profits) reflecting a decline in the average oil price to Dollars 20.48
(Dollars 26.78) per barrel.
The results also included an additional depreciation charge of Pounds 1.3m
reflecting a reduction in the estimates of reserves at Villeperdue, the
company's principal source of production. However, changes were to be made
in the operating structure of the field which Mr Tom Graves, the chairman,
said should result in 'meaningful savings and improved profitability'.
On the current year he said that trading conditions in the first three
months were in accordance with company expectations. Triton's financial
position remained strong with net assets of Pounds 65.2m, indebtedness of
Pounds 500,000 and about Pounds 5m in cash.
Turnover fell from Pounds 29.7m to Pounds 21.7m and gross profits to Pounds
4.32m (Pounds 12.7m).
Net interest receivable amounted to Pounds 677,000 against Pounds 66,000 but
there were exchange losses of Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 1.3m gains).
Earnings per share came through at 4.71p (38.05p) but there is no dividend
payment for the year.

Pre-tax profits declined by IPounds 500,000 to IPounds 1m (Pounds 958,000)
at Kingspan in the first half to June 30. Sales fell by 10 per cent to
IPounds 27.4m (IPounds 30.5m).
The Irish Republic-based maker of steelwork for buildings and metal doors
and windows, said it had maintained volume in its building components
division by increasing market share during the period, but if the market
contracted further it would not be able to do so again.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1p on earnings per share of 3.02p
(4.88p).

High Gosforth Park reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 64,168 for the six
months to June 30, against profits of Pounds 5,897 in the previous first
half. The 1991 year ended with losses of Pounds 46,000.
The operator of the Newcastle racecourse said gate receipts and commission
from on-course betting had suffered from smaller fields due to dry weather
and recession.
Turnover in the six months rose to Pounds 592,167 (Pounds 555,590) but cost
of sales was Pounds 572,600 (Pounds 467,038). Losses per share of 70.5p
compared with earnings of 0.2p and there is no interim dividend.

LGW, the USM-quoted marketing services and luxury goods group, achieved
pre-tax profits of Pounds 438,000 in the six months to June 30, compared
with losses of Pounds 254,000. The group returned to the black in the second
half last year and reported profits of Pounds 77,000 for the full year.
The result was achieved, directors said, by maintaining a lower level of
expenses, better profit margins, and by a reduction in stock levels.
Turnover improved to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 6.21m). Earnings per share worked
through at 7.8p (5.7p losses) and an interim dividend of 1.125p is declared,
the first payment since 1990.

SHARES OF Ramus Holdings, the manufacturer of ceramic tiles, kitchens and

pending clarification of its financial position.
Directors said results for the year to end-June would be considerably worse

The company was at an advanced stage of discussions which could lead to a
substantial capital subscription. A further announcement, together with
publication of the results, would be made as soon as possible, they added.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Meggitt records 3% improvement to Pounds
12.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEGGITT, the Dorset-based engineering company, yesterday reported a 23 per
cent fall in earnings per share but a 3 per cent increase in profits, helped
by a reduction in the interest charge.
In spite of the drop in earnings, the group is increasing the interim
dividend by 4.2 per cent to 1.25p (1.2p), based on confidence that it was
'well placed to benefit from any changes in the industrial environment.'
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 12.3m to
Pounds 12.6m on sales ahead 1 per cent to Pounds 152.9m.
At the operating level, profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 11.7m as the
group came under margin pressure and the cost of competing in tough markets
increased, according to Mr Ken Coates, chairman.
Meggitt enjoyed the benefits of last November's Pounds 39.6m rights issue,
which helped lead to a Pounds 2.78m swing to Pounds 901,000 interest earned.
Gearing at the half year fell to 8.5 per cent in spite of Pounds 51.5m spent
on acquisitions during the period, helped by the rights but also due to cash
management and cash generation.
Mr Coates said that after a fall in capital expenditure last year from a
level below that of depreciation, there had been an increase in the first
half.
The research and development budget had also increased by 7 per cent over
the same period last year.
On the operational side, the controls and aerospace divisions came under
greatest pressure with difficulties in the UK in the former and the latter
down on the exceptionally high first half last year.
Electronics and energy both improved their first half performances.
On current trading Mr Coates said the group's order intake was ahead of the
comparable period last year, helped by newly-launched products. There were,
however, no clear signs of any lasting economic upturn.

<TEXT>
CLOSE BROTHERS, the City merchant bank, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m
in the 12 months to July 31, an advance of 2.4 per cent on the previous
year's Pounds 12.3m.
Total assets expanded by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 417m (Pounds 395m) and the
loan book rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 275m (Pounds 239m). The group
maintained a broad spread of lending and at the year end had only 13 loans
of more than Pounds 1m.
Mr Hugh Ashton, chairman, said that the group had achieved 'another
resilient performance in the face of a gruelling year with extraordinarily
difficult trading conditions'.
He added: 'In recent years we have outperformed others within our sector and
we are now intent on building up a major merchant banking group.'.
With the exception of Air and General Finance, the light aircraft and
helicopter financing company, which incurred losses, most subsidiaries did
well. Close Consumer Finance and PROMPT, the commercial insurance premium
finance company, both had good years.
Deposits were down from Pounds 140m to Pounds 130m. Committed term
facilities were Pounds 210m and substantial new funding has been agreed in
principle since the year end.
The proposed final dividend is 6.5p, bringing the total for the year to 9.5p
(8.8p), covered 2.3 times by earnings ahead 8 per cent to 22.7p (21.1p) per
share.

La Cantina reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 40,000 on sales of Pounds
360,000 in the year to September 30. Sales in the eight months to end-May
were Pounds 216,000.
As a result of the deal Mr Rory Haisley, Gillport's main shareholder, has

Gillport will emerge with a 17.7per cent stake in Simpsons.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Try declines to Pounds 380,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HUGH TRY, chairman of Try Group, said yesterday he was pleased that
pre-tax profits at the contractor and housebuilder had only declined from
Pounds 501,000 to Pounds 380,000 in the six months to June 30, given the
constraints on the sector.
Overhead reduction has been swingeing. About 25 per cent of the workforce
has gone in the past year - 'well into the lean of the company', said Mr
Try. He said there was very little new work on architects' drawing-boards,
but that there were 'opportunities available even during a recession'. Try
has had some success acquiring sites, contracting business and indeed
contracts from the receiver.
Margins could be better on those unfinished sites or projects of failed
builders or contractors, Mr Try said. Work gained this way now accounts for
about 15 per cent of Try's turnover, which rose 10 per cent to Pounds 63.1m
(Pounds 57.2m) as several large contracts reached their final stages.
In August 1991 it raised about Pounds 8m through a rights issue to buy
housebuilding sites from the receiver of Egerton Trust and more recently it
acquired a partially completed block of flats in Gravesend, Kent. At the end
of last year, it bought Arnold &amp; Nathan, the contracting business, and has
acquired contracts for an office block and a leisure complex from
Swindon-based Isis.
The interest charge was Pounds 275,000; last time there was a credit of
Pounds 385,000 because of the banked proceeds of the rights before the
Egerton buy.
Earnings fell to 0.73p (2.28p) per share and the interim dividend is cut to
0.5p (2p).

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Gestetner sells camera distribution side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GESTETNER HOLDINGS, the office products and photographic film and equipment
distributor, has found a buyer for its camera distribution business, which
has been hit by the recession.
Concord Camera of the US is to purchase the Vivitar and Hanimex camera
distribution business, excluding Hanimex Australasia, for Dollars 40m
(Pounds 20.3m) in cash and 1.3m Concord shares, with an option to convert
the shares to Pounds 12.5m in cash in 12 months' time.
Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner chairman, said the sale reflected the
realisation that camera distribution 'was not a core business for us.' The
group had been seeking a buyer for nine months.
The camera business has net tangible assets of about Dollars 31m. Its main
market is North America. Trading profits were Pounds 2m on world-wide sales
of Pounds 90m in the year to October 31, but dipped to a Pounds 1.3m trading
loss on sales of Pounds 37m for the six months to April 30.
Gestetner will retain its film and processing operations based in Australia,
New Zealand and the UK, together with the right to the Hanimex name in
Australia.
These operations mainly comprise distribution and processing of Fuji film in
Australia and Fuji graphic arts products in the UK. Trading profits from
this source were Pounds 7.2m on sales of Pounds 90m in the full year, and
Pounds 1.7m on sales of Pounds 44m in the latest half year.
The cash proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce bank borrowings.
The UK group has been focusing on its core office equipment business
following its 1990 acquisition of the non-US operations of Nashua Office
Systems and its recent alliance with Ricoh of Japan.
Ricoh and AFP, the Australian investment company, hold nearly 25 per cent
each of Gestetner, on a fully diluted basis.

<TEXT>
NIKON, the Japanese camera and semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker,
said yesterday it would cut 450 jobs from the company payroll over the next
four years, bringing down the size of the workforce by 6 per cent to 7,000.
Nikon said it was forced to cut staff in order to maintain an adequate level
of profitability, thus joining a growing list of mainstream Japanese
manufacturing companies which have found that the fast pace of growth of
recent years has left them dangerously exposed to the economic downturn.
Sales of Nikon's semiconductor manufacturing equipment have fallen sharply
as electronics companies have responded to the slump in the industry by
slashing investment budgets. Sales of cameras, eyeglasses, and measuring
equipment are also poor.
The company plans to reduce recruitment by natural wastage. About 60 new
employees will be inducted into the company next year, compared to 200 last
spring. An average of 100 new employees a year are to join the company over
the next four years. With about 200 employees leaving the company each year,
total employment will decline gradually.
Nikon's parent company pre-tax profit fell by 62.4 per cent to Y7.23bn
(Dollars 58m) in the year to March. Although the company has yet to revise
its forecast for this year, it is thought to be struggling to stay in the
black.

Foods

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
H J HEINZ, the large US foods group with extensive overseas operations, is
holding talks with Australia's Goodman Fielder Wattie about the purchase of
a strategic stake in Wattie Foods, the GFW subsidiary which is New Zealand's
biggest producer of canned goods.
Wattie Foods became part of GFW through the merger of Australian-based
Goodman Fielder and New Zealand's Wattie group in 1987.
Besides producing canned goods, Wattie Foods also manufactures a range of
other products, including frozen food and ice cream.
The talks came to light when the New Zealand Commerce Commission revealed
that Heinz has applied for clearance to buy up to 100 per cent of Wattie.
Yesterday in Pittsburgh, the US food group acknowledged that the application
had been filed, although it said that matters were at a fairly preliminary
stage.
Heinz declined to state whether it was aiming for an outright purchase of
Wattie Foods or whether it would consider a smaller equity stake.
Only last month, Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz's chairman, said that his company
was looking for acquisitions worldwide, but particularly in Asia.
The US company has a well-established subsidiary in Australia that produces
a range of products from baby foods to baked beans, but it has no operations
in New Zealand. About 40 per cent of Heinz's Dollars 6.5bn annual sales
already come from outside the US.
GFW has been looking for a shareholder to buy around 25 to 50 per cent of
the Wattie Foods subsidiary, in line with its plans to float the rest of the
shares later this year.
Mr Michael Nugent, GFW chief executive, said in Wellington on Tuesday that
directors wanted to find 'strategic shareholders' to bolster the public
float, which is expected to raise close to NZDollars 500m (USDollars 280m).
GFW said yesterday talks with Heinz were proceeding, but no offer had been
received. It added that Heinz was one of a number of parties interested in
buying into Wattie.
GFW said: 'We don't think anyone is close to making an offer.'
It added that it had a 'fairly inflexible' timetable for the float, with a
prospectus due to be released in the middle of next month.
GFW intends to reinvest proceeds from the Wattie disposal in expanding its
role in the Australian cereal business.

<TEXT>
DOMINION Mining, one of a crop of emerging Australian gold producers, has
overcome lower gold prices to make a strong return to the black in the year
to June.
The directors yesterday reported that the company had turned net losses of
ADollars 26.7m (USDollars 19.54m) into ADollars 18.1m profits on a 6.6 per
cent rise in sales to ADollars 265.8m from ADollars 249.2m. The previous
year was affected by an ADollars 81.3m abnormal loss.
The annual dividend has been reduced to 4 cents a share from 4.5 cents.
The directors warned that an accent on cost reduction would lead to a small
fall in gold production in the current year.
Gold output rose to 436,605oz from 388,021oz but the average price received
fell to ADollars 598 per oz from ADollars 626.
The directors said the cost of production was running at ADollars 376 per
oz.
'A strong forward sales position has been maintained, with over 900,000oz
forward sold at an average deliverable price of ADollars 580 per oz,' they
said.
'The group net operating cash flow for the financial period was ADollars
81.8m. Total equivalent cash increased to ADollars 46.8m and the group
re-mained totally debt free.
'The strong cash flow and debt free status enables the company to examine
acquisition opportunities.
'The company will continue to review expansion options from its own resource
port-folio, search for sound ac-quisitions and above all maintain the
aggressive and innovative exploration programme.'
The tax provision was ADollars 11.4m compared with a ADollars 17.1m credit,
and depreciation took ADollars 45.5m against ADollars 42.4m.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Court of Appeal yesterday cleared the way for Carter Holt
Harvey (CHH), the New Zealand forestry group, to sell Sealord Products, its
fishing subsidiary, to a consortium led by Greenland Ocean Trawlers of
Denmark.
The court threw out a legal challenge that would have stopped the company
selling 40 per cent of its shares overseas. Southern Ocean Trawlers, a rival
New Zealand fishing group, had argued that Sealord should not be allowed to
have more than 25 per cent foreign ownership to retain its fishing quotas
under the country's Fisheries Act.
CHH has received two bids for Sealord:
One from the Danish-led consortium which includes Ord Minnett, an investment
bank which is part of Westpac, the Australian banking group. It plans to
float about 25 per cent of Sealord in New Zealand.
The other bidder is a joint venture between Brierley Investments, the New
Zealand investment group, and Maori tribal interests which will receive
NZDollars 190m (USDollars 105m) government support. This group also intends
to float some of Sealord's shares.
CHH's plans to sell Sealord, believed to be worth Dollars 390m, have been
delayed for months because of the court action.

WHITE Martins, a publicly quoted Brazilian chemical company controlled by
Praxair of the US, posted net profits of Dollars 36m for the first seven
months of 1992. Last year the company earned Dollars 33m over the same
period.
Mr Julio Cesar Cassano, director of legal affairs and market relations, said
the group - which controls 70 per cent of the Dollars 650m Brazilian market
for industrial gases - was able to buck a 'negative' trend in Brazil.
He cited cost reductions and increased sales from a plant opened in March to
supply Copene, a petrochemical company in Bahia state.
White Martins recently paid Dollars 13m for a controlling interest in
Fracchia Hermanos, an Argentinian producer of industrial gases, starting
what Mr Cassano called the company's 'strategy for Mercosur', the proposed
common market for Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
By investing Dollars 30m, the group hopes to boost Fracchia Hermanos' share
of the Dollars 100m Argentinian market from 15 per cent to 25 per cent in
five years.

in first quarter

DETERIORATING results in its home market caused Federal Express, the largest
overnight delivery company, to report a 29 per cent profits fall in its
first quarter.
In the three months to end-August, Fedex said it made Dollars 12.25m after
tax, compared with Dollars 17.2m a year earlier. Turnover was Dollars
1.86bn, little changed on last year's Dollars 1.82bn.
The Memphis-based company has been bedevilled by losses on its international
side and has therefore relied on its core domestic operations. It released
the results late on Monday, after stock markets had closed. Yesterday,
trading in its shares was delayed at the outset, and by the close the price
was Dollars 36 7/8 , down Dollars 2 7/8 .
The international business showed an improvement in the first quarter.
Operating losses were down to Dollars 57.1m on revenues of Dollars 523m,
compared with Dollars 98.1m and Dollars 573m a year ago. Fedex said this was
partly due to a Dollars 12.5m reduction in estimated settlement costs from
its previously-announced European restructuring.
However, Fedex said the profitability of domestic op-erations had fallen
'well below last year's level as declines in yields have recently outpaced
our ability to reduce costs'.
Average US domestic revenue per package had fallen 10 per cent year-on-year,
the company said. It blamed the weak economy; discounting of rates; a switch
by customers from next-morning deliveries to cheaper next-afternoon or
two-day deliveries; and a similar growth of high-volume, higher-discount
deliveries versus less-frequent shippers.
Overall, operating profits fell from Dollars 75.2m to Dollars 73.5m.
The company warned that pressure on domestic profit margins would continue
'at least through the second quarter', with results being below previous
expectations. On the international side, it said there should be an
improvement over the Dollars 69.6m loss recorded in the second quarter of
1991.

STATE Government Insurance Corporation, the Perth-based general insurer and
investor, has returned to the black in the year to June, ahead of Western
Australian government plans to float the group to the public.
The corporation, which achieved a high profile in the late 1980s through its
involvement with Western Australian corporate entrepreneurs, turned a
ADollars 4.3m loss into a ADollars 27.1m (USDollars 16.5m) profit for the
year.
The directors said the improvement reflected a 35 per cent rise to ADollars
29.2m in investment income following a reorganisation of the group's
portfolio. They said gross written premiums rose 14 per cent to ADollars
183.3m, reducing the underwriting loss by ADollars 18.8m.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (1): The continent rolls out
the carpet - Big international mining companies are intensifying their
operations in the scale of its untapped mineral reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 200 Canadian and US mining companies are now operating in Latin
America. They have been encouraged to look south by a convergence of two
trends:
The North American mining industry perceives itself to be beleaguered by
increasing government restrictions, regulation and taxation while being
constantly sniped at by a well-funded environmental lobby which is sapping
public support for exploration and mining.
Meanwhile, Latin American countries in recent years have become committed to
financial and trade liberalisation, deregulation, tax reform, increased
direct foreign investment, debt reduction and monetary and fiscal
adjustment. This change in direction has been achieved at a time when
democracy is spreading through the region.
Latin American countries are competing strongly for foreign investment
dollars and technical expertise, are offering the mining industry preferred
tax treatment, security of mineral tenure, government joint ventures and
prompt government response to, and assistance with, development plans and
proposals. Profits, when they are made by the foreign mining investor, can
be repatriated and even capital can be returned - an important consideration
because no mine lasts for ever.
Environmental and safety standards applied in Latin America are comparable
with those in the US and Canada but the permitting process now is very much
quicker. For example, Cambior, a Canadian company, is bringing a big
(250,000 ounces a year) gold mine into production in Guyana in only two
years. Miners claim this would not have been possible in North America.
Then there is the associated cost - between 6 and 10 per cent of the cost of
a new gold mine in North America today goes on environmental review and
permitting. Moreover, companies can often acquire assets in Latin America at
prices equivalent to one-third of those in the US or Canada.
Latin America has a long mining tradition so skilled labour is available but
pay is much lower than in Canada or the US. An experienced miner in the
region earns about Dollars 1 an hour. Add on social benefits of 50 cents and
the total cost to a company is Dollars 1.50 an hour which is roughly one
tenth of the cost of a miner in a comparable job in Canada or the US.
Of course, there are also some drawbacks to mining in Latin America. The
greatest is the political risk.
With few exceptions, the nations of Latin America have a history of
revolution, political overthrow, dictatorship, military rule,
nationalisation of foreign investment, frequent rampant inflation, currency
destruction and extreme poverty for most of their people.
However, a number of Latin American nations have adopted 'Brady Plan'
economics and are working with commercial bank lenders to re-arrange their
outstanding non-performing debt. Serious attempts are being made to balance
budgets. Inflation rates are below 30 per cent and still falling. Tight
money policies are in vogue, tariffs are being reduced, economic
deregulation is current, free trade agreements between neighbouring states
and regional economic integration are making some progress.
Now the debt crisis seems to have passed, Latin America is again attracting
international finance. Last year the international community invested
Dollars 12bn in Latin America, much more than went into eastern Europe
(Dollars 2.3bn) and about half the investment in North America (Dollars
22.2bn).
Nevertheless, the free-market reforms sweeping Latin America remain tenuous,
partly because few of its nations have established sound institutions on
which democracy and a capitalist economy can be firmly built.
Since the begining of this year Venezuela has been shaken by an army
uprising; Peru's President Alberto Fujimori seized dictatorial power;
Bolivia's president Jaime Paz Zamora threatened to close congress; and
President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil faces possible impeachment.
Peru also temporarily pulled out of the Andean Pact, the regional trading
agreement. This might seriously affect its mining industry as metal exports
to other Pact countries will now attract duty.
This sequence of political events must have given those mining companies
already committed to Latin America cause for concern. But what of those
wondering whether to take the plunge?
To attract mining companies, a country or region must have the right type of
geology and a favourable 'enabling' environment - that is infrastructure,
legal systems, official policies and institutional development.
There is no doubt about Latin America's geological potential. Already it
provides about one third of the western world's copper, one third of the
tin, about one quarter of the bauxite (the (raw material for aluminium) and
more than 10 per cent of the gold.
Mining companies at present are searching primarily (in order of preference)
for copper, gold and zinc in Chile; for silver and copper in Mexico; tin,
gold, copper and zinc in Bolivia; copper, zinc and gold in Peru; copper in
Argentina; copper and gold in Panama; nickel and gold in Venezuela and gold
in Costa Rica.
One bonus for the incoming mining companies is that much of Latin America
has not been properly surveyed for mineral wealth so the potential for
bagging an elephant (miner's jargon for finding a really huge mineral
deposit) is much greater than in North America. The most favourable mineral
potential seems to be in an area along the Andes mountains, extending from
northern Peru to the southern tip of South America. There is also the
so-called 'Venezuelan Arch' which extends across Venezuela, Guyana and
Surinam and has considerable base metal and gold potential. And Brazil is
known to have vast reserves of minerals.
As for the 'enabling' environment, governments have been doing their best to
change the rules and regulations to help encourage inward mining investment,
frequently following (with some modifications) a pattern pioneered by Chile.
This allows repatriation of capital and profits with limited restrictions
while total taxes on profits are generally 30 per cent or less. (The
marginal corporation tax rate in Canada is 49 per cent).
Brazil is the outstanding exception because of a clause in its 1988
constitution that prohibits foreign companies from holding majority
interests in mining operations. Since that was enacted, investment by
international mining companies in Brazil has slumped from Dollars 37.5m a
year to Dollars 2.2m.
In some countries road and rail networks are poor, finding enough water can
often be a problem and electricity supplies can be unreliable, particularly
during the present drought which is badly affecting hydro-electricity supply
in the north of the region.
Guerrilla activity is also a fact of life and death in Latin America and
guerrillas with political motives frequently take violent action against
mines to make their point. Security costs can be high.
Individual wildcat miners, or garimpeiros, can also be a threat. They will
often swarm in when a rich deposit is found and can remove a remarkable
tonnage of ore in a very short space of time. They pay no attention to
ownership rights but governments are often reluctant to take action against
garimpeiros, particularly if they are in a remote area.
Nevertheless, in spite of the political and other risks, analysts expect a
steady stream of mining newcomers to arrive in Latin America for some years
to come. North American companies in particular are being driven south by
spiralling environmental and operational costs, high taxes and lack of
exploration incentives at home. Most important of all, good and large-scale
ore bodies have become very difficult to find in Canada and the US.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil bauxite venture to cut
exports by 600,000 tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINERACAO Rio do Norte (MRN), a joint venture led by the state-owned
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), responsible for 70 per cent of Brazil's
bauxite output, will export 600,000 tonnes less this year than it did in
1991.
In 1991, MRN sold 8.1m tonnes of bauxite, of which 5.6m tonnes were
exported. Mr Fabio Matos, president of Aluvale, CVRD's holding company for
the aluminium sector, believes that overall sales will be about 7.5m tonnes
this year, with 5m tonnes of exports. Total Brazilian bauxite production
last year was 10.3m tonnes.
The main reason for the drop in exports is a sharp decline in orders from
Venezuela. Sales to that country are expected to fall from 2m tonnes last
year to 1.1m tonnes this year.
Mr Matos said that the reduction in exports to Venezuela was because of
increased domestic output there. MRN has placed some of the bauxite normally
destined for Venezuela in other markets, notably the former Soviet Union. He
added, however, that 'MRN has never had an aggressive sales policy because
it has always had a captive market - the partners themselves'.
CVRD controls 40 per cent of MRN. The other 60 per cent is divided among
seven companies. Large shares are held by Alcan, the Canadian aluminium
producer, and Alcoa, its American competitor. Those multi-nationals are also
the two leading aluminium producers in Brazil.
The MRN bauxite mine is at Porto de Tombetas, near the northern bank of the
Amazon River. Its capacity is about 8.5m tonnes a year, but this year's
output will be less.
'We are adjusting production to demand,' said Mr Matos. He added that MRN is
also reducing output in order to draw down on high stocks from the beginning
of this year, which totalled 700,000 tonnes. 'Judging from the level of
stocks at MRN, I don't see much capacity for recuperation in the aluminium
market in the short term,' he said.
Meanwhile, he denied reports that the Japanese government would delay its
plans to invest in an aluminium plant because of the political and economic
uncertainty in Brazil. He said that the 31 private partners, who along with
the Japanese government make up a consortium called the Nippon Amazon
Aluminum Company (NAAC), have agreed to resume investment in the Alunorte
project. The plant was 30 per cent finished when construction was halted
seven years ago because the Japanese partners balked at further investment.
Mr Matos said he expected approval from the Japanese government shortly. He
estimated that about Dollars 530m of new investment would be needed.
The 1.1m tonne annual capacity plant will produce alumina, the raw material
for aluminium manufacturing, primarily to supply Albras, an aluminium ingot
producer and another CVRD-NAAC joint venture. Mr Matos said that demand from
Albras would be between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes a year. The plant is
expected to begin operating in mid-1995, reaching full production by the end
of that year.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec under pressure to drive up
oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE was growing from some members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries yesterday for action to drive oil prices up to their
Dollars 21 a barrel target.
Prices have fallen by 15 per cent in real terms in the last two years, Dr
Subroto, secretary general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, told the opening meeting of its Ministerial Monitoring Committee
yesterday.
The weakness of the dollar had pushed real oil prices down by more than 6
percentage points since the last Opec meeting in May, Dr Subroto said in his
report to delegates.
A composite price index taking into account inflation and exchange rate
changes had fallen from a base of 100 in July 1990 to 90.8 in May this year,
and to 84.47 in August.
His comments prompted Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, to
insist that Opec should 'seriously consider' taking action to raise prices
towards the target set in 1990 of Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket of
crudes (equivalent to about Dollars 23 a barrel for Brent crude). The price
stood at Dollars 19.64 as the meeting began yesterday.
Delegates said Mr Aghazadeh was strongly supported by other members,
including Libya, Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.
They said there was widespread agreement among members that prices had to
rise, in spite of indications from the Saudi Arabian and United Arab
Emirates' oil ministers, as they arrived at the meeting, that they were
happy with present prices.
Most analysts, however, were still expecting Opec to reach an agreement that
would allow its members, except Kuwait, to continue pumping at present
levels. Kuwait would be allowed to continue to raise production during the
rebuilding of its oil industry after the Gulf war. Such an agreement would
imply total Opec production in the fourth quarter of between 24.5m and 24.7m
barrels a day.
With demand for Opec oil - including production and stocks - forecast at
about 25.7m b/d by the International Energy Agency, Opec believed supply
would be sufficiently tight to push prices up to Dollars 21 by the end of
the year - or higher if the winter is unusually cold.
Opec is thought likely to roll over its third-quarter production ceiling of
22.98m with special dispensation for Kuwait, or to adopt a more 'meaningful'
quota of around 24.5m b/d.
Dr Subroto said Opec's estimate of demand for its oil was slightly lower
than the IEA's, at 25.1m b/d. 'It is up to the ministers to decide what the
production level should be,' he added.
Ministers met for about three hours yesterday morning before spending the
afternoon in bilateral meetings. They are to meet again this morning for
what some delegates suggested could be the final session.

COCOA prices soared in London as heavy short covering was prompted by
sterling's slump. The New York cocoa market was also well ahead by midday on
sentiment that International Cocoa Organisation talks in London might result
in Russia purchasing the ICCO's 235,000-tonne buffer stock. European bullion
prices rose against the background of turmoil in the foreign exchanges. GOLD
closed just over Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 349.40 a troy ounce in London.
It has now risen almost Dollars 10 this week. With the foreign exchanges
expected to remain uncertain and volatile until Sunday's French referendum
on Maastricht, bullion's downside appears limited. On Comex the December
gold contract had risen above key resistance at Dollars 351 an ounce for the
third time by midday. The currency market turmoil led to thin trading on the
LME and widely fluctuating base metal prices, dealers said. The currency
factor was highlighted by the three-month COPPER price, which at the end of
the afternoon kerb showed a Pounds 43 a tonne rise but a Dollars 13 fall
from Tuesday. Dealers said the overall strength of the dollar was the main
factor discouraging consumer interest.

UP TO Dollars 200m in public loans has been rescheduled as the core of a
package of measures announced by the Brazilian government in an effort to
alleviate pressure on coffee producers, who are suffering from record low
international prices, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
The package awaits technical approval by the National Monetary Council,
expected by the end of the month.
Under the plan, producers whose public sector loans came due by April will
have their debts rescheduled over five years, with a two-year grace period.
Loans due after April will be awarded six-month extensions if prices fall
below 85 per cent of a referential price of between Dollars 65 and Dollars

Federal officials rejected a minimum price guarantee scheme defended by,
among others, officials in Sao Paulo, a leading coffee growing state.

<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM exports from the CIS are expected to run at last year's level of
843,000 tonnes - but, depending on movements in the world price, might
exceed this figure by 100,000 tonnes.
Ivan Prokopov, president of the Russian state-owned aluminium concern
covering smelters and refineries in Russia and the CIS, said the concern
would 'be selling as much (aluminium) abroad as necessary for us to buy raw
materials, equipment and spare parts'.
At an aluminium conference in St Petersburg on Wednesday, Mr Prokopov denied
Russian responsibility for a decline in aluminium prices, which the West
attributes to a sharp increase in Russian exports. He blamed cheap aluminium
from Brazil, Venezuela, Australia and Canada.
However, Mr Prokopov admitted that independent CIS traders had contributed
to the price fall.
Mr A Stephens Hutcraft jnr, president of Kaiser Aluminium, said the western
aluminium industry could barely operate at the current level of world
prices. He said that world prices now stood at Dollars 1,300 a tonne.
'The unexpected export of 900,000 tonnes from Russia (in 1991) caused prices
to drop by around Dollars 450 a tonne as the year progressed,' he said. He
said tariffs and dumping claims were not an answer to this 'new reality' and
called for inter-government talks.
According to Mr Hodgcraft, the West will have to accommodate Russian exports
of primary and scrap aluminium - 'and it means we in the West must balance
supply with demand while assuming for the near term an annual range of
500,000 - 750,000 tonnes exported from Russia'
The industry had lost 'something close to Dollars 7bn' in 1991 because it
did not accommodate the pressures.
Mr Valery Gazman, the deputy director of the International Fund for
Privatisation and Foreign Investment in Russia, hoped Russian exports would
become controlled once the new system of exporting strategic materials was
enforced.
Under this system, 13 organisations were granted the right to export
aluminium from September 1.
Mr Gazman also said the Russian government wanted a reduction of export
tariffs for aluminium, from ECUs 200 - 75 a tonne.
Mr Prokopov said that after a decline in production of aluminium in the CIS
last year, this year's output would stay on the 1991 level of 3.25m tonnes -
85 per cent of that produced in Russia.
He said that domestic demand could be increased by 15 to 20 per cent from
2.3 - 2.4m tonnes.

<TEXT>
ASARCO, the US metals producer, has renewed efforts to secure a minority
share in Poland's KGHM copper mining and smelting combine amid new signs of
labour unrest there.
Yesterday unions at KGHM called a 24-hour strike for September 23 after
KGHM's new management refused to meet for pay talks in the wake of a
six-week long strike suspended last month. They have threatened to resume
their strike on October 6.
The strikers suspended the action last month after being told that increases
would be made once new legislation easing wage controls had been passed by
parliament.
The legislation has since been delayed and yesterday KGHM's management
promised an interim pay settlement by the end of this month 'in accordance
with the company's financial possibilities'.
Meanwhile Mr Robert Muth, an Asarco vice-president, has been meeting
government officials in Warsaw this week. Asarco first signalled its plan
last May.
Mr Muth had planned to talk to the KGHM management, but it did not want to
see him while it is wrestling with the labour troubles.
Asarco is pressing the Polish government to grant them a three year
management contract for KGHM.
A draft agreement being discussed with the Poles would give Asarco six
months to negotiate the purchase of a minority share in KGHM after the
expiry of the management contract.
The Poles would be bound to retain state control of the combine while KGHM
was being managed by Asarco which pledges to maintain the present level of
output unless instructed otherwise by the Polish government.
During the management period, Asarco would work on a long-term strategy for
KGHM which would form the basis of its investment offer.
It also proposes to work towards enhancing KGHM's market value as well as
working towards 'international environmental, pay and work safety
standards'.
The Western Mining Corporation from Australia has also expressed a strong
interest in investing in KGHM. KGHM produced 229,000 tonnes of refined
copper in the first seven months of this year or 3.1 per cent more than in
the same period last year.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil and PTT to trade
jointly in south east Asia

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, and PTT of Thailand, Thailand's
state oil company, have agreed to trade crude oil products jointly in south
east Asia from October, initially for one year.
Mrs Berit Oeyen, a spokeswoman for Statoil, said the agreement to trade
crude oil products on an inter-regional and regional basis strengthened its
foothold in the South East Asian markets and provided a good basis for the
expansion of trading activities established in Singapore earlier this year.
Statoil will provide on-the-job training in crude oil products trading for
PTT employees. The deal also includes a sales agreement in which Statoil
will supply 'large volumes' of refined crude oil products to PTT.
PTT is the largest importer in South East Asia of refined products and has a
25 per cent share of Thailand's downstream market. About 70 per cent of the
country's oil consumption is met by imports. Last year, consumption was
estimated at about 500,000 barrels a day, although Statoil believes it may
be higher.
Statoil has crude oil access of about 1.2m barrels a day from the North Sea,
European refining capacity of 200,000 barrels of oil a day and is the
largest net exporter of North Sea quality crude oil. Norway is the world's
fourth biggest net exporter of crude oil.
In addition, Statoil has hired refining capacity elsewhere in the world to
meet the demand of refined products contracts.
Under the terms of the agreement, Statoil will be required to maintain
storage capacity in Singapore to guarantee supply to PTT. To this end,
Statoil has agreed to hire storage capacity from Oil Tanking, a subsidiary
of UK-based Mabanaft.
The company is also negotiating refinery arrangements and expects to buy
crude oil from the Middle East and South East Asia for refining.
Mrs Oeyen said another purpose of the agreement was to expand co-operation
further with PTT. Statoil has a 10 per cent stake in the Bongkot gas field
in the Thai gulf.
The field, operated by Total-CFP, is scheduled to come on-stream in June
1993.

FT  17 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strength in the US dollar and thus in the Australian dollar has meant that
buyers in other currencies effectively pay more for wool auctioned in
Australia. The market there held firm at first but yesterday eased a little.
The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator which closed at 548 cents
a kilogram last week, rose to 550 on September 15 and fell back to 542 cents
on September 16. Higher United Kingdom interest rates are of serious concern
directly to the industry and indirectly if reduced or delayed consumer
expenditure on textiles results.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK business fears another blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial and Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING British industrialists reacted with dismay to yesterday's rise in
interest rates and expressed fears that if it turned out to be more than a
temporary measure it would deal a further blow to consumer demand and deepen
the recession.
Before last night's suspension of sterling within the European exchange rate
mechanism and the cancellation of the second - 3-point - rise yesterday in
interest rates, most reluctantly accepted that the government had had little
choice but to act as it did. 'We need 15 per cent interest rates like we
need a hole in the head,' said Sir Michael Angus, president of the
Confederation of British Industry. 'But if it is a choice between that and
devaluation, then I suppose it will have to be'.
Some businessmen had feared continued pressure on sterling could make
devaluation inevitable. A small minority, led by Sir Owen Green, chairman of
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, argued that sterling should be taken out
of the ERM entirely.
'These are war conditions. We have to know what we are fighting for. Is it a
British pound or a D-Mark pound?' Sir Owen said. 'If we start to devalue,
all the precedents say we don't know what the rate should be. If we float,
we know what the real value is for the British pound and call up the
troops'.
For most businesses, however, the most pressing concern was the outlook for
demand. Some industry spokesmen argued that, almost regardless of what
happened next, yesterday's events had inflicted a devastating blow to
consumer demand.
'People will no longer be buying as of now. They will be stopped in their
tracks', said Mr Neil Marshall, economist at the Retail Motor Industry
Federation. He also warned that another round of business bankruptcies was
inevitable.
Others argued that much would depend on how long interest rates remained at
crisis levels, and whether they were passed through into mortgage rates.
Several believed that it would be politically and economically impossible
for the government hold current interest rates for more than a few weeks.
Several companies yesterday called on the government to take steps to revive
the economy. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said action was
needed to help the construction industry.
Mortgage lenders were aghast at the prospect of an unprecedentedly sharp
increase in interest rates, but said the market was in such disarray that no
decision about a new rate could be taken before next week.
There were widespread fears, however, that any tentative recovery in the
housing market had been killed.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth
largest building society, summed up the general view: 'There is such turmoil
going on that we cannot take any sensible view about the short, medium or
longer term. This is potentially bad news for borrowers but when and to what
extent one cannot yet foresee'.
The rise in interest rates is especially painful for lenders since it comes
at the lowest point in the fortunes of the housing market. 'The mortgage
market has been virtually dead all this month even before this,' said the
chief executive of one of the five largest building societies.
Mr Michael Jones, president of the National Association of Estate Agents,
said the increases would kill stone dead an already faltering housing
market. Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, the
seventh largest building society, said repossessions could rise dramatically
if rates rose further.
If these borrowers are evicted, the market could be even further depressed
by a flood of repossessed houses. The Association of British Insurers said
that widespread increases in mortgage rates could mean that insurance
companies which have provided mortgage indemnity policies could face further
huge losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled Canadian property developer, yesterday said it
had agreed to sell a 34-storey building in Park Avenue to the New York-based
Mutual of Am-erica Life Insurance Company.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Mutual is believed to be
paying more than Dollars 100m for the building.
Mutual said the company plans to invest about Dollars 70m in an extensive
renovation of the property. This could create about 1,000 construction jobs
in New York.
O&amp;Y is likely to use the proceeds of the sale to pay off a series of
outstanding bank mortgages on the property; these are believed to total
about Dollars 100m.
'We are not assuming any mortgages that O&amp;Y had on the building,' said Mr
Thomas Moran, the president and chief operating officer of Mutual.
Mr Moran said Mutual, which has total assets of more than Dollars 6.2bn,
plans to use the building as its new headquarters and to move in by 1995.
'We will use about one third of the building and lease out the rest,' Mr
Moran said.
The building, located near the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, was previously the
world headquarters of ITT, the US financial, industrial and travel
conglomerate. It has remained vacant for the past 18 months.
The building consists of 664,000 sq ft and requires much work to remove
asbestos and make a number of repairs.

warning

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMDAHL'S stock price plunged yesterday after the computer manufacturer
warned that it expects to report an operating loss for the current third
quarter.
Amdahl, which manufactures IBM-compatible mainframe computers, said there
had been an unexpected fall in demand for its latest models.
The company's stock lost one third of its value to trade at Dollars 9 7/8 at
the close, down from a Monday close of Dollars 15. Concerns about the
outlook for mainframe computer sales also dragged IBM's share price down to
Dollars 85 1/2 from Dollars 88 3/8 .
Amdahl expects third-quarter losses of 10 cents to 20 cents per share, but
notes that because a large number of shipments typically occur late in the
quarter, it is not possible to give a precise forecast.
The company anticipates that revenues will fall below the second-quarter
level of Dollars 693m, when Amdahl benefited from strong demand for
mainframe products introduced earlier in the year.
'We are witnessing a deferral of customer buying decisions because of tough
economic times,' said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive.
'Although some improvement in revenues and margins is expected to return us
to profitability in the fourth quarter, we do not anticipate substantial
growth until these economic fundamentals change.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Steel urges broader
powers for UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING the United Nations as a supranational authority able to intervene
in countries' internal affairs was the way to tackle the global problems
that had arisen since the end of the Cold War, Sir David Steel, the party's
former leader, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
Had the party's proposal for a permanent UN peacekeeping force been adopted,
he said, the organisation could have been more effective in its efforts in
the former Yugoslavia.
'We need less firefighting and more fire prevention,' he said, referring to
yesterday's announcement of an additional troop deployment for Bosnia.
Sir David said the UN should be able to levy richer nations to put resources
into achieving a sustainable environment. It should also be able to
intervene in governments' affairs when it found brutality and gross
violations of the human rights of minorities.
Sir David said: 'International statesmen must come to their senses and
recognise that our only hope is to use all our expertise in new technology
and communications to create a healthier world, for it is now a practical
possibility to achieve that - given the necessary political will.'
He contrasted the Liberal Democrats' readiness to consider such
international moves with 'the parochialism of both Labour and the Tories'.
He accused Mr John Major of relinquishing his responsibilities as leader of
the EC council of ministers in refusing to take part in a French television
debate on the Maastricht treaty.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Ashdown moderates stance
on referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN'S calls for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty on closer
European union have come under strong attack from within his own party,
forcing the Liberal Democrat leader to tone down his advocacy of the idea.
Senior party officials said that a rebellion against Mr Ashdown's stance
among Lib Dem MPs had forced the leader to agree not to promote the demand
as party policy.
At what some officials described as an acrimonious meeting of the 20 MPs, an
informal deal was struck allowing Mr Ashdown to continue to voice support
for a referendum when pressed on the issue but constraining him from
actively campaigning for one.
It is understood that more than half-a-dozen of the party's MPs - including
Sir David Steel, the foreign affairs spokesman, have said that they would
not back a plebiscite in any debate in the House of Commons.
Mr Ashdown believes the constitutional implications of Maastricht - with its
commitment to monetary union and shared decision-making on defence and
foreign policy issues - merit a popular vote.
The Liberal Democrat leader has also argued privately that a referendum in
which his party was campaigning alongside Labour politicians for a Yes vote
would enhance the prospect of wider co-operation between the two opposition
parties, similar to the 1975 referendum on British membership of the EC.
But even some of those MPs who back a referendum caution that party
activists might well refuse to mount joint campaigns with Labour.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Local co-operation to
oust Tories proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OPERATION at local level between Labour and Liberal Democrats was
envisaged as the way forward for the centre-left by two MPs yesterday.
But, as the Liberal Democrats prepared to debate party strategy today, there
were clear signs that they were still deeply divided.
The conference organisers have devised a 'purist' amendment effectively
ruling out formal dialogue on electoral pacts with any other party. The
party leadership last night made clear it would oppose the amendment.
At a packed fringe meeting Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, and Sir
David Steel, former Liberal Democrat leader, discussed how much the parties
had in common and spoke of using local agreements between the parties to
defeat the Conservatives.
If Labour came to its senses it would realise that there was little point in
forcing constituency Labour parties to put up candidates in Tory-Lib Dem
marginals, Sir David said.
He was unrepentant about the fact that such an arrangement would be a
'one-way bargain' and said that the prize for Labour would be the greater
chance of the creation of an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons.
'Without that, we will always be caricatured as the patsies who are going to
put Labour into government, and that doesn't do us any good.'
Mr Field highlighted the difference in attitude between Liberal Democrat
voters and party activists.
He said that formal pacts would not work because about half Liberal Democrat
voters disliked Labour more than the Tories, but said that as a joint agenda
developed co-operation would emerge 'because Labour activists and Liberal
Democrat activists believe they have some genuine common purpose to achieve
by defeating the incumbent Tory'.
Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the first president of the former Social
Democratic party, also called for co-operation between parties. If the past
three elections showed anything, he said, 'they show that neither the
Liberal Democrats nor Labour can beat the Conservatives on their own.'
Co-operation on individual policy issues such as freedom of information
where the parties agreed was put forward at another meeting by Ms Mo Mowlam,
a member of Labour's shadow cabinet.
She called for an end to the 'farce' of opposition 'where absolutely
everything they do is silly and everything we do is right.' The Labour
leadership has maintained an official silence on the question of pacts but
is said to be sympathetic to Ms Mowlam's approach.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Privatisation row looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFERENCE delegates will be asked this morning to approve a consultation
paper on competition and regulation entitled After Privatisation. It would
be much easier for the party leadership if the debate were indeed taking
place after privatisation.
Proposals for curbing the 'excessive prices and profits' of privatised
utilities, of breaking up the monoliths of British Telecommunications and
British Gas into regional companies, and of tightening regulation and
improving the services to the consumer are already party policy.
But in a week when the delegates have registered unease at the leadership's
fascination with the market, today's discussion could end in rejection of
the motion's invitation to welcome the creation of a company to franchise
rail services and stations, and the gradual reduction of the level at which
the Post Office operates its letter monopoly.
Persuading the party to come to terms with prospective privatisations is the
task of Mr Malcolm Bruce, the trade and industry spokesman. He said: 'We are
uniquely seeking to strike the balance between free enterprise and public
services and social justice.'
For the Liberal Democrats, as for the government, the most difficult
privatisation is that of British Rail.
Mr Bruce emphasised that if it were in government the party would want to
increase rail services by allowing the private sector to compete to run
services, rather than envisage the full-scale privatisation the Tories
intend.
The consultation paper itself goes further, however, in looking towards the
sale and franchising of rail stations, and even - in the future - the sale
of some or all of the four existing BR business sectors, such as InterCity.
The party leadership sees the privatised utilities as an opportunity to
launch a vigorous and distinctive attack on the government over the
operation of the market and the promotion of fair competition.
Signs this week are that is an opportunity the party membership is prepared
to miss.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Kennedy looks beyond
pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHARLES Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday urged
party activists to cut through theoretical debates about deals with the
Labour party and instead confront the threat of permanent Conservative
entrenchment in government.
Mr Kennedy sought to defuse the tensions which have built up among delegates
over the potential for pacts with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
He called on Liberal Democrats to devote their energies to building an
'intellectual framework which challenges the Tories' appeal to
self-interest, but not in the same patronising or paternalistic way'.
Mr Kennedy, who favours keeping open the door to co-operation with Labour at
some stage in the present parliament, said that the task for the party in
Harrogate was 'not to try and tie our feet in ribbons about hypothetical,
undeliverable political pacts'.
It had instead to consider whether the first-past-the-post electoral system,
reinforced by demographic trends and prospective changes in constituency
boundaries, pointed to an era of 'entrenched Conservative hegemony'.
Against that background the Liberal Democrats should seek to become a
'catalyst' for reform in British politics.
The party should focus its efforts now on honing a distinctive political
appeal which recognised 'the primacy of the individual within the context of
a community of shared values'.
It should appeal to the individual drive for self-improvement but also
explain the need for shared values.
Mr Kennedy also underlined the concern among the party's leadership that a
conference debate which is scheduled for today on the Liberal Democrats'
future electoral strategy should not close the door to co-operation with
other opposition parties.
Stressing the potential which existed to reshape the opposition to the
Conservative government, he concluded that as a catalyst for such a process
the party could - as in the chemical process - change the political
landscape without losing its basic form, properties or identity.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: The Power behind the clubs - Garry Booth talks to the
new owner of the Jazz Cafe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Powerhaus and Mean Fiddler - both descriptions have been applied to Vincent
Power in his short time as London's leading rock impresario. They are, in
fact, names of two of his clubs and one-third of the formidable Mean Fiddler
Organisation. Power house he is. The stubbly and artfully dishevelled
45-year-old Irishman established the North West London honky tonk which
heads the organisation exactly ten years ago. Two weeks ago he added
Camden's Jazz Cafe, bought from the receivers, to a music empire which now
turns over Pounds 6m a year - not counting his hugely successful open air
festivals which add Pounds 3m a year.
A visitor to London interested in contemporary music would be hard pushed
not to visit one of the 15 bands playing Power's five (and now six) clubs on
any given night of the week. He publishes a 24pp magazine, Feedback, which
lists and reviews the gigs he stages, from bluesman Albert Collins to
college circuit heroes Kitchens of Distinction, via hideous noise merchants
with names like Bum or Headbirth.
Power had been 15 years in the furniture business when he bought his first
nightclub in North West London's Harlesden from boxer Terry Downes for
Pounds 250,000. He turned it into the sort of good ol' boys' country honky
tonk he liked and spent thousands booking his favourite C&amp;W acts. 'I was
pigheaded, I ran it how I wanted to and I lost a fortune. The venue was
right and the staff were great. I realised in time it was my booking policy
that was sending it down.'
By making a shift sideways to more fashionable Tex Mex and blues, the Mean
Fiddler was established as a popular and profitable medium-sized venue. By
1987 it was full every night and Power was looking for a new outlet. He
found it in the heart of hip Islington, opposite the refurbished Angel tube.
The Pied Bull, a dilapidated pub with a room on the end of it, as Power
describes it, was already known for its militant lesbian nights, free jazz
extemporisations and sticky carpet. At a total cost of Pounds 275,000, Power
bought it from the brewery owner, put in a stage and lavatories, and
extended capacity to accommodate the city's enthusiastic 'thrash' rock
aficionados. Renamed the Powerhaus, the club now serves as a springboard for
indie outfits (amateurish but fashionable young groups without big
contracts).
Power had refined the art of booking: 'You must have iron costings,' he
says, 'and although we still pay bands too much and then not enough people
turn up, those occasions are rarer.' His 'iron costings' have led to discord
with the Musician's Union, who object to what they perceive as a 'pay to
play' scheme for young hopefuls. Power saysthe MU is unrealistic: 'We charge
for the pa and we charge for an engineer, as an incentive. If the band draws
more than 50 we will refund that fee.
'The MU does nothing to help young bands; it doesn't understand that a gig
is impossible to put on without the equipment and there must be an incentive
to keep out the timewasters.'
After a year in the Powerhaus, its expansive owner was ready to buy again,
this time in North Kensington, under the Westway motorway. The North
Kensington Amenity Trust had been set up in the 1960s to operate the
commercial spaces created by the building of the new road to Oxford. One of
these was a dance hall called the Acklam Hall. Dogged by its reputation as a
narcotics cash and carry, Westminster wanted rid of the place. 'I bought
with a view to turning the place around quickly and ended up shutting it for
a year, tearing it down to the ground and spending Pounds 0.75m on a
rebuild,' says Power smiling.
Subterania opened late in 1988 amid controversy over admittance and a tough
stance on security: 'We had to make it clear to one or two of the local lads
that things had changed,' Power explains in a soft Dublin brogue.
Undeterred by the hidden problems encountered in Ladbroke Grove, Power went
on the acquisition trail again, this time south of the river. In late 1989,
at the peak of the property boom, he spent Pounds 1.2m on acquiring and
refurbishing a Grade 2 listed music hall in Clapham, The Grand. The biggest,
most comfortable of his clubs, it turned out to be the riskiest of his
ventures to date: 'I didn't realise there would be such opposition from
local residents'. It took an appeal to the High Court to award him a music
and dance licence, with the club dark for a year.
The Grand opened at the close of 1991, downstairs only, until 11 pm, with
tough caveats on parking. 'It is the best music venue in London - but I
think Wandsworth would have preferred a Lloyd Weber production,' Power says
coolly.
Sitting at a dining table on the balcony of London's brightest but
shortlived jazz venue, the Jazz Cafe, 'I'll enjoy the challenge of turning
this place around', he says.
Power reflects on the work to be done. He is flushed with the success of his
'Fleadh', the annual Gaelic-flavoured music festival held in Finsbury Park,
and last month's Madness reunion gig in the same place which attracted
66,000 fans during two days.

concerns that the markets and dealers are being blamed for the inability of
the UK government to reduce interest rates.
The Bank of England has been approached to join the Corporation of London
and leading banks in making a public statement that unrestricted flows of
capital in foreign exchange markets are positive for the economy.
'Politicians are representing the free markets as a bad thing', said an
executive involved in the discussions. 'We fear that the general public
blames the City for the country's economic problems.' The mood among City
dealers and executives over the past few weeks of sharp fluctuations in
currency markets - prompting huge rises in interest rates in Italy and
Sweden - has become very defensive.
There are widespread fears that the exchange volatility and the government's
inability to cut interest rates could lead to pressure for new regulations
to be introduced into foreign exchange markets.
City institutions want to make it clear it is not their fault that sterling
is under pressure. However, they are unclear how to say this without by
implication blaming the government, which they are reluctant to do.
The Bank of England has not decided whether it will get involved in making
any such defence of free markets.
City institutions are also organising a related campaign to reassert the
strength of Europe's financial markets. They fear that international
financial institutions may reduce their investments in Europe if the French
vote against the Maastricht agreement on Sunday.
The Corporation of London and UK banks want to stress the City will stay one
of the world's three most important financial centres, whatever the vote.

FT  16 SEP 92 / OFT to rule soon on perfume trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading yesterday confirmed that its response to
complaints about restrictive distribution arrangements in the perfume
industry was 'imminent'.
'It is one of a number of subjects which are going up to Sir Bryan
(Carsberg) pretty soon and you may have noticed he arrives at decisions
fairly snappily,' the OFT said, referring to its newly-appointed director
general.
The Superdrug chain, run by the Kingfisher group, lodged a complaint with UK
and European Commission competition authorities earlier this year after
several leading perfume companies refused to supply the pharmacy chain.
The European Commission said the matter did not fall within its remit. If
there is sufficient evidence, the OFT may recommend an investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Superdrug said the perfume companies had refused supply agreements because
they did not want the retail price of perfumes to be heavily discounted. The
perfumers said they would not supply Superdrug because its stores were not
suitable for selling high-class perfumes.
In spite of the ban Superdrug is selling a wide range of top-name perfumes
at discounts of up to 30 per cent at 14 of its 668 stores.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher corporate affairs director, said Superdrug
was obtaining the perfumes - perfectly legally - from the 'grey market' in
Europe and elsewhere.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, has been reprimanded by the Advertising Standards
Authority about price claims after complaints from a village shop which said
its prices were lower.
B&amp;Q's spring 1992 catalogue said it used its buying power to make bulk
purchases and pass savings on to customers with lower prices. The ASA ruled
that: 'While a price promise was a useful protection to customers, it did
not necessarily mean that the claim to offer lower prices through
bulk-buying power was accurate.'

with next month's Conservative conference took a fresh turn.
In a letter to Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent, the Tory

should exploit the 'publicity-seeking antics of an extreme,

He said neither Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen nor Ms Alessandra Mussolini was

<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday offered to freeze the temporary suspension
of 40 prison officers announced on Monday as a conciliatory gesture towards
resolving their industrial dispute. However, its efforts were blocked when
two of the biggest officers' unions, the UFAP and Force Ouvriere, refused to
attend a morning negotiating meeting.
Despite the government's efforts, staff at most of France's 182 jails stayed
out on strike yesterday. There were ugly scenes as riot police tried to
restore order, sometimes clashing with picketing officers as well as
inmates. The strike, which follows after a similar stoppage last month, was
sparked by last Friday's murder of a warder at Clairvaux prison, when seven
inmates tried to shoot their way out of the jail.
Squads of security vans arrived at Clairvaux throughout the morning to move
100 of its 220 inmates. Clairvaux is one of France's maximum security
prisons, but staff have refused to return to work until the prison has been
thoroughly searched after Friday's shooting.
Warders at Baumettes have also demanded that their jail be searched before
they return to work. The warden's death was the latest in a series of
violent incidents, which have included attacks on staff and dramatic
helicopter snatches of inmates from prison roofs.
The prison officers are demanding more staff and improved facilities,
including the reintroduction of the top security wings recently phased out
by France's Socialist government. The justice ministry has promised to
review the whole prison system and to table legislation to improve financial
compensation for officers' dependents.
The French airline pilots' unions have called out their members on a 24-hour
strike today in protest at proposed changes to their working arrangements.
The pilots' union criticised the European Commission by claiming that it was
tabling changes which would involve more flying hours and shorter rest
periods for French pilots.

<TEXT>
THE Netherlands boasted yesterday that it was one of the few countries
managing to put its state finances in order despite the international
slowdown in economic growth, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Unveiling its budget for 1993, the centre-left government of Prime Minister
Ruud Lubbers said that the state's financing deficit was expected to fall to
3.75 per cent of net national income - or about 3.4 per cent of gross
domestic product - ' from an expected 4.25 per cent in 1992. This puts the
Dutch government on target for meeting the deficit-cutting goals formulated
when it took office in late 1989.
In absolute terms, the total financing deficit for 1993 is projected at Fl
47.4bn (Pounds 15bn), down only slightly from Fl 47.9bn in 1992.
However, in terms of net national income, the decline is larger because the
Central Planning Office yesterday forecast that GDP would rise by 2.25 per
cent next year compared with 1.75 per cent in 1992.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Russia risks UN clash over Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council's post cold war unity appeared at risk last night
over the issue of former Yugoslavia's continued membership in the general
assembly.
Under the rules, the 15-member council may recommend to the larger body the
exclusion of a member state and the western powers have signalled their wish
to follow that course in the Yugoslav case.
But Russia is adamantly opposed to any move that would adversely affect the
Belgrade government's UN rights - raising the possibility that a western
resolution to this effect might be vetoed. This would be a rare event in the
changed political climate in the security council.
A new session of the general assembly, the 47th, opened yesterday and the
credentials of what now is called 'the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro)' could be challenged by a committee set up routinely
to examine the credentials of all of the member states. It was a similar
committee's recommendation that brought about the exclusion of South Africa
from the general assembly in 1974.
South Africa remains a UN member but cannot participate in most UN work.
While the EC foreign ministers, meeting in London last weekend, agreed to
try to block the Belgrade government's claim to be the automatic UN
successor to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a founding
member, several Moslem states also backed the effort.
Russian objections are somewhat ironic given the fact that Moscow managed to
retain its permanent security council seat last December following the
Soviet break-up.
Mr Yuli Vorontsov, then the Soviet ambassador and now the UN representative
of the Russian Federation, was the council president at the time and was
widely credited with diplomatic sleight of hand.
Although a draft paper being circulated by Britain, France and Belgium, with
US and Austrian support, would recommend that the general assembly deny
Belgrade's claim to continue automatically former Yugoslavia's membership,
and exclude its participation in the work of UN bodies, some western
diplomats questioned last night whether the issue would be pressed to a
vote.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Pound falls to new low in ERM: UK interest rates threatened
as weaker European currencies come under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERVENTION by the Bank of England to buy sterling for D-Marks yesterday
failed to prevent the pound hitting a new low against the German currency in
the European exchange rate mechanism.
As UK pension funds and other large investors switched money out of pounds
into D-Marks in nervous trading, expectations rose that the UK government
might be forced soon into an economically damaging increase in interest
rates to prevent the pound breaching its ERM limit.
Investors were also worried by the news that Mr John Major, the prime
minister, had abandoned a planned trip to Spain, apparently to turn his
attention to the UK's economic problems.
The fresh turbulence in the ERM seriously unsettled other weak currencies
including the lira and the peseta. It came in spite of Monday's cut in
interest rates in Germany and the 7 per cent devaluation of the lira.
The pound's difficulties could be worsened if Sunday's French referendum on
the Maastricht treaty delivers a No vote to European economic and monetary
union. This could prompt further selling of the more fragile currencies in
the system in favour of the D-Mark and further damage investor confidence in
the ERM.
The pound closed against the D-Mark in London last night at DM2.78, 3 1/4
pfennigs down on the day and at the lowest level since Britain joined the
ERM 23 months ago. At this point it is just one fifth of a pfennig above its
DM2.778 floor, at which government action is required through either large
intervention to buy pounds or an increase in base rates, now 10 per cent.
The impact of the pound's woes spilled over into share and bond markets,
which lost virtually all the gains made on Monday after news of the first
cut in German borrowing rates in five years.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE index of leading shares closed down
52.1 at 2,370.0, and UK gilts ended a point lower. The purchase of pounds by
the Bank of England was thought to be relatively modest. It came amid
extreme investor nervousness about the prospects for sterling.
On the sterling money market, the three-month interbank rate, an important
indicator of where the market thinks base rates are moving, closed at about
10 3/4 per cent,  1/2 a percentage point up from the previous close.
The lira, which had strengthened on Monday after the weekend devaluation
announcement, fell nearly 2 1/2 per cent yesterday against the D-Mark,
breaching its central ERM rate. It bottomed out during the day at L811 to
the D-Mark, before rising to close in London at L805.8. The lira's decline
was closely followed by the peseta, which fell through the central ERM rate
of Pta65 against the D-Mark, which the Bank of Spain has been defending for
months. The dollar held steady in London at DM1.4855 and edged higher later
in New York.
Selling of financial assets was not confined to the UK, as investors
elsewhere in Europe and in the US inclined to the view that the reductions
in German interest rates and the lira's devaluation were unlikely to provide
more than a modest boost to the European economy.
The Paris and Milan bourses closed down 2 per cent and 1.3 per cent
respectively, while government bonds in several countries were marked lower.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.9 lower at
3,327.92.
Tokyo brokers said weak overseas markets were partly responsible for a fall
in stocks in early trading this morning. After an hour the 225-share Nikkei
average was down 379.37 points at 18,092.03

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (12): Farmers are worried - Fierce debate
within agricultural community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, visited Wales earlier this month and
spent some time on a hill farm discussing the state of the agricultural
industry.
Far from winning praise for his initiative, however, Mr Major was accused by
some Welsh farmers of avoiding hearing about the near-bankrupt state of the
industry by visiting an unrepresentative model farm of more than 600 acres,
and not a more typical Welsh hill farm of 40 to 150 acres.
This sour reaction is a measure of the extent to which Welsh farmers these
days feel under siege. It is not only because of the recession, though that
is bad enough. Farm incomes last year, while marginally higher than 1990
were still 25 per cent down on 1989 levels.
In some sectors, most notably hill farming, which accounts for some 80 per
cent of Wales's land area, average incomes fell by 60 per cent to Pounds 144
a week, 56 per cent of the average industrial wage.
But Welsh farmers are also becoming deeply concerned about their longer-term
future.
Put crudely, do they have one in a Europe now more than self-sufficient in
food and determined to dismantle the marketing structures which have
supported agriculture for half-a century and more?
The consequences of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package, agreed by
EC Farm Ministers earlier this year, are still not clear, but from Welsh
agriculture's point of view, the signs are not encouraging. The
long-standing threat of a Uruguay Round GATT agreement being concluded at
the expense of agricultural areas, such as Wales, remains, as does the
planned winding up of the statutory Milk Marketing Board (MMB), and its
replacement by a voluntary co-operative.
It will bring to an end a statutory marketing scheme which has been the
financial backbone of many Welsh farms for over half a century.
If this were not enough, many west Wales farmers are suddenly faced with
losses from a totally unexpected direction - the collapse into bankruptcy of
King Thomas, Lloyd Jones, a leading firm of livestock auctioneers in south
west Wales.
The potential impact of CAP reform has been the subject of fierce debate
within Wales's agricultural community. This is because the Farmers' Union of
Wales supported the principles for reform originally adopted by Mr Raymond
MacSharry, the EC Commissioner for Agriculture, whereas the National
Farmers' Union supported the Government's campaign of opposition.
The FUW argued that MacSharry's fundamental aim of targeting EC support to
those who need it most, allied with a more effective environmental support
programme and more liberal social support measures, was the right approach.
It could give the majority of farmers in Wales stability and a new sense of
direction,' said Mr Bob Parry, the FUW President.
The National Farmers' Union, on the other hand went along with Mr John
Selwyn Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture's argument that the EC
Commissioner's proposals would simply subsidise inefficient small producers,
many of them in southern Europe, at the expense of the more productive and
efficient farming enterprises in Britain.
In the event, the re-election of a Conservative Government to Westminster,
and the return of Mr Gummer to Brussels, meant the shape of the reform
package finally agreed was more to Mr Gummer's liking than Mr MacSharry's.
Even so, the dilution of the MacSharry proposals at Britain's behest is
already giving rise to suggestions the reform package will neither curb
surpluses, nor the cost of the CAP, and that it could soon be back to square
one. East Anglia's cereal growers, for example, are due to suffer a 30 per
cent cut in their guaranteed prices over the next three years, but they will
be shielded from its full impact by generous compensation.
WELSH farming is primarily dependent upon livestock products - sheepmeat,
beef and milk - and the MacSharry proposals for discouraging output of these
were also diluted during the course of the negotiations.
Combine this with cheaper feeding-stuff costs - resulting from the
substantial cut in cereals prices - and it is easy to foresee a return to
bigger food mountains and a fresh EC crisis over the cost of agricultural
support which could be potentially even more damaging to Welsh farming
prospects.
On the other hand, next time round, Welsh farmers battling to make a living
on marginal land in what the EC euphemistically calls less-favoured areas,
may have more friends and allies within the EC.
The government is keen to press ahead with enlargement of the Community.
This would bring within the CAP's ambit the farmers of Norway and Finland,
who have a strategic and social as well as food producing role in Europe's
northern extremities.
The proposed winding up of the MMB is less a cause for concern than might
have been the case a few years ago. Having suffered creamery closures and a
number of other economic blows in recent years, Welsh dairy producers have
already learned the traditional paternalism of the MMB can longer be taken
for granted.
Indeed, there is widespread recognition within the farming industry in Wales
that it must take more responsibility for its own marketing. With active
support from organisations like the Welsh Development Agency and the
Development Board for Rural Wales, hardly a month seems to pass without some
new Welsh food initiative, be it the development of a new cheese, a lamb
product or organic foods.
Another positive development is that Welsh farmers are becoming increasingly
willing to accept the role of custodian of the countryside, as well as that
of food producer. This has not always been the case - not many years ago,
plans for creating a Cambrian Mountains National Park were dropped after
they ran into strong opposition from local farmers.
The Government went back to the drawing board and decided instead on a
different approach, creating what were designated Environmentally Sensitive
Areas in which farmers would be encouraged - and assisted financially - to
maintain traditional landscapes.
A few weeks ago, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary of state announced that
another four areas of Wales are to be designated as ESAs within the next 12
months - the island of Anglesey, the district of Radnor in Powys, Preseli
which covers a large part of Pembrokeshire, and the Clwydian hills in north
Wales.
With a section of Cambrian mountains and the Lleyn peninsula already
designated, it means that some 24 per cent the land area of Wales is now
being given ESA designation.
More than 800 conservation management agreements covering a total of some
64,000 hectares have already been signed by farmers in the existing two
Welsh ESAs, and the Welsh Office plans to spend Pounds 6.1m on ESA
conservation agreements in 1993-94 rising to Pounds 7.8m in 1995-96.
In addition, the new Countryside Council for Wales (an amalgamation of the
Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council) is proposing to
give the districts of Merionnydd and Dinefwr, and a large part of West
Glamorgan Tir Cymen designation.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (13): Eye on niche markets - Food
manufacturing / An entrepreneurial case study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD manufacturing is one of the sectors in which Wales would like to
expand, so, when one of the European industry giants, Nestle, decided to
dispose of its Holgates subsidiary on the mid-Wales coast, the
disappointment was palpable.
At stake was a small but important stake in the manufacture of health food
bars for own-label clients in the UK, Germany and elsewhere, and a total of
75 jobs - small by industry standards but crucial to tiny Tywyn.
What was proving to be little more than a distraction for the Swiss group,
however, was an opportunity for a management buy-out (or more accurately a
'previous owner buy-back') for managing director, Peter Saunders. Now aged
41, and a chemical engineer by training, Saunders had started his career at
BP Llandarcy, after graduating from the University of Wales, moving to
Holgates (then a honey farm) as production manager in 1975 before acquiring
it from the owner in 1976.
Nestle's involvement came about more by chance than strategic planning.
Rowntree Mackintosh had come across the company in the early 1980s, by which
time it had branched out into honey-based confectionery items, and was
impressed with the speed with which such a tiny operation could get
interesting new products to market - 'as a large business they were
interested in the way a small concern operated. They realised it was all too
easy for big companies to stifle initiative. While we could get a product on
the shelves in six months it could take them years because it was too
expensive for them to make a mistake. Our operation is much lower cost so we
can afford to get things wrong,' says Peter Saunders.
The fit with Nestle after its acquisition of Rowntree in 1988 at first
seemed just as good. Holgates' principal products had now developed into a
range of cereal and nut-based nutritional bars sold by major groups, such as
Boots the Chemist, to slimmers as meal replacements, and to sportsmen
seeking high carbohydrate or protein intake.
Following the take-over, Nestle continued to invest heavily in the company,
which currently has a capacity to produce 75m bars of 'nutritional',
'virtuous', and 'indulgent' confectionery annually at its modern plant.
Eventually, it became clear, however, that a company the size of Holgates
did not have a future as part of a group focusing increasingly on the
development of big international food brands, and in any case was not
well-suited to Nestle's corporate style.
WITHIN Nestle, research tended to be concentrated in centres of excellence -
and product development at the Tywyn site was run down. Sales and marketing,
too, were seen as group activities. Yet, for a small company serving niche
markets, the ability to carry on an active product development policy and to
search vigorously for its own customers was essential.
Last September, as part of the post-takeover integration of its UK
operations, Nestle announced that it wished to sell Holgates, which by that
time had slipped into losses, but that if a buyer did not emerge in nine
months it would be closed. In the event, the food group, which had already
sold Holgates' cakes-to-preserves tourist products subsidiary, the Welsh
Pantry, to Peter Saunders, quickly agreed to sell the main business as well.
The terms have been kept confidential but are known to be less than Pounds
1m, reflecting the losses of Pounds 0.3m made on a turnover of Pounds 2.5m
in the last full financial year under Nestle ownership.
The deal was put together with grant aid from Mid Wales Development,
following a feasibility study by accountants Touche Ross. Loan finance was
made available by the Midland Bank in Newtown. Further losses are expected
this year, but profits are forecast for next, even on a pessimistic reading
of the recession.
With the business fully back under his control as sole shareholder, Peter
Saunders intends to run it again in the way he believes right for a small
entrepreneurial company serving niche markets - 'I was sure the business
could work, because I could see market opportunities we were not able to
tackle when we were in big company ownership,' he says. There has been some
staff reductions, but an increase in the product development team. A senior
sales appointment is also to be made.
The main focus will continue to be own-label confectionery, and attempts are
being made to win other major retailers as customers. A recent new client is
Eurodisney. The company is also a big supplier of ingredients to other food
companies, in particular the flavoured ingredients used in the ever-widening
range of ice creams.
According to Peter Saunders, however, the company's strength is that it has
established itself in niches where the market is small and the competition
is limited. Fortunately, too, there does not seem any very strong likelihood
that interest in healthy eating - the basis on which its bar business is
built - will diminish over the years ahead.

first tenant less than three months after being opened at the end of June. A
leading European concern, a world leader in its field, has talked about
taking two suites for a research centre.
Imperial Park, a 50-acre site within the much larger Celtic Lakes
development being undertaken by Trencherwood and the local Bassaleg Group,
is intended to be the flagship property development in Wales. Celtic Lakes,
a Pounds 250m business park is intended to compete with the best in Britain,
according to its developers, able to stand comparison with Aztec West in
Bristol, the Birmingham business park, the Solent business park at
Southampton, or Stockley Park near London's Heathrow airport.
The WDA's chairman, Dr Gwyn Jones, who has already been to Japan and the Far
East once to extol the virtues of Imperial Park, says: 'Imperial will be a
formidable force in attracting even more Japanese companies to Wales. It
also enhances the prospects for indigenous business growth.'
To launch a science park in the middle of the deepest property recession
since the war might seem foolhardy.
But south Wales at least has managed to weather the downturn in the economy
remarkably well. Mr Freddie Watson, director of Grosvenor Waterside, the
property arm of Associated British Ports, in Cardiff may be excused
excessive enthusiasm when he says that 'although the property market in
Britain is stagnant we are going at 100 miles an hour down here,' but he can
at least point to tangible evidence to support his claim.
Grosvenor has two pre-let projects, one from the public sector, the other
from the private, amounting to 250,000sq ft. 'Where can you find 250,000sq
ft of pre-let property anywhere else,' he beams.
Nor is it just a matter of Cardiff. Grosvenor has ambitious plans for
Swansea, where the first major office building in 40 years has just been
completed.
The WDA's Dr Jones says south Wales has bucked the trend in the property
market, and forecasts that over Pounds 12m will have been invested in Welsh
property as a result of private-sector partnerships agreed with the agency
in the second quarter alone of this year. Last year the agency's joint
schemes led to 800,000 sq ft of new working space being planned, a figure Dr
Jones expects to see topped by at least 100,000 sq ft this year.
'There is now a more effective and efficient property market in Wales,' Dr
Jones says. Despite the difficulties in the property market, Wales is still
attracting increasing private-sector investment.'
That optimism is borne out by some figures. The WDA has reported a 45 per
cent increase in lettings for the first half of the year, compared with the
same period in 1991. Between January and June it let more than 1.1m sq ft of
industrial and commercial space, a rise of 347,000 sq ft.
A more cautious view is taken by Mr Peter Kelly, director of Debenhams in
Cardiff. 'There is a gratifying amount of activity about,' he says,
'especially in the retail sector and among some of the locally-based
developers. The two pre-lets in Cardiff Bay are very significant, and with
infrastructure work on the second Severn bridge having started, the
potential exists for expansion.
'But it is potential and we are not expecting any great material change in
the market. The point about south Wales is that the market has stabilised
and we don't expect it to decline because there is no significant area of
oversupply.'
Mr Bernard Ryan, chief executive of the Land Authority for Wales, sees
south-east and north-east Wales as being the two areas where interest is
greatest - 'the North Pentwyn site in Cardiff offers great opportunities,'
he says. 'Apart from housing and leisure interest there are 90 acres of
employment land which will produce between 1m and 1.5m sq ft of space. This
is being undertaken as a joint venture between the WDA, DMD, a local
company, and the Italian concern, Cogefar-Impresit, a subsidiary of Fiat
which built the Kariba dam in Africa.
'Other developments are taking place in Caerphilly, led by Boots the
Chemist, as well as at Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend. Generally, I am fairly
optimistic about the situation.'
The one area where movement is difficult is in north Wales. With the
exception of the Redrow group, which is locally-based, though it operates
nationally, it is being left to the smaller and medium-sized developers to
sustain the market. Mr Ryan says that even in these difficult times, though,
a steady flow of land is released to developers in north Wales, 'which may
not be headline news but it does keep the market moving. The market never
drops here as it has done in England.'

HJ Heinz, the US foods group, has made an application with New Zealand's

GFW, the biggest food company in Australasia, has said it planned to float
Wattie on the New Zealand Stock Exchange later this year.
'Yes, Heinz has made an application to us for authorisation for a takeover

An application to the commission does not necessarily mean a company will

<TEXT>
MR DONALD Bainton, who resigned as president of Continental Can nine years
ago after a disagreement over strategy, is getting belated revenge by buying
back the name of the largely dismembered group from its current owner, the
diversified Pieter Kiewit group.
Mr Bainton will use Continental Can as the new name for Viatech, a packaging
company with significant European interests which he has built up since the
mid-1980s. Mr Bainton and his brother hold 42 per cent of Viatech's stock.
He also announced that Viatech, which is quoted on the American Stock
Exchange, would seek a listing under its new name on the larger New York
Stock Exchange.
The company has also signed an agreement to raise from 50 per cent to 100
per cent its stake in Plastic Containers, a joint venture with Merrywood,
which is controlled by Mexico's Zapata packaging family.
Plastic Containers is a vehicle used in 1991 for the Dollars 153m purchase
of Continental Plastic Containers, a US company which is the last remaining
packaging unit of the old Continental Can company.
Under the deal Merrywood can, after July 1994, exchange its stake in Plastic
Containers for 887,500 shares of Viatech or put the stake to Viatech for
Dollars 30m, its original cost, plus interest.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: High-yielding sectors come under selling
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY'S gains following the Bundesbank's interest rate cut and the
devaluation of the lira were retraced yesterday as high-yielding markets
came under heavy selling pressure.
The sell-off in the markets perceived to be most vulnerable to devaluation,
such as Italy, the UK and Sweden, came in spite of the results of two
private polls commissioned by banks, which showed a narrow Yes majority for
Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
ITALIAN bonds shed 1 1/2 points as the lira came under renewed pressure,
despite Sunday's 7 per cent devaluation. The market lost most of the gains
recorded on Monday, in the wake of the Bundesbank's interest rate cut.
Far from being able to cut their own rates, as the Italian authorities had
hoped, the Bank of Italy had to intervene in the foreign exchange market to
support the lira. Fears that a second devaluation may be needed sparked a
further crisis of confidence in the Italian bond market yesterday. 'There
were no buyers yesterday, and there will not be any at least until the end
of the week,' said one Italian bond trader.
Rumours, later proved false, that Mr Guiliano Amato, Italy's prime minister,
was to resign, further unsettled the market. The Italian BTP future on Liffe
ended at 92.02, down from 93.63.
UK GILT prices ended a point lower, after sterling came under renewed
pressure. The weakness of the lira, and rumours of a devaluation of the
Swedish krona fuelled fears over sterling. The short-sterling contract on
Liffe ended at 89.15, discounting almost a full point rise in the base rate,
as dealers speculated that a hike of as much as one percentage point could
come by the end of the week.
Weak producer prices data did not restore spirits, though attention was
focused on the foreign exchange market.
SWEDISH yields jumped in nervous trading on fears that the central bank
would lose the battle with the foreign exchange market over the krona.
Dealers said the market was looking for an early devaluation of the Swedish
currency by up to 20 per cent.
Talk of a capital outflow of SKr40bn on Monday prompted rumours that the
central bank would have to reverse Monday's cut in the marginal lending rate
to 20 per cent from 75 per cent. Official currency flow figures are due
today.
Dealers said that overnight money rates were more than 100 per cent and that
one-month rates jumped from 17 per cent to 47 per cent. Three-month T-bills
closed up 850 basis points at 27.5 per cent and 11-year bond yields were up
43 points at 11.23 per cent.
DUTCH bonds closed about 15 cents higher after erasing modest morning
losses. The release of a deficit-cutting budget contained few surprises and
did not affect trading.
The 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 ended up 15 cents at 102.55 while its
yield fell to 8.01 per cent from 8.04 per cent. The gap between 10-year
Dutch and German yields fell further to 41 basis points from 43 earlier in
the day.
GERMAN bonds overcame a slightly easier start, as the market consolidated
Monday's gains and the Treuhandanstalt issued DM4bn of 10-year bonds to end
steady to slightly up.
In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent Bunds due July 2002 rose 0.03
to 102.64 to yield 7.60 per cent, while the Liffe December Bund future
traded at 90.21 late in the day after Monday's close of 90.16, in volume of
46,580 lots.
FRENCH bonds drifted for most of the day to end slightly lower. The Treasury
announced it was seeking between FFr12 and FFr14bn at its forthcoming
auction of new two- and five-year notes, slightly more than the market had
expected.
The 8 1/2 per cent OATs of 2003 closed down 0.14 at 98.92 to yield 8.65 per
cent compared with 8.63 per cent, while the 8 1/2 per cent OATs of 2023 fell
0.18 to 98.66 to yield 8.62 per cent. On the Matif, the September bond
futures contract closed at 107.46, down 0.10 on volume of 135,650 lots.
US Treasury bonds suffered a double blow yesterday as profit-taking combined
with a reassessment of the significance of Germany's interest rate cut to
produce a sell-off that pushed the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury
issue nearly a full point lower.
By late afternoon the 7.250 per cent paper maturing in August 2022 had
fallen by of a point to 99 7/32 , to yield 7.309 per cent. Shorter-term
maturities were less affected, although 10-year bonds were  15/32 lower at
99 15/16 to yield 6.370 per cent.
Ms Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, said
Treasuries were under downward pressure because of the hedging of US
corporate positions as well as outright selling by institutional investors
in what appeared to be profit-taking in the wake of Monday's highs.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities said there was also
'creeping concern' in the bond market about the possible effects of a
Clinton presidency. 'Clinton's spending programmes are front-ended, while
his plans to generate revenues would come later,' Mr Hale said.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Spain sets up Dollars 1.5bn
seven-year offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain is taking bids from a number of investment banks for a
seven-year Eurobond issue totalling at least Dollars 1.5bn, but has yet to
award a mandate. The deal, expected to emerge this week, will add further
supply to the dollar sector, which has already digested a Dollars 2bn
offering of global bonds by the Province of Ontario, arranged by Goldman
Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
The Ontario offering, launched on Monday just ahead of the German rate cut,
suffered from its timing, according to some under-writers.
'When you have such a huge dislocation of markets, no one wants to make
investment decisions,' said one underwriter. In addition, the Japanese
market was closed yesterday, and many bankers and investors were not at
their desks on Monday.
However, the lead managers said that investor sentiment on the dollar, which
at last appeared to have turned, spurred buying of the deal, especially in
south-east Asia and Europe.
The five-year bonds were priced yesterday at 48 basis points above the
comparable Treasury yield, the wider end of the indicated spread range.
However, even at this level the pricing appeared rather aggressive to US
investors. The US corporate bond market had to digest about Dollars 10bn of
supply last week and investors are becoming rather choosy.
The spread on the Ontario offering widened to 50 basis points at one point.
However, a weak US Treasury market allowed the spread to tighten back to 48
basis points.
Despite some resistance to the Ontario deal, Spain could meet a more
enthusiastic welcome.
While Ontario has already borrowed heavily in the US and Eurobond market to
meet its heavy funding programme of nearly CDollars 10bn (USDollars 8.10bn)
this year, Spain has never issued in dollars, and should have some rarity
value.
In the equity-linked market, Nestle Holdings launched a Dollars 250m issue
of seven-year bonds with equity warrants attached.
European equity-linked offerings have become a rarity recently, as few
companies are keen to issue at current stock market levels. However, Nestle
is considered one of the most attractive stocks in the sector, having
released good interim results on Friday.
Elsewhere, Citicorp launched a Dollars 40m two-tranche Eurobond issued by
International Bonds Investments, which holds Venezuelan debt.

REPSOL, the Spanish state-owned oil, gas and chemicals group, is to delay a
placing of some 10 per cent of its equity until next year to allow
parliament to lift legal barriers to the deal.
The delay caused some surprise on the domestic markets where the placement,
which will include an international tranche and would raise some Pta60bn
(Dollars 625m), had been eagerly awaited.
The markets had understood that parliament would remove the mandatory
majority state ownership of Repsol.
A draft bill was approved last July. But Repsol said yesterday the
legislation would not be approved until December, delaying the placement
until the first half of 1993.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: First Treuhand deal divides
London and Frankfurt contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST bond issue of the Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with
privatising former East German assets, yesterday forced a sharp divergence
between the prices of Bund futures in Frankfurt and London.
At one point during the afternoon, the gap between the rival contracts
reached more than three quarters of a point, with the London contract at
90.53 compared with the Frankfurt on 89.77.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange had decided
not to make the new Treuhand bonds deliverable into its Bund contracts which
expire up to March 1992, making them less attractive for investors to hold.
The Deutsche Terminborse, on the other hand, last month ruled that the bonds
would be deliverable into its March 1993 contract. The new Treuhand bonds
will be the cheapest to deliver into the futures contract, helping to push
down the price.
Yesterday's issue of DM4bn of bonds, expected to be followed today with an
auction of a further DM6bn, was launched with a 7 3/4 per cent coupon and
priced at 101, to give a yield about 13 basis points higher than 10-year
bunds.
At that level, the bonds, which carry a full guarantee from the Federal
government, were considered attractively priced by traders.
'If the unity fund is deliverable, then the Treuhand should also be,' said
one economist, adding that to include it would not undermine the quality of
the Liffe contract.
Liffe said it was reviewing whether the bonds should be deliverable into its
contracts from next June onwards.

mortgage-backed issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RARE mortgage-backed Eurobond issue from a continental European borrower
was relaunched yesterday, having been pulled last week due to the turmoil in
Swedish financial markets.
Goldman Sachs relaunched the offer, by Osprey Mortgage Securities - a
special purpose vehicle for a subsidiary of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken -
in the face of renewed pressure on Swedish markets.
However, the bank said that after discussions with the issuer, investors and
the rating agencies it was confident the issue would not need to be delayed
again, even if the markets suffered the same upheaval as last week.
The terms of the Dollars 372m offer have been amended only slightly, with a
change of size in two of the three tranches of bonds. Also, CSFB was
replaced by Morgan Stanley as a co-lead to the issue. However, the spreads
over US Treasuries offered on the bonds were squarely within the ranges
indicated last week. The first tranche, for instance, was offered at a
spread of 78.5 basis points, compared with an indicated range last week of
77-80 basis points.
The original decision to delay the issue had caused concern in some
quarters, since it marked an unusual move to hold back an offer that had
already been underwritten. However, Goldman said at the time that it merely
intended to postpone the offer until the markets settled down.
Trading in German Bund futures on the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) will start
one hour earlier on Monday, the day after the French vote on the Maastricht
treaty, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. Trading will begin at 7am local time
on Bund futures, as well as for Bobl futures and options on Bund futures.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (10): A dream comes true - Swansea's Pounds
16m barrage will lead to new riverbank projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTEEN YEARS ago the city fathers and planners in Swansea had a dream.
They envisaged a city in which the Tawe, the city's river, would be
transformed by a barrage, offering the chance the develop the river banks
for work and housing.
Eighteen years on that dream has come true. At the end of July, a Pounds 16m
barrage was completed, and the river now has reasonably constant level of
water. Industry has been attracted, and there are plans to develop the
run-down eastern bank in a setting suitable for the 21st century.
Swansea's dream is being entertained, too, elsewhere in south Wales. Both
Cardiff and Newport want to put barrages at their entrances, in Cardiff
across the bay and in Newport across the Usk. But both have run into
opposition.
In Swansea, completion of the barrage has created the basis for a big
expansion along the riverbank. The area is already unrecognisable from the
run-down shabbinesss that characterised it for so long after the end of the
second world war. According to Mr Ken Jones, assistant city engineer, it now
has the potential to become one of the most exciting cities in Britain.
The magnitude of Swansea's problem was enormous, as it was in its two Welsh
neighbours. Like Cardiff and Newport, it had seen its dock trade, largely
based on coal and metals, all but disappear, with little coming to replace
it.
Swansea suffered doubly from the nature of its industrial past. In the 18th
century, it was the centre of the world's metal industry, housing hundreds
of copper, lead, zinc and silver smelting operations. When these industries
moved nearer their sources of supply a hundred years ago, they were replaced
by iron, steel, tinplate and chemicals.
These, too, eventually moved on and in 1945 the lower Swansea valley had
become Britain's largest single area of industrial dereliction.
Today, Swansea is a very different place. Its enterprise park has attracted
more than 400 companies and almost 8,000 workers; its marina, on the west
side of the barrage, is a thriving community, full of boats; the city centre
is being developed attractively.
What the barrage, the first to be completed in Britain, will do is to unlock
the development potential of the Tawe some two miles upstream as far as
Morriston. It will act as a dam, creating a reliable level of water. The
difference behind it between high and low water is now about 2ft: previously
it was 30ft on a high tide. The barrage will also operate a water-driven
turbine to generate electricity and allow pleasure craft to ply the river
through the lock system.
With Swansea nominated as European City of Literature for 1995 there are
plans, in conjunction with the Welsh Development Agency, which has backed
the barrage project in many ways, to create a publishing park. Other
investment has already been stimulated: a 40,000 sq ft office block for
instance, by Andrew Scott, of Port Talbot, the first in the city for years.
There are also plans for an archeological park to commemorate the city's
industrial past, a hotel and a tourist centre.
'The most important thing, though,' says Mr John Churchill, the city's
director of trade and industry, 'is to make sure that the river ends the
divide between the prosperous western side of the city and the run-down
eastern bank.'
Ambitious plans to develop the eastern side have been put forward by
Grosvenor Waterside, the property-development arm of Associated British
Ports, in conjunction with the city itself and British Rail.
Housing is to be linked to the existing marina across the river and there
will be the usual mix of leisure activities, commercial developments, open
spaces and offices designed to attract major national companies to the city.
Port Tawe, the name given to this development, 'will reflect the maritime
theme of Swansea,' says Grosvenor Waterside.
Although he does not admit it, Mr Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of Cardiff Bay
Development Corporation, must be envious of the way Swansea has got there
first. Despite massive support from the government, the passage of the
private Bill to allow the Pounds 150m Cardiff barrage to go ahead has been
bedevilled by a long-drawn-out parliamentary procedure.
The result has been to delay the start of work for at least two years,
though Mr Inkin, whose enthusiasm for the scheme remains undiminished
despite the problems, not just of parliamentary opposition but also of the
collapse of the British property market, says the period has not been wasted
 -'an enormous amount of preparatory work has gone ahead,' he says, 'and
when the Bill is passed we shall be ready to push the button from day one.'
WITH government support, it is thought likely the Bill will receive royal
assent some time early in the new year - 'then you'll see us move,' Mr Inkin
says. 'The interesting thing is that investor-interest in Cardiff has
remained very high despite our problems.'
That view is supported by Mr Freddie Watson, executive director of Grosvenor
Waterside in Cardiff - 'the property market may be flat elsewhere in Britain
but down here we are doing 100mph.'
Grosvenor has pre-let 250,000 sq ft of office space on its development
within Cardiff Bay even without the assurance of the barrage. Half of that
has gone to the Welsh Health Common Services Authority and the remainder to
NCM Credit Insurance, the Dutch company which late last year bought Export
Credits Guarantee Department's short-term insurance arm.
Newport is also facing a struggle to get its private Bill through
parliament. Its opposition is not so much from MPs but from outside
interests, especially fishing interests and the National Rivers Authority,
both of which fear a barrage across the Usk would affect fishing in one of
Britain's premier salmon rivers.
Mr Roger Davies, head of urban development at Newport, believes 'we have
designed the barrage in such a way that fish will continue to run the river.
There will be tidal intrusions on 60 per cent of tides for two to two and a
half hours a day. Like Swansea, we shall also have fish locks to allow
access into and out of the river.'
The proposed Pounds 72m barrage is part of a scheme not just to enhance the
development potential of a run-down part of the town but also of a southern
road link which will take pressure off the M4 motorway which runs across the
north of the town - 'although the scheme is publicly funded at the moment,'
says Mr Davies, 'several companies have expressed interest in jointly
funding it.'
The barrage could eventually create 5,000 jobs and 2,000 houses in a
neglected part of the town. Lovell, Wimpey, Tarmac, Regalian and Blue Circle
are among the companies that have all expressed interest in the area - 'we
need the barrage to regenerate the waterside,' says Mr Davies. It is a view
held equally forcefully by Swansea's Ken Jones and Cardiff's Geoffrey Inkin.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (11): Reform plans are well-advanced - The
changing shape of local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW MORNING, councillors and officials representing the district and
country councils in Wales sit down in London with Mr David Hunt, the Welsh
secretary, to discuss the future shape of local government in the country
for the last time before Mr Hunt produces his white paper on the subject
later this autumn.
It will be the councillors' final chance to influence the shape of local
government in the next century. Wales is well ahead of England in this
process and if the government's timetable is met the new shadow councils
should be in place by May 1994, and operating from the spring of the
following year.
Some decisions are already known. Wales will be governed by unitary
authorities. The present two-tier system of county and district councils
will be replaced by single-purpose, unitary authorities.
It is also clear that Mr Hunt does not intend to accede to any of the calls
for an elected assembly for Wales. Other matters are, however, still to be
resolved, including the number of councils.
Two recent consultation papers, on education and community councils, suggest
Mr Hunt has settled on 23. When he produced his first proposals for a review
of local government in June 1991 he offered three options - 13, 20 or 24
unitary authorities to replace the eight existing counties and 37 districts.
His preferred option was 20.
By now opting for the higher end, Mr Hunt has gone a long way towards
meeting the demands of the districts, who once they had seen that reform was
going to be introduced, with or without their acquiescence, agreed that to
argue for the protection of the present 37 councils was not a viable option.
This decision, reached just over a year ago, was crucial, since it allowed
the districts to outflank the eight counties which, until a late stage,
continued to press for their existing number and their members to be the
basis of reform.
Not that the districts willingly, at first, agreed to ditching any of their
members. It was only after a lot of banging of heads, and then reluctantly,
that the districts agreed some should go to the wall. Eventually, the
Council of Welsh Districts suggested between 25 and 30 with a preferred
option of 27.
'The key to the whole reform must be to relate local activities to the
people,' say Mr Geraint Price-Thomas, under secretary (Wales) of the
Association of District Councils. 'This means making them acceptable to the
people.'
The counties do not disagree. Mr Hugh Thomas, secretary of the Assembly of
Welsh Counties and chief executive of Mid Glamorgan County Council, says:
'We are concerned at delivering a service to the community that should be
efficient and cost effective.'
After their initial exercise in digging in heels by advocating their number
 -eight - should be retained the counties have shifted, rather late in the
day, to suggesting there should be 16.
The eight chief executives have, however, been sufficiently concerned at the
way the whole issue of reform has been going to publish a paper expressing,
independently of the elected members, their own deep concern.
'The case for change must rest on whether any proposed change will secure
sufficiently worthwhile improvements,' they say.
In a strongly worded attack, they complain that 'the proposals emerging
indicate a lack of integrated consideration of local government's purpose,
functions, financing, internal management and structure. Democratic
accountability will be undermined, be administratively unwieldy and be less
understood by local people than at present.'
They conclude that if the concept of unitary authority is to be implemented
in accordance with the government's principles - democratic accountability;
responsive to local needs; clearly understood; strengthened community
loyalties; efficient services - the solution lies with larger unitary
authorities than Mr Hunt has proposed.
This might seem like special pleading from a body of men and women that
stand to lose most by the proposed reforms - except that it has been backed
by the business community. The Confederation of British Industry has
expressed 'serious misgivings' about the proposal to have over 20 councils.
Accepting the government's position that reform should be cost-neutral the
CBI claims the handling of strategic issues could be fragmented if the
number of authorities were to be too large and that the small Welsh
authorities 'may also be at a disadvantage compared to the English
counties.'
The calls for an elected assembly come mainly from Labour, the dominant
political force in Wales. It controls 27 of the country's 38 parliamentary
seats. It also controls five of the eight counties and 18 of the 37
districts.
Not that a unified approach would be easy, anyway, since it is the policy of
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalists, to bypass an assembly and go directly
for an independent Wales within the European community.
Since the nationalists are a minority force in their own country, despite
winning a fourth seat at last April's general election, polling slightly
under 10 per cent of the popular vote and trailing not just Labour and the
Conservatives but also the Liberal Democrats, this policy is as much dead in
the water at the moment as an elected assembly.
That leaves Mr Hunt, born in Wales but brought up in Liverpool and
representing an English constituency, calling all the shots despite having
just six Conservative seats in the principality.
Mr Hunt smiles a lot and gets on well with his political opponents. But
behind the bonhomie is a steely resolve. He will get what he wants for
Wales, which is why this autumn's white paper is awaited so keenly.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (7): Europe's 'finest facilities' claim -
More business parks in mid Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE START of last May, the Development Board for Rural Wales unveiled its
latest business park at Penrhyndeudraeth, little more than a stone's throw
from the burial site of David Lloyd George, one-time prime minister and one
of Wales's greatest sons, writes Anthony Moreton.
Glyn Davies, the ebullient chairman of the board, said at the launch that
the park was part of the strategy of marketing the whole of rural mid Wales
as one coherent business park.
'We have the finest facilities in Britain,' he said, 'the best quality of
life and the right atmosphere in which businesses can operate profitably.'
Several business parks have already been created in this vast area, which
stretches from the northernmost tip of industrial south Wales to the edges
of Snowdonia in the north, from Cardigan bay to the English border in the
east. Some of these parks, such as that at Newtown, have beenhighly
successful in helping create employment and economic activity in their
locality.
The problem which the board initially faced was rejuvenating small towns,
such as Llanidloes, Aberystwyth, Bala and Brecon, where there were
insufficient jobs to hold, let alone attract, young people.
It has also increasingly had to take into account the rundown in farming,
with its consequent depressant effect on incomes.
Having managed to arrest the decline in numbers - aided, it has to be
admitted, by a considerable number of incomers - and stimulated new
businesses, Glyn Davies's team at Newtown developed a new strategy for the
1990s in which the emphasis was placed on focused investment.
'We're focusing our activities on six growth areas - Aberystwyth, the
Ffestiniog valley, Brecon, central Powys, Newtown and Welshpool - and 12
special towns, ranging from Cardigan in the west to Presteigne on the
English border.
'This way we should ensure that the maximum number of people will benefit
from the new jobs and community facilities we are either providing or
helping to provide.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (6): A thousand projects won in the last
decade - Inward Investment / A Record year in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the statistics that have been coming out of Wales of recent years
will surprise those more used to expecting a tale of economic woe.
Since the mid-1980s, the economy has, according to the Welsh Development
Agency, been growing faster than that of the UK as a whole and is expected
to continue to do so.
During this summer, Welsh unemployment actually fell below the UK average
for the first time since the 1920s.
ln the past ten years nearly 1,000 inward investment projects have been
attracted, creating or safeguarding around 100,000 jobs and bringing capital
investment totalling Pounds 4.7bn.
Last year was a record year for inward investment, with 208 projects
creating or securing 17,000 jobs and capital expenditure of just over Pounds
1bn.
Wales, with just five per cent of the UK's population has been getting more
than one fifth of the jobs and projects coming coming from abroad.
It now has nearly 30 per cent of all people employed in Japanese
manufacturing in the UK, with no fewer than 44 Japanese companies.
Even allowing that future figures may look less positive when the impact of
the continuing recession is fully reflected, Wales has had an outstanding
few years in the marketplace for internationally mobile investment, with
some very big corporations choosing it.
Bosch, the German group, has spent Pounds 100m. on a 500,000 sq. ft.
factory, its biggest outside Germany, at Miskin near Cardiff, to produce a
new generation of compact alternators.
Toyota is to produce 200,000 800cc engines a year from a Pounds 140m new
plant on Deeside for the cars it is to make at Burnaston in Derbyshire.
Ford is putting Pounds 450m into its existing south Wales plants and will be
producing 530,000 a year of its new Zeta engines at Bridgend. Altogether
more than Pounds 1.3bn has been spent by automotive component makers in
Wales since 1983.
Dow Corning at Barry, and Sony at Bridgend are both spending around Pounds
150m to upgrade existing facilities, and other companies have moved in to
acquire large-scale assets which other companies have decided to release.
Against this background, it is perhaps understandable that the formula
whereby Wales - along with Scotland and Northern Ireland - receives a
proportionately higher share of UK public expenditure per head than England
is apparently to be looked at again in this autumn's Treasury spending
review.
Within Wales, however, opponents of such a move are likely to point out that
the task of restructuring the Welsh economy remains only partially complete.
While the big new projects have brought in hundreds of jobs, the losses
elsewhere have continued and, indeed, risen again in recent months. Apart
from those that will go when British Coal closes a further two collieries in
south Wales shortly, some 400 jobs have gone in the last few years at
television contractors HTV, in the previously fast-expanding Welsh media
sector.
Other jobs have gone, or are going, not just in Barry Docks with the move by
Geest from its long-established Welsh base to Southampton, but also in the
health service at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, at British Aerospace in Hawarden
and at Hotpoint in Llandudno.
A threat hangs over part of the BP Baglan Bay complex and there have been
cutbacks even in expanding areas, such as electronics, where one of the
leading Welsh-owned companies, AB Electronics, has been forced to trim back
operations.
Employment opportunities vary markedly, too, in different parts of Wales,
with the south Wales coastal belt, particularly the Newport-Cardiff-Bridgend
nexus, and the north east corner of Wales, around Wrexham, benefitting from
good communications and the services and labour available in nearby big
population centres.
In the south Wales valleys and rural Wales new investment has proved much
harder to obtain, and some pockets of high unemployment and acute
deprivation remain.
THE challenges are going to become even greater, too, over the rest of this
decade, and not just in areas outside the favoured M4 corridor. One of
Wales's attractions has undoubtedly been the availability of relatively low
cost male and female labour, but, as John Hockey of surveyors, Henry
Butcher, in Cardiff points out, former Eastern block countries, such as
Poland, are now stepping up their efforts to attract mobile manufacturing
projects, adding to the competition Wales already faces from other parts of
Britain and of Western Europe, such as Spain, Portugal, and the south of
France.
And although one of the reasons for Wales's success in attracting new
companies from around the world has been low overheads, much is also going
to depend on where sterling settles in relation to other European currencies
and the dollar.
Yet, although conditions are going to remain difficult there are good
reasons for the WDA, and its sister body in rural areas, Mid-Wales
Development, to feel optimistic that the groundwork they have laid will
ensure continuing competitiveness in the battle for investment.
The objective over recent years has, of necessity, been to bring in
large-scale manufacturing projects capable of providing the jobs - and in
particular the male jobs - needed to replace those being lost. The approach
has, however, been much more than simply grant-based.
The WDA since its creation has been behind a big programme of removing
industrial dereliction in Wales to create a greatly improved environment for
incoming industry, and has recently turned its attention to assisting in the
improvement of the townscape in a number of Welsh towns. There has also been
a big improvement in Welsh road communications. The rebuilt A55 along the
north Wales coast gives the rural north a fast link with the English
motorway system, and by 1996 south Wales will be linked to England by a
second Severn crossing. The possible benefits this will bring have already
been foreshadowed by the recent announcement from Tesco that it would be
building a very large distribution depot near the Welsh landfall.
The strategy for attracting investment has been a selective one, too, with
the intention of building on core competencies already in Wales. In this way
it is hoped, as Mr Ian Rooks, WDA executive director, marketing, points out,
that a nucleus can be created around which other similar businesses will
cluster.
This approach has clearly worked not just in automotive components and
electronics, but in aerospace itself, where a number of important
developments have taken place. General Electric of the US has acquired
British Airways engine overhaul facilities at Nantgarw, near Pontypridd,
while British Airways itself has chosen Cardiff Airport as the location for
a Pounds 100m aircraft maintenance facility to handle its Boeing 747 fleet.
It is also building a Pounds 23m. new avionics servicing centre at nearby
Llantrisant. As a result, Wales now has more than 5 per cent of UK
employment in this sector, having previously been under-represented.
The approach adopted by Welsh Development International, the WDA's inward
investment arm, is according to Mr Rooks, not simply to trawl for whatever
is available but to research developments taking place, even in industrial
sectors which might be passing through a temporary downturn. A package is
then put to leading manufacturers showing how they could benefit from
picking Wales for expanding in growing product areas.
CONSIDERABLE effort has also been put into analysing the industries which
might be suitable for different parts of Wates. The decision by US company,
Euro DPC, to move from Oxfordshire to Gwynedd will be used as a lever to
encourage other similar high value, low bulk medical equipment producers to
move into the clean environment of north Wales. West Wales, it is hoped, can
develop further its involvement in the food industry.
South east Wales has already attracted a number of financial services
companies' back-office operations, and Cardiff has seen strong growth in
legal and accountancy services. As yet the city has attracted relatively
little foreign banking interest but this may come with the expansion of
overseas manufacturing within Wales.
Another area that has yet to develop to the extent that the WDA would like
is research and development, though there are signs that some of the more
long-standing inward investors are beginning to locate parts of their
research activities to Wales. Sony will be including research facilities in
its new investment project in Bridgend. To help improve the Welsh research
profile, the WDA has persuaded Imperial College, London, to join it and
Newport borough council in creating a science park outside Newport which
will bring the research resources of the college within easy reach of Welsh
firms.
It is undoubtedly a reflection of British industry's own problems that few
of the very big moves into Wales of recent years have been by UK-owned
concerns. The companies that have come from overseas have come, however,
with the intention of serving not just the British market but the single
European market as well.
ln the process Wales has managed to secure for itself not just a more
diversified industrial base but one which, perhaps just as significantly,
has a wide spread of markets, too.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (2): Cardiff has much to offer - Financial
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE start of July, Hayter Brockbank, a specialist in marine insurance,
chose Cardiff for the headquarters of an operation to expand its marine- and
car-insurance business through direct sales, a rapidly expanding sector of
the insurance market.
The decision, which will mean the creation of about 250 jobs in the Welsh
capital, has been described by Mr Robert Ashmead, director of the financial
services initiative run by the Welsh Development Agency, as the most
significant move in financial services in Wales in the past three and a half
years.
The move, he added, 'confirms our view that Cardiff, in particular, and
south east Wales, in general, has the strength to become a very important
player in the financial sector.
'Cardiff has a magnificent location in its docklands, now being developed in
a coherent way, and the decision by NCM Insurance Services to move into a
very large building in Cardiff Bay, as well as Prudential's decision to site
a regional headquarters in the city, has started to create critical mass.'
The financial services initiative was set up four years ago by Lord Walker
when, as Mr Peter Walker, he was secretary of state for Wales. He was
anxious to develop the attractions of south-east Wales as a site for the
then rapidly-growing financial services sector.
He saw financial services as an essential element in the new Wales which had
emerged from the shadow of steel and coal.
South Wales, and particularly the Newport area, had already had a degree of
success in attracting newcomers even before the Walker initiative. TSB had
located its trust arm in the town, next to the Patent Office. AA Insurance
was in Cardiff, and all the major accountants were also in the Welsh
capital.
Lord Walker devolved the task of running the financial services initiative,
which was a joint operation among local authorities in the area and the
agency, on to the WDA, but he also played a very close part himself in
getting the scheme off the ground.
An important success for the initiative has been the decision by N M
Rothschild to open a full branch in Cardiff, apart from Manchester, where
the first Rothschild began in business, the only city in which the merchant
bank has operations outside the City of London.
It was Walker's contacts with the bank, and in particular with Sir Michael
Richardson, the former managing director, whom he talked into seeing the
commercial advantages of operating in Cardiff, which brought Rothschilds to
the Welsh city.
SOUTH WALES has always had a small financial sector by comparison with
regional centres such as Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and even nearby
Bristol, not to mention Edinburgh. Standard Chartered, whicn through its
Chartered Trust subsidiary acquired the former Julian Hodge loan finance
operations, was an early arrival, with the establishment in the late 1960s
of the Bank of Wales, now fully owned by the Bank of Scotland, another
milestone.
AA Insurance opened in 1977, followed by Chemical Bank which arrived in
1983. It has since passed on its mortgage business in Cardiff to Banque
Nationale de Paris, while retaining its other Cardiff operations.
The Julian Hodge name, synonymous for many years with financial services in
Cardiff, survives in the Julian Hodge Bank, which provides a range of
personal and merchant banking services.
A further wave of new arrivals built quickly in the late 1980s. National
Provident Institution transferred its group pensions business from Tunbridge
Wells in 1988; Sedgwick James came in 1990; stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White,
part of Hill Samuel, were a 1989 arrival while more recently the
German-owned insurance company DAS, pensions consultants Noble Lowndes and
French owned Axa have all arrived. The result, according to Mr Brian Morgan,
chief economist at the WDA, is that there has been a very encouraging rise
in the numbers employed in this sector.
'This is important because improved links between the industrial and
financial sectors are likely to be vital in the early stages of the
economy's recovery.'
Mr David Lewis, deputy managing director of Willis Corroon (Wales) concurs:
'Our expansion in the past five years has been dramatic,' he says, 'and it
is symptomatic of what is happening here.
'Companies have been keeping their heads down over the past year but there
is plenty of expansion waiting for the moment to go.'
Willis Corroon is part of that expansion. Five years ago it had 19 staff.
Now it numbers more than 70, and, in addition to Cardiff, it now has offices
in Swansea and Haverfordwest.
As the UK economy has tumbled even further into recession, though, there is
evidence that it is becoming increasingly more difficult to attract
companies into Wales.
Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the WDA, says: 'There is still a lot of interest
in south Wales as a home for financial-services companies, but it is
certainly hard to bring in more.'
His solution is to broaden the scope of the financial services initiative to
focus on those areas in particular where Wales has a definite competitive
advantage over other parts of Britain.
Mr Ashmead spells it out: 'Instead of going out and saying what a wonderful
place Wales is, as we did originally, we have now taken the institutions,
divided them into their sectors and are looking at the problems and issues,
facing them individually.
'We can then go to a sector and offer a solution for their problem.
Financial-services businesses operate on the bottom line. The
quality-of-life approach may be important, and it has a role to play, but
what is important to any company thinking of relocating to Wales is what
will happen to the figures.'
He believes that Wales's advantages, which include a large untapped pool of
labour, especially among married women in the 25-40 age bracket returning to
work, good educational standards, a willingness to adapt to new techniques
and property at reasonable prices are the factors that now determine
decision making.
'This is the bottom line,' he says, 'and this is what will sway a company
towards making a move to Wales.'
He argues that Wales's strengths will be helped by the willingness companies
now have to accept that the front and back offices do not have to be in the
same building.
'For years, firms were reluctant to think the two could be divorced.' he
says. 'Now they not only accept the divorce but are actively looking to ways
to implement it.
'We have shown in Wales that we can be the perfect base for back-office
operations. We have also shown that in the retail sector of financial
services this is a very good centre.
Mr Nicholas Markovits, manager of Venture Link Investors, a privately-owned
venture capital group which has set up a fund to provide equity capital for
unquoted companies, and product development finance, sees the future as
bright.
'The demand for venture capital is not much down on last year, considering
the state of the economy,' he says, 'and we are in place to do good business
once there is a pickup.'
That is the general consensus. Wales is well placed, it is generally agreed,
to develop its nascent financial services industry.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (3): Rich diversity of schemes - Training
initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JUST OVER two years ago Diane Hughes wanted to return to work. With her
children growing up there was less need for her to be present 24 hours a
day. The problem was that in Menai Bridge, her home, there was no nursery,
and no nursery meant no return to work.
Mrs Hughes was not one to sit back and accept the inevitable, though. She
set up her own nursery and within 18 months it was full. Fired by
enthusiasm, and by her success, Mrs Hughes decided to expand and open
another on Parc Menai, a business park on the edge of Bangor. Just the
place, she reckoned, as the women working in the offices there would need
and welcome the facilities she will provide.
Mrs Hughes's initiative, which has led to the creation of seven jobs, won
her an award presented by the Midland Bank and Targed, the training and
enterprise council covering north west Wales.
'It just shows what can be done with a little initiative,' says Ms Enid
Rowlands, chief executive of Targed. 'A lot of women are setting up in
business in this part of Wales, especially farmers' wives, where there is
now a very great need to bring in extra income as farming is going through a
difficult time. We can help them in all sorts of ways to become independent
and viable.'
Jobs for working women are not the only requirement in north Wales -
'education has always had a high priority in family life in this part of the
country,' Ms Rowlands says, 'so academic attainments are high. But there is
still a need to improve skill levels.'
Training rather than enterprise tends to be a more important role for the
seven Tecs in Wales, because of the support given towards stimulating
enterprise by the Welsh Development Agency. In this respect, the situation
in Wales is closer to that in Scotland than England. The Tecs tend to place
rather more emphasis on small firms and start-ups, which is where a lot of
the job-creation is to be found; consequently, two-thirds of Ms Rowlands'
Pounds 15m budget goes towards training, split 60:40 between youth and adult
work.
Large businesses are not ignored, though. In Cardiff, Mr Sheldon, chief
executive of the South Glamorgan Tec, is keen to provide help for companies
such as British Airways and Bosch, two recent incomers, especially if they
take people off the unemployed register. With BA, for instance, it has
helped fund a scheme out of its Pounds 13m budget in which it meets the cost
of the third year of a college course in order to improve good long-term
training. For Ms Rowlands at Targed, size has a different connotation. There
are probably only 20 large companies in Gwynedd, so much of her thrust is
directed towards companies with fewer than 20 employees.
South Glamorgan's unique approach is to have introduced the first business
credit in Britain. It offers Pounds 5,000 to companies wanting buy a range
of services, such as consultancy, or helping with the cost of senior
managers attending skill seminars. The Tec will meet two-thirds of the cost
of these services.
There has been a reasonable take-up, Mr Sheldon says - 'the problem is that
in the present recession too few companies can afford to lay out the other
third but, as the economy picks up, I expect greater use to be made of this
facility.'
MOST of the demand for services within the Targed area comes from within its
boundaries. Further east in Clwyd, the situation is slightly different. The
county's workforce also looks to England, and especially the Chester
conurbation for employment, so that the Tec has rather different priorities.
In Clwyd, the Tec is known as Training and Enterprise and its area is a net
exporter of workers.
About one in every five works outside the area whereas only one in every 10
jobs is accounted for by someone travelling in to the area.
The sort of work Targed undertakes is illustrated by a recent case involving
a bakery in Bala. Berwyn Bakery had a fine reputation in Gwynedd and beyond.
Its biscuits were - and still are - much sought after. Its reputation grew
as the company took display stands at several exhibitions; as its reputation
grew, so did demand.
The rise in orders, however, threatened to overwhelm the bakery - total
employment five - and the company put out an SOS call to Targed. The agency
sent in a consultant, drew up a development plan which pointed a sensible
way forward, and met part of the costs. The result was that Berwyn could
cope with the increased orders, turnover and profits rose, and the company
now employs 20.
That figure may seem miniscule by comparison with the thousands expected
eventually at British Airways's new maintenance plant outside Cardiff. But
in the context of Bala it was significant.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (1): Well-placed for an eventual recovery -
As the Welsh economy has diversified in recent years, observers believe that
the principality will be the first part of the UK to take advantage of an
economic upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JUNCTION 24 on the M4 motorway into south Wales, a few miles to the east of
Newport, presents a microcosm of what is happening to the economy of the
principality.
To the north, the Welsh Development Agency and Wilson Bowden are working on
the Langstone business park, the first stage of a joint venture between the
public and private sectors that is eventually expected to create several
hundred jobs. Across the road, the shell of the building which the
electronics company, Inmos, once occupied now stands empty. Wales is no more
immune to recession as unemployment rises, liquidations and closures
increase, and business confidence wanes, than the rest of Britain.
It differs from many other parts in that there is good news as well as bad.
Mr David Hunt, the eternally optimistic secretary of state for Wales, tours
the country announcing new investments, jobs created. Thus, the marine
insurance concern, Hayter Brockbank, will create 230 jobs in Cardiff;
Henrob, which makes rivets in Flint, is to undertake a Pounds 1.8m expansion
to create 34 jobs; Pullmaflex, which makes car seats, is to expand in
Ammanford at a cost of Pounds 2.8m, creating 40 jobs.
This welcome news has been offset, however, by other less favourable
announcements. British Coal is closing two of the last three pits in the
Welsh valleys, with the loss of 700 jobs, BP has put a question mark over
one of its chemical plants at Baglan Bay, Port Talbot, where 1,900 are
employed, and companies such as Panasonic, AB Electronics and Hoover have
introduced lay-offs or short-time working.
Success and failure go hand in hand in Wales in 1992. The long road from an
economy based on heavy, smoke-stack industries to a diversified, modern
industrial base has been largely completed. Wales is now a country in which
financial services, motor parts, processed foods, electronics and
information technology are established sectors. The country has the highest
percentage of small businesses and start-ups, relative to population, of any
part of the UK. Management buy-outs are continuing at a healthy pace, says
3i, the investment capital group.
It is this change in the economy that has led commentators to suggest that
the principality will be the first part of the UK to take advantage of the
upturn in the economy when it comes.
'People have kept their nerve here,' says Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the
Welsh Development Agency, set up in 1976 to rejuvenate the economy. 'In the
recession of the early 1980s, confidence went as unemployment and closures
rose. This time, although the recession has checked our economic momentum,
people are confident of what they can do when times get better.'
Mr Brian Morgan, the agen
cy's chief economist, points out that manufacturing output has fallen by
just 2 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1988 and the second quarter of
this year, compared with 20 per cent between the second quarter of 1979 and
the last three months of 1982. This time, unemployment has gone up by 2 per
cent, against 130 per cent a decade ago. And in some areas, such as business
services, Welsh growth exceeded that in the rest of the UK between 1985 and
1992 by 15 percentage points.
Mr Keith James, chairman of solicitors, Eversheds Phillips &amp; Buck in
Cardiff, says there has been considerable resilience during the recession.
'Manufacturing has continued to expand,' he says, and the corporate and
services infrastructure has remained strong.'
Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster bank, believes Wales
will lead a weak UK recovery. 'The Welsh economy will register a small rise
in economic growth of 0.1 per cent this year,' he says, 'in contrast to
fairly large outright declines in London and the rest of southern England.
'Next year, Wales's output growth, forecast at 1.7 per cent, will continue
to outperform the national average. The resilience of the Welsh economy in
the face of the longest, and one of the most severe British recessions, is
remarkable,' he argues.
Much of that resilience has come from the inflow of investment. The capital
inflow last year topped Pounds 1bn, according to Dr Jones, twice the level
achieved a decade ago. A Canadian company, Fisher Gauge, has chosen mid
Wales, and a Singapore concern, Mayor-Sakata, is already in production in
Merthyr Tydfil. The Gooding group has announced a further joint venture with
Japan's Sanken for electronics expansion and Ford is to put another Pounds
100m into its Bridgend engine plant. Tesco is to build its largest UK
distribution depot outside Newport.
Yet, for all the confidence being expressed in Wales's resilience, the
recession, if, prolonged much further, will undoubtedly be very damaging. A
survey just published by accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows that
two-thirds of Welsh businesses have suffered significant reductions in
turnover, three-quarters have seen their margins come under severe pressure,
and half have had to lay off workers. Contrary to the more optimistic
assessment being made elsewhere, Coopers' partner in charge in Cardiff, Mr
Hywel Jones, is one of those who believe there has been a significant
reduction in confidence in the future.
An earlier Western Mail/Touche Ross survey similarly concluded that business
confidence had been severely dented this year. Mr Robert Ellis, senior
Cardiff partner with the accountants, has gone so far as to describe the
collapse of confidence as 'startling and dramatic, indicating bad news for
the economy for the foreseeable future.'
Another Cardiff-based accountant, Mr Hugh Thomas, senior partner of Price
Waterhouse, claims that while Wales has fared better than areas such as the
south-east of England, the effect of a post-election buzz has been was
short-lived.
'Wales still has a long way to go towards achieving prosperity,' he states.
The position is unlikely to get better for 18 months, suggests Mr Paul
Sheldon, chief executive of the South Glamorgan TEC.
The benefits being achieved by schemes such as the Valleys Initiative of
former secretary of state, Peter Walker, have also been called into
question. A recent report by two Cardiff academics argues that the
initiative was largely a marketing exercise, packaging together policies and
projects already in existence, without the substantial extra funds needed to
make it work.
Unemployment in a number of towns such as Holyhead, Merthyr Tydfil,
Aberdare, Haverfordwest, Bangor and Llanelli hovers around the 20 per cent
mark, while low pay continues to be a depressant, a consequence in part of
the large numbers employed in the public sector. Nor are the problems
confined to the older industrial areas. Agriculture remains depressed with
farm incomes last year, while marginally higher than in 1990, still 25 per
cent down on 1989 levels. Meanwhile, tourism in south Wales has been helped
by the highly successful garden festival in Ebbw Vale.
The Institute of Welsh Affairs, an independent think-tank, has set up a
steering group, Wales 2010, to try to chart an economic development plan
which will equip Wales for self-sustaining growth in the 21st century. Its
chairman, Mr Gareth Jones, says the group is 'seeking to develop a
successful strategic intent and direction for Wales, which will not only
produce a significantly higher GDP but also improve the quality of life.' It
is a direction everyone in Wales wants to travel.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Institutions increase demand
for LME metal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW and volatile source of demand for London Metal Exchange metals has
arrived because more financial institutions are investing in commodities,
according to Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economic adviser at RTZ Corporation,
the world's largest mining company.
He says: 'Given the size of the metal markets, only a small shift in fund
investment could push prices up substantially.'
Compared with other financial markets, the LME was relatively small, he
said. The total value of all the exchange's metal stocks was only Dollars
2.2bn at the start of 1992 and Dollars 3.4bn in late August.
'The total cost of buying up existing stocks of some individual metals would
be relatively low, although only a portion would be needed to influence the
market.'
In a paper which RTZ will present to analysts and investment fund managers,
Mr Crowson says it has been suggested that the financial institutions start
investing in commodities for the first time for ten to 15 years to diversify
their portfolios.
'In practice, the prospective returns from price appreciation have appeared
considerable when compared with likely returns from alternative assets.'
Investment interest has helped to drive LME turnover - which is much greater
than the value of its stocks - to record levels this year,
Mr Crowson, who is an LME director, says: 'This is fine as long as the
institutions pay more than lip service to portfolio asset management, but
not if they become mesmerised by patterns of prices on charts.
'The recent experiences of the gold market show the potential dangers of
changing investment fashions.'
But the development of more complex trading strategies, linked largely to
the growth of options markets, and the transfer of precious metals market
experience to base metals suggests 'there may have been a stepwise change in
behaviour.

Brazil exported 1.3m sacks of coffee in August, down from 2.2m for the same
month last year, according to figures from the Brazilian Federation of
Coffee Exporters (FEBEC). Due to record low prices, receipts were off even
more sharply, at Dollars 64.3m for the month, compared to Dollars 151.4m
last year.
Despite lower monthly export figures, volume for the first eight months saw
a 0.6 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, standing at
11.6m sacks. Again, depressed prices hurt income, down 23.1 per cent. This
year's receipts through August were Dollars 700.8m, down from Dollars 911.5m
for the same period in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA has unveiled a package of incentives to improve the commercial
viability of developing gas fields and to entice production companies to
explore frontier areas for oil.
The package allows a more rapid depreciation of the capital costs of
developing gas fields, while increasing the production companies' share of
'equity' gas - the gas produced after the current costs of production have
been deducted.
Companies signing new conventional contract areas will receive 35 per cent,
up from 30 per cent, of equity gas, with the rest taken by Pertamina,
Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas utility. In frontier areas, companies
will receive 40-45 per cent of equity gas, depending on water depth.
For companies operating existing contracts the equity split is unchanged,
except for deep water frontier areas where the split is increased from 30
per cent to 40 per cent.
The package does not increase the price paid by Pertamina for gas of about
Dollars 2 per million cubic feet. Oil executives say the price must be
raised if sufficient gas is to be developed to satisfy growing demand,
mainly from power generators.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN tea industry is expecting the federal government to release a
fresh tranche of technical credit of Dollars 38m (Pounds 17m) to Russia in
order to enable it to buy about 19m kg of tea.
The government has acceded to the tea industry's plea to sanction further
technical credit following Russia's agreement to supply between 800,000
tonnes and 1m tonnes of crude oil from November.
The Russian buyers will be returning to the auction centres in north and
south India next week mainly to buy bolder CTC brokens, orthodox and medium
Darjeeling teas.
Since the prices of all varieties of tea fell sharply following the Russian
withdrawal from the auctions in the third week of August, their return is
expected to boost market sentiment.
Russia, which until its withdrawal had purchased about 16m kg of tea using a
technical credit of Dollars 32m, is to buy 65m kg of tea this year under the
trade protocol.
Although tea sale to Russia has been deadlocked, Indian tea sales for
re-export to Russia have increased, according to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman
for brokers. Indian tea export to Poland in the current year is expected to
be 20m kg, against 12m kg last year.
The Indian tea industry is hopeful of finalising an agreement with Iran
shortly for the export of 2.5m kg of packet tea. Iran has already bought 15m
kg of bulk tea from India and it is believed India may sell it a further 8m
kg of packet tea this year.
Meanwhile, India's tea output in the first seven months of 1992 declined by
nearly 28m kg to 326m kg. With high temperatures slowing down tea plucking
in Assam and West Bengal, this year's tea crop could be as low as 690m kg,
against last year's record crop of 741.7m kg.

A rapid afternoon rally in the dollar caused some irregular price movements
in BASE METALS on the LME after their generally firmer trend in the morning.
The ERM realignment and German interest rate cut reduced upward pressure on
European interest rates and raised hopes of economic recovery. But a
simultaneous strengthening of the dollar made prices more expensive in local
currency terms and buyers, at present, did not appear to be willing to
chase. Dealers noted a copper strike threat in Poland and Alcan's potlines
reopening, but currency was the main focus of attention. TIN moved sharply
ahead as short covering triggered buy stops in a thin market. But unless
there is a matching gain in Kuala Lumpur, prices could struggle to maintain
these levels today. In Chicago SOYABEANS were trading sharply higher in late
afternoon trading on commission house and fund buying as fears of frost
supported the market. New York COTTON futures were higher on uncertainty
over how much of Pakistan's crop will be lost to widespread flooding.
PRECIOUS METALS remained steady in Europe as prices continued to consolidate
after Monday's sharp gains.

for Bush support
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration, which has been showering money on US farmers in a bid
to win votes in the crucial Mid-western states, is finding that the price of
their support may be more than the president can afford.
Mr Bush's most dramatic offering to his farm constituents was his
announcement earlier this month that subsidies would be made available under
the Export Enhancement Programme for an additional 1.1bn bushels of wheat.
The announcement, which outraged other wheat-producing countries, came one
week after leaders of national wheat organisations met Mr Edward Madigan,
the US agriculture secretary, to complain about the EEP programme.
Mr Madison Angell, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers,
said: 'We told the secretary that action was needed to get markets moving in
the right direction. Our prices have dropped nearly Dollars 1 a bushel since
the beginning of the year, and the government's passive use of the EEP is
one of the problems.'
The initiative was extended to 28 countries, but wheat lobbyists remained
unsatisfied. In its newsletter, US Wheat Associates said it was
'unfortunate' that countries such as Mexico, Indonesia and Colombia had not
been included.
They said the president was 'bowing' to Canadian and Australian requests to
leave these markets 'out of US wheat farmers' reach'.
The White House has had other goodies for the farmers. On Monday it
announced a Dollars 1.15bn food assistance package to Russia, including
Dollars 250m in aid and Dollars 900m in credit guarantees to the end of
February. Farm lobbyists had requested Dollars 1bn in credit guarantees.
President Bush has also made available Dollars 755m in emergency funding for
farm disasters for winter grain producers to cover 1992 harvest losses. That
might have been enough before Hurricane Andrew wreaked havoc upon Florida
and Louisiana, where damage estimates are at least Dollars 3bn.
Meanwhile, some farmers are less than enthusiastic about the North American
Free Trade Agreement. The fruit and vegetable growers in Florida failed to
receive exemption from the pact.

WORLD commodity prices are expected to rise about 7 per cent in 1993, while
fuel prices could climb 9 per cent, according to a UN study, Reuter reports
from Geneva.
However, petroleum prices may be constrained by a potential output increase
from new capacity and by quota disagreements in OPEC.
The United Nations Trade and Development Conference (UNCTAD) said in an
annual Trade and Development Report that export prices for primary
commodities may rise by about 1 per cent in 1992, after falling about 11 per
cent last year,
Food prices should prove the firmest, led by higher demand for cereals in
central and eastern Europe and in sub-Saharan Africa.
Cotton prices are expected to drop sharply because of record output and
moderate consumption this year.
Although prices of mineral raw materials are declining, and are expected to
rise only slightly on average in 1993, non-ferrous metal prices are expected
to rise steeply after declines this year.
The UNCTAD report said prospects for tin prices appeared 'particularly
promising if production cutbacks continue'.

Yukon this month.
Top of the agenda will be a report on the investment climate in Canada by a
government-industry task force. The report, not yet made public, will
confirm that Canadian mining companies are cutting exploration budgets at
home while increasing investment elsewhere.
'It's not that the bottom is falling out, but there's a drift away from
Canada's attractiveness,' says Mr George Miller, president of the Canadian
Mining Association in Ottawa.
Others are more forthright. Mr Jim O'Rourke, president of Princeton Mining
of Vancouver and chairman of the British Columbia Mining Association,
complained in a recent speech that 'the resource industries of the province
have been milked and drained to support costly government programmes and a
standard of living which makes our operations uncompetitive in international
markets.'
Evidence of mining companies' unhappiness with the business climate in
Canada is not hard to find. Falconbridge, the big nickel producer, has
closed its exploration office in Vancouver and moved five employees and
their families to Santiago, Chile. A growing number of junior mining
companies listed on the Vancouver stock exchange have their operations
outside Canada.
About 40 Canadian mining companies are now active in Chile, helping to make
Canada the biggest foreign investor there in 1991. Others have gone to the
US, Mexico, Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. 'The exodus is now in full
swing,' said Mr Robert Holbauer, Cominco's president, in a speech earlier
this year.
The discontent is greatest in Ontario and British Columbia, which are both
ruled by interventionist, social-democratic governments. By contrast, Mr
Claude Drouin, general manager of the Quebec Mining Association, says
companies in the francophone province have a 'fairly good relationship' with
the government. Manitoba recently unveiled incentives, including cash
grants, to encourage exploration.
The list of complaints is long, but can be grouped into three main
categories: high taxes, lengthy delays in getting projects off the ground,
and increasingly rigorous environmental assessments.
The tax burden on mining companies in Canada is among the highest in the
world. But the industry is especially critical of a lengthening list of
government levies which bear no relation to profits.
These include licensing fees, fuel taxes and the spiralling cost of funding
workers' compensation claims. The Ontario Mining Association estimates that
its members are exposed to a CDollars 1bn unfunded liability in the
province's workers' compensation fund. Muncipalities in the province went a
step further recently by suggesting that they be allowed to levy property
taxes on underground facilities as if they were on the surface. Sandy Laird,
senior vice-president of Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based gold producer,
said earlier this year that 'the probability is that future changes will
increase, not decrease, the tax burden for the mining industry. From the
point of view of tax, British Columbia must be counted as a high-risk
region.'
The industry also frets about long delays in the approval process for new
mines without any assurance that, in the end, the projects will be allowed
to go ahead. Mr O'Rourke gives the example of a relatively small garnet
quarry in British Columbia, where the provincial government has insisted on
a study on markets and competitors before it allows construction to proceed.
Placer Dome estimates that the project-approval process lasts an average of
more than two years in BC compared to about a year in Nevada and Papua New
Guinea, six months in Australia and virtually no delay at all in Chile.
'The stonewalling is the worst of it,' says a Falconbridge official.
Besides the usual criticism about bureaucratic inefficiency, applications
for mining rights are invariably bogged down by environmental concerns and
by disputed aboriginal land claims.
'We're not against the environment,' says Mr Drouin in Quebec, 'but it's
difficult to break a rock without creating dust and making a noise.''
The most bitter battle is taking place over the Windy Craggy property,
located amid the spectacular mountains of northwest BC Geddes Resources of
Toronto has spent some CDollars 50m evaluating what appears to be Canada's
biggest copper and cobalt deposit.
But the provincial parks service and environmental groups throughout North
America are pushing hard to kill the project before a mine is built.
Mining executives acknowledge that their complaints might be less strident
if commodity prices - and therefore profits - were higher, or share prices
stronger. According to a Price Waterhouse study, mines in British Columbia,
lost CDollars 1.04bn in 1990 and another CDollars 485m last year.
But the companies also say some concerns have little to do with the business
cycle. Mr Holbauer said in his last annual report that other countries were
seeking to attract mining investment through changes to ownership laws,
lower tax rates and minimising red tape.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (8): A significant boost for tourism - 'The
garden festival factor' helps to attract visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WALES Tourist Board is calling it 'the garden festival factor.' Hotel
and guest houses bookings in Wales were 2 per cent up in July, compared with
last year, as against a decline of 6 per cent in England and a 2 per cent
fall in Scotland, according to the most recently published figures.
Paul Loveluck, chief executive of the WTB, is in no doubt that the
government-backed annual Garden Festival, located this year at Ebbw Vale in
the south Wales valleys, has given a significant boost to Welsh tourism
activity and helped shield sections of the industry from the worst of the
recession.
The festival has been huge success. Despite the weather - rainfall in August
was 81 per cent above average - it is well on its way towards meeting its
target of 2m visitors. Hotels and guest houses in south and mid Wales were
reporting a 6 per cent increase in occupancy in July, whereas in north Wales
the figures were indicating a 6 per cent drop in bookings, Mr Loveluck
explains.
Tourism has long been a key component of the Welsh economy. During the 1980s
it assumed even greater importance, as employment in Wales' traditional
industries contracted. These days the industry generates a total revenue of
about Pounds 1.3bn annually, and supports about 95,000 jobs, or 9 per cent
of all employment in Wales. Between 1982 and 1987, tourism created an
average of about 1,500 jobs per annum.
In 1990, the number of visits to Wales by domestic tourists fell back
sharply to 8.3m from 9.4m the previous year. However, last year there was a
recovery to 8.7m visits, on top of which there were some 640,000 overseas
visitors who spent an estimated Pounds 130m, and an estimated 32m leisure
trips by day visitors whose expenditure is calculated at around Pounds 229m.
As these figures indicate, the Wales tourist industry has clearly not
escaped the effects of the recession. In particular, outside the hotels and
guest-house sector, the signs are that things are getting worse.
During June, holiday caravan park bookings fell sharply by a worrying 14 per
cent. The number of visitors to tourist attractions was also 10 per cent
down during the same month from 1.26m to 1.16m. In terms of volume, the
recession is catching up with us, Mr Loveluck admits.
However, he stresses that at this stage the industry is neither alarmed nor
downhearted. To start with, the drop in visitors to traditional tourist
attractions is due in part to the fact that many end-of-term school trips
which normally boost visitor numbers in June, were this year diverted to the
garden festival.
But the garden festival promises also to have a beneficial effect long-term.
Some 70 per cent of visitors to Ebbw Vale said they intended coming back to
Wales. Information on these visitors is being incorporated into the WTB's
data- base for use in future marketing campaigns.
Second, the industry has been enjoying good levels of investment. Since June
1988, grants and loans awarded by the WTB under section 4 of the 1969
Tourism Act have generated a total of some Pounds 120m in capital investment
projects designed to improve the quality and range of Wales's tourist
facilities.
Third, the Welsh Office has authorised the Board to step up investment
incentives in the farmhouse and guesthouse sector, with a view to
maintaining capital investment improvements in the recession. Some Pounds
1.25m has been earmarked for enhanced capital grants over the next 18
months. The average rate of grant will be 30 per cent of project cost, but
up to 50 per cent will be available towards the cost of electronic equipment
necessary for today's successful tourist business, such as computers, faxes,
and telephone answering machines. This scheme was announced in July and the
number of enquiries is already been encouraging.
A fourth ground for optimism is the success of Wales's Welcome Host scheme.
Welcome Host is a network of 70 trainers who offer a one day training module
to assist whole communities to make visitors to Wales feel more welcome.
The idea originated in British Colombia in 1986 as the Super Host scheme at
the Vancouver Expo. It crossed the Pacific to become New Zealand's Kiwi Host
scheme, but Wales is the first country in Europe to introduce this new idea
in customer care.
Aimed at all who come into contact with visitors, the beneficiaries of the
Welcome Host training programme include the staff at Garden Festival Wales,
some 200 Cardiff taxi drivers and staff of the Midland Bank in Wales.
Marks and Spencer is among the companies which are about to sign up on
behalf of their staff. Such has been the interest in the scheme, the WTB is
planning to hold a seminar later this year to explain its principles to
organisations from other parts of the UK. In the meantime, the WTB has made
attendance on a Welcome Host course a condition of any financial assistance.
Fifth, the Welsh Office has made an extra Pounds 2.5m a year available over
the next three years to increase the WTB's marketing activities. Some Pounds
1.7m of the total is earmarked for image building in the north-west,
Midlands, M4 corridor and the south-east.
Using both poster and TV advertising, the board's campaign will highlight
Wales's striking scenery, peace and tranquility, and easy paced
sophistication. It will be particularly aimed at those people who do not at
present put Wales on their holiday shopping list.
One of the strengths of the Welsh tourist industry is that it has a very
loyal customer base. Visitors come back time and again for their holidays.
And response rates from recent marketing campaigns have been exceptionally
good. The board commissioned a tracking survey in 1990 and established that
45 per cent of people who asked for a copy of its holiday brochure
subsequently came to Wales for a holiday.
In these circumstances, there will be no let up in the board's direct mail
effort. The board has 1.5m names on its direct mail data-base and is
continually adding to it by buying in fresh data, confident that it knows
enough about the Wales tourist industry's customer profile to improve its
response rate.
Last but not least, the decision of the government to grant the Wales
Tourist Board the same overseas marketing powers as the Scottish Tourist
Board is also a welcome boost for the industry. The board intends to
continue working in close co-operation with the British Tourist Board.
However, the new powers will enable the board, for example, to work in
cooperation with the Welsh Development Agency on joint promotions.
A start is being made this autumn when the two organisations take advantage
of a concert tour by the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra to Paris, Amsterdam
and Brussels, to promote the virtues of Wales for both business and pleasure
in three key European markets.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (9): New approach to nation's heritage -
Growing public interest in historic sites, treasure trove and works of art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSTANDING additions continue to be made to the national heritage of Wales,
whether it be the 210m-year-old dinosaur footprints found two years ago near
Barry, the three outstanding Bronze Age gold torcs recently uncovered near
Milford Haven, or the ever-expanding remains of Roman and Romano-British
life still being excavated at the legionary fort of Caerleon and the nearby
Roman town of Caerwent.
Yet, although Wales has long been a treasure trove for those interested in
learning about man and his accomplishments, the ways in which much of the
information has been presented has - with some notable exceptions - often
been as likely to discourage as to encourage the casual observer from
inquiring further.
The revolution that has now taken place in the way Wales's past is being
presented is the result of a number of factors happily co-inciding.
Interest in the past has grown, fostered by books, articles in the press and
television programmes. At the same time, growth in visitors during the 1980s
has brought with it a rising demand for access to historic monuments and
other buildings, including relics of Britain's great industrial era,
developments in which Wales was at the forefront.
The two main bodies in Wales charged with preserving and interpreting the
nation's heritage, the National Museum, and Cadw, the equivalent of English
Heritage, have responded to this challenge with a re-think both in attitudes
and approach, as, too, have a number of private owners. The National Museum
has been nursed back to financial health by its new director, Mr Alistair
Wilson, who has overseen an investment programme designed to make the museum
one of the finest in Europe.
Under this, the main building in Cardiff's Cathays Park, the foundation
stone for which was laid by George V in 1926, will finally be completed next
October, when the last stages of a Pounds 26m scheme, doubling its size, are
finished.
This will add a further six centre block galleries, totaling 85,000 sq ft,
to two new galleries recently completed in the east wing, giving the museum
the space it has long needed to display its collections to the full and to
the highest standards.
The museum will, as a result, be able to mount for the first time a
comprehensive display of art, including its renowned Impressionist
collection, (the bequest of two Welsh sisters Gwendoline and Margaret
Davies), other older works and its paintings by Welsh artists such as
Richard Wilson, Thomas Jones, Augustus and Gwen John, and Ceri Richards.
Other developments made possible by the large increase in space are a new
Welsh ceramics gallery to house the museum's extensive collection of
Nantgarw and Swansea porcelain.
A number of important additions have recently been made to this from the
Pounds 1.1m auction of the collection of Sir Leslie Joseph, the Welsh former
vice-chairman of Trusthouse Forte.
Though some critics have accused the museum of an excessively conservative
approach, and of failing to pay enough attention to Wales's indigenous
cultural heritage, the result is an impressive addition to the visual arts
in Wales,
Ahead of these latest developments, the museum has been attracting greatly
increased numbers of visitors through imaginative temporary exhibitions,
sometimes shared with other museums elsewhere in Europe and often designed
to appeal specifically to younger people.
A successful dinosaur exhibition has been followed by another on the Ice Age
featuring woolly mammoths. The museum was also one of the venues for a
touring exhibition of the Queen's Windsor Castle collection of paintings,
and last year produced its biggest ever temporary exhibition, on the Celts
in Wales, much of it using material usually stored.
This policy has helped to attract more than 200,000 people to the main
museum annually, enabling it to recover from a sharp downturn after the
introduction of charges in 1989.
Total visitors to all the museum's sites - which include a north Wales
branch, Oriel Eryri, and specialist museums on Welsh folklife and on various
aspects of Wales's industrial past at locations around Wales - are running
at around 800,000 a year, with a target for this to grow to 1m.
A new permanent exhibition on Man and the Environment exemplifies the move
away from the traditional glass-case approach.
This brings together a number of the museum's exhibits, including the
largest Leatherback Turtle ever found - washed ashore on Harlech beach in
north Wales - and uses the latest audio-visual techniques.
Cadw (the Welsh word for save) was set up in 1984 to take over the
management of 127 historic monuments and buildings (out of a total of 2,700
altogether in Wales) in the care of the secretary of state.
It also carries out a range of statutory responsibilities for preserving,
conserving and promoting the Principality's built inheritance.
An executive agency of the Welsh Office since 1991, Cadw has, like the
museum, sought to inject greater energy into the presentation and
preservation of Wales's past.
Visitor centres, which put developments their historical context, have been
added at the main monuments and a survey is being undertaken at all the
sites in Cadw's care to see how they should best be presented to the public.
At the bigger sites permanent exhibitions and seasonal events have been
introduced, together with shops offering relevant, and where possible,
locally-made, products.
Acquisitions of important sites continue to be made. Cadw has recently
acquired Plas Mawr in the heart of Conwy's walled town, the finest surviving
example of a 16th century town house in Wales.
Formerly owned by Lord Mostyn and leased to the Royal Cambrian Academy of
Art,the building contains a fine Jacobean ceiling, and, when the first stage
of restoration is completed in 1995, it will be presented as it appeared
about 1700.
Cadw is also responsible for administering in Wales applications for grant
assistance for historic buildings.
Among its biggest beneficiaries is the National Trust, which received more
than Pounds 1m. last year towards the cost of maintaining its properties.
Cadw's attention is also being focused on townscapes within urban
conservation areas. Though lacking the mediaeval buildings which are feature
of many historic English towns, Wales is full of interesting Victorian
buildings and streets, the virtues of which are in many cases only belatedly
being recognised. Last year grants worth some Pounds 646,000, funded jointly
by Cadw and local authorities, were made in support of 23 town schemes.
Working through four regional archaeological trusts, Cadw also provides
finance for rescue digs at sites throughout Wales. The Second Severn
crossing, east of Newport has already proved to be a rich source of
discoveries from palaeolithic, bronze age and Roman times, including what
could be bronze age fish traps.
Sadly, in two important areas, Wales's more recent past continues to
disappear or suffer grievous damage. The decline in religious observance and
the movement of population from older industrial areas has left many of
Wales's fine chapels high and dry, or converted to unsuitable uses, such as
tyre depots or carpet warehouses.
The vast miners'institutes, complete with libraries and a range of social
and other function rooms, which dominated former pit communities, are also
now largely disused, though one at least is being moved from Oakdale, in
Gwent, to a new home at the Welsh Folk Museum in St. Fagans.
The help Cadw can provide, however, is limited. Because most of the
buildings remain in private hands, their only safeguard is listed building
status, and where no viable future use can be found this is very often not
enough to prevent demolition.
Because of the nature of its attractions Cadw is probably more dependent on
overseas visitors than the National Museum and the past financial year has
been disappointing, Cadw's chief executive, John Carr, admits. With fewer
American visitors last year because of the Gulf War, total admissions to
Cadw properties fell by 11.7 per cent to just under 1.3m, with revenue also
slightly down.
There are still hopes for a recovery in the present year, though the high
sterling-dollar relationship and poor August weather may well prevent this.
The improvement that has taken place in the facilities on offer seems likely
to have laid much of the groundwork, however, for a strong recovery when the
economy does pick up again.

FT  16 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS another heavy trading session in the derivatives market yesterday.
This time, however, sentiment turned sharply into reverse as sterling fell
and the City of London flinched at the possibility that UK base rates might
have to rise after all. Traders in stock index futures, where the premium on
the December over the September contract remained at recent levels, said
there was no heavy selling. 'It was more like Chinese torture,' commented
one.
By the close, futures traders agreed with their colleagues in the stock
market that the odds were now heavily on a rise in UK interest rates.
Turnover in September totalled 17,634 contracts and the price slid in tandem
with the FT-SE Index itself, closing at 2,363, a discount of about seven
points. September expires on Friday and dealers were again busy rolling
positions over into the December quotation.
In traded options, turnover remained high, at 33,293 contracts, albeit
slightly under Monday's total. The FT-SE option attracted good business,
recording 15,459 contracts, and the Euro-FT-SE was also active, on 1,313
lots.
BTR, regarded as vulnerable to higher interest rates, topped the actives
list with 3,511 contracts dealt.

FT  16 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: CU dips on share sale hints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD suggestions that Sun Alliance had sold its near 15 per cent stake
in Commercial Union were still unproven at the market close yesterday, but
many traders believe that such a deal is not far away.
A quiet opening in Commercial Union shares changed dramatically as the stock
fell on suggestions that Sun Alliance had sold its CU holding via a bought
deal. CU shares dropped from 509p to 490p as a series of rumours swirled
around the market early in the session. However, a spokesman for Sun
Alliance declined to comment.
One suggestion was that Sun Alliance had sold its holding of around 60m
shares to one of the big US investment banks at 470p a share, and that the
bank was attempting to place the stock with institutions. Another variation
was that Sun Alliance's joint brokers, SG Warburg and Cazenove, were
attempting a placing of the shares.
However, the Seaq ticker produced no evidence of a large deal in CU shares,
which ended the session 27 off at 483p on turnover of 2.9m. Sun Alliance
eased 3 to 254p.
Sun Alliance acquired the bulk of its CU shareholding in August 1989 when it
bought a 13 per cent stake, some 55m shares, from Adelaide Steamship, the
Australian group then controlled by Mr John Spalvins. It paid 465p a share
for what has been described as a 'long term friendly holding'.
Arjo Wiggins shock
Recent worries that Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper group, would struggle
to achieve half-year profits of Pounds 100m, against Pounds 135.5m last
time, paled into insignificance as the company stunned the market by
chopping its interim payment. To make matters worse Arjo said it believed
the final dividend would be cut by a similar proportion. The profits figure
came to Pounds 99m.
The market had braced itself for the steep reduction in interim profits,
with estimates said to have been as low as Pounds 95m, but none of the
London-based analysts had factored in a lower dividend. Dealers said
analysts had already begun to hack at their full-year forecasts, with many
shaving estimates by upwards of Pounds 20m.
Arjo stock was easily the Footsie's and the market's worst individual
performer, plunging nearly 30 per cent to close 53 down at 129p, by far the
lowest level since the company's June 1990 demerger from BAT Ind-ustries.
Volume reached 20m.
Gas offers
British Gas gave a notably sluggish display as dealers picked up hints that
a number of hefty lines of stock were making an appearance in the market.
There were suggestions that the stock on offer came from institutions that
were beginning to question the commercial viability of the transportation of
gas from the UK group's joint venture in Khazakstan.
The Khazakstan gas story was behind a good run in British Gas shares earlier
this year. By the close, the stock was 4 1/2 off at 230 1/2 p on turnover of
6.1m shares.
The big banks moved with the market, Barclays sliding 13 to 310p and Royal
Bank of Scotland, where there was exceptionally heavy trading, 8 to 148p.
Legal &amp; General, where the market is still haunted by worries about domestic
mortgage indemnity losses, retreated 13 to 317p.
The international/pharmaceutical sectors gave up some of Monday's big gains
as the market preferred to focus on the sharp fall on Wall Street in early
trading yesterday rather than on renewed weakness in sterling against the
dollar. Glaxo settled 14 off at 776p and Wellcome fell 17 to 867p.
The oil market was brooding over the possibility that yet more earnings
downgrades for BP may be on the way. BP shares eased 2 to 202 1/2 p on 6.2m
shares. Shell, in spite of the recent good dividend, lost 5 1/2 to 476 1/2
p.
Retailing group Kingfisher had a good session after reporting figures at the
top end of market expectations. At the day's high the shares were up 11 at
485p, but came back with the market to close unchanged at 474p after volume
of 3.6m. Dixons slipped 7 to 202p, with Kleinwort Benson reported to have
advised investors to switch out of the stock and into Kingfisher.
Profit-taking left Rank Organisation 13 down at 455p. Motor repair group
Kwik-Fit continued to suffer from Monday's release of disappointing
half-time figures. The shares shed 7 to 89p, with BZW said to have joined
other brokers that have downgraded expectations for the company's full year.
Inchcape retreated 11 to 409p on profit-taking.
In the hotel sector, chunky sellers were again seen in Queens Moat Houses,
which eased 2 to 34p in trade of 6.2m shares.
Granada Group lost 15 to 220p, with County NatWest reported to be the day's
main seller. Turnover came to 4.9m. Thorn EMI ended 13 off at 657p in
sympathy with Granada.
USM-quoted travel and tour operator Airbreak Leisure Group plummeted 13 1/2
to 10 1/2 p in reaction to Monday's announcement after the market close of
interim losses, the passing of the dividend, a profits warning about the
full year and the resignation of the chairman and finance director.
Cadbury Schweppes was among a handful of stocks to buck the market trend.
The shares firmed 2 to 432p as bid speculation once again did the rounds.
Food retailers were friendless throughout the session, retreating more than
the general market in percentage terms. Tesco declined 7 to 208p in trade of
4.9m shares, while Argyll fell 13 to 314p and J. Sainsbury 10 to 426p.
Delta's interim figures disappointed the market, sending the shares plunging
25 to 353p. AB Electronics, after the losses and dividend omission, dropped
10 to 47p.
International conglomerate BTR saw busy trading of 6.8m shares as the stock
shed 4 to 444p. It was also active in the traded options market, the
equivalent of more than 3m shares being dealt.
Concern about the outlook for British Aerospace returned to upset the
shares, which weakened 15 to 198p.
A profits downgrading sent Simon Engineering tumbling 33 to 138p, making it
one of the day's worst performing stocks in percentage terms. Smith New
Court cut its current year forecast by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 13.4m, citing a
lack of recovery in the company's Access operation in the US.

FT  16 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities slide on interest rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPTIMISM kindled in the UK stock market by the reductions in German
interest rates was quashed yesterday by sterling's fall to within a hair's
breadth of its permitted ERM low, which brought renewed fears that UK base
rates might have to be pushed up sharply to protect the pound.
A slide in share prices gathered pace towards the close and the FT-SE Index
ended 52 points down as the market resounded with suggestions that UK rates
could be forced higher by two percentage points without waiting for the
Maastricht referendum in France this weekend.
City analysts at the leading securities firms were summoned to meetings
after trading hours last night. Nerves came in for further testing following
reports that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had cancelled plans to
return to the Continental holiday interrupted by the Bundesbank's actions
last weekend; and also after unconfirmed rumours of crisis meetings at
either the Bank of England or at Downing Street.
The day's loss of 52.1 on the Footsie wiped out Monday's gain and left the
index at 2,370 last night. The big institutions, having taken the
opportunity to sell into a firm market on Monday, appeared to be less active
yesterday. Seaq volume, which increased towards the end of the session when
sterling was challenging its ERM low and the Bank of England was believed to
be supporting the UK currency, totalled 507.3m shares. Monday's Seaq
turnover of 537.9m shares reflected retail business worth Pounds 971.7m,
still on the low side.
With City analysts and the investment press taking a negative view of the
likely effects of the Bundesbank's rates cut, the UK stock market made a
gloomy start to the day. 'The writing was on the wall as soon as we saw the
Footsie open six points off after Wall Street had climbed 70 points
overnight,' commented one leading dealer.
The Footsie 2,400 mark melted away and occasional pauses to test support
levels invariably crumbled in the face of the market's negative sentiment.
Widespread falls in government bonds and persistent pressure on stock index
futures left equities to close virtually at their lowest levels of the day.
Nomura's Nicholas Knight, the spokesman for the bears, described the
Bundesbank's actions as no more than an anaesthetic for the financial
markets. 'The anaesthetic will wear off,' he warned clients yesterday
morning.
The fear that UK interest rates would be forced higher outweighed other
considerations, including Wall Street's overnight strength and even the
suggestion of a sterling devaluation, which also circulated in the financial
markets.
Building and construction shares, the chief casualties from high base rates,
lost more than the cautious gains achieved on Monday.
The international stocks brushed aside Wall Street's Monday upsurge, which
was reversed early in the new session when the Dow slipped 29 points. BAT
Industries, Glaxo and Wellcome were cut back as investors in the London
market dived for cover.

FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Soft economy and falling
bonds hit Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SHARE prices on Wall Street retreated sharply yesterday as the market's
earlier euphoria over Germany's interest rates cut faded and there was
further statistical evidence of the extremely sluggish performance of the US
economy, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Declining prices in the US Treasury bond market also aggravated sentiment in
the equity area, as did the conviction that interest rates in the UK and
elsewhere could remain high notwithstanding the Bundesbank's unusual action
on Monday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 48.90 down at 3,327.32, while
trading volume on the New York SE stood at 212m shares. At least part of the
Dow's decline was interpreted by dealers as a technical reaction to Monday's
70-point upsurge.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 5.50 to 419.77 and the Nasdaq composite
index was off 6.35 at 587.86.
Mr John Parasco, a senior vice-president of trading at Lehman Brothers in
New York, said stock prices had been weakened both by soft economic news and
by falling bond prices.
Among the macro-economic statistics released yesterday was a 0.5 per cent
decline in August retail sales, worse than expected. Consumer prices last
month were up by 0.3 per cent, in line with expectations.
The US current account deficit for the second quarter - Dollars 17bn - was
above expectations of a deficit of about Dollars 13bn or Dollars 14bn for
the quarter.
Disappointment at the rather slim cut in German interest rates and a sense
that the market had overreacted on Monday were key factors for equity
traders. The German rate cut at first came as a relief, but by yesterday
many in New York had come round to the view that the move did not offer any
long-term solutions.
Especially hard hit yesterday were share prices in the computer and airline
industries. Computer share prices were sinking yesterday after Amdahl
signalled that its products were suffering from weak demand and offered a
bleak earnings outlook. IBM weakened Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 85 1/2 .
Airline issues were down after Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR, the
parent of American Airlines, told analysts that the company's third-quarter
losses would exceed those already suffered in the second quarter. AMR
relinquished Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 .
Among the most active issues, AT&amp;T dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 on
about 2m shares traded, while General Motors lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 33
7/8 on volume of 1.6m shares. Canada
SOLID GAINS in gold shares limited the overall decline in Toronto as the
market pulled back from Monday's 30-point advance.
The TSE 300 index ended 6.3 off at 3,464.1 and declines led rises by 313 to
281 after volume of 30.5m shares valued at CDollars 317.7m.
Gold shares followed through on Monday's gains in gold futures, in spite of
a mild easing in Comex gold futures yesterday.
American Barrick put on CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 38 5/8 , Pegasus Gold
CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 21 1/2 , Hemlo Gold CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 10
1/8 and Placer Dome CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 12 7/8.

FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses backtrack after
reappraisal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND thoughts about the ERM realignment and the Bundesbank's interest rate
cuts weakened bourses progressively yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff,
with the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index losing just over one-half of the previous
day's gains.
MILAN seemed to get progressively worse. At the official close the Comit
index was 5.90, or 1.6 per cent down at 373.14, on a weak lira and worries
about Sunday's referendum in France.
After hours, computer trading was showing a 2.7 per cent loss after a
rumour, subsequently denied, that the Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano
Amato, had resigned; but this was mild compared with the 7.5 per cent drop,
in lira terms, in the Italian component of the FT-Actuaries World Index at
3.30pm, London time.
The London prices were measured from Monday's 3.30 close, reflecting an
extension of early enthusiasm after a rousing start on Wall Street. So the
falls were more severe. Among market leaders, Ferruzzi dropped by 9.9 per
cent on this basis, Mediobanca by 9.5, Olivetti by 9.1 and Fiat by 8 per
cent.
The worst fall of the day, again in London, was in Credito Italiano, one of
the market's privatisation prospects and down 13 per cent after a 29 per
cent gain on the Milan kerb on Monday. Nuovo Pignone, the other
privatisation prospect, was fixed locally at L5,000 after a Monday quote of
L3,410.
PARIS took profits as turnover retreated a little to FFr2.4bn. The CAC-40
index closed 37.45, or 2 per cent lower at 1,836.15 after an earlier high of
1,869.21.
Saint Louis was in focus after Arjo Wiggins of the UK, in which it holds a
39 per cent stake, said it was cutting its dividend. It fell FFr95, or 7.9
per cent to FFr1,109.
Financial sector stocks, which had been in the vanguard of Monday's rises,
shed much of those gains: Suez wasdown FFr11.20 at FFr256.80, and Societe
Generale by FFr20 at FFr541.
FRANKFURT consolidated after Monday's 4.4 per cent gain, the DAX index
closing 7.49 lower at 1,587.55 although there were indications of a fall of
more than 1 per cent overall in the London post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM7.4bn to DM5.4bn. London prices had the big three
chemicals around 1 1/2 per cent lower but a more distinctive approach to the
carmakers, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, down 0.6, 1.4 and 2.1 per cent
respectively, VW, perhaps, reflecting the earnings downgrade imposed on it
by Morgan Stanley less than two weeks ago.
ZURICH saw the blue-chip SMI index fall 20.3 to 1,851.4 as the city came
back from a day's holiday. On Monday the SMI gained 3.3 per cent in Basle
trading.
Activity centred on Nestle, major banks and chemicals. The improving Nestle
topped the active list, its registered shares closing a token SFr2 higher at
SFr977.
BRUSSELS closed lower although the metals sector managed gains. The Bel-20
index fell 12.29 or 1.1 per cent to 1,107.96 in turnover of BFr1bn. In
metals, Arbed gained BFr85 to BFr3,245, Clabecq BFr18 to BFr938 and Bekaert
BFr200 to BFr12,125 after announcing an increase in first half profits after
the close on Monday.
Union Miniere, due to release first half earnings after today's close,
slipped BFr85 or 4 per cent to BFr2,005.
AMSTERDAM fell in line with neighbouring markets as the 1993 budget
announcement generaly left investors unmoved. The CBS Tendency index shed
0.8 to 112.3.
Hoogovens lost a further Fl 3.10 to Fl 37.60 after announcing job cuts on
Monday while Philips bucked the trend with a 30 cents gain to Fl 24.50.
STOCKHOLM fell in heavy trading as investors took profits. The Affarsvarlden
index lost 14.8 to 745.1 in turnover of SKr599m.
Increases in money market rates contributed to nervousness while there was
renewed speculation about the stability of the coalition government.
Trading in Asea shares accounted for SKr162m of volume and its B shares
closed up SKr5 at SKr325.
OSLO fell 2.9 per cent after one-month money market rates were raised from
17 to 20.5 per cent. The all-share index fell 9.57 to 320.98 in turnover of
NKr157m. Norsk Hydro fell NKr4.5 to NKr138.5. HELSINKI saw bank shares
depressed on news that Unitas faced substantial credit losses from an
associated investment company. The HEX Index lost 3.22 to 586.15. Unitas
free shares fell 50 penni to FM2.9.
VIENNA took a 4.84 point loss on the ATX index to 799.20, off the intraday
high of 809.42. The insurer Erste Allgemeine, which forecast a good second
half, went against the trend, rising Sch45 to Sch1,770.
ISTANBUL eased by 1.7 per cent as investors took profits. The 75-share index
closed down 76.35 at 4,437.89 but off the day's low of 4,421. Turnover rose
to TL370.2bn from TL328.5bn.

FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt picks over the weekend
package - Andrew Fisher sounds a judicious note of cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was just what the German market needed. After optimism at the start of
the year had been replaced by gloom about international economic and
currency trends, this week's interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank and the
European exchange rate realignment brought a note of cheer back to dealing
rooms.
The mood is not exactly euphoric. The Frankfurt stock market, as measured by
the DAX index, put on 4.4 per cent on Monday. Yesterday the index declined
by 0.5 per cent to 1,587.55, leaving it well below a high of 1,811.57 seen
at the end of May.
Mr Heinrich Ackermann, of Bank in Liechtenstein's Frankfurt office, says:
'Things have not changed in the real economy. We are going to get further
poor figures for things like new orders, production and so on.' He feels,
however, that the reduction of the central bank's key rates has removed the
risk of a further escalation in rates, giving the market a more solid basis.
Meanwhile, this weekend's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty is
still to come. Until this is resolved and fears of further European currency
turbulence removed, stock markets, for the time being at least, will still
be somewhat hesitant. Also, it could be some time until the Bundesbank feels
able to cut rates again; exchange rate tensions forced its hand before it
was really happy about trends on the inflation and money supply fronts.
When announcing the interest rate cuts, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, alluded to the weakness in the economy - not a
recession, he said - and signs of more moderation in the next wage round by
saying that the Bundesbank's moves were in line with these developments.
But the central bank would not have acted without being put under extreme
pressure by the size of the intervention needed to support the lira last
week. This threatened to overturn its monetary stance by inflating money
supply. Hence the decision urged upon the Bonn government for a realignment,
accompanied by the earlier than expected rates cut.
The size of the reductions, most eyes being on the significant Lombard rate,
caused disappointment in some markets. But as Mr Schlesinger emphasised, the
Bundesbank is also pushing money market rates down by 1/2 percentage point
to 9.2 per cent by conducting this week's securities repurchase operation at
a fixed rate.
Even so, it will take far deeper interest rate cuts than these to help
propel western European economies out of their present slackness, especially
in the hard-hit UK and Nordic regions. 'The whole of Europe needs much lower
interest rates, not just the little we have seen,' says Mr Werner Wanke, a
partner at Metzler, the Frankfurt private bank. For Europe to be given a
real stimulus, he believes two or three percentage points need to come off
rates across Europe.
Since Europe's interest rate levels depend basically on the Bundesbank,
investors will be waiting to see when it feels like delivering further cuts.
They may have to wait some time. Mrs Katrin Kandel at the London office of
Sal. Oppenheim, another German private bank, says: 'I do not think the basic
policy of the Bundesbank has changed at all. I do not think rates are going
to come down faster now.'
Her strategy continues to centre on companies with strong cash flow, above
average earnings growth, and worthwhile assets. There are plenty of those
around in Germany, even though the country's export performance has
obviously been braked by the slow US recovery and weakness in European
markets.
Many German companies are now trying hard to cut costs, especially in the
motor industry where competition is increasing from the Japanese, who have
set up plants in the UK and elsewhere. Companies in the vital mechanical
engineering sector are suffering from the steep downturn in orders and are
keen not only to become more competitive on the cost front but also to
produce more abroad.
It is the intensity of the cost pressures which have concentrated minds in
government and industry and led to the latest call by Chancellor Helmut Kohl
for a solidarity pact which would include moderate pay deals. Such a pact
has yet to be worked out, but a healthy sign is the agreement won by
Lufthansa, the hard-pressed German airline, for a pay freeze and other
far-reaching concessions from its unions.
Lufthansa may be a special case with its heavy losses and severe cost
disadvantages against leaner rivals such as British Airways, but other
German companies are also uncomfortably aware that they need to slim down.
Volkswagen is shedding labour and has also been investing heavily in
lower-cost sites in Spain, Mexico, China and Czechoslovakia.
In other important German industrial sectors, the chemical companies have
been feeling the chill of world economic weakness and are suffering in
various degrees from low prices at a time of tougher competition. With many
German concerns heavily dependent on foreign sales, it is clear that it will
take more than the events of the past few days to engender a lasting return
of confidence to German bourses.

FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK gains ahead of talks
on new airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Tokyo closed for a public holiday, the region's markets concentrated on
domestic news yesterday, while investors remained cautious about New York's
overnight gain.
HONG KONG extended its rally to two days, the Hang Seng index closing a net
46.69 higher at 5,653.84 after profit-taking had dragged it down from the
day's peak of 5,671.97.
Turnover, however, was down to a modest HKDollars 1.29bn from Monday's
HKDollars 1.39bn and investors were said to be awaiting the result of
today's meeting of the Airport Committee, which comprises Chinese and
British diplomats and Hong Kong officials, amid hopes that a deadlock over
financing the HKDollars 175bn new airport project will be broken.
Individual counters attracted bargain hunting, with Jardine Matheson
finishing HKDollars 1.50 ahead at HKDollars 52. HSBC Holdings was the most
active stock, steady at HKDollars 55.
AUSTRALIA reversed three days of advances with a 6.2 retreat in the All
Ordinaries index to 1,530.4. Turnover came to 96m shares worth ADollars
246.7m.
Activity focused on BHP and Foster's after the former announced that it had
taken a 32 per cent stake in the brewer. BHP receded 26 cents to ADollars
12.48, while Foster's relinquished 13 cents to ADollars 1.46 with some 14.3m
shares traded.
News Corp rose 40 cents to ADollars 22.94, recovering half of Monday's drop.
In the banking sector, Westpac firmed 2 cents to ADollars 3.
SINGAPORE failed to sustain an early advance, uncertain about whether Wall
Street would hold on to Monday's gains. The Straits Times Industrial index
closed just 3.02 up at 1,383.42, after reaching 1,390.34. Volume improved to
35.34m shares from 25.33m.
Keppel Corp, the diversified conglomerate with its core businesses in
shipbuilding and ship repairing, rose steadily from SDollars 5.95 to
SDollars 6.40 but retreated to close at SDollars 6.15 after sellers emerged.
SEOUL cooled its heels after two weeks of wide fluctuations, the composite
index losing 6.49 to 544.82 in the absence of institutional support.
Institutions have been required for the past three weeks to be net buyers of
stocks to comply with government market-boosting measures, but profit-taking
in big manufacturing shares, which led the recent rally, contributed to the
market's fall.
TAIWAN moved lower initially after Monday's 2.7 per cent fall, but then
staged a technical rebound to close higher on the day, although brokers said
investor confidence remained very weak. The weighted index, down more than
50 points at first, ended 31.68 up on the session at 3,716.72. Turnover
stayed thin but increased to TDollars 18.2bn from TDollars 17.4bn.
Buyers stepped into the market just before the close, focusing on
export-related electronics shares, which could benefit from the recent
depreciation of the Taiwan dollar.
NEW ZEALAND finished a moderately dull session little changed, the NZSE-40
index gaining 1.17 at 1,480.26, after an intraday high of 1,491.26.
Brewery shares remained firm but showed little extension of Monday's gains.
Lion Nathan rose 4 cents to NZDollars 4.50 and Brierley Investments put on a
cent to 90 cents.
MANILA gained strength as PLDT rose on a good overnight performance in the
US. Its shares advanced 20 pesos to 995 pesos, while the composite index
added 10.76 at 1,429.27. Combined turnover fell to 173m pesos from 344m
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's highs on lack of follow-through support.
The composite index was finally 2.17 up at 585.91. Rises outpaced falls by
120 to 98 after volume of 53.3m shares, against 48.3m on Monday.
BANGKOK paused following a period of gains ahead of Sunday's general
election. The SET index eased 0.21 to 817.74 in a turnover of Bt11.5bn.
BOMBAY climbed 3.8 per cent after the Indian government's opening of stock
markets to foreign institutional investors, the BSE index closing 135.44
higher at 3,410.29.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling at record ERM low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH STERLING and the Italian lira came under intense pressure against the
D-Mark yesterday as dealers had second thoughts about the weekend
realignment, writes James Blitz.
On Monday, foreign exchange dealers had been impressed by the Bundesbank's
cut in interest rates and the suggestion that they may have peaked. But
there was a conviction yesterday that the 7 per cent devaluation of the lira
had been too small and that a No vote in Sunday's French referendum on
Maastricht would trigger another cut.
The lira took a 2 1/2 per cent fall against the D-Mark, dropping through its
central rate and bottoming out at L811. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London, said: 'Big investment funds were
hit by the devaluation and said to their banks: just get me out of Italy at
any price.'
The lira closed in London at L805.8 per D-Mark, against a previous L793. Its
drop was echoed by the Spanish peseta, which fell through the central rate
of Pta65 to the D-Mark that the Bank of Spain has been defending
aggressively for months. There was similar pressure on the Swedish krona,
which ended at SKr3.685 to the D-Mark from a previous close of SKr3.662.
Particular uncertainty hovered around sterling, which fell to a new low
since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990 of DM2.7800, just 0.2 pfennig
above its floor. The pound was initially undermined because the fall of the
lira, technically the strongest ERM currency on Monday night, lowered the
floor to which the weakest could fall. As so often in recent months, this
triggered selling, not by interbank speculators, but from big institutions
such as pension funds that are hedging themselves against a possible
devaluation.
The impact of this hedging may be less detrimental for sterling in the
longer term because there is far less hot money invested in the pound than
there is in high-yielding currencies such as the lira and peseta. But the
announcement that the UK prime minister was cancelling a planned trip to
Spain and newspaper reports that the German government had put pressure on
Britain to devalue shook sterling further.
The Bank of England intervened covertly in the market, with one analyst
saying his bank had seen around Pounds 50m bought. The pound closed 3 1/4
pfennigs down at DM2.7800.
In marked contrast to the EMS currencies, the dollar fared relatively well
against the D-Mark. It was hit at the start of US trading by a fall in US
August retail sales of 0.5 per cent, the largest in five months. But July's
rise was revised upwards by 0.5 per cent, cancelling this out. The dollar
was unchanged on the day in London at DM1.4855. In New York it rose to
DM1.4915.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Rates rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULLISHNESS that dominated Monday's trading in both the sterling cash
and futures markets was reversed yesterday as sterling slumped to a new
post-ERM entry low of DM2.7800 against the D-Mark.
The pound's fall pushed rates in the sterling cash market up to levels which
could be incompatible with 10 per cent base rates for long. There were
rumours last night that clearing banks were in discussion with the Bank of
England.
The one-month sterling cash rate finished at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered
side, up from a previous close of 10 3/16 per cent. Clearing banks are
currently lending money at 10 per cent, but if the rate at which they borrow
from each other stays at the 10 1/2 per cent level for long they will ask
the Bank to signal a rate rise.
Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates
are moving, ended at 10 3/4 per cent on the offered side,  1/2 percentage
point up from the previous close of 10 1/4 per cent on Monday night.
One clearing bank dealer said that the UK government could probably
withstand a rise in UK base rates this week, but that all would depend on
the outcome of the French referendum on Sunday. However, in the longer term,
he felt that the UK's economic problems would leave sterling weak.
The December short sterling contract dropped 65 basis points from its
previous close, bottoming out at 89.09. This was still above the record low
of 89.00 that it reached on August 25, but discounted a full percentage
point increase in base rates.
Because the tension in the markets came in the afternoon, traders were
relaxed about removing the Pounds 950m shortage forecast in the morning.
The Bank of England bought Pounds 5m of Band 1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, Pounds 5m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 43m of Band 4
bank bills at 9 per cent and Pounds 20m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16
per cent.
The forecast was revised to Pounds 900m and the Bank purchased Pounds 9m of
Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 28m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 19m of Band 4
bank bills. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 200m of Band 1 bank
bills, Pounds 1m of Band 3 Treasury bills, Pounds 13m of Band 3 bank bills,
Pounds 1m of Band 4 Treasury bills, Pounds 27m of Band 4 bank bills, and
Pounds 600m in a repo.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Foster's deficit disguises
strong breweries side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian beer company, yesterday reported a fall
into net loss for the year to June. However, the result, following ADollars
1.19bn (USDollars 872m) asset write-downs, disguised a strong performance by
the company's breweries.
The group's directors announced it had turned net profits of ADollars 234.4m
into losses of ADollars 950.8m for the 12 months, on a fall in sales to
ADollars 10.37bn from ADollars 10.63bn. The final dividend is being omitted.
The result followed abnormal losses of ADollars 1.31bn, mainly reflecting
write-downs of ADollars 1.19bn affecting the company's pastoral, finance and
investment operations.
But brewing profits before interest and tax rose 13 per cent, with UK-based
Courage emerging as the company's strongest performer. Gross brewing profits
rose to Dollars 551.9m from ADollars 488.2m, with Courage lifting its
contribution to ADollars 242.4m from ADollars 167.9m.
This comfortably exceeded earnings from the Australian-based Carlton and
United Breweries, down to ADollars 189.5m from ADollars 231.8m, with
Canadian-based Molson Breweries up to ADollars 119.9m from ADollars 88.5m.
Directors said Courage had consolidated its position as the UK's second
largest brewer after the 1991 purchase of Grand Metropolitan's brewing
business.
'Trading conditions in the UK continue to be depressed by the recession.
However, Courage is determined to withstand market pressures and is now
structured for business retention and growth in both on and off-trade
sectors,' the directors said. 'In continental Europe, Courage's business
continues to flourish, led by a comprehensive marketing approach to Foster's
which had a 14 per cent increase over 1991 volumes.'
Almost ADollars 840m of the write-downs announced yesterday came in Foster's
finance division, mainly reflecting its exposure to property markets. But
another ADollars 228m came from Inntrepreneur Estates, the company's pub
joint venture in the UK with GrandMet.
The directors said Inntrepreneur, which operates about 7,000 pubs, had been
hit by recent legislative changes requiring the disposal of a significant
numbers of pubs.
The group has also been affected by falling beer consumption and a recession
in property markets. The directors said a pub valuation in January this year
had reduced values by an average of 3.2 per cent. Given an expected further
decline in pub values, a ADollars 228m provision against the value of
Courage's investment in Inntrepreneur reflected the present and medium-term
view of value, they said.
Grand Metropolitan, the UK food, drinks and retail group which is Foster's
50:50 partner in Inntrepreneur Estates, said that Foster's provisions
brought its accounting treatment in line with UK standards. GrandMet said it
did not need to make any new provisions against its stake.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Wharf invests in central China -
One of Hong Kong's corporations is shaking off its sleepy image and going
where few have gone before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Yue-Kong Pao, the Hong Kong businessman, spent more than 40 years
rebuilding the corporate empire he lost when he fled from the Communist
takeover of Shanghai.
Under the helm of his son-in-law Mr Peter Woo, another Shanghai refugee, his
empire is now returning to the city at the mouth of the river Yangtze with a
pocket full of hard currency.
The news that one of Hong Kong's leading corporations is pouring money into
mainland China is no longer a surprise but the fact that it is Wharf
(Holdings) that is doing so is remarkable.
Wharf has for some time been the sleeper among the colony's four big
'hongs'. Its corporate image has been associated with assets such as the
Star ferry, tramways and its ageing low-rise skyline properties in Kowloon,
rather than Hong Kong island's gleaming skyscrapers and frenetic trading
businesses.
Even when Wharf made moves to shake off this drowsy image, such as its
recent HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194.86m) push into cable television, it
had little success. Its consortium crumbled in the face of Hutchison
Whampoa's push into regional satellite television and a confused government
broadcasting policy.
Mr Woo took over the chairmanship of the group in 1986, when Sir YK divided
his empire among his son-in-laws, but he was regarded inevitably as only a
puppet for the great businessman.
Colleagues say he has a hands-on approach to management, but the presence of
the conservative patriarch looking over his shoulder was a compelling
influence.
Since Sir YK's death last September, there is no question of who is boss,
and Wharf's corporate slogan, 'Quiet dedication is our philosophy', is
beginning to look decidedly out of place.
Mr Woo feels it is the responsibility of Hong Kong's leading corporations to
stake out the colony's future after China becomes its sovereign power on
July 1 1997.
'When I went to Beijing, my discussion with the leadership was that to go to
the next level of development, the focus and emphasis must be on how to
mobilise the resources of central China. To do that, you need transportation
and energy,' said Mr Woo; his company is going to provide it.
He admits that the reputation of his father-in-law helped get him access to
the very top, in this case Premier Li Peng. Having gained approval for its
plans for central China, Wharf is moving rapidly.
The conglomerate is looking to Wuhan, the central Chinese city which lies at
the intersection of the country's main east-west axis, the Yangtze river,
and the main north-south axis of the Beijing-Guangzhou (Canton) railway.
This location makes it a logical third point of a Hong Kong-Shanghai-Wuhan
triangle, which will be the main focus for Wharf's resources.
Wharf is already renovating a hotel on the waterfront in Wuhan and is
working on a power project in the city. It also plans to set up a transport
hub there, with a river port, airport and an upgraded railway station
providing outlets for a container port which will process the resources of
the surrounding provinces.
A high-speed railway will link this hub with Hong Kong's container terminal,
where Wharf is the leading shareholder of the colony's second largest
terminal operator.
Wharf has also signed letters of intent for big property and infrastructural
projects in order to build a presence in Shanghai.
It is an alluring vision. Hong Kong was the catalyst in the expansion of
Guangdong province, arguably the fastest growing economy in the world over
the past decade. Other property developers are cashing in on this by
building cheap flats, but Wharf aims to spearhead the push further north.
One group of individuals which has so far remained unimpressed by this
vision is the Hong Kong brokerage community. 'Wharf is a solid property
story which has been clouded by infrastructure,' was the reaction of one
analyst.
However, Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimates that between 1992
and 1995 property investment earnings will increase 68 per cent to HKDollars
2.5bn, representing 69 per cent of pre-tax profit. With that level of
recurrent income, Wharf could be forgiven for looking for some higher-reward
projects to spice up the longer-term outlook.
Cable television has been one diversification, which has provided little
return apart from uncertainty; projects in Wuhan and Shanghai should prove
more attractive - if an equally long-term use of Wharf's resource base -
since it is sticking to areas it already understands: property and
infrastructure.
Mr Woo said Wharf is looking at large-scale projects in which it will form
consortia to limit its exposure and bring in outside expertise. 'The main
role we would hope to play is as a useful and positive catalyst,' he said,
suggesting that Hong Kong and other multinational companies would be offered
participation.
The group's Chinese exposure will be limited to between 10 and 20 per cent
of assets, while Mr Woo said the company would not exceed HKDollars 1 of
debt to every HKDollars 2 of equity.
Wharf has an estimated net asset value of close to HKDollars 50bn. This is
an asset base offering significant redevelopment potential, since the
closure of Kai Tak airport in 1997 will allow increased height limits for
buildings in Kowloon, where Wharf is the main landlord. The company can
therefore afford to take big bets.
Mr Woo has already experienced big risks, when he left Shanghai in the
1940s. 'When you look at the fundamental economic trend (in China), it is an
attractive slope up. Along that slope there will be economic hiccups, but
you just have to plan for that,' Mr Woo said.

MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, tripled
fourth quarter net profits and expects to benefit from a 5 to 10 per cent
rise in north American car production in fiscal 1993.
Profits for the fourth quarter to July 31 were CDollars 31.3m (USDollars
25.8m), or 82 cents a share, up from Dollars 11.6m, or 41 cents a share, a
year earlier, on sales of Dollars 625m, up 16 per cent.
Two years after a brush with failure, the restructured Magna reported a
profit of Dollars 98m, or Dollars 2.91 a share for the full year, up sixfold
from Dollars 16.5m, or 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were
Dollars 2.4bn, up 17 per cent.
Magna attributed the strength in sales to rising north American vehicle
output and growth in the company's average production content. Magna also
operates several European plants.
Profits gained from higher plant operating rates and lower interest costs.
Debt has been halved to Dollars 274m, including a Dollars 165m convertible
debenture.
Magna plans to apply for a New York Stock Exchange quotation. It is paying a
10 cents a share dividend on the A and B stock on October 16.
Lac Minerals, a Canadian gold producer, is buying 52 per cent of the high
grade Lisheen zinc-lead property near Kilkenny, in Ireland, from Chevron

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DONALD Bainton, who resigned as president of Continental Can company nine
years ago after a disagreement over the company's strategy, is getting
belated revenge by buying back the name of the largely dismembered group
from its current owner, the diversified Pieter Kiewit group.
Mr Bainton will use Continental Can as the new name for Viatech, a packaging
company with significant European interests which he has built up since the
mid-1980s.
He also announced that Viatech, which is currently quoted on the American
Stock Exchange, would seek a listing under its new name on the larger New
York Stock Exchange.
The company has also signed an agreement to raise from 50 per cent to 100
per cent its stake in Plastic Containers, a joint venture with Mexico's
Zapata packaging family.
Plastic Containers is a vehicle used in 1991 for the Dollars 153m purchase
of Continental Plastic Containers, a US company which is the last remaining
packaging unit of the old Continental Can company.
Mr Bainton, 61, says he is keen to build up Continental into a much larger
packaging company by making further acquisitions.
In 1984 - a year after Mr Bainton resigned from Continental Can - the
company was sold to Peter Kiewit, which has since disposed of many of the
company's subsidiaries.
After leaving Continental Can, Mr Bainton joined Viatech, an engineering
company in which his brother had a significant interest, and moved it into
packaging through the acquisition of Germany's Dixie Union Verpackingen,
Spain's Onena Bolsas de Papel, and France's Ferembal. Mr Bainton and his
brother hold 42 per cent of the stock of Viatech.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DATA General aims to seize a leadership role in the emerging market for disk
arrays, a new type of mass data storage system that is gaining popularity as
a lower cost alternative to high-capacity computer disk drives in corporate
data centres.
Yesterday, the minicomputer manufacturer, which is struggling to achieve
consistent profitability after more than three years of heavy losses,
launched a range of disk array products designed to work with competitors'
computer systems.
Data General has been selling disk array systems with its own open-systems
minicomputers or 'servers' for the past 18 months. Starting in November, the
company will offer similar disk systems for use with IBM's RS/6000 systems
and Sun Microsystems' Sparc Servers. These will be followed by disk systems
for use with Hewlett-Packard, Unisys and ICL server computers.
The move represents a bid to build revenues by exploiting its lead in disk
array technology beyond the company's own relatively limited base of
computer customers.
Disk array systems, also known as Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disk
(Raid) systems, are made up of an array of small disk drives of the type
commonly seen in personal computers. They are capable of storing vast
quantities of data at a fraction of the cost of large disk systems.
A significant advantage of Raid systems is reliability. Employing
sophisticated duplication techniques, Raid systems can ensure that data is
not lost even if part of the array fails. Raid is upsetting the status quo
in data storage technology just as microprocessors have brought wrenching
changes to computing.
'In much the same way that PCs and workstations have brought inexpensive
compute-intensive applications to the user, this new technology should bring
data-intensive applications, such as video, voice, imaging and multi-media
to the user as well,' added Mr Thomas West, senior vice president, who will
head a new business unit at Data General targeting the disk array market.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bloomberg to tune radio
listeners into stock prices / Examining the rapid expansion of a US
financial news and information group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The day after Mr Michael Bloomberg paid Dollars 13.5m for WNEW AM, one of
New York's most famous music radio stations, there was no shortage of people
 -from the security guard at his Park Avenue office to the Korean newsagent
near his home - asking him for a job.
'Everybody, it seems, wants to be a disc jockey,' Mr Bloomberg said
resignedly after the acquisition was announced.
Disc jockeys, however, do not figure in the station's future. Sinatra will
be replaced by stock prices. WNEW will become WBBR (Bloomberg Business
Radio), and a fast-growing financial news and data company, Bloomberg
Financial Markets, will have taken another step forward.
Mr Bloomberg's journey began in 1981 when he was fired by Wall Street
securities house Salomon Brothers over differences with the management - he
kept telling them how to do their job.
The day after he left Salomon, he began his search on Wall Street for
someone to back his company, which would supply dealers and investors with
electronic data on financial markets. The only firm interested was Merrill
Lynch, which took a 30 per cent stake in the tiny venture.
Today, Merrill's investment has paid off handsomely.
More than 20,000 customers around the world have Bloomberg's terminals on
their desks. They cost Dollars 1,100 a month to rent, which brings in annual
revenues of Dollars 264m.
The growth rate of new rentals has never been higher, with customers
attracted by the system's easy-to-use analytical capabilities and its
reputation for service. A year ago Bloomberg was renting 325 new terminals a
month, today it rents 625 a month.
Apart from its terminals, which carry a huge range of market prices,
statistical data and analytics, Bloomberg runs a financial newswire service
and it publishes specialist newsletters and a glossy magazine for its
customers.
Despite an impressive growth record, Bloomberg remains one of the smaller
players in the Dollars 4.5bn electronic information business.
Reuters dominates the market with more than 200,000 terminals. Second is
Telerate, which is owned by the Dow Jones company and has about 90,000
terminals, and third biggest is Citicorp-owned Quotron, with about 65,000
terminals. In the newswire business, Bloomberg not only has to contend with
Reuters and Dow Jones, but also Knight-Ridder.
Seeking to stretch the technological boundaries, Bloomberg plans later this
year to provide its customers with an audio and video capacity on their
terminals. Users will be able to hear the news, interviews and speeches of
the day direct from their screens, accompanied by static pictures of
relevant material.
Sitting in his Park Avenue office surrounded by framed profiles from the
pages of US newspapers and magazines, Mr Bloomberg displayed obvious pride
in his company's achievements. Yet despite his forays into news journalism,
publishing and now broadcasting, he insists the terminals remain the most
important part of the Bloomberg machine.
'The radio station is a natural extension of our business,' says Mr
Bloomberg. 'It is designed to enhance the reputation of our news product,
which is only available over our terminals. It all fits together. 'In the
end, what drives this company is renting terminals. That's the way we make a
living. The magazine helps that, the radio station will help that.' Never
one to shy from loudly criticising his competitors, Mr Bloomberg argues that
many of the problems they have encountered - Quotron has been a huge drain
on the resources of its parent, Citicorp, while Telerate has struggled to
keep its customers in the face of heightened competition - can be traced to
the fact that the parent companies have lost sight of what they are selling.
He says: 'We are a one product company. Take a look at Dow Jones, they are a
one product company, and the product is the Wall Street Journal.
'They just either didn't realise it, or maybe realised it and made a
mistake, but Telerate never helped the sales of the Journal - that's the
cash cow. In our case the radio station and magazine are designed to help
sell our product.'
Bloomberg's rivals have not stood idly by watching the new upstart steal
their business. Reuters launched its Decision 2000 analytics package last
year, Telerate has won some plaudits with its new Matrix system, and EJV, a
joint venture between six big Wall Street securities houses, will soon be
selling its own product, UniVu.
With its open architecture, UniVu can take data and analytics from any
number of sources, striking at the heart of Bloomberg's biggest weakness -
the fact that because it is a closed system, cust-omers can only use the
calc-ulations and formulas for analytics provided by Bloomberg. To use
anything else, they have to turn to a different terminal.
This is a source of frustration to many users, who increasingly want
everything housed in one terminal.
Ms Patricia Zlotin, an investment manager with Massachusetts Financial
Services in Boston says: 'We're looking for something that can interact and
be combined with other systems. The stand-alone systems will lose market
share as space on desks becomes more of a premium.'
Mr Bloomberg, however, confidently dismisses criticisms that his machines
are inflexible. 'We are close to completing a system that will allow anyone
to run their analytics on our system using our data, our calculation
libraries, our communication system . . . that is the openness that the
users really want.'

COMPAREX, the mainframe computer subsidiary of the German chemicals giant
BASF, managed slight growth in the first half of the year, in spite of
deteriorating market conditions.
Mr Rolf Brillinger, Comparex CEO, said that turnover rose 3 per cent to
reach DM536m (Pounds 191m) compared with DM522m in the same period last
year. The company does not disclose half yearly profit figures, but it is
thought to have made moderate profits, in contrast to other European-owned
mainframe manufacturers which have been reporting heavy losses.
Mr Brillinger was pessimistic about the outturn for the whole year, citing
economic weakness, lack of capital investment and fiercer competition.
He also pointed out that the computer boom in Germany following unification
had been short lived and a backlog of demand for Comparex' new high end
machines was now satisfied.
The company markets mainframe computers which are functionally identical to
those made by International Business Machines, the US-owned market leader.
Comparex' mainframes are manufactured by Hitachi of Japan.
Comparex also markets computer peripherals and is seeking to increase the
proportion of its revenues derived from computing services.

SIMINT, the Italian clothing group partly owned by Mr Giorgio Armani,
reported virtually unchanged net group profits of L17.48bn (Dollars 14.83m)
for the year to April 30 against L17.23bn the previous year.
The group, which is pushing ahead with an ambitious expansion drive in the
US, raised sales by 6.4 per cent to L352.9bn. The increase stemmed from a
mixture of early receipts from the US initiative and higher sales in
European markets.
Pre-tax profits rose 13.2 per cent to L23.06bn from L20.36bn. The dividend
is unchanged at L150 a share for both ordinary and preference stock.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fried. Krupp and Hoesch face
fresh merger obstacle
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRIED. Krupp and Hoesch, the two large Ruhr-based steel and engineering
groups, yesterday vowed to press ahead with practical steps towards a merger
despite a court ruling which has created a last-minute legal obstacle to the
long-planned fusion of the two groups.
The two companies, which have spent most of this year successfully clearing
legal hurdles in the way of a merger one after another, announced yesterday
that a Dortmund court had refused to register the application for the
merger, as required under German company law for the transaction to take
final effect.
This decision - which follows a legal challenge to the merger launched by
three individual shareholders in Hoesch - was dismissed by the companies as
a legal techni-cality. They said that they would appeal against the ruling
as soon as possible and proceed with all the organisational preparations for
a merger.
Despite the companies' insistence that the judgment will not lead to a
serious delay in the practical implementation of the merger, it is
inevitable that plans for the listing of the merged company on the German
stock-exchange will be held up. The original plan was to seek such a listing
this month or next, but it now looks likely that the flotation will be
postponed until later this year.
The basis of the Dortmund court's ruling is that it does not have the
competence to evaluate the legal basis of the claims lodged by the three
shareholders, Mr Henry-August-Robert Nold of Darm-stadt, Mr Hans-Gerhard
Haas of Dortmund, both private investors, and Mr Hans Kluting, a lawyer
based in Dortmund who previously spent 38 years working at Hoesch.
A date for a hearing in the Dortmund regional court has been set for
December 18.
Their concerns are thought to focus on the treatment of minority
shareholders under the terms of the merger agreement, although Mr Kluting
has complained bitterly that the name of Hoesch will not be given enough
prominence after the merger. Technically, the the merged company will be
called 'Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp'.
Hoesch shareholders voted 99.7 per cent in favour of the merger at an annual
general meeting this July.

insurer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the Swedish insurance group, yesterday announced the sale of Great
States Financial Corporation, a specialty workers' compensation insurer
licensed in California and Arizona, to FHP International Corporation of the
US.
The Swedish group said the sale reflects its decision to reduce its risk
exposure in the US, and follows plans to spin off part of its US reinsurance
business.
Skandia said the sale would provide a profit after tax of about SKr35m
(Dollars 6.4m), although it said exact price details for the deal were not
being made public.
Great States Financial Corporation was set up by Skandia in 1989 and has
annual premium income of about SKr200m, which represents a relatively small
proportion of Skandia's total US operations.
Total premium income from the US amounts to about SKr6bn, including
reinsurance, direct insurance and international life insurance business,
Skandia said.
FHP International Corporation is a publicly-listed company which specialises
in health care and sickness insurance.
The company said the deal with Skandia would enable it to issue its own
workers' compensation policies in California and Arizona, rather than
arranging for another insurance company to issue such policies.
Earlier this year, Skandia announced plans to concentrate on its core
businesses of direct non-life insurance and life assurance for individuals
and small or medium-sized companies.
In July, Skandia registered an initial public offering (IPO) of 30 per cent
of the shares in Skandia America, its US subsidiary which includes its
reinsurance operations.
Skandia said it plans to go ahead with the IPO, but added that a date has
not yet been fixed.

FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: No plans for an M&amp;A takeover -
Rumours of a power struggle between Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell are
unfounded, Ronaldo Schmitz tells David Waller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell, the London-based merchant bank
bought by Deutsche Bank in January 1990, can rest assured: Ronaldo Schmitz,
head of corporate finance at Deutsche and chief of its expanding North
American operations, is not trying to wrest control of the UK merchant
banks's mergers and acquisitions activities.
'It is not true,' Mr Schmitz says, rejecting local press reports that he and
Mr Craven are engaged in a power struggle in the boardroom of Germany's
biggest bank. The rumours have been lent credence by the fact that Mr
Schmitz's team - rather than Morgan Grenfell - has advised on a number of
recent prominent mergers and acquisitions in Germany, including the DM1.45bn
(Dollars 1.02bn) acquisition of the non-paper businesses of Feldmuhle Nobel
by the Metallgesellschaft mining and engineering group last year.
'There may be other cases in the future where due to specific client
circumstances, the bank does the advisory work,' Mr Schmitz concedes, 'but
this is not to imply that there is competition between my department and
Morgan Grenfell. M &amp; A is Morgan Grenfell's field, and if we do the odd
transaction here and there, that does not mean that we are making specific
inroads into Morgan Grenfell's domain.'
Moreover, he says, a fusion of Morgan Grenfell's M &amp; A activities with those
of Deutsche would be counter-productive: 'Given the size differential,
Morgan Grenfell would eventually be crushed, its pure M &amp; A culture would be
contaminated.'
Mr Schmitz and Mr Craven have much in common. They are about the same age
(Schmitz is 54 next month, Craven 52, also next month) and both joined the
bank in 1990. Schmitz arrived after 23 years at BASF, the large German
chemicals company, where he was finance director from 1984. They are the the
only two of Deutsche's 13-strong main board who have not spent their entire
working lives at the bank.
The Brazilian-born Mr Schmitz can also claim to be the only board member to
have had experience of being a bank's corporate customer. Highly regarded in
the international financial community, he left BASF only after losing out in
the race to succeed Mr Hans Albers as chief executive.
Given his background, Mr Schmitz is well-placed to comment on the often
controversial relations between the Deutsche Bank and German industry.
A network of large industrial holdings (notably the 28 per cent direct stake
in Daimler Benz, Germany's largest industrial group), combined with the
seats taken by Deutsche Bank directors on the supervisory boards of dozens
of big companies, often gives the impression that the bank tells German
industry what to do, rather than the other way round.
'If the number of supervisory board memberships we have relays the picture
of a very significant power being wielded by the Deutsche Bank, it is
wrong,' Mr Schmitz says. 'Even the treasurers of very small companies give
us a very hard time. If you look at the companies we have a stake in, and
how they behave when seeking a bank service, they play us off against our
competitors whether or not we are on the board. It would be short-sighted or
even foolish to try to gain business via our board members.
'As for the stakes themselves, many were acquired decades ago as a result of
underwriting exercises - rather than as the result of any conscious
investment decisions. The result is that the bank is close to a number of
industries and in order to protect its investments it has to understand the
companies involved. This adds a lot of value and intelligence to what we
do.'
On commercial grounds, Mr Schmitz thinks that the industrial holdings should
be sold, as the proceeds could be better invested elsewhere. However he says
that in practice this is impossible, for tax reasons.
The extensive cross-holdings often serve to protect German companies from
the threat of takeover, a threat further reduced by voting restrictions
which curb shareholders' influence over the companies in which they have
stakes. A good example is the Continental tyre company, where Deutsche and
Morgan Grenfell have played a controversial role in preventing Pirelli
exercising its full voting rights.
Mr Schmitz believes that the best defence for company management - in
Germany as elsewhere - is 'aggressive management of the business combined
with an open information policy'. But he says that Deutsche will not abandon
its own shareholder voting restrictions until Germany has international
standards of disclosure and takeover rules.
If the bank cannot wash its hands of its corporate investments, it can
participate in the process of disintermediation, which in Germany is slowly
leading to a reduction of German companies' traditional dependence on bank
finance.
Mr Schmitz points to the bank's central role in the founding of the German
commercial paper market last year. This market has grown rapidly to become
the fourth largest in Europe, with the total value of programmes likely to
rise to DM50bn by the end of the year.
As head of the 274-person strong corporate finance department, Mr Schmitz
has twin priorities. One is to develop the bank's financial structuring
activities - 'using our financial engineering skills as opposed to marketing
commodity capital market products, an area which is becoming increasingly
competitive day by day'. The other is to develop the bank's equity business
across the whole of Europe: 'Here in Germany we are an equities powerhouse,
but not outside Germany, and this has to change.'
His other main management responsibility is North America, where the bank
employs more than 1,000 people and has tripled its assets to Dollars 14bn
since 1990. Here, he says, 'there have never been better opportunities for
foreign banks than at present . . . we have a strong balance sheet and so we
can say that we are ready to lend - a rare commodity in North America these
days, so it opens doors for us. But we are hoping to do far more than plain
vanilla lending'.
The change from industry to banking has not been traumatic, he says. The
people are equally dedicated, the management issues similar.
The big difference is, of course, working with money rather than chemicals.
'Chemicals smell, money doesn't,' he quips.

THE Netherlands banking and insurance group Internationale Nederlanden Groep
(ING) said it is seeking board representation at its takeover target Banque
Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), possibly through a vote at today's extraordinary
shareholders' meeting of the Belgium bank, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
ING said yesterday that it 'has urged BBL's chairman that it should be
directly represented on the bank's board'. This would help it create a
co-operation pact with BBL on banking and insurance.
ING said last week it planned to offer at most BFr3,600 (Dollars 117) a
share in a friendly takeover bid for Belgium's second largest bank. ING,
which already has an indirect 10.03 per cent stake in BBL, will make a final
decision on the bid by mid-October.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; General shows 25% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING DEMAND by consumers to insure their domestic appliances against
breakdowns helped lift pre-tax profits at Domestic &amp; General, the
Wimbledon-based specialist insurer, by 25 per cent to Pounds 6.19m in the
six months to June 30.
Earnings per share rose from 48.11p to 61.13p and the annual dividend is
raised to 18p (15p) with a proposed final of 12p.
Mr Martin Copley, chairman, said: 'We're obviously very pleased. This is a
creditable result given the continuing recession.'
He said the company's service - which arranges repairers rather than simply
providing insurance to cover breakdowns - combined with growth in insurance
schemes operated by appliance manufacturers had helped raise premium income.
Gross premiums for domestic appliances rose to Pounds 43.5m (Pounds 32.9m)
and other premiums fell to Pounds 232,000 (Pounds 421,000), reflecting the
company's concentration on its core business.
Turnover rose by 29 per cent from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 44.2m, while
expenses increased 13 per cent to Pounds 10.5m.
Investments in Copley, a subsidiary which provides personal loans to police
officers, jumped to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 7.9m). Total investment income rose
14 per cent to Pounds 5.9m.
Mr Copley said the company's strong connections with the domestic appliance
suppliers and its broad management services had helped it stave off growing
competition over the past 12 months.
He said Domestic &amp; General had had to reduce its premiums in line with the
market, but it was taking steps to limit attempts by the 1,000 repairers it
uses to widen their margins.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals cut AB Electronics' loss
 -Takeover discussions continue with TT following exchange of site visits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING COSTS and a fall in sales were blamed by AB Electronics, the
components manufacturer, for another deficit over the year to June 30. The
final dividend is omitted.
AB is continuing friendly discussions with TT Group which may led to it
being taken over by the acquisitive industrial holding company. TT recently
took a 6.35 per cent stake in AB.
The two sides have exchanged site visits which led to further negotiations
last week. TT has now asked for further information.
AB's loss before tax of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 14.8m) was struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 10.9m) to cover redundancies and
costs associated with the rationalisation of the ongoing businesses.
Last year's results have been restated to comply with the Accounting
Standards Board. The effect has been to increase the loss in 1991 since
reorganisation and restructuring costs accounted for as an extraordinary
item have been restated as exceptional items.
Sales fell from Pounds 213.4m to Pounds 171.2m. The operating loss rose to
Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 66,000). Losses per share were 34.9p (36.4p).
Mr Paul Ryder, managing director, said the group decided not to pay a
dividend since the expense of administering last year's notional dividend of
0.1p was too costly.
A strong performance from the German-based sensors business helped the
automotive division report an increased operating profit of Pounds 2m
(Pounds 1.7m). The group is in talks to sell its loss-making UK-based
automotive electronic systems.
The operating loss at the components division increased to Pounds 3.75m
(Pounds 2.6m). Loss-making Swansea Industrial, which makes electrical
harnesses, is also about to be sold.
The assemblies division incurred a loss of Pounds 46,000 compared with an
operating profit of Pounds 2.4m. The old resale and distribution division
reduced its operating loss from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 964,000.
Borrowings fell to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 28.7m) representing gearing of 89
per cent.
COMMENT
News of TT's continued interest cut little ice with the market. The shares
fell 10p to close at 47p, capitalising the group at Pounds 13m. This is less
than the sum the company might be reasonably expected to raise for two of
its loss-making businesses. It appears that the market is unsure whether the
group can survive. With forecasts of another small pre-tax loss or the
possibility of breaking even the outlook is bleak. In the group's favour are
the planned disposals which could cut borrowings by half, the refocusing of
its core businesses, increased cost cutting with the loss of another 400
jobs and the possibility of a takeover. However, it remains a risky recovery
stock. For that reason most investors will want to wait longer before
committing themselves.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Manufacturing side boosts Haggas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from its manufacturing side enabled John Haggas, West
Yorkshire-based worsted spinner, to increase pre-tax profits for the year to
June 30 by 58 per cent.
However, an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.95m on the sale of the hand
knitting wools retailer left attributable losses at Pounds 2.98m, against
profits of Pounds 1.22m. The effect was a reduction of Pounds 580,000 in
reserves after taking back Pounds 4.37m of goodwill previously written off.
Manufacturing pre-tax profits increased 52 per cent to Pounds 3.15m (Pounds
2.07m) with the fabric division performing well and spinning making good
progress. Retailing lost Pounds 263,000 (Pounds 249,000).
Group turnover was Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 33.4m). Earnings per share were
9.02p (5.6p) and a final dividend of 2p is proposed for an unchanged total
of 3p.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cala cuts loss to Pounds 980,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY FOCUSING on its core housebuilding activities Cala, the Aberdeen-based
builder and developer, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 6.94m to Pounds
980,000 in the year to June 30.
However, with the housing market having suffered a further setback and the
outlook 'obscure' the company is proposing to cut its final dividend from
2.25p to 1.15p leaving the total at 2.3p (3.4p).
Mr Geoffrey Ball, chairman, said that firm management controls had been
reimposed on its south of England housebuilding side and losses had been
significantly reduced as they had been in the Midlands. In Scotland its
activities were still profitable.
The pre-tax figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.25m of
which Pounds 628,000 related to discontinued activities. It included
commercial property writedowns of Pounds 840,000 and housebuilding land
writedowns of Pounds 8,000.
Gearing increased from 40 per cent to 56 per cent at the year end as a
result of investment in land.
Turnover was Pounds 66.2m (Pounds 93.3m). Losses per share were 3.44p
(15.09p).

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lopex cuts losses to Pounds 125,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOPEX, the advertising, public relations and marketing group, cut its
pre-tax losses to Pounds 125,000, from Pounds 916,000, in the first half of
1992 as clients continued to reduce their spending. The interim dividend is
passed again.
Mr Peter Thomas, chief executive, said it was doubtful whether a final
dividend would be paid. The policy would be reviewed when the group returned
to profit, which would hopefully be next year.
Turnover fell from Pounds 111m to Pounds 73.7m, although the bulk of the
decline was accounted for by disposals. Lopex said the underlying
contraction in volume was 4 per cent.
A further 30 to 40 jobs were shed with more to follow in this half.
Exceptional redundancy costs of Pounds 447,000 (Pounds 410,000) were,
however, more than offset by the surrender of a lease on an acquisition's
former head office in Grosvenor Gardens, central London.
Mr Thomas said the carrying costs of empty properties used to exceed Pounds
1m, a large proportion of that would have been eliminated by next year.
Most of the group's sales are in the UK. Advertising had suffered a severe
squeeze on profits, while public relations and direct mailing had held up
better.
Marketing budgets were much leaner: 'The marketing director is no longer the
key man on the board - that's the finance director these days.'
After a quiet six months, clients were now considering their budgets for
next year and there were signs of them starting to spend.
The group's net debt typically stood at Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m and was
stable. First half interest costs fell to Pounds 465,000 (Pounds 948,000) as
disposals had brought down debt.
Mr Thomas said the group had only Pounds 250,000 of earn-out payments left
for acquisitions. Those liabilities had stood at Pounds 20m two years ago.
Extraordinary costs amounted to Pounds 477,000 (Pounds 50,000) following a
loss on selling a subsidiary and the write-off of goodwill.
Losses per share were reduced to 1.22p (4.1p).

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Alchem and United Drug discuss merger
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER TALKS are at an advanced stage between United Drug, the Dublin-based
pharmaceutical distributor, and Alchem, the parent company of Sangers,
Northern Ireland's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler.
The combined group would have turnover in excess of IPounds 110m (Pounds
105m).
In a statement United Drug said 'These discussions may lead to an
amalgamation of the interest of the two companies and an announcement on the
outcome will be made in due course.'
United Drug has expanded in recent years by the acquisition of companies
specialising in the distribution of optical and hospital equipment and
photographic supplies.
It distributes to 1,000 pharmacy outlets in the Irish Republic, a quarter of
which hold 15 per cent of the company's shares. It also holds the Vantage
franchise in Ireland, a retailing system developed by AAH Pharmaceuticals,
one of the the UK's leading distribution companies.
United Drug reported a 10 per cent increase in sales in 1991 to IPounds 63m,
and a 13 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to IPounds 2.7m. The company
obtained a full listing in London and Dublin in March this year. Its shares
closed up 5p at 175p yesterday.
Alchem is an unquoted company, but has more than a third of the retail
pharmacists in Northern Ireland as shareholders. It reported turnover of
Pounds 43m in its accounts to March 1991.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Scholes blames low activity for 31% fall to
Pounds 3.17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLES, the electrical installation materials group, continued to be
affected by 'the worst recession for many years', and reported a 31 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 3.17m, for the 12
months to June 30.
Turnover declined 8 per cent to Pounds 62m (Pounds 67.3m).
Mr Bill Riches, who moved up from finance director to chairman in July after
the death in March of Mr Reg Harrington, the previous chairman and chief
executive, said lower levels of activity lay behind the profits fall.
The group's cash position was sharply improved, he said.
Net cash generation rose to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 1.5m) and gearing fell to 13
per cent (32 per cent) as borrowings were cut to Pounds 3m (Pounds 7.4m).
Net interest charges were almost halved at Pounds 834,000 (Pounds 1.59m),
ameliorating the 47 per cent decline in operating profits from Pounds 7.12m
to Pounds 3.8m.
The group, Mr Riches said, had a much better second half - turnover was
Pounds 33.5m, operating profits Pounds 2.6m and pre-tax profits Pounds 2.3m.
The respective first-half figures were Pounds 29.5m, Pounds 1.2m and Pounds
916,000.
The improvement, he said, was largely a result of reduced costs and
manufacturing efficiencies, and to a lesser extent to increased sales
volume.
Mr Riches also said that the restructured board would be exerting more
hands-on management as far as pricing, joint ventures and product
development were concerned.
There were no acquisitions in the pipeline, but capital expenditure, having
fallen in the year under review from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.5m, would rise to
Pounds 2.5m or more in the current year.
Earnings were down at 5.9p (8.5p) per share, from which a maintained 5p
total dividend will be paid via an unchanged 3.4p final.
COMMENT
The results were a little better than expected, especially the second half,
though trading is locked into the housing and construction market doldrums.
However, Scholes can only benefit from its growing joint venture
relationship with Asea Brown Boveri (cf Delta and AEG). ABB does the
expensive research and development chores and Scholes makes and distributes
the products well. Meanwhile Mr Alan Baxter, the chief executive newly
arrived from FKI, adds muscle to a board which needs to regain some control
of the operating companies from their managements. Forecasts for current
full-year pre-tax profits give a multiple of 9.7. The shares - up 1p at 93p
 -might well drift for a while, but any positive interest rate news to help
the housing market will give them a boost. Worth buying and holding.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Organic growth lifts Tibbett &amp; Britten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIBBETT &amp; BRITTEN, the warehousing,transportation and distribution services
group, reported a 6 per cent increase, from Pounds 6.34m to Pounds 6.72m, in
interim pre-tax profits.
Mr John Harvey, chairman, described the result as 'a stout performance
despite the recession' reflecting organic growth across all group divisions.
Turnover in the six months to June 27 expanded by 21 per cent to Pounds
101.6m (Pounds 84.3m). Virtually all the increase came from existing
businesses with the retail consolidation business, which handles electrical
and non-food goods, performing particularly well.
Operating profits, however, increased by only 4.3 per cent to Pounds 6.41m
(Pounds 6.15m), reflecting reduced margins. Mr Harvey said several factors
contributed to the decline in margins.
Although distribution for individual clients performed well, Fashion
Logistics, the shared-network distribution business which accounts for 7 per
cent of turnover, was operating in 'an extremely depressed clothing sector'
and remained unprofitable despite 'considerable rationalisation,' as volume
and prices fell.
Margins were also reduced by changes in the overall mix of activity and
revenues, start-up costs overseas, especially in Canada, Portugal and South
Africa, and further costs incurred in strengthening group infrastructure.
Organic growth continued with the purchase of a 30 acre site and 580,000 sq
ft warehouse at Preston Brook for the further development and consolidation
of the group's contract with the B&amp;Q retail DIY chain, and the building of a
cold store at the Northfleet depot for distribution of J Sainsbury's
refrigerated food from September.
Capital expenditure, for development, in the first half was particularly
high at Pounds 13.5m. However, net interest received still rose to Pounds
308,000 (Pounds 194,000), and gearing was 14 per cent of net assets of
Pounds 51m at the period-end.
After a higher tax charge of Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 2.11m), earnings per share
increased by 4 per cent to 12.8p (12.3p). The interim dividend is raised to
3.8p (3.4p).

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Airbreak resignations 'a gesture'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID LEWIS, who tendered his resignation on Monday as chairman of
Airbreak Leisure Group, said yesterday that the move was largely a gesture.
His resignation and that of Mr Martin Linton, finance director had not yet
been accepted and nor did he expect them to be.
In a statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday after the markets closed, Mr
Lewis reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.92m and the sale of
Sunsail International, an ill-starred recent acquisition. He also said in
the statement: 'I have tendered my resignation as your chairman along with
your finance director, Mr Linton.'
Mr Lewis had also warned that 'the results for this financial year will be
significantly below the expectation of our shareholders'. He was unavailable
for comment on Monday evening.
Responding to the news, Airbreak's shares dropped 13 1/2 p to close
yesterday at 10 1/2 p.
Mr Lewis explained yesterday that he made the warning so as not to create a
'false market' for the tour operator's shares.
The Pounds 2.92m losses, for the traditionally loss-making first half, were
about Pounds 500,000 better than the predicted losses of Pounds 3.4m, he
said. But the company would probably not meet, he said, profit forecasts of
Pounds 4.2m for the full year.
As for Sunsail, Mr Lewis said that he and Mr Linton had 'bought a company we
should never have bought'.
Sunsail owns some 340 of the more than 450 yachts it charters and has no
business through the winter months. The company was bought in January for up
to Pounds 8.08m, mostly in shares but including Pounds 1.55m of loan stock.
The first tranche of 5.71m shares was paid, but Mr Lewis said that the
second tranche of 6.91m, which was dependent on Sunsail making profits of at
least Pounds 1.4m pre-tax in the year to October 31 1992, would not now be
issued.
Mr Lewis said Sunsail had been sold 'to a large well-known City institution'
for Pounds 3.4m in cash and loan notes.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon ahead to Pounds 60.6m - Interest
charges sharply reduced following Pounds 149m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST SAVINGS following its Pounds 149m rights issue last November helped
MB-Caradon increase interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds
60.6m.
The interest charge fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 2.5m in the six months
to June 30.
The figures were in line with expectations and the shares initially rose on
the news before falling back to close 12p down at 224p as analysts scaled
down forecasts for the year.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said demand had increased slightly immediately
after the UK election in April but had then weakened again.
Pre-interest profits from managed businesses - products such as double
glazing, radiators and bathrooms, and cheque printing - rose 4.2 per cent to
Pounds 42.5m on sales down 3.2 per cent at Pounds 324.7m.
The group's 25.2 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the European packaging
group, contributed Pounds 20.6m to profits, a rise of 15 per cent.
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the UK building products business,
where operating profits fell from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 17.9m, had suffered
a 9 per cent volume fall in all, though with wide variations, but had
increased prices 2 per cent.
He said business was now 'bumping along the bottom' although without any
sign of an upturn. The trend in profits would depend on how competitive
rivals became on pricing.
European building product operating profits were up 39 per cent to Pounds
7.5m partly because of the sale of the loss-making Austrian boiler business.
Mr Jansen was cautious about the German market in the short term but
expected growth in the longer term.
Cheque printing, mainly based in the US, increased operating profits by 45
per cent to Pounds 17.1m. The first half of 1991 had been affected by costs
of integrating American Bank Stationery, acquired in 1989. Benefits of the
merger had now come through. Margins rose from 15 to 21 per cent, but Mr
Jansen said it was aiming to reach the 25 per cent margins its main rivals
achieved.
The balance sheet was strong, Mr Jansen said, with gearing at 12 per cent.
He said this gave the group the scope to make acquisitions although he said
the lowest risk way of spending was investing in the group's existing
businesses.
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 24m in the first half, broadly covered
by cashflow, Mr Daniel Cohen, finance director said.
Earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 7.6p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 2.75p, although this represents a 2.6 per cent rise when the
scrip element of the rights issue is taken into account.
Mr Hichens said that dividend was prudent. He said 'why stick your neck out
at the half year?' The group would be better placed to decide on the
appropriate dividend for the year when reporting full year profits next
March.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATMOUGHS (Holdings), one of the UK's largest printers, almost doubled
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 5.1m, for the half year to June
30 on the back of increased orders.
In comparing the 96 per cent profit increase with last year Mr Patrick
Walker, chairman, said account should be taken of the difficult trading
conditions affecting the second quarter of 1991, which were largely related
to the Gulf war.
The group regained the printing contract for the Saturday Times Review,
after losing it temporarily, and increased its mail order business.
Mr Walker said the group has also won more one-off contracts than before
because of its speed in processing pictures into magazines within less than
48 hours.
Turnover increased to Pounds 55.5m (Pounds 48.6m).
The group has continued to expand in continental Europe, opening a new plant
in Hungary and winning contracts in Spain.
Mr Walker said the group was on target to generate 30 per cent of turnover
from Spain, Hungary and exports from the UK by 1994.
This year's Pounds 22m rights issue, coupled with strong cash flow, enabled
the group to reduce gearing by half to 15 per cent.
Net assets stand at Pounds 90m.
Capital expenditure is expected to have almost doubled by the year end to
Pounds 33m.
The shares rose 6p to close at 443p in a falling market.
Earnings per share increased to 11.14p (6.17p). The interim dividend is
raised to 2.7p against 2.5p.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais taking over Woodchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, has
announced its ambitions to become the third force in the Irish banking
market and a significant company in the European small-ticket leasing
market.
In its interim results for the half-year to June 30, also announced
yesterday, Woodchester reported a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from
IPounds 18m to IPounds 17.5m (Pounds 16.7m).
The company intends to acquire from Credit Lyonnais Group a 30 per cent
stake in Credit Lyonnais Leasing Europe, in a share and cash deal worth
IPounds 22.1m. The deal will take the French group's stake in Woodchester to
48 per cent and it intends to increase this to 51 per cent by purchases in
the market.
CLLE is Credit Lyonnais' principal holding company for its continental
European leasing activities outside France. It has advances and other assets
worth IPounds 1.1bn.
Mr Craig McKinney, Woodchester chairman, said: 'Within 12 months I expect
Woodchester to be the third largest Irish bank with a strong retail banking
presence in Ireland. Credit Lyonnais and ourselves share that aspiration.
'If you are in the lending business you need a partnership like this
otherwise you are dead in the water'.
He added that the company was seeking to acquire a retail banking network of
50 to 60 branches in the Republic, to add to its existing 12. With
electronic banking he said Woodchester would not need the 400-branch
networks of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, the market leaders, to be
able to compete effectively. He expected that a deal would be announced
within the next three to six months.
On the leasing side Mr McKinney said: 'We want to be a big pan-European
player in partnership with Credit Lyonnais. We are going in with a partner
who knows those markets well.
'In Ireland we have 45 per cent share of the car finance market. We believe
the sector we are working in is too narrow. With what we have done in a
population of 3.5m people, we believe there is huge potential in Europe
backed by the financial muscle of Credit Lyonnais. If we cannot quadruple
(the CLLE) leasing portfolio in four years, I would be very disappointed.'
On the results Mr McKinney said: 'I believe it represents a considerable
achievement given the difficult trading conditions in the UK and represents
only a small decrease on the record profits achieved in the same period last
year.'
The result was in line with expectations, improvements in the core domestic
market having been offset by the difficult conditions in the UK.
Overall advances and other accounts increased 65 per cent to IPounds 1.36bn
(IPounds 826m).
Gross rentals were IPounds 231m (IPounds 197m). Earnings per share came out
lower at 7.47p (7.7p) and the interim dividend is raised by 20 per cent to
1.81p (1.51p). One analyst said the increase was 'indicative of
Woodchester's intention to establish itself as a banking group'.
The shares rose 16p to 154p.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Renault's UK truck side incurs Pounds 18.6m
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT TRUCK Industries, the UK subsidiary of Renault Vehicules
Industriels, the French commercial vehicle maker, suffered an Pounds 18.6m
pre-tax loss last year following losses of Pounds 20.8m in 1990 and Pounds
21.1m in 1989.
The scale of the losses, coupled with the absence of new orders to replace a
large volume military truck contract which will be completed at the end of
the month, is forcing Renault to review the future of its truck assembly
operations in the UK.
In the short-term the ending of the contract is expected to lead to further
job losses at the Dunstable plant. The workforce, excluding truck
dealerships, has already been almost halved during the recession to 552 from
1,070 at the end of 1989.
RVI has been forced to inject Pounds 20m in new equity to bolster the
battered finances of RTI, which has incurred losses for the past decade.
The latest financial restructuring follows the provision by RVI of Pounds
20.4m of additional working capital for its UK truck subsidiary in 1990, the
injection of Pounds 14.2m of extra working capital and a Pounds 15m loan in
1989. RTI's turnover fell by 10 per cent last year from Pounds 71.9m to
Pounds 64.8m.
Renault warned previously that it could end truck assembly in the UK, but
the Dunstable plant was granted at least a temporary reprieve in mid-1990,
when it won - along with Reynolds Boughton - a Pounds 20m contract to supply
846 four-wheel drive trucks to the Ministry of Defence.
The contract has accounted for close to 30 per cent of RTI's output in the
last two years.
The MoD has not exercised its option to purchase an additional 160 vehicles,
and RTI hopes that the initial contract would lead to significant export
orders have failed to materialise.
Renault took over the former Chrysler-owned Dodge truck operations in
Dunstable in 1981. It currently assembles two vehicle ranges - the 50 series
light truck, which it inherited from Dodge, and the Renault Midliner
light/medium truck. Output fell last year by 24 per cent to 915 vehicles.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: African drought takes toll on Linton Park
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The drought in Africa and consequent decline in tea production in Kenya and
Malawi left Linton Park, the tea producer, food processor and engineer, with
a 6 per cent fall in interim profits.
Mr Haughton FitzGerald, chairman, said it was unlikely that the shortfall in
production would be made up in the second half, although prices for higher
quality Kenyan teas had recently improved.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 58.7m, down from
Pounds 60.3m. After a reduced interest charge of Pounds 1.26m (Pounds
1.58m), pre-tax profits came to Pounds 2.34m, compared with Pounds 2.49m.
Earnings per share dipped to 7.1p (7.8p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.5p.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bowater agrees sale to avoid MMC referral

<TEXT>
Bowater has agreed with the Department of Trade and Industry to dispose of
its Welton medical sterilisation bags and pouches subsidiary thereby
forestalling a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, writes
John Thornhill.
The DTI asked Bowater to reduce its presence in the market following the
acquisition of the DRG packaging group which gave the combined packaging
group an unacceptably high market share. The addition of DRG's subsidiary -
DRG Malago which has an annual turnover of Pounds 4m - bolstered Bowater's
share to 51 per cent.
However, Bowater has undertaken to sell its Welton business, which has a
turnover of Pounds 2m, within 12 months.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Problems at US cable offshoot leave Delta
6% lower at Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA, the cables and engineering group, said that one of its four business
cylinders had failed to fire in the first half, causing pre-tax profits to
fall by 6 per cent, from Pounds 33.1m to Pounds 31m.
The 'problem child' was Surprenant, a US cables company badly affected by
defence cuts. The cables division saw operating profit halve to Pounds 5.61m
(Pounds 10.7m) in the six months to June 27 on sales of Pounds 139m (Pounds
146.6m).
Delta's share price, which hit 505p in May, closed 25p down at 353p
yesterday.
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said UK cables prices had fallen through
the recession and the capital spending of privatised electricity companies
remained limited.
Overall, group operating profit declined to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 29.5m) on
turnover of Pounds 402.3m (Pounds 389.6m). Earnings per share slipped to
12.7p (14.3p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 4.2p.
The star performance came from the engineering division, which advanced
operating profits by 18 per cent to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 9.53m) on sales of
Pounds 160.5m (Pounds 145.7m). The continental plumbing products business,
related to building refurbishment, had continued to grow and there was
considerable scope for expansion in eastern Europe.
Industrial services slipped to Pounds 8.43m (Pounds 9.71m) on sales of
Pounds 89.2m (Pounds 96.7m). The main impact came from the weakening
Australian dollar. Overall the effect of currency movements knocked nearly
Pounds 1m off group profit.
Circuit protection improved by 27 per cent to Pounds 7.38m (Pounds 5.8m) on
Pounds 66m (Pounds 53.7m) turnover. New products had improved the company's
market shares.
Before the group acquired the outstanding 36 per cent of Delta Crompton
Cables for Pounds 37m from BTR in June, gearing was similar to the year-end
ratio of 13 per cent on net debt of Pounds 40.7m. Mr Mike Gill, finance
director, said the up-to-date gearing figure was about 25 per cent.
The proportion of group sales in the UK has steadily declined to less than
50 per cent. Altogether, Europe, accounted for Pounds 329.2m (Pounds 307.5m)
of sales.
COMMENT
It seems the market has grown a little bored with Delta's worthy record of
cost-cutting to tackle recession, maintaining a comfortably covered dividend
and eschewing rights issues and big acquisitions. It used to benefit from
the reflected lack of glory of BICC. But with BICC yielding nearly twice as
much, sentiment has swung the other way. Unfortunately for Delta, the prompt
rationalisation to protect margins is seen as limiting recovery potential.
This is perhaps a little unfair because only a 5 per cent increase in volume
in cables would create a bounce from the lean cost base. But there are few
good words for Delta's cables business at the moment, which is seen as
commodity-like - hence the vulnerability to falling prices. The group
remains in a good position to make acquisitions for cash - there is some
regret that it did not use its erstwhile highly rated paper for this
purpose. A full-year pre-tax profit of Pounds 62m gives a prospective
multiple of 13.5. The share price ought to have fallen far enough, but it
will take some positive news to get it moving.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Jeyes turns in 20% advance to Pounds 2.11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEYES GROUP, the rapidly growing cleaning products group, yesterday
demonstrated the resilience of the UK's household goods market by reporting
a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 11.
The improvement, from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.11m, came from sales ahead 17
per cent at Pounds 35.9m, with the growth almost entirely internally
generated.
Earnings per share rose from 8.3p to 9.9p. In line with the forecast in July
when the group made an Pounds 18m acquisition of Globol of Neuberg, Germany,
the group is to pay a 3.1p interim dividend, a 19 per cent increase.
'The UK market was much stronger than we thought,' said Mr Jimmy Moir,
managing director, referring to the bleach, moist wipes and lavatory cleaner
markets, which grew, and disinfectants which shrank by just 2 per cent.
Internationally, sales grew 40 per cent and now account for 35 per cent of
profits.
Mr Moir said there was great potential for earnings enhancement at Globol,
which was making operating margins of only 2-3 per cent, compared to Jeyes'
overall 7 per cent.
The group could benefit from the kind of attention that Jeyes received after
the management buy-out he led from Cadbury Schweppes in 1986.
The acquisition of Globol, which expands group sales by about two thirds in
a full year, will greatly increase Jeyes' international presence.
Had Globol been included this year the group would have 40 per cent of sales
in the UK, 20 per cent in Germany, 20 per cent in the rest of Europe and the
balance in the rest of the world.
Gearing at the half year was unchanged at 40 per cent. Interest was six
times covered by operating profits.
COMMENT
The most surprising aspect of these good results is that the UK household
market remains so strong in spite of the recession. While Jeyes has had to
forgo some margin, its market share in the UK has increased and
internationally growth has been nothing short of phenomenal, led by a
Japanese love-affair with the 'Blu' lavatory hygiene blocks. Jeyes' next few
years of earnings growth is also pretty much guaranteed from margin
improvement, cross-marketing and cost-cutting at Globol, acquired in July.
The problem for investors who did not join the bandwagon when the MBO
vehicle came to the USM is that most of this good news is already in the
price. A full-year pre-tax profits forecast of Pounds 5.5m, or 21.8p of
earnings, puts the shares on a multiple of 21, already at a 50 per cent
premium to the market.

exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Usher-Walker, the manufacturer of printing inks and rollers, saw pre-tax
profits almost wiped out at the interim stage following a sizeable
exceptional charge and 'predatory pricing' by a competitor in the black
newspaper ink market.
After an exceptional debit of Pounds 143,000 for reorganisation and
redundancies in the group's inks and rollers divisions, pre-tax profits for
the six months to June 30 amounted to just Pounds 9,000, against Pounds
217,000 last time.
Profits at the operating level emerged at Pounds 270,000 (Pounds 416,000)
from turnover of Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 8.14m).
Earnings per share fell from 3.23p to 0.04p but the interim dividend is
being maintained at 2p.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trinity ahead of City forecasts with Pounds
7.89m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY International, the Chester-based publisher of the Liverpool Daily
Post and Echo, announced a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 6.94m to Pounds 7.89m for the six months to June 27.
Mr David Sneddon, chief executive of the group which has local and regional
papers in north-west England, North Wales, Canada and the US, said yesterday
he was particularly pleased by the performance of the group's UK newspapers
despite the recession.
'We took costs out a long time ago,' said Mr Sneddon, who added that display
advertising at the Liverpool Echo was more than 16 per cent up during the
first half.
The results were better than expected and the share price rose by 9p to
close at 250p.
This year Trinity has turned itself into a more concentrated media company.
In January it sold its papermaking and packaging division to Danish Paper
Packaging for Pounds 27m in cash.
In July the purchase of Scottish and Universal Newspapers from Lonrho for
Pounds 45m was completed too late to be included in the first half results.
The company said that integration of the Scottish titles was going well.
Turnover of the continuing Trinity businesses increased by 3.3 per cent to
Pounds 49m.
Earnings per share rose by 5.1 per cent to 8.2p and the dividend is 2.7p
compared with 2.5p.
Trinity warned that its Canadian newspaper businesses were still
experiencing competitive pressures which 'together with continued dollar
weakness will have some impact on profitability.' However, the new
management in Canada was 'aggressively addressing the competitive position.'
Trinity said it was confident that results for the full year would be
satisfactory provided there was no material worsening of market conditions.
In the year to December 1991 Trinity made pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.3m.
This year analysts are expecting between Pounds 16.2m and Pounds 16.6m.
Trinity is also looking at acquisition prospects in the newspaper industry.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Richard Lines sets up in business again -
Ex-MTM chairman returns to his beginnings at Stockton-on-Tees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD LINES, who resigned as chairman of MTM in March after controversy
over the specialist chemicals manufacturer's accounts, has set up in
business again - from the same Stockton-on-Tees offices where MTM was
created.
In an uncanny reworking of history, Mr Lines is now operating as a
consultant to fledgling entrepreneurs from Marlborough House, after which
MTM - Marlborough Technical Management - was named in 1978.
He has leased the first floor offices from Hexcel Corporation which bought
MTM's first venture, Seal Sands Chemical Company. Mr Lines, an ex-ICI man,
was running his own chemical consultancy from Marlborough House when he met
MTM co-founder Brian Wiggins in 1978.
Mr Lines was forced to resign after misleading the City about 1991 profits.
Binder Hamlyn, MTM's auditors until last week, subsequently compiled a
report that revealed 'incorrectly recorded' transactions in 1991 and gave
rise to questions about previous years' accounts.
The Stock Exchange conducted an insider trading investigation into MTM.
On his return to Marlborough House, Mr Lines even found the same decor; 'I
thought what appalling taste I had 14 years ago.' Symbolically perhaps, it
has now been changed from black and white to pale green.
First credited with creating, by sheer personal dynamism, one of the fastest
growing glamour stocks of the 1980s, and subsequently obliged to resign by
its dramatic nosedive, he says he emerged two months ago 'from the misery
zone' and set up Stronach Investments.
He regularly telephones Mr Ken Schofield, the new chief executive who turned
around the fortunes of Hickson International, the chemicals group, offering
a torrent of free advice.
Mr Lines owns 75 per cent of the new company and his business partner, Ian
Lawson, an ex-Price Waterhouse accountant, owns 25 per cent.
Mr Lines says he is advising would-be manufacturers on start-up techniques
and finance 'using all the experience one has gained over the years in
creating MTM'. Stronach Investments may invest in projects 'if the
opportunity looks good'.
Those he is advising include ex-MTM European operations director and
ex-board member Neville Newson, who left MTM in the summer.
Mr Newson, whose new company - Fine and Performance Chemicals - is next door
to Mr Lines, is acting as a chemical companies adviser, though further
development is planned.
MTM's market capitalisation was Pounds 256m before its shares plunged in
March from 286p to 26p; yesterday they closed at 30p. It showed a Pounds 20m
pre-tax loss in 1991.
The company, now being restructured, last week reported a Pounds 28m interim
loss. Net assets are Pounds 15m and net debt Pounds 100.6m.
Mr Lines said MTM's problems had not deterred clients. 'I've looked at
numerous pretty good ideas and some pretty awful ideas.'
With hindsight, he said, MTM should have taken more balanced advice; he also
now believes a 'projects person' like him should hand over day-to-day
running of his creation.
Mr Lines, who last year sold 1.25m shares in MTM at 247p each, said he
needed both to earn a living and to satisfy his desire to work. He retains a
6 per cent stake in MTM, where Mr Schofield is seeking about Pounds 40m in a
new capital injection from shareholders.
So far he had helped create 36 jobs, four at Stronach and 32 in two Teesside
start-ups, making furniture and household equipment.
MTM's setback was 'a bit sad', he said, but he was confident for its future.
And his ambition for Stronach Investments? 'It's got to move in the right
direction.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / Kingfisher advances 4% despite sharp fall at B&amp;Q
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, one of the UK's biggest retailing groups, reported higher than
expected interim profits of Pounds 64.9m, representing a 4 per cent gain
before tax and exceptional items.
But the headline figure disguised a 10 per cent fall at the pre-interest
level as profits at the B&amp;Q DIY chain were eroded by a fierce discounting
war. Strong cash generation reversed the company's interest position
yielding a Pounds 400,000 contribution against a Pounds 9.1m charge.
The Kingfisher group, which also includes the Woolworths, Superdrug and
Comet chains, said trading had been patchy and it expected no uplift in
consumer spending this year.
Mr Geoff Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive, said: 'A good month has been
followed by a bad one. Some of our markets have looked stronger only to fade
away again. It is a tough world out there for retailers and it is not going
to get any easier.'
He added: 'If your house price has fallen, you are afraid of losing your
job, and you have high levels of personal debt you are bloody well not going
to go out and spend money no matter where interest rates are.'
Kingfisher's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 1.56bn in the six months to
August 1 as the company claimed to have won market share in all its core
markets.
B&amp;Q saw operating profits fall from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 40.1m but the
company said its emphasis on 'everyday low pricing' should minimise the
attractions of competitor discounts.
Superdrug edged ahead by Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 12.8m; Woolworths,
strongly weighted to the second half, contributed Pounds 800,000 (up from
Pounds 200,000); and Comet reduced its losses to Pounds 500,000 (down from
Pounds 2.8m).
Kingfisher will spend Pounds 300m over the next three years on store
improvements. Woolworths and Superdrug will be fitted with electronic point
of sale systems and up to 60 B&amp;Q Depot format stores will be rolled out.
Property development profits and investment income at Chartwell Land
contributed Pounds 17.5m (down from Pounds 20.8m). An exceptional profit of
Pounds 2.9m (against Pounds 8.1m) arose from retail property disposals.
Earnings per share were static at 9.2p. But the interim dividend was lifted
by 5 per cent to 4.2p. The shares closed unchanged at 474p.

FT  16 SEP 92 / BHP takes control of Foster's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHP, Australia's biggest company, is taking effective control of Foster's
Brewing, the troubled Australian-based international brewer, in a deal worth
about ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 540m).
BHP announced yesterday it was buying 32 per cent of Foster's, plus options,
from the receivers of International Brewing Holdings (IBH), the private
group controlled by Mr John Elliott, the former Foster's chief.
BHP has also offered to buy a further 5 per cent of Foster's capital from
Citibank, which has also placed part of IBH in receivership.
BHP underlined its influence by placing its nominees in four out of the 12
seats on the Foster's board, following Monday's resignation of Mr Elliott
and his associate, Mr Ken Biggins. BHP's move came as Foster's announced it
had plunged to net losses of ADollars 950.8m for the year to June and a
two-for-five rights issue to raise ADollars 1bn.
The losses followed asset write-downs of ADollars 1.19bn which disguised a
strong performance from the company's breweries, particularly in the UK.
BHP's ascendancy at Foster's has been expected since June 2 when it sent
receivers into the IBH group.
Mr John Prescott, BHP managing director, said last night his company was
comfortable with a long-term Foster's investment. BHP's exposure to Foster's
stands at just under ADollars 2.5bn or just over 10 per cent of the brewer's
total assets.
The receivers of IBH had been attempting to find alternative buyers for the
company's Foster's stake since mid-August after BHP made an offer for the
parcel, worth ADollars 2.39 a share.
That price, which involves debt forgiveness, equates to a cash price of
about ADollars 2 a share. It is higher than the ADollars 1.10-a-share price
on the Foster's scrip issue announced yesterday.
The issue will be fully underwritten by Potter Warburg, the Australian
investment bank. BHP says it will take up its entitlement and act as a
sub-underwriter.
Foster's shares fell 13 cents yesterday to a year low of ADollars 1.46 on
the Australian stock exchanges.
It said it expected dividends would total 6 cents a share out of profits
earned in the year to June 30 1993.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Arjo Wiggins cuts dividend by 19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO Wiggins Appleton, the troubled Franco-British paper group, unexpectedly
cut its dividend yesterday by 19 per cent from 3.3p per share to 2.65p. The
group's shares fell 29 per cent from 182p to 129p.
Profits before tax for the first six months to June 30, fell 26 per cent
from Pounds 135.5m to Pounds 99.1m, although they were in line with
expectations.
Earnings per share fell from 10.7p to 7.5p.
Operating profits were Pounds 112.4m against Pounds 146.1m a year ago as the
company struggled in difficult trading conditions. Group turnover was Pounds
1.30bn compared with Pounds 1.26bn for the same period last year.
Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the results were far better than those of its
competitors. The fall in profits had been almost entirely attributable to
the weak European market, he said.
Mr Tony Isaacs, finance director, said most of the problems were in the
European carbonless paper and coated paper markets. Results in the
carbonless sector remained poor, with capacity utilisation of only 85 per
cent to 88 per cent.
Prices had fallen about 20 per cent over the past two years. The coated
market was continuing to grow fast, but new capacity had come on stream,
forcing operating rates down to about 85 per cent and prices down about 10
per cent.
The company was also hit by the dollar's fall which affected earnings from
the US Appleton operations. The company lost about Pounds 3m for each 10
cents the dollar lost, he said.
Mr Stenham said the outlook was grey for the balance of the year and 1993.
Gearing, which began the year at 13 per cent, would more than double by the
end of 1992. The company is a third of the way through a Dollars 170m paper
investment in the US.
The group was still looking for two British board members to replace Mr
Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, who resigned, and Mr Ian
Kennedy who retired, said Mr Stenham. One replacement was likely to be
British, while the other might be American or a non-French continental
European.
Mr Stephen Walls, the former British chief executive, was replaced this
summer by Mr Alain Soulas, formerly chief executive of Saint-Gobain's paper
division.

<TEXT>
SEVERAL European banks and many individual investors stand to suffer heavy
losses from their exposure to Castor Holdings, the Montreal-based property
holding company at the centre of a tangled international group controlled by
financier Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg.
A bankruptcy trustee, Richter &amp; Associates of Montreal, has identified
contingent liabilities of CDollars 743m (Pounds 323m) since Castor was
placed in receivership two months ago, but total losses to investors are
expected to be considerably higher.
Castor's bank lenders include Credit Suisse, which has an unsecured exposure
of about CDollars 100m, Paribas and Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank.
The biggest creditor is Chrysler Canada's pension fund, with an exposure of
more than CDollars 200m. A number of secured creditors have begun
proceedings to seize their collateral.
Castor was set up in the mid-1970s to invest European funds in North
American property. The full extent of its operations is far from clear, and
is expected to take several years to untangle.
A lawyer involved in the proceedings said Castor made a 'multitude of loans'
to various property developers, including Imry Merchant Developers in the
UK. It is also known that Castor lent money to York-Hannover Developments, a
group controlled by German-Canadian property financier Mr Karsten von
Wersebe.
York-Hannover is at the centre of allegations in Switzerland that Rothschild
Bank of Zurich, the associate of UK merchant bank NM Rothschild, contravened
banking rules by advancing more than 20 per cent of its capital in unsecured
loans to a single customer.
Castor also has connections with other companies in Canada, the UK, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Cyprus and Curacao.
One of the Cyprus-based subsidiaries, CH International (Overseas), is
currently being wound up.
Mr Stolzenberg, who lives in London, appeared with his lawyer at a
creditors' meeting in Montreal last month.
He has also had a brief, informal meeting with the bankruptcy trustee, and
has indicated a willingness to be interviewed more thoroughly on Castor's
affairs.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Scottish banking group rescued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN emergency rescue of a small Scottish private banking group, Adam &amp;
Company, has been organised over the past three weeks after it lost Pounds
21m on foreign currency futures.
The losses were made by the three employees of Adam's London treasury
dealing department, which trades in foreign currency and short-term
securities.
All three have been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation by a
firm of accountants, Price Waterhouse. Mr James Laurenson, Adam's managing
director, said the dealings had been 'unauthorised'. He said the treasury
team began to make the loss-making deals in April, but that senior
management only became aware of them three weeks ago.
He said the deals came to light because losses on them had become so big
that 'they could not be hidden'. All the dealing positions have now been
closed. However, the bank's capital - which was Pounds 7.1m at the end of
June - was wiped out by the losses. But the bank has been able to keep
trading because it has persuaded one of its shareholders to inject Pounds
21m of new capital into it.
The shareholder, which is buying Pounds 21m of new preference shares in
Adam's banking subsidiary, has asked for its identity to remain secret. The
preference shares pay no coupon for 10 years.
Mr Laurenson said the bank was 'incredibly' fortunate to have such a
supportive shareholder. He believes the bank has emerged stronger than
before, because of the terms of the injection and because of support by the
Royal Bank of Scotland, which has provided committed credit lines to the
bank.
Adam's biggest shareholders include the wealthy Schlumberger family and also
Standard Life, the Scottish insurance company. It is understood neither made
the capital injection.
Adam disclosed yesterday it had incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5m in the
year to June 30, compared with a profit in the previous year of Pounds
869,000. The results included Pounds 6.58m of the Pounds 21m foreign
currency loss. Adam believes only Pounds 6.58m had in fact been incurred by
June 30.
Mr Laurenson said that without the foreign currency loss 'profits would have
almost doubled'.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Shareholders claim a lack of entente: Strong reaction to
paper group's move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British analysts and institutional shareholders re-acted angrily to Arjo
Wiggins Appleton's dividend cut yesterday.
Most complained they could not understand the reasons for the unexpected
decision by the Franco-British paper group.
The move seems to represent a serious breakdown in understanding between St
Louis, AWA's French minority shareholder, and its British counterparts.
It also demonstrates the different attitudes of French and Anglo-Saxon
groups to shareholder value and management practice.
Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman of St Louis, the French group which owns 39 per
cent of AWA, said he was surprised at the reaction of the London market.
'This is very simple,' he said. 'What concerned us was the fall in profits
this year and last. There was no prospect of an improvement next year. If
profits fall, then it's absolutely normal to cut the dividend. That is not
unusual. It's not a French nor a British practice, but just good
management.'
Mr Nicholas Worms, senior partner at Worms et Cie, the French financial
group which owns 36 per cent of St Louis, said UK institutions had
over-reacted to the cut.
He said the market should have appreciated the move as a sign the company
was serious about getting to grips with its problems, although they were not
as serious as other companies in the sector.
UK analysts were far from understanding, however. 'The cut is a stupidity
and a tragedy. There was just no need to do it,' said one analyst.
'Financially the group is strong. The decision shows Arjo Wiggins has
effectively become a subsidiary of a French group that does not have the
interests of the majority shareholders at heart.'
Another analyst complained: 'The company is completely out of touch with its
shareholders - apart from 39 per cent of them.'
There were suggestions that a lower share price after the dividend cut might
make it easier for St Louis to raise its stake.
Mr Dumon said St Louis had no plans to increase its shareholding for the
time being. 'There is nothing in the air or any studies to go above the 40
per cent limit set during the merger between the French and British
companies.'
Mr Worms said that if in a couple of years the market had been 'completely
idiotic' and the share price was too low, St Louis might then approach the
other shareholders to buy them out.
However, he said St Louis was relatively too heavily invested in the paper
industry and did not have spare cash to squander.
Mr Tony Isaacs, AWA finance director, said that given the expected fall in
earnings for the full year, dividend cover would have dropped below the 2.0
to 2.5 times target set by the company if the dividend had been maintained.
The savings, he estimated, were about Pounds 13m. But analysts said such a
sum was tiny compared with the Pounds 50m the company had spent on
acquisitions and the Pounds 82m it was spending on capital investment.
Shares look likely to remain weak until the company can regain the City's
confidence. But most analysts believed that could now take years.
Meanwhile, Mr Worms insisted the move would strengthen the company. 'We have
to be realistic,' he said.
'If we want the company to be in a position to take advantage of the market
and make a Pounds 100m or Pounds 200m investment, then it's essential to
have a strong balance sheet. The dividend cut helps us achieve that.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: The Japanese have never forgotten Keynes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his interesting piece, 'International Capital Markets: Europe stays
out of step' (September 7), Anthony Harris says that the Japanese have
rediscovered Keynes. When we made a detailed study of the Japanese domestic
construction market in 1990 (still the only one of its kind, the report on
which the Japanese requested permission to translate), it was obvious that
they had never forgotten him. When we said so to the president of the
Research Institute for the Construction Industry, he was very amused. In
construction any shortfall in private investment is made up by public
investment and vice versa.
The Japanese also understand that you create a supply-side economy by
ensuring there is a supply of what the economy needs (educated and trained
people, research and development, investment in plant, product design and
marketing) rather than hoping it will be induced by macro-economic magic.
And a successful economy can be solidly based on investment and exports, not
domestic consumption.
Finally, the Japanese understand the power of the tribe (see Michael
Prowse's piece on Hayek, September 7). In their successful days there were
British and American tribes which had the same power, but no longer.

The Socialist Group in the European Parliament - which recently announced
via some fine posters and postcards that Napoleon and Charlemagne would have
voted Yes in Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht - have now brought
their campaign efforts a bit more up to date.
They have taken out an access code on France's high-tech, on-line Minitel
service, which is available to all telephone subscribers. So all those
punching 'Vote Oui' into their Minitel handset will get a crisp and graphic
explanation of why they should indeed vote Yes on Sunday; 4,000 callers have
so far availed themselves of this clarification.
And as a spoiling tactic, the Socialists also booked the 'Vote Non' code so
as to keep one jump ahead of the motley rejectionist front in the Maastricht
campaign.
The smirk on their faces acquired a slightly pink hue, however, when it was
discovered that the simple 'Oui' access code gains callers entry to a
distinctly bluer, though equally graphic area - one of Minitel's porn
services.

Canary Wharf has lost another lifeline with the outside world. The Number 40

The Bingham report into the collapse of BCCI, the corrupt international
bank, could have landed its author, Lord Bingham, in very hot water.
The report - commissioned by the government - was at one stage scheduled to
be published today. However, the inquiry has few precedents and so it was
only late in the day that the Treasury's solicitors discovered that very
little privilege attached to it. In other words, Lord Bingham, the new
Master of the Rolls, could have been sued for libel.
Rather than risk a lorryload of writs landing on the desk of the most senior
civil court judge, the Treasury has decided to postpone publication till the
report can be released under parliamentary privilege when the Commons
resumes.

Pleased to hear that Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National
and author of what is generally seen as one of the more offbeat ideas for
heaving the British housing market out of the doldrums, has found a soul
mate to chat to at board meetings.
True to the bank's style of picking 'unconventional' people as its
non-executive directors, it has chosen Sir Terence Heiser, who retired as
permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment in June. 'His
style, way of thinking, and background is not exactly conventional,'
enthuses Sir Christopher.
In common with the last mandarin non-exec at Abbey - Sir John Garlick who
retired last year - Sir Terence has anything but the typical Whitehall
background; they both, for instance, joined the civil service straight from
school. With his recreation of 'talking', according to Who's Who, he
obviously continues to defy the norm for his colleagues.
Sir Christopher says he has not been able to discuss his idea of tax breaks
for homeowners who have lost money on their bricks and mortar investment, as
Sir Terence is still in purdah. For two such chatty men (Sir Christopher
lists 'conversation' as one of his Who's Who recreations) this must have
been a severe strain.

Being a 'close friend' of analyst-cum-author Terry Smith, who is making the
most of his 15 minutes of fame, certainly brings its own reflected glory.
Paul Compton, UK engineering analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is resigning
this morning to go to Credit Lyonnais, a move that would undoubtedly have
gone largely unnoticed - apart perhaps from a brief envious glance from his
colleagues in the direction of his 'much better salary' - had he not been a
regular dinner companion of Terry Smith.
Smith, the author of Accounting For Growth and recently sacked by UBS P &amp; D,
has been basking in the glare of publicity and the ensuing flurry of
questions about the independence of analysts at City investment houses.
He has asked Compton to appear as his witness in the second disciplinary
hearing. Compton, in turn, is ruling out any connection between his
resignation and his witnessing activities. Pointing out that another
colleague, still with the firm, was the witness at the first session, he
goes on to explain that he is joining John Holmes, formerly head of Morgan
Grenfell Securities, for whom he worked before joining UBS four years ago.
He has been in discussions for the past six months, - though he is not
denying that the dismal atmosphere at the firm in the wake of the Smith
upheaval may have speeded his departure.

<TEXT>
Sir, With distribution logistics fast becoming an even bigger global
concern, I read the FT's survey on Distribution Service (September 3) with
great interest.
However, in the article 'A hidden force ready for action - Japanese eye UK
market', the remark by Mr Jack Mather, chief executive of NFC, that '(The
Japanese) come in on the back of Japanese manufacturers - they all trade and
link together - and use them as a base. Then they'll spread to other
customers', makes us Japanese sound like some sort of germ. It spoilt, at
least for me, the up-till-then impartial and objective analysis of Japanese
distribution network systems.
I cannot deny that there are many undesirable aspects about the Japanese
manufacturer-distributor relationship. But it would only mean another bout
of meaningless 'Japan-bashing' to criticise current systems without trying
to find out what makes them click, and without saying what exactly critics
want done about it. I may well be mistaken, but I feel the main reason for
Japan's 'success' in this area was that which seemed to be asked for
throughout the survey - an understanding of the customer's business and
services tailored to market needs.
True, some Japanese companies may continue to prefer all-Japanese 'exported'
systems, but there are limits to this, and as the confidence and scale of
Japanese business grow, many already realise the merits of local networks
and are using the most efficient, logistic system regardless of nationality.
Surely local customers will also want to give their custom to the provider
of the best services in the same way?
In an increasingly borderless world, we must do our best to understand and
learn from one another in order to reap the benefits of mutuality and
reciprocity, and make the best use of the 'good' competition available to
achieve co-prosperity worldwide. Yumiyo Yamamoto,

FT  16 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: Cold war's final frontier - The North
Korean iceberg may be beginning to melt under the impact of global warming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europeans have often been accused, in recent years, of being excessively
absorbed in their own affairs, and expecting everyone else to find those
affairs equally absorbing.
The complaint was heard during the cold war, when Iraqis or Iranians could
die by the hundred thousand without disturbing the global strategic balance
but a single shot fired in Berlin would have the whole world transfixed.
That particular spot of bother has been disposed of, but now Europeans
cannot confront even smaller-scale problems such as Yugoslavia without
calling in the UN to do the dirty work. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, was complaining about that, quite rightly, back in July.
It was salutary, therefore, that this year's annual conference of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) should have been held
last week a long way from Europe - in the South Korean capital, Seoul. The
IISS is recognised as the leading think-tank in its field, but it is based
in London and its directorial baton has just passed from a Frenchman to a
Swede. So it did well to accept the invitation of its Korean members,
reminding itself and the world that Asia, too, has its own security
problems.
Although the conference was supposed to be about 'Asia's international role
in the post-cold war era', it was not until the final session that anyone
said anything about the contribution that east Asia, home of the
fastest-growing economies in the world, could make to global security.
One of the points made was that Japan has made a contribution, at the price
of a traumatic internal debate, by amending its constitution to allow
Japanese troops to join in UN peacekeeping operations. I agree, but it was
clear that some Asians present (not least those from Korea itself) saw even
this as an extra problem, since the memory of what Japanese troops got up to
last time they went overseas is still too fresh and too painful.
Anxiety and suspicion left over from old conflicts, and the second world war
in particular, can hardly surprise the European visitor. But what does
strike anyone used to thinking about security in a European or Atlantic
context is the lack of any regional structure designed to overcome or even
manage these problems. No Nato, no EC, and for that matter no Warsaw Pact.
The cold war in these parts was waged, on both sides, through an untidy set
of bilateral relationships. On the communist side there was open hostility
between China and the Soviet Union from 1960 onwards: local communist powers
such as North Korea and North Vietnam were obliged to maintain a delicate
balancing act between the two. On the western side there was the ill-fated
South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (Seato), but even the great
'pactomaniac' of the 1950s, John Foster Dulles, did not attempt to form a
Neato between Japan, South Korea and nationalist China (Taiwan).
So it is hardly surprising that Asians are not very receptive to the
suggestion, insistently pressed on them by Europeans, that they should deal
with the residue of the cold war by forming a 'CSCA' (conference on security
and co-operation in Asia), modelled on the CSCE, the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe.
The CSCE in its present form is not much to write home about, in any case:
it is doing precious little to resolve the conflicts breaking out all over
eastern Europe, and has not even got round to filling the post of high
commissioner on national minorities, which it decided to create more than
two months ago.
The CSCE came into existence originally as the result of complex
negotiations between two already highly structured blocs. No such building
blocs are visible in Asia today. But the alarming result is that almost
every Asian state, faced with the prospect that the US might lose interest
in the region in the absence of a Soviet threat, is stepping up its military
expenditure and nervously eyeing that of its neighbours.
Koreans, for their part, are especially unreceptive to suggestions that the
reunification of their peninsula could be managed through a '2 plus 4'
process on the German model - the four being, in this case, the US, Russia,
China and Japan. It is true that South Korea is now officially on good terms
with these four, having established diplomatic relations with China last
month. But Koreans are quick to point out that the four do not have the
legal status in Korea that Britain, France, the US and the Soviet Union had
in divided Germany.
Korea was not a defeated power in 1945. On the contrary, as a 'liberated'
Japanese colony, it was on the side of the victors. Its division only came
about because Mr Dean Rusk, then a middle-ranking US state department
official, drew a line along the 38th parallel. South of it, the Japanese
surrender would be accepted by American forces; north, by Soviet ones. The
Soviet Union took advantage of this arrangement to install a communist
regime in the north under President Kim Il Sung, who is still there.
Mr James Baker, when still US secretary of state, described the Korean
peninsula as 'the last glacier of the cold war'. That is certainly a good
description of Kim Il Sung's regime, which has done a more thorough job of
isolating and repressing its people than any other communist regime since
Stalin's death.
Radio and TV sets are pre-tuned to government stations, and those few North
Koreans who travel abroad on official business are forbidden to talk about
their experiences when they return home, on pain of dire consequences. It is
assumed, therefore, that North Koreans know far less about South Korea than
East Germans did about West Germany; and South Koreans admit to knowing very
little about the lives and opinions of ordinary people in North Korea.
Talk of 'managing reunification', therefore, may seem premature. Kim Il Sung
is not volunteering for the fate of Mr Erich Honecker. No Gorbachev, and
probably no Deng Xiaoping, is in a position to topple him from power. But he
is 80 years old and his chosen successor, his son Kim Jong Il, cuts a less
than convincing figure.
Even the North Korean glacier may be beginning to melt under the impact of
global warming. In the past two years Mr Kim has embarked on barter trade
and political dialogue with the South (the eighth 'high-level meeting' is
being held in Pyongyang this week); and this summer, yielding to intense
pressure from the US, Mr Kim has allowed the International Atomic Energy
Agency to carry out a thorough inspection of his country's nuclear
facilities.
That is still a long way from unification, and the South would be happy to
keep the process as gradual as possible; it is well aware of the havoc
wrought by rapid unification in Germany, which in many ways was better
equipped for the task.
But many South Koreans are also aware that they may have no choice in the
matter, if the regime in the North cracks and its people begin to flock
southwards as East Germans flocked west.
If that happens, the new Korea will need a lot of help and understanding
from its neighbours. Surely some sort of multilateral framework, with the US
as a full participant, would help the states of the region to approach this
and other looming security problems with greater confidence and less mutual
distrust.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Wrong curriculum for 21st century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From FRANCES STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Apple-pie curriculum', September 11) describes his ideal
curriculum for British children today as including proficiency in English,
'an acquaintance with the Bible and Shakespeare and the best of modern
literature. A little science, a smidgen of history and a dip into French,
German or another European language'. And he claims, presumably correctly,
that this is what the national curriculum will achieve.
Is this a curriculum suitable for preparing British children for the 21st
century, from an economic, political or cultural perspective?
For Britain to reverse its economic decline, our education must include
basic science and technology as central subjects, more important than the
Bible or Shakespeare. A little science is not enough.
If Britain is to participate fully in European governance and our children
are to participate fully in its economic opportunities, every child should
leave school fluent in another European language. A 'dip' into a foreign
language - which is what most English children enjoy now - will leave us and
them at an increasing disadvantage in all European matters. Ideally every
child should have some of their schooling in another European country.
In our multi-ethnic society, the exclusive focus on the Bible and
Shakespeare is offensive to the non-Christian majority and makes no attempt
to educate our children to be tolerant and inclusive in their religious and
cultural attitudes.
Joe Rogaly (and apparently the government's) curriculum is an attempt to
turn the clock back to the 19th century in cultural terms - and then our
under-emphasis on technology and its low prestige was the forerunner of our
present economic decay. His curriculum is ideally suited for a life spent on
the desert island of Desert Island Discs, when the only occupation available
is to read the Bible and Shakespeare: is this the environment we expect in
the 21st century?

FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Government purchase of services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Smith's report, 'Treasury spells out preference for private
sector' (September 10), repeated a misleading statement by Civil Service
unions on government policy. The unions quoted from a document about selling
government services into outside markets and claimed that this conflicts
with our statements on Competing for Quality. This is not so. The two are
different. The first deals with government competing with the private sector
in markets outside government, the second with government as purchaser of
services for its own use.
Our guidance on market testing sets out very plainly our policy on the
government's purchase of services for its own use on behalf of the taxpayer.
We want to improve the quality of services. A key element of this is to
ensure that services currently provided in-house are tested against the
market. The contract will be awarded on the basis of who can provide the
best combination of quality and price. Staff will be encouraged to prepare a
proposal and bid on the same basis and time-scale as the private sector.
This is fair to those who work in the public sector, to the taxpayer and to
those dependent on services purchased by government.
When the government may be in competition with the private sector in the
supply of services outside government, it is important that it does not use
what may be its cheaper access to capital or other advantages to compete
unfairly; and where the private sector operates satisfactorily, there has
long been a presumption against expanding the role of state as trader.
Market testing will be conducted with fair and open competition for internal
and external bids and with no dogmatic preference for either. William

FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Devaluation - a remedy that has not worked in the
long run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor GEOFFREY MAYNARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Muellbauer (Personal View, September 14) makes a strong case for a
devaluation of sterling. It is one that has been advanced many times in the
last 20 years, the core of it being that output, employment and
manufacturing competitiveness will all be increased while, in the existing
state of employment, inflation will not be significantly raised.
Indeed, Prof Muellbauer goes further. Econometric models, including the
Treasury's, he says, 'take no account of the ways a devaluation could in
current circumstances raise output permanently and cut inflation in the
longer run'.
Those with long memories note that the D-Mark/sterling exchange rate is 2.80
today compared with more than 8 in 1971; that in the intervening years UK
inflation has far exceeded Germany's; and that the UK's relative
manufacturing competitiveness is probably worse today than it was then. Real
wages and labour productivity have risen less fast in the UK than in
Germany; and the UK has generally found it more difficult to maintain
employment. Some people, including myself, do not believe that these
developments are unrelated.
Admittedly a strong short-run case can often be made for sterling
devaluation, but the obvious failure of the repeated application of the
remedy to work in the long run should surely lead us to be wary of it.

FT  16 SEP 92 / People: Stevenson to replace Stormonth Darling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Stormonth Darling, the chairman of Mercury Asset Management, is
retiring in November after 14 years in the post. He is to be replaced by
Hugh Stevenson (right), one of three directors in SG Warburg's investment
banking division and the mastermind of MAM's public flotation in 1987.
Stormonth Darling says that having reached 60, the 'normal' retirement age
of MAM directors, he will relinquish his post but intends to remain a
non-executive director. His retirement has been planned since the turn of
the year and, he says, is not in any way connected with the well-publicised
departure several weeks ago of Leonard Licht, deputy chairman and a star of
MAM's fund management team.
Stevenson becomes the first chairman of MAM, Britain's largest fund
management group, never to have worked as a fund manager. 'I would say that
on the whole, fund managers are not very good at managing businesses,' he
says. He had been a MAM board member and a member of its policy committee
since 1986.
His main priority will be to 'maintain the continuity of the business in
terms of staff and strategy'. Despite widespread press speculation of
unhappiness within the ranks of MAM senior executives, Stevenson says that
the group's entire management team is unchanged from that at flotation five
years ago and that more senior executives have joined in recent months than
have left.
Stevenson will be assisted by a new executive committee, consisting of
deputy chairmen David Price and Stephen Zimmerman, Carol Galley, Nigel
Hurst-Brown, David Rosier and Lord Cairns.

FT  16 SEP 92 / People: Unilever shuffles responsibilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products manufacturer, has
announced a reshuffle of board-level responsibilities involving six
directors.
On January 1, Morris Tabaksblat will relinquish the chairmanship of the food
executive, which co-ordinates Unilever's worldwide food operations, to
concentrate on his work with the three-man special committee, the group's
most senior decision-making body.
He will take over responsibility for central and eastern Europe. He joined
the special committee, the other members of which are Unilever's British and
Dutch chairmen, in May.
Jan Peelen will become chairman of the food executive and will be succeeded
as director for east Asia and the Pacific by Alexander Kemner, who is
currently responsible for food operations in southern Europe.
Charles Miller Smith will succeed Kemner. Hans Eggerstedt, the commercial
director, will also take over Miller Smith's responsibilities as financial
director.
Eggerstedt's responsibilities for Europe will be transferred to Michael
Heron, who will continue as director in charge of personnel and external
affairs.
Though Unilever gave no reason for the changes, it is understood that they
are intended mainly to broaden top managers' experience and skills. All the
directors except Peelen were appointed to their posts in 1989.

FT  16 SEP 92 / People: Non-Japanese to be an md at Komatsu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Komatsu, the Japanese construction equipment manufacturer, has appointed
Keith Tipping as managing director of its Birtley plant near Gateshead.
Tipping, 46, one of Komatsu UK's earliest recruits at Birtley in 1986, is
the first non-Japanese managing director of a Komatsu manufacturing plant
anywhere in the world. On October 1, he succeeds Toshitake Suketomo, who
returns to Japan to take overall responsibility for Komatsu's recently
formed International Division for construction equipment. Suketomo will also
become non-executive chairman of Komatsu UK.
Tipping's appointment comes at the end of a difficult 18 months for Komatsu
UK; the recession's impact on the construction industry forced the shedding
of 80 jobs at Birtley and the plant made a Pounds 6.62 loss in 1991. But
with the first UK-designed Komatsu excavators now in production at Birtley,
Tipping believes prospects are becoming muchbrighter.
His appointment follows a restructuring of management roles following the
departure in June of personnel director Clive Morton, now with Northern
Electric. Tipping plans to continue Komatsu UK's commitment to community
involvement - and its Japanese-style morning physical exercises for the
plant's 350 employees.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: The green view on subsidiarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN HINES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the French referendum on Maastricht imminent, it has been disconcerting
how little coverage has been given to the environmental priorities of both
the existing and proposed European Community. A key question governing
effective environmental protection is whether the dogma of free trade should
be allowed to continue to override national environmental concerns.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, has challenged this view, calling for
changes that allow countries in the EC to take unilateral action to protect
their environment even if they override the sacred objective of the freedom
of movement of goods and services.
However, such questioning is not found in the Maastricht Treaty or the
debate surrounding it. Instead, 'subsidiarity' has been promoted as a key
term since the Danish 'no' vote. This has been brought to the fore in an
attempt to calm those who perceive that Maastricht means the loss of
sovereign control to Brussels.
Subsidiarity, put simply, means that action should be taken at a Community
level only where it would be more appropriate than taking action at a
national or regional authority level.
In order for environmental protection to become a basic goal of the EC, the
principle of 'subsidiarity' has to be harnessed to this end. 'Green
subsidiarity' would be defined as confining EC intervention to those areas
where it will be more effective than national action in ensuring maximum
protection of the environment.
Thus the EC would not be able to hinder member states from introducing more
stringent environmental measures than the Community norm, regardless of
whether it might be an impediment to some trade within the Community. The
mechanism would also make the EC's harmonised levels of environmental
protection a floor beneath which no member state's environmental standards
would be allowed to drop.
Last month, for instance, France closed its border to German waste after the
discovery that trucks which were supposed to carry household waste also
contained syringes, bloodbags and other dangerous hospital waste.
Around the same time the Swedish government was warned by the EC Commission
that its draft regulation on ozone-depleting substances was contrary to the
proposed trade arrangements between itself and the EC.
Sweden wants to introduce a ban on the imports of products containing or
produced with CFCs, HCFCs and other ozone destroyers. The Commission is
concerned that these measures will be considered too stringent and would go
further than EC regulations.
On the other hand, there is the speculation that the UK government could use
the principle in the opposite way to weaken domestic adherence to the
restrictions imposed by the EC's Bathing and Drinking Water Directives.
The principle of 'green subsidiarity' applied to these cases would mean that
decisions would be made at the level which would ensure maximum
environmental protection. Its use would allow France to maintain controls on
the imports of German toxic waste.
It would also mean that Sweden's proposed bans on products containing, or
produced by, ozone-depleting chemicals would not have to be watered down in
order to ensure their right of passage into the European Community.
The UK, however, would not be allowed to retain its sorry title of 'The
Dirty Man of Europe' by using 'subsidiarity' as an excuse to drop its
bathing and drinking water standards below those of the EC directives.
Allowing some member countries to go further than the EC norm would create
new competitive pressures in Europe and over time could be expected to lead
to the ratcheting up of national standards. An additional impetus that might
need to be considered would be to allow a country to set environmental
conditions for access to its markets.
Regardless of whether Maastricht will need to be renegotiated, the European
Community's major environmental problems will remain largely unsolved unless
tackled at such a fundamental level.
'Green subsidiarity' thus provides the mechanism for ensuring both the
maximum protection for the environment and the emergence of a group of
nations which are constantly increasing their environmental standards.
Colin Hines works for Greenpeace on trade and environment issues.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Style without substance -
Andrew Jack argues that without approved guidelines, companies'
environmental disclosures invite criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fans of the Body Shop may have been impressed when the company produced a
'green book' earlier this year to accompany its annual report. But while the
text gushed over the company's achievements in 47 pages, one independent eye
was rather more circumspect.
A statement at the end from Arthur D Little, brought in as independent
consultants, or 'verifiers' of the information in the report, said it was
'impressed' by the company's 'leading role in promoting environmental
excellence'.
But it added that the Body Shop still needed to assess areas such as the
impact of its manufacturing wastes and pollutant emissions, and to develop a
formal audit programme.
It stressed that it only examined one of the company's plants, that it did
not conduct a comprehensive environmental audit, and that it did not
validate figures quoted by Body Shop on issues such as raw material and
energy consumption and waste.
The report raises both good and bad points in the emergence of environmental
auditing. While a handful of companies are beginning to take the publication
of their green impact seriously, the results can be disappointing and
limited.
A survey earlier this month by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
monitoring service of company accounts, showed that 23 per cent mentioned
environmental information in their most recent annual report, up from 10 per
cent 14 months earlier.
There has been a corresponding growth in independent consultancies to meet
these new demands. Environmental Data Services, a green information
organisation based in London, is about to issue its third annual directory
of environmental consultants. Stewart Foxon, who has been co-ordinating the
project, says he has heard estimates of more than 1,000 firms claiming to
provide green advice.
His new directory, which is rather more selective in choosing 'mainstream'
firms, will list 350 consultancies employing more than 10,000 people and
with an estimated turnover last year of Pounds 350m.
The growth in environmental consulting in the last few years has been
staggering. The first edition of the directory in 1990 listed 125 firms.
Last year's contained 225 with a turnover of Pounds 200m. The new version
will show that one third of the firms expect their turnover to double within
the next five years.
It will show that roughly 18,000 contracts were awarded to the consultancies
in the last year. Most of the work related to contaminated land and water
pollution. Environmental auditing alone represents a growing field, up from
5 per cent last year to 8 per cent.
As more companies lay claim to the green mantle in their annual reports and
publicity material, a growing number of consultancies are emerging which
offer data to fill the space. Quality can leave much to be desired.
The pressure to gather environmental information reflects rapidly growing
public and political concern over the subject. This has given rise to a
series of national and international legal requirements. Among the most
significant are the EC guidelines on environmental impact assessment, first
published in 1988, and the forthcoming packaging directives.
The voluntary Eco-audit requirements - which will require independent
scrutiny of environmental impact of a company's activities - are due to be
in place by 1994. Similar guidelines are being developed through British
Standard 7750. All are beginning to have an effect on the level of corporate
green activity.
Directors in some companies - notably the chemical sector - grit their teeth
at the sudden obsession with things green, however. Many have been
conducting environmental audits for several years. The Chemical Industries
Association has a well-established set of guidelines, for example.
The reason is often grounded in sound business management. Geoff Mills, a
director of the Association of Environmental Consultancies, and head of
consultants Gibb Environmental, argues that companies want both to recognise
emerging problems - to stave off litigation or public criticism - and to
identify areas in which they can take action to save costs.
'Environmental reviews are becoming an integral part of good management,' he
says. 'The environment is becoming just another part of a business manager's
legitimate day-to-day concerns.'
But there remains a fundamental problem over definitions, according to
Martin Houldin, principal consultant at KPMG Peat Marwick's national
environment unit. He says activities described as 'environmental audits' can
range from internal environmental reviews or partial examinations by
consultants, through to full independent verification of a company's
activities. The latter, he says, is rare.
This is in large part explained by the focus of legislation. Most is focused
on site-specific analysis: the impact of a particular plant or the changes
brought to a unit of land as a result of development. There is little
guidance for analysing the entirety of a company's operations.
The information which gets into the public domain is far more limited and
less reliable still. The Company Reporting survey showed that only 11 per
cent of businesses disclosed concrete information such as environmental
policies or achievements. 'The remaining 12 per cent publish statements
which are general to the point of being virtually meaningless,' it
concluded.
That echoed the conclusions of a survey of environmental reporting published
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales at the start
of this year. 'Many appear to be using environmental disclosures in the
annual report primarily as a channel for public relations,' it said.
It warned that the information was often partial - stressing 'good' and not
'bad' news - and that sometimes information from other sources even
contradicted that provided by the company.
Companies may be undertaking a wide range of activities behind closed doors.
But little is made public, and a smaller proportion is a balanced or
comprehensive attempt to describe the impact of a business' operations.
A tinier proportion still uses an independent firm to scrutinise this
information and state whether it reflects the true picture. No systematic
guidelines exist on how to undertake such reviews, or a consistent use of
words which might be included in annual reports. 'Conflicts can arise,
especially over the commercial pressures when audit findings are not what
the clients expected. There is a need for professional standards,' says
Mills.
That is why his association is introducing a system of accreditation and
peer review. At the same time, the Institute of Environmental Assessment,
which represents individual environmental consultants, is drawing up a
registration scheme for its members.
Without compulsory disclosure of environmental information, companies are
likely to receive growing criticism from outside observers. Without
independent, objective scrutiny from environmental auditors, the little
information which is provided will remain suspect.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Smaller companies do not
consider environmental issues significant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALLER companies do not consider environmental issues significant,
according to a survey published this month by the consultancy arm of
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, writes Bronwen Maddox.
In KPMG's annual survey on UK business opinion, two thirds of the 324
companies interviewed said that environmental issues were not a trading
issue last year, and 59 per cent said the environment would not be an issue
for the forthcoming year. However 44 per cent of manufacturing companies in
the survey said they had been affected by green rules, compared to 26 per
cent in services.
Martin Houldin of KPMG commented that small companies were mainly affected
by local authority rules rather than by national or EC environmental
regulation. 'The environment has been pushed down the agenda of many private
companies by other factors such as the recession and exchange rates.'
Although 12 per cent reported that sales revenue had risen, 39 per cent said
that profit margins were squeezed by interest charges and other cost
increases. However the companies surveyed ranked the environment above the
liberalisation of eastern Europe in importance for their trading.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Retail sales fall a blow to Bush: White House fears US
economy will be stagnant in run-up to election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US RETAIL sales fell far more steeply than expected by the financial markets
yesterday, reinforcing the Bush administration's fears that the economy will
be stagnant in the final stages of the presidential race.
The Commerce Department announced that retail sales had fallen 0.5 per cent
in August, the largest drop for five months.
'The economy is dead in the water,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior
economist at Merrill Lynch, the New York financial services group.
The recovery's failure to gather momentum showed that structural weaknesses,
such as the debt build-up of the 1980s, were more profound than had been
suspected, he said.
Preliminary figures for car sales in the first 10 days of September were
also disappointing. Results from General Motors and Ford indicated sales of
domestically-built vehicles were running at an annual rate of only 5.7m
units, against the already depressed level of 6m at the end of last month.
The economy had 'no real engine' for recovery, Ms Susan Phillips, a governor
of the Federal Reserve, said. Consumers were hesitant because of fears about
job security. 'Everybody has a brother-in-law or sister-in-law or knows
some-body' who has lost a job, she said.
The weakness in retail sales was concentrated in durable goods, especially
cars, building materials and furniture, which all fell by more than 1 per
cent relative to July.
The impact of last month's figures, however, was reduced by an upward
revision for July to show an increase in retail sales of 1 per cent rather
than 0.5 per cent. Overall sales for July and August were slightly ahead of
the second quarter level.
Most forecasters believe the economy is still growing sluggishly at about
the 1.4 per cent annual rate registered in the second quarter. But this is
well below earlier expectations and insufficient for President George Bush
to claim a convincing recovery ahead of the November election.
Slow growth, however, is putting downward pressure on inflation. The
consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent last month, with much of the rise
reflecting a sharp increase in volatile food prices, the Labour Department
reported yesterday.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 3.1 per cent compared
with 3.2 per cent in July.

FT  16 SEP 92 / German economics minister calls for wide-scale reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, yesterday called for a
comprehensive reform of the country's education and welfare systems, labour
laws and enterprise taxation, to restore its international competitiveness.
At the same time he appealed for more radical action, including extended
investment subsidies, to revive the east German economy and warned that
recovery in the east could take at least a decade.
In a broad-ranging paper on the ossified structure of the German economy in
the 1990s, Mr Mollemann called for legally binding budget controls to
restrain public sector spending by both central and local government.
He proposed an overhaul of the wage-bargaining system, to provide more
flexibility above all in eastern Germany, where mass unemployment is already
stoking social unrest and racial violence.
Businesses faced with bankruptcy - particularly in the east - must be
allowed temporarily to suspend wage agreements to stay in operation, he
said.
He also proposed that a new law on working time should be introduced,
allowing for more flexible working hours, more shift working to use factory
equipment more efficiently and greater flexibility in working on Sundays and
holidays. He proposed that the retirement age, now 65, should be raised and
made more flexible.
On the other hand, university courses should be shortened, because students
could currently extend their studies almost indefinitely; the norm should be
for students to start work by the age of 25, he said.
Mr Mollemann renewed his call for a series of enterprise tax reforms and for
an overall cut in the peak rate of income tax from 53 to 44 per cent.
He presented a generally gloomy view of the state of the German economy,
above all in the east.
'We face the total collapse of the social and economic system in eastern
Germany,' he said. 'It is impossible to overcome this in two or even in five
years. We will need a whole decade.'
The minister expressed scepticism about the stimulus to growth which would
flow from the German Bundesbank's latest cut in interest rates, of between
0.25 and 0.5 percentage points.
Mr Mollemann's said his strategy paper should provide a working basis for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's proposed 'solidarity pact' between employers,
unions, central and local government.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Italy plans tough crisis budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government has begun toughening the 1993 budget and preparing
measures to tackle the country's financial crisis following a wave of
criticism over the devaluation of the lira.
The moves were made against the background of renewed pressure on the lira,
nervousness on the Milan stock exchange and a slight rise in short-term
interest rates after Monday's dip in the wake of devaluation.
The government's original intention in July was to find an extra L83,000bn
(Pounds 37bn) in the 1993 budget to contain the public sector deficit, but
this has been overtaken by events.
High interest rates in defence of the lira have added to the cost of funding
the deficit, while the concerted wave of speculation against the Italian
currency has emphasised that only a tough budget will restore some
credibility in the markets.
On present trends economists estimate the government would have to find at
least L100,000bn in fresh revenues and spending cuts. But if interest rates
do not drop this may only hold the deficit down to 10.5 per cent of GDP -
almost double the EC average.
Among the measures being considered are an immediate deindexation of the
state pensions scheme and the capping of health spending. The finance
ministry is also considering a cut in the number of permitted tax breaks for
companies and a rise in corporate income tax.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, after a meeting yesterday with Mr Giuliano
Amato, the prime minister, threw his weight behind an austerity package and
said the crisis required 'the maximum understanding from politicians and
society in general.'
The president said the government should introduce two laws to show the
burden of sacrifice falls equably - a law dealing with political corruption
and one to end pay privileges of state concerns' board members who have been
removed from their jobs.
The meeting also appeared to be designed to show the president's backing for
the prime minister as rumours swept Rome yesterday that the government was
about to resign.

The market has been wondering for some time whether and when MB-Caradon will
go on the acquisition trail. But the strategic need to do so is growing more
acute, to judge by yesterday's interim results. Pre-tax profits were up 28
per cent on the first half of last year. The interest charge fell as last
year's rights issue proceeds were applied to reducing debt. Operating
profits from security printing rose 45 per cent. That masks a pretty dismal
performance in UK building materials, a market which appears to have got
worse as the half progressed.
MB-Caradon has managed its way through the recession better than some in
this sector, but there must be a limit to the degree to which efficiency
gains alone will limit the damage. It would be rash to assume that
continental markets will continue to provide offsetting growth or to rely on
much further gains from security printing. Last year's second half was
already strong in that division. Volume growth is weak and operating margins
have now topped 20 per cent. Scope for further enhancement is limited.
Happily, gearing is down to 12 per cent. How the management exploits this
strength is crucial to securing future growth. It has been reluctant to go
on a buying spree too early in the downturn, but there is also a danger of
missing the boat.
Similarly, timing is of the essence in the sale of its 25 per cent stake in
CarnaudMetalbox. The holding has more than doubled in value since the
beginning of 1991. Finding a buyer will be harder once the recovery is
complete.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard times and prudent management of cash flow distinguished Kingfisher's
interim figures yesterday. Indeed, the company earned an interest credit for
the first time since its buy-out 10 years ago. Yet there are inevitable
signs of strain at the trading level. Worst affected is B&amp;Q which has been
fighting price battles with DIY competitors Texas and Do It All. Despite
B&amp;Q's late entry to the fray, profits fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 40m.
As it attempts to persuade consumers it offers value for money, B&amp;Q is
switching to fixed low prices. This is a good long term plan, but it carries
considerable cost. The question is no longer when the recovery will arrive,
but rather how to live without it. There is overcapacity in the DIY sector,
and price cutting will take time to weed out the weaker companies. B&amp;Q will
be a winner. Meanwhile its profits risk being squeezed by bouts of heavy
discounting on the part of its competitors.
As for the rest of the group, Comet still has a poor position in its market.
Having failed to buy Dixons, the logic for Kingfisher must be to sell its
electrical retailer eventually. Woolworth is dependent on a good Christmas,
the prospect of which recedes as fast as sterling falls. Kingfisher's best
asset, its management, is struggling heroically. Sadly, the attraction of
the shares lies not in the company's trading outlook, but in the dismal
prospects elsewhere.

It has suddenly become reasonable to wonder whether the UK can make it
through to the weekend without raising base rates sharply to defend
sterling. By last night the sense of alarm in currency markets was every bit
as bad as it was on Friday, and sterling was firmly in the firing line. The
trouble is only partly that the devaluation of the lira was too timid and
the ensuing Bundesbank rate cut to small. Yesterday's weak retail sales
figures from the US do not help either. They underline the limited prospects
for a narrower trans-Atlantic interest differential which would sustain the
dollar and curb upward pressure on the D-mark.
To make matters worse, Mr Major has made a strategic blunder by cancelling
his trip to Spain. The markets were quick to conclude that his nerve is
faltering. Having just made a killing out of the lira at the expense of the
Bank of Italy, dealers must now think the Bank of England is ripe for
similar treatment. A token rise in UK rates will hardly put them off. Mr
Major would have to opt for two points at least to show earnest commitment.
But that would leave the real economy in an even bigger mess.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Shredded paper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one sense the stock market deservedly got its come-uppance yesterday from
Arjo Wiggins Appleton. UK income funds, in particular, have been guilty of
bullying companies into maintaining expensive dividends in the face of
deepening recession. The obvious threat of a collapsed share price if they
step out of line, though, counts for nothing if the victim displays little
regard for City credibility.
That is an inescapable conclusion after the wholly unexpected 20 per cent
cut in Arjo's interim payout. The Anglo-French paper maker must have known
that the reaction would be severe - Pounds 400m off its market
capitalisation is vicious by any standards - and that investors would be
puzzled by its motives. Cover on an unchanged payout for the year, after
all, would probably have been 1.5-1.7 times earnings: short of its desired
2-2.5 times target but perfectly respectable in these difficult times. The
balance sheet is far from stretched - gearing may be 30 per cent by the year
end - and the Pounds 13m cash saving on the dividend is dwarfed by
acquisitions and capital spending.
Simple miscalculation seems an unlikely explanation for a Footsie company.
The sudden assertion of continental long-termism looks equally implausible,
though few can be in any doubt now that the French are in full control. St
Louis' 39 per cent stake, however, does not provide access to the huge cash
flows of which Arjo will one day be capable, which is why a full takeover
may yet be the ultimate aim. It does not take a conspiracy theorist to
recognise that a lower share price helps in this respect.
The trouble with buying the shares at 129p is that patience may be required.
On fundamental grounds they look cheap relative to the market, there is no
obvious black hole and the overcapacity problem which lies at the root of
weak European earnings should be mostly resolved by the end of next year.
Given the market's disenchantment, though, it is hard to see a stampede of
takers.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear reaction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN GOVERNMENTS are not yet taking seriously enough the threat of an
accident at one of the 58 nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union and
eastern Europe.
The G7 summit in July failed to agree a Dollars 800m multilateral programme
to pay for the most urgent safety work. The seven passed the problem on to
the 24 OECD countries, whose nuclear experts and civil servants are in
Brussels this week trying to patch together a coherent programme from the
paltry Dollars 300m worth of bilateral aid announced so far. But the G24
meeting is not at a sufficiently senior level to take the decisive action
required.
Unfortunately, western leaders see nuclear safety as a technical issue which
they can leave to their technical experts. It deserves much higher priority
than that. Another Chernobyl-type accident would be an environmental
catastrophe and would almost certainly deal a fatal blow to the nuclear
industry worldwide.
Apart from some EC-funded emergency work at Kozloduy in Bulgaria, little has
been done yet to tackle even the most urgent safety problems. Nuclear
officials in eastern Europe are understandably exasperated that interminable
discussions with western experts have yielded such limited practical
assistance. With energy in short supply, they have no option this winter but
to continue running every available reactor, whatever its safety level. So
the Ukraine will reluctantly restart two units at the crippled Chernobyl
plant.
The immediate priority is to end the bureaucratic delays that have held up
even the very limited funds announced so far. Then western governments
should launch a new political initiative to set up a multilateral nuclear
aid programme to fill in the large gaps between the bilateral schemes. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank would
play a central role in funding it.
At the very least, the most dangerous reactors - 15 Chernobyl-type RBMKs and
the 10 oldest VVER230s - require new hardware such as back-up generators,
computerised control rooms and fire barriers.
The Russians - inheritors of a proud but flawed tradition of nuclear
engineering - are determined to keep their reactors running into the next
century, whether or not they receive western help to make them safe.
Another limited nuclear incident, such as the one last March near St
Petersburg which aroused a temporary surge of western political concern
about Soviet reactor safety, would bring the issue back to the prominence it
deserves. A sense of urgency is required if something is to be done before
there is another Chernobyl.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Pension benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE search for ways of scaling back the UK's bloated public expenditure
plans, one part of exchequer spending which appears sacrosanct is that spent
on state pensions. The Conservative election manifesto promises to increase
state pensions in line with prices. Yet as today's report by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies makes clear, the state pension is ripe for review. With
10 per cent of public expenditure going on the basic state pension, the
wisdom of forever uprating this universal flat-rate benefit is questionable.
Already the state pension is declining in importance. It now provides less
than half the income of the 65 to 74 age-group. Income from occupational
pensions and investments is rising, and personal pensions will add further
to this in the future. The indexing of the pension to prices has reduced its
relative value from 20 per cent of male average earnings in 1977 to 15 per
cent today. If it continues to be revalued in line with prices, its value is
likely to fall to just 7 per cent of average male earnings by 2050.
One response would be to increase the pension by more than the rate of
inflation to restore its value relative to earnings (as the Labour party
promised to do at the last election). The IFS report points out that it
would require substantial tax increases to fund such increases over the
coming years as the proportion of the population over retirement age rises.
More important, since not all pensioners need such increases, it would be a
poorly targeted transfer of resources. The state pension remains important
for many, especially older, pensioners who retired with little else by way
of income. But for a growing minority of the wealthier pensioners, the state
pension is a small and relatively insignificant part of their income.
The alternative is to put any increase in the pensions bill entirely into
benefits targeted on poorer pensioners. The government has already moved in
this direction in the last Autumn Statement with increases above the rate of
inflation in means-tested income support for pensioners. While there are
problems in the take-up of means-tested benefits, more imaginative use could
be made of Inland Revenue and social security records to encourage those
needing such help to apply for it.
Such a strategy would be within the spirit of the manifesto commitment,
provided the overall pensions bill was increased in line with inflation. And
it would begin a process of directing benefits to those who need them most
in a way that would later permit a more fundamental review of pensions in
the light of changes in the UK economy and society.

FT  16 SEP 92 / No way out from tough decisions: John Major's cancellation
of a trip to Spain highlights the public spending dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The way in which Mr John Major's trip to Spain was cancelled at the last
minute smacked of carelessness. An admission from Downing Street that the
prime minister was needed in London to get to grips with the public spending
round could hardly have been calculated to calm London's financial markets.
The threat of a sterling crisis may have been uppermost in Mr Major's mind.
But he may also have judged that it was impossible to disguise any longer a
looming cabinet battle over how the government is to meet its spending
targets for the next few years. With the recession threatening another big
increase in the government's social security budget, ministers are digging
in against cuts in other sensitive Whitehall budgets.
Mr Major may have calculated that it was better to demonstrate now that he
was intent on giving a political lead on public spending rather than
allowing resentment among his colleagues to develop into a public row.
But direct involvement by the prime minister will not solve his government's
dilemma over spending. How, during a deep recession, can it square its
election promise to deliver improved public services with the need to
reassure financial markets that public spending and borrowing are not
spiralling out of control?
The latest projections on the outlook for public borrowing have alarmed
Whitehall. Officials believe the recession's impact on the government's
balance sheet - pushing up spending and cutting tax revenues - means the
Treasury is already set to overshoot its Pounds 28bn borrowing target for
1992-93. More worryingly, the outlook for the 1993-94 financial year, which
begins next April, points to a borrowing requirement of closer to Pounds
40bn.
Even these gloomy projections assume that the government manages to stick to
its pledge of holding departmental spending to Pounds 244.5bn in 1993-94 and
to Pounds 258bn in 1994-95.
Barely two months ago Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was claiming a
significant coup when he persuaded the cabinet to confirm these targets
publicly - and to set up a new ministerial committee to ensure that the pain
of meeting them was shared fairly between the main spending departments.
But it has become clear that the mechanism does not give ministers an easy
escape route from hard political decisions. When the committee - chaired by
Mr Lamont and including cabinet heavyweights such as Mr Michael Heseltine
and Mr Kenneth Clarke - meets for the first time tomorrow it will be handed
a gloomy assessment of the Treasury's initial skirmishes with spending
ministers.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, has held a series of bilateral
meetings with cabinet colleagues to persuade them to whittle down the
estimated Pounds 14bn of extra money they had bid for next year. Mr Portillo
has managed to knock a 'significant sum' off the threatened overshoot. But
with some ministers unwilling to move on their individual bids, the
projected total remains well above the Pounds 244.5bn figure they
collectively endorsed in July.
In theory the target is not draconian. In real terms the figures pencilled
in for total spending should allow for an increase in each of the next two
years of 3.5 per cent. And with inflation likely to be lower than the
forecasts on which that calculation was made last autumn, the growth rate
could be higher.
But the global calculation obscures the ravages wrought by the recession on
the Pounds 70.5bn social security budget. Most of the overall increase in
public spending will be absorbed by higher benefits payments to the
unemployed. Other departments - education, transport, environment and the
Home Office among them - face an effective freeze or worse on their budgets
to pay the additional benefits bill.
The present plans already allow for an increase in social security payments
to Pounds 76bn next year. But it is acknowledged that the figure is based on
an optimistic estimate of unemployment. The Treasury's calculations assume a
jobless total of 2.4m. It is more likely to be 3m or above. That alone will
lead to an automatic increase in spending of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds
3bn.
The other main pressure point is the council tax - the planned replacement
for the community charge. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is
arguing that, if the average bill when the tax is introduced is to come
anywhere near the Pounds 400 per household suggested by the government, then
the Treasury will have to hand over an additional Pounds 2bn in extra grant
for local authorities and in temporary relief for those worst hit by the
transition.
Mr Portillo has tried to scale down Mr Howard's bid, but there is
recognition that the cabinet cannot permit a repeat of the increases in
household bills which ensured that the community charge's introduction was a
fiasco.
The implication is that the Pounds 4bn or so available for allocation this
autumn from the Treasury's contingency reserve has been more than spent.
When other unavoidable spending increases are added - the knock-on effect,
for example, of higher-than-expected pay increases this year for health
workers and teachers - the conclusion is that other ministers must abandon
their bids for extra cash and accept cuts in their existing programmes.
The Treasury has already targeted the Pounds 7bn roads programme, the
Department of Environment's Pounds 7bn housing budget, the urban aid
programme, the Home Office's prison-building plans, and the relatively
generous settlement won last year by the health department. It wants also
deep cuts in the Pounds 24bn defence budget.
But cabinet ministers threatened by the squeeze are beginning to challenge
the economic logic of financing increases in social security spending with
cuts in the government's capital programmes. They are sensitive to the calls
from the Conservatives' allies in the business community and from the
government's backbench supporters for more rather than less to be spent on
roads, schools and hospitals.
Some ministers are muttering that if the Treasury's target is to be met, the
cabinet will have to confront the politically explosive issue of whether to
stick with an open-ended commitment to higher state pensions, child benefit
and income support payments. No Conservative government since 1979 has been
prepared to grasp that nettle. But it may be that Mr Major has no other
choice.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The limits of force in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S UN decision to authorise the dispatch to Bosnia of an additional
6,000 troops is a fitting, if belated, response to the prospect of a
humanitarian calamity in the former Yugoslav republic this winter. Given the
fullest commitment of food, medicine and other aid to the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, the reinforcements should permit a quickening of
the Bosnian relief effort in coming weeks.
But it is important that the governments whose troops are now to be placed
in the firing line recognise both the risks that such an operation entails,
and the limits on what it can achieve. In particular, those responsible
should be explaining their objectives much more clearly to their own
electorates and to those caught up in the conflict. Without such clarity,
there is a real danger that the western military forces protecting aid
convoys could be sucked into a Lebanese-style quagmire, incurring heavy
casualties and facing a choice between still heavier intervention and a
humiliating retreat.
What, precisely, is the international community trying to do in Bosnia? That
there is confusion is scarcely surprising given the complexity of the
conflict, the seriousness of the mistakes committed by western governments
over the past year, and the profound reluctance with which they have now
become more directly involved.
But the question needs answering. Is the UN moving, as is being claimed in
some quarters, from peace-keeping where there is no peace to keep, towards
peace-making? If so, it is certain to fail. The level of forces now being
committed will not suffice to raise the sieges around Bosnian towns or
provide safety for the 2m refugees uprooted by Serb forces.
Still less does this week's move bring the UN any closer to an ability to
force the parties to stop fighting. A protectorate in Bosnia would require
tens of thousands more troops, a commitment which neither western public
opinion nor the hard-pressed UN is prepared to contemplate. The 15,000 UN
troops in eastern Croatia are themselves over-stretched in keeping a peace
to which the parties to the conflict have grudgingly agreed. In Bosnia, no
such will to stop the fighting is yet discernible. Any extension of the UN's
mandate permitting foreign troops to do more than defend themselves if
attacked would rob them of the perceived impartiality which they need to
carry out their job, and expose them to greater danger. It might also
jeopardise the continuing Geneva peace talks.
Under such circumstances, the UN should go out of its way to draw a
distinction between its military protection of humanitarian aid efforts on
the one hand, and its efforts to restrain the fighting (for example, by
placing all heavy weapons under UN control) on the other. Both activities -
one under the UNHCR, the other overseen by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the
EC and UN mediators - will need more manpower and resources. They will also
have to be accompanied by an intensification of sanctions pressure on
Serbia, and by the dispatch of more observers to Bosnia's borders to stem
the flow of weapons from Croatia and Serbia.
Even determined action on all these fronts scarcely offers a prospect of
rapid progress. The governments now preparing to dispatch troops had better
be ready for a long haul, and concentrate in the short term on doing what
they can to save lives.

FT  16 SEP 92 / EFA - that queasy feeling: The wrangles over the Pounds 20bn
Eurofighter are symptomatic of a rough phase in defence collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene opens in a hardened aircraft shelter, somewhere in Europe,
sometime after the year 2000. Computer-generated images of an aerial combat
mission, by an anonymous air force fighting an unidentified enemy, zoom
across a semi-circular screen. The stomach lurches.
The flight simulation is a promotion for the European Fighter Aircraft, a
Pounds 20bn project now caught in a limbo between reality and fiction.
Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain have been working in earnest on the
project for seven years. Two prototypes are nearly ready. More than Pounds
5bn has been spent. But it is now more uncertain than ever what form the
aircraft will take, whose air force, if anybody's, will fly it - and when.
Germany no longer wants the aircraft it helped design. The other partners
want costs cut. The Italians are already thinking they may be forced to buy
something else. Spanish support hangs by a thread.
EFA should have made its maiden flight six months ago. It would have been
the belle of the ball at the Farnborough air displays which closed on
Sunday. In the event, it was the wallflower.
Outside the projection room where hundreds queued to see the flight
simulation stood a forlorn mock-up of the aircraft. Instead, visitors
watched live displays by the latest MiGs and Sukhois - the fighters that EFA
was designed to take on. They also saw smaller European rivals of EFA's
generation, Sweden's Gripen and France's Rafale, both resembling EFA with
their delta shapes and small forward 'canard' wings.
The manufacturers say technical hitches linked to some of EFA's
computer-driven systems have been mostly overcome. But the politics of
reunified Germany have given the whole project such a buffeting in the last
few months that plans to have aircraft in service in 1998 already appear
unrealistic.
A first flight is still scheduled this year. But the first prototype is
German, and it is uncertain whether Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence
minister, will want the flight to take place.
Germany has said it will stay in the Pounds 8bn development programme but
not proceed with production of the current EFA design. British officials
have ceased to entertain hopes that Bonn might accept a modified version of
EFA as it exists, with a lower price tag and the option of a special-edition
German model.
Mr Ruhe, a prospective future candidate for chancellor, has overruled his
air force, EFA supporters within the government and the German defence
industry. His rejection of EFA, as too expensive and geared too closely to
the needs of the cold war, was a clear political calculation.
In most of Germany, the fighter - known there as the Jager 90 - had become
irredeemably unpopular. Any chance of making Germans identify with the
project was undermined by a perception that the British bullied their way
into industrial leadership of all the main elements of the programme,
including the radar and electronic warfare systems. Some were already
calling it 'the British aircraft'.
The unwelcome surprise that Mr Ruhe sprang in June was his proposal, not
just that Germany withdraw, but that Europe should go back to the drawing
board and make something different - cheaper, lighter and later.
While discussions continue between the partners, they seem to be talking at
cross-purposes. Two sets of studies are due to be completed by late October.
The first is by defence chiefs, who have been told to re-evaluate their
operational requirements. The second is by the two main industrial consortia
involved the project - Eurofighter and the engine grouping, Eurojet - and is
intended to identify cost savings.
Britain, in its confidential long-term defence plans, is understood to have
budgeted for a price of about Pounds 30m an aircraft at 1991 prices,
excluding development and support costs. Eurofighter hopes to cut costs
through a redistribution of work and more use of off-the-shelf components.
The consortium plans a 'buffet approach' - offering a range of options from
which partners can choose.
The fate of EFA may be decided at a defence ministers' meeting in November.
But there is already talk of trying to delay final decisions until the
German elections of 1994.
For all of Britain's partners, the project poses budget problems. Germany is
able to put off buying any new aircraft, relying for the interim on an
ageing, but updated, fleet of F-4 Phantom fighters. Italy, on the other
hand, urgently needs to replace its single-engined F-104 Starfighters.
'They take their life into their hands every time they fly,' says one UK
expert.
Rome has been considered Britain's staunchest EFA ally. But it recently
asked McDonnell Douglas of the US for data on the F/A-18, a possible
short-term substitute. Spain already uses this aircraft and has the least
pressing military need for a new fighter. Its reasons for joining EFA were
political and industrial. The more trouble the project encounters, however,
the less compelling those reasons become. German officials say Italy and
Spain are now interested in a cheaper collaborative venture.
Where does that leave Britain? 'Technically,' says Mr John Weston, British
Aerospace's defence chief, 'there is nothing in the programme that we could
not do in the UK if we had to.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary,
came close last week to saying Britain might be prepared to go it alone. But
it is doubtful he would get his way in the cabinet if there were no other
partners.
The RAF's requirement - originally set at 250 - is unlikely to be enough to
make a competitively priced aircraft. Back in the late 1980s, the nominal
viability threshold for the project was 800 aircraft, although purchase
plans by the four partner nations never quite reached that level.
Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, the defence group which reckons it has as much
at stake on the project as BAe, sees it becoming 'a titanic struggle in
Whitehall'.
Bonn's proposals for a Jager Leicht - or EFA Lite - have muddied the waters.
EFA itself was meant to be as light and cheap as possible for the
performance, with an airframe 70 per cent made of reinforced carbon fibre.
How much lighter should it be? Mr Erich Riedl, parliamentary undersecretary
at the German economics ministry, whose job it is to oversee the country's
aerospace industry, dismisses the concept of a still lighter EFA as
'laughable'.
But the idea - jocularly dubbed the Volksjager - is tempting to a country
such as Spain, which might be willing to divert remaining development funds
into a smaller, less capable aircraft. The Swedish government has expressed
interest in participating, saying the aircraft would have a lot in common
with its single-engined Gripen.
Eurofighter's own review includes a study of whether EFA could have one
engine instead of two and still meet its required performance. Mr John
Vincent, the consortium's managing director, said at Farnborough that it was
making the study so 'we cannot be accused of ignoring' the suggestion.
Managers at Rolls-Royce, the UK engine partner, splutter at the very idea of
a one-engine model.
Mr Weston at BAe believes the review will point to an aircraft 'very
similar' to the current EFA. The aircraft will be required to last 30 years,
and Britain is reluctant to jettison any of EFA's capabilities.
All the alternative aircraft, apart from one, fall 'significantly short' of
the performance needed to beat new Russian-made fighters, says Mr Weston.
The exception is the F-22 air-superiority fighter being developed in the US
by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. But it is expected to be less
versatile than the EFA and to come on the market at twice its price.
The Gulf war brought home the overriding importance of air superiority in
any conflict, Mr Weston argues. 'A poor second best in this area could mean
that all investment in other military arms and systems may have been of
little value.'
But the worry haunting EFA's proponents is that the US will come in with a
'loss-leader' - a multi-role fighter such as the F/A-18 or F-15, with an
attractive price tag and industrial offsets thrown into the bargain. Mr
Weston argues that offsets would never compensate for the work lost on EFA.
BAe expects the project to engage 16,000 aerospace workers in the UK at the
height of the programme. Some estimates put the figure as high as 40,000.
Britain's engineering base would suffer if the project is scrapped, Mr
Weston says, and export opportunities would be lost.
The bitterness and recriminations over EFA are symptomatic of recent
European defence collaborations. Germany may well follow its EFA move by
withdrawing from the Tiger attack helicopter project, which it is developing
jointly with France. That in turn could scuttle the anti-tank weapon the
helicopter is designed to carry, a project in which Britain is involved.
However, in many fields of defence, there is no alternative to collaboration
if European manufacturers are to remain in the business. National budgets
are shrinking; equipment is needed in smaller numbers; and development costs
continue to rise. Secretive US projects in sectors such as combat aircraft
are seen as leaving little room for outside partners except as
sub-contractors or, eventually, as licensees. The Harrier - a British
aircraft reworked by Americans - is an exception to the rule.
The strangest thing about the wrangle is that the French - direct rivals -
are not pleased with the prospect of EFA's demise. Officials and
industrialists believe France's own long-term survival in the military
aircraft business depends on having strong partners in Europe. After its
experience with the Rafale project - which has also faced a reappraisal -
France has no intention of going it alone again.
Mr Serge Dassault, its chairman, says he would be 'most unhappy' if the EFA
project fell apart. This is the same company that once fought with BAe over
design leadership in a five-nation EFA project. When that quarrel came to a
head in 1985, the French attempted to lure other EFA partners away from the
project to join the breakaway Rafale programme, without success. If even the
French are now worried by the consequences of EFA collapsing, then matters
must be serious.

FT  16 SEP 92 / House contents raise Pounds 660,000: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S yesterday realised Pounds 660,330 from the first morning session
of a two-day sale of furniture and effects from Groombridge Place in Kent,
which was sold in May.
Under the hammer are oak furniture, walnut cabinets, and early textiles from
the house, used as the setting for Peter Greenaway's film The Draughtsman's
Contract. Also for auction is Oriental porcelain and silver amassed during
Groombridge's refurbishment by the Mountain family early this century
Among items on offer yesterday was a fine group of 17th-century Packer
family portraits, now said to be on the shopping list of a distant
descendant, Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian entrepreneur.
The most appealing of the portraits - of the four daughters of Philip
Packer, a founder member of The Royal Society and Groombridge's builder  -
by a follower of John Michael Wright realised Pounds 13,200.
There was predominantly private bidding and prices frequently made the top
estimate. A private buyer paid Pounds 33,000 for a pair of oyster-veneered
walnut side tables with cabriole legs, dated around 1745.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Securities Institute is shaped by the Big Bang / Examining a
professional body as it prepares to carve out an independent role for itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERY soon the Securities Institute will emerge from the shadow of the London
Stock Exchange and carve out an independent existence. The new initials MSI
 -Member of the Securities Institute - are beginning to appear on notepaper
and business cards.
The institute's founding chairman, Mr Graham Ross Russell, a former deputy
chairman of the Stock Exchange, says: 'We are trying to create a
professional institute for the securities industry in the broadest sense.'
The physical separation is scheduled to take place at the end of next month,
when the institute will set up its own City of London premises next to the
Monument, including a members' room, a reading room and seminar facilities.
The institute is to launch a recruitment drive to attract applications from
a broader constituency, outside the Stock Exchange membership from which it
has drawn most its initial support.
The founding of the Securities Institute on March 2 was a delayed
consequence of the stock market's Big Bang in 1986. One reform led to
another and eventually the Stock Exchange was reconstituted on the basis of
corporate rather than individual membership.
That change, which took final effect on April 1 this year, created a gap.
Who would look after the professional training of individuals and be
responsible for upholding personal standards of behaviour? The Stock
Exchange was no longer a club or an educational body but a highly
competitive, technology-based international business.
Mr Peter Rawlins, the Stock Exchange's chief executive, unsentimentally shed
several parts of the old imperial organisation, dispatching the traded
options market over to the financial futures exchange, Liffe, and the
private shareholder support team to the new independent body ProShare.
It became logical, too, to send off to a new organisation the 20-odd members
of the section - headed by Mr Tim Nicholson - that had looked after the
individual membership. Some of these had already moved over to the regulator
of Stock Exchange firms, the Securities and Futures Authority.
To get the new institute off the ground the 5,000-odd former Stock Exchange
members were offered a favourable 'window'. They could sign up within 12
months on the basis of a Pounds 100 first year's subscription. They would be
admitted subject only to a check that they were in good standing with the
SFA and other regulators.
Other securities practitioners face more formalities. For full membership
they must show they have up to 15 years' relevant experience, or have passed
Stock Exchange examinations or have gained other professional
qualifications. They will, in addition, be vetted for good character. Lower
grades of associate and student membership have also been created.
Besides stockbrokers, practitioners of investment management, corporate
finance and securities settlement are all seen as potential candidates.
'We are now focusing much more on the wider membership,' says Mr Nicholson,
now chief executive of the institute. 'That is going to be one of our big
tasks during the autumn.'
Mr Nicholson hopes to have boosted the total roll to about 5,500 by next
March, of which about 2,000 would be recruited from outside the Stock
Exchange. He thinks there is the potential to reach a membership of 10,000
over the next five years. The current roll is 4,200.
Membership of the institute confers little except status at present.
The institute does not have a defined position in the regulatory structure,
although certain other professional institutes are accepted by the
Securities and Investments Board as so-called recognised professional bodies
and can authorise their members to conduct investment business.
RPB status, says Mr Nicholson, is far off. 'We may not be on that road, and
it would tie us down at this stage,' he says.
The prime focus at present is on developing the examination and training
programme, which will include not only the basic exams taken over from the
Stock Exchange but also a spectrum of activities ranging from back office
training modules to refresher courses for top securities executives.
There is considerable emphasis on professional integrity. Members are
required to follow a code of conduct and will be expected to follow the
spirit as well as the letter of rules set by various regulatory authorities.
A disciplinary panel will investigate allegations of misconduct.
Regional branches are planned and may acquire a local emphasis. For example,
the Edinburgh branch will probably be dominated by fund managers rather than
stockbrokers.
The membership of the main board, too, is being broadened. Initially
composed of ex-Stock Exchange figures it has taken on an investment manager.
Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive of M&amp;G, joined in July. This month three
others are being elected: Mr David Burton, ex-chairman of the financial
futures exchange Liffe, Mr John Spencer, deputy chief executive of Barclays
de Zoete Wedd and Mr Richard Broadbent, a corporate finance executive at
Schroders. The whole board will stand down next spring ahead of the
institute's first elections.
Against the background of various City scandals the institute can be seen as
an attempt to build a respectable future for the securities industry.
'We aim to help people to be truly professional,' says Mr Ross Russell.
'Then clients will want to be sure they are dealing with a member of the
institute.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / Companies are accused of ignoring hackers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH business is shutting its eyes to the risks of unauthorised
interference with its computer systems which may be costing it up to Pounds
2bn a year, a report commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry
warned yesterday.
It said there was widespread ignorance of the Computer Misuse Act, passed
two years ago to crack down on the growing problem of computer 'hacking',
and a reluctance to use the law to pursue computer criminals.
Computer security experts said the report would raise awareness of security
issues that companies were too willing to sweep under the carpet. Mr Alan
Stanley of the European Security Forum, whose members include many of
Europe's largest companies, said companies were still unwilling to admit
that the security of their computer systems had been compromised. It was
therefore impossible to compile a database showing the full extent or cost
of computer misuse.
Hacking involves gaining unauthorised access to computer systems, either out
of curiosity or to perpetrate fraud. Other computer crimes include
programming 'viruses' or 'timebombs' - software which subverts or damages
computer systems.
The report recommends measures to highlight the risks and costs involved in
computer misuse and suggests that the Home Office should consider
establishing a national computer crime unit. It also proposes the
establishment of a directory of established computer security experts.
The report was welcomed by Mr Edward Leigh, the trade and technology
minister, who said the DTI had arranged seminars in London, Manchester,
Bristol and Birmingham later in the year to consult business about the
implications.
The DTI study, carried out by the management consultancy Coopers &amp; Lybrand
in association with the law firm Cameron Markby Hewitt, set out to test
whether the effectiveness of the act was being prejudiced by a lack of
information about computer misuse and a lack of expert advice.
It concludes there is no shortage of computer misuse experts, but their
skills are under-employed because businesses find it hard to identify
'reliable' suppliers of authoritative advice and, in any case, prefer to
deal with computer crime within the company rather than going to law.
The act defined three new offences: unauthorised access to computer programs
and data, or hacking; unauthorised access with further criminal intent, and
changing the contents of computer programs or data.

FT  16 SEP 92 / EC aid to unions is put at Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is funding British trade unions to the tune of about
Pounds 7m a year, senior union officials believe.
No precise figures are available for total EC funding of unions, but an
estimate by Mr Glyn Ford, MEP for Greater Manchester East and leader of the
European parliament's Labour group, puts it at about 50m Ecus (Pounds 35m),
of which British unions are winning a growing share.
Some EC money is earmarked for projects, such as the UK unions' share of the
14m Ecus set aside for a meeting of unions to discuss the setting up of
European-wide works coun-cils in multinational organisations.
The EC also supports various trade union organisations such as the European
Trade Union Institute and the union-run Health and Safety Centre in
Brussels, which directly and indirectly support union work.
Unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress spent Pounds 420m in 1990,
received Pounds 364m in subscription income and made up most of the
shortfall from investment income. Resources from the EC thus form a small
part of union income but are becoming increasingly important, especially in
trans-European work.
British unions led by the GMB general union are set for a new push to
establish European works councils in a number of UK multinationals such as
Pilkington, the glass group.
The European TUC calculates that there are 21 European works councils
recognised by employers, such as those at Volkswagen, the carmaker, and
Bull, the computer group. As many again are not recognised.
None of the 21 is in UK-based multinationals - in spite of the fact that 35
per cent of all companies operating in two or more EC countries are UK
companies - and the bigger UK unions are now planning to change that.
The unions do not envisage cross-border bargaining on pay - they see works
councils, which focus on consultation and information, as the first step
towards European bargaining on non-pay issues. Ms Bernadette Tesch, head of
FIET, the commercial and clerical workers' union industry committee, said at
last week's TUC congress that issues such as training, equality and health
and safety, could be the subject of such bargaining.
Mr Emilio Gabaglio, general secretary of the European TUC, also told last
week's TUC that the social dimension in the EC must operate through a
combination of legislation and collective bargaining.
Mr Gabaglio said: 'Cross-border bargaining is a major objective for the
future.'
The Co-operative Bank is to set up a European-style works council in spite
of opposition from Bifu, the banking union, according to the latest issue of
Personnel Today.
The bank said the works council would not be a negotiating body and that
Bifu would continue to be recognised for collective bargaining.

FT  16 SEP 92 / De-regulation leads to Sharp increase in level of rents in
England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE-REGULATION of the private rented housing sector has led to a sharp
increase in the level of rents in England, according to a government survey
published yesterday, John Willman writes.
An Environment Department survey on private renting shows that the average
rent for all tenancies in 1990 was Pounds 43 a week, compared with Pounds 30
a week in 1988. This 43 per cent increase followed the deregulation of rents
on new tenancies in 1988.
Of the 1.6m private tenancies in 1990, 483,000 had been created following
the 1988 Act. Rent levels for these new tenancies were much higher than the
average for all tenancies - Pounds 66 a week on average for assured
shorthold tenancies.
According to the survey the age and occupational profile of private tenants
is changing. The proportion of tenants under 30 rose from 29 per cent to 35
per cent between 1988 and 1990, while those aged 60 and over fell from 33
per cent to 28 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Company reports on 'green' action urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should be required to publish details of their environmental
policies and their performance in meeting 'green' objectives, a group of
accountants and industrialists said yesterday.
A report published by the environment research group of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says the Stock Exchange and the
Financial Reporting Council should consider formally encouraging companies
to provide environmental information.
It says any environmental factors affecting a company's policy and
activities, or having a financial impact, should be regularly accounted for.
The report does not reflect the official policy of the institute but Mr Ian
Plaistowe, its president, says in a foreword he will ask that its governing
council consider the proposals and make recommendations.
The research group includes the corporate chief economist at Imperial
Chemical Industries, the government's assistant auditor-general, and several
business and academic accountants.
The report says that as part of the annual reporting cycle a company should
publish details such as the nature and amount of expenditure on
environmental objectives, and the name of the director responsible for
environmental activities.
It says the Accounting Standards Board should consider a financial reporting
standard on environmental issues, and the Auditing Practices Board should
discuss producing guidelines on environmental audits.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Producer prices almost static
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORE INFLATION, as mea-sured by the producer prices index, continued its
down-ward path in the year to August as difficult domestic and overseas
conditions deterred UK manufacturers from raising prices.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that the prices
of manufactured goods leaving factories scarcely moved last month, rising
just 0.1 per cent from the previous month.
That gave a year-on-year increase of 3.3 per cent, the lowest annual rate of
increase for more than 24 years. It compared with a rise of 3.4 per cent in
the year to July.
The annual rate of producer price inflation has been falling more or less
continuously since April last year, when it was 6.2 per cent.
Stripping out volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, the output prices
index rose 2.6 per cent in the year to August, the same as the annual rate
in May, which was the lowest since 1969. That compares with a high of 6.4
per cent in February last year.
The data suggest many manufacturers are continuing to cut prices to maintain
sales in a fragile climate of weak demand while benefiting from lower raw
material and wage costs.
The prices of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry fell 2.2
per cent last month, reflecting weak demand for many types of commodities.
The CSO said prices paid for food manufacturing raw materials had fallen
particularly sharply.
The month-on-month drop compared with a fall of 0.2 per cent in July. It
brought the annual rate of decline for input prices to 1.9 per cent.
Seasonally adjusted, the prices of raw materials fell 1.9 per cent from the
previous month, the sharpest monthly fall since 1968.
The official figures underlined the favourable outlook for inflation in the
UK. The Treasury said lower producer inflation would feed through to further
reductions in retail price inflation.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Aim of state pension for all is questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE survival of state pensions for all is questioned in a report published
yesterday.
The study, the first of a series of reports on older people in Britain, says
it is no longer the case that all pensioners are poor and a 'state transfer
to all pensioners no longer represents a well-targeted benefit'.
Private pensions form the greater part of the income of most pensioners. The
report says a case can therefore be made for spending most of the state's
resources on the poorer minority.
The report, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a social policy think tank,
is part of a wide-ranging examination of issues affecting older people
co-ordinated by the Carnegie Inquiry into the third age.
The third age is defined as between 50 and 74.
The inclusion of people as young as their early 50s has the statistical
effect in the institute's study of showing that a high proportion of the
youngest third-agers are also the poorest. These are mainly unemployed
people in their 50s and early 60s who do not receive higher levels of
benefit paid to pensioners.
Overall, however, the study finds that income distribution in the third-age
group is 'at least as unequal as that in the population as a whole'.
The report argues that the basic state pension has fallen in importance
because it is indexed to price inflation, while earnings and other sources
of income have risen considerably faster.
It estimates that if state pensions were indexed to earnings the cost would
rise to Pounds 79.7bn a year by the year 2050 - 3 1/2 times the present
cost.
A second report in the third-age series - a study of employment issues by
the Public Finance Foundation, an independent research body - says
demographic changes offer older people who want to continue working better
prospects in the 1990s than in the 1980s, but not to the extent that is
often assumed.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Papers on BCCI 'priced at Pounds 200,000'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTANT expected a solicitor to pay Pounds 200,000 for documents
uncovered during the investigation into the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
Mr Tim Langdale QC, prosecuting, said Mr Bernard Lynch had acted as
'go-between' in a plot with Mr Mark Braley, an accountant who was part of
the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into BCCI.
He said Mr Lynch tried to sell files to Mr Michael Barratt, a solicitor for
Mr Syed Ziauddin Ali Akbar, a former BCCI official who is awaiting the
outcome of extradition proceedings in France.
The jury heard that Mr Braley told detectives after his arrest that -
according to Mr Lynch - Mr Barratt had brought Pounds 200,000 from France.
If Mr Braley was prepared to take 'certain risks' and supply inside
material, most of the money would go to him.
Mr Lynch, who was not involved in the SFO inquiry, had asked Mr Braley to
keep a file of 'juicy' documents.
The jury has already heard that Mr Barratt exposed the plan to police and
was equipped with secret recording equipment to trap Mr Lynch and Mr Braley.
Mr Lynch, of Forest Hill, south London, and Mr Braley, of Hayes, west
London, deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice.
The jury has heard that both admit conspiring corruptly to obtain a
consideration from Mr Barratt between the same dates, and that Mr Braley
alone admits the theft of four share certificates from HM Customs.
Mr Langdale said Mr Braley told detectives he had 'foolishly' given Mr Lynch
a copy of a sensitive document which was later leaked to The Times. He had
become suspicious of Mr Lynch's motives and had not realised until his
arrest what was going on.
Mr Barratt said Lynch claimed to be friendly with police officers in the SFO
who were willing to supply information. 'He made it clear his contacts were
prepared to sell information to me,' said Mr Barratt. 'I had taken advice
about this from a solicitor friend and I told him I was interested.' In
fact, Mr Langdale said, Mr Braley had been Mr Lynch's sole contact in the
SFO.
Mr Neil Bennett, banking correspondent of The Times, said Mr Lynch handed to
him in a pub a document setting out the state of the investigation into an
investment firm associated with BCCI. 'I was stunned with what I saw,' Mr
Bennett told the jury.
The case continues.

FT  16 SEP 92 / L&amp;G plans rolling venture funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; General Ventures, the venture capital arm of the life assurance
group, is to set up an innovative system of rolling one-year venture funds.
L&amp;G Ventures plans to raise two parallel Pounds 50m venture funds each year
 -half from its parent company and half from outside investors. Any funds
not invested by the end of any year will be returned to investors and a new
fund will be raised.
The aim is to allow investors to decide each year whether to commit funds to
venture capital, said Mr Charles Peal, managing director of L&amp;G Ventures,
which has Pounds 200m under management. At present institutions put money
into venture capital funds which may take up to five years to invest the
money, by which time economic conditions and their own investment plans may
have changed.
L&amp;G Ventures plans to set up two funds each year - one conventional equity
fund and an unquoted equity underwriting pool. The pool will underwrite
deals arranged by the equity fund but, if investors do not want to take up
their allotment, it will offer stakes in the deal to other outside
investors.
The two funds will be raised between September and December each year. L&amp;G
Ventures also plans to reduce the fees it charges investors to 1 per cent
from the usual 2 to 2 1/2 per cent in the first year. It will also take a
share of only 10 per cent cent in any profits above the return on the FT
All-Share Index instead of the normal 20 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: A fair cop - in moral shades of grey - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the brain deadening preponderance of television drama series about
crime in the past 10 or 20 years - series about English lawyers, Scottish
lawyers, American lawyers, private eyes, male uniformed police, female
uniformed police, male criminals, female criminals, English detectives,
French detectives, Dutch detectives, American detectives, police in cars,
police in boats, police on motorbikes, even as a last resort police on foot
 -it seemed unlikely that we would welcome yet another police series. But
quality will out, and if you come up with good ideas, good writing, good
direction and good acting the milieu hardly matters. Between The Lines is
yet another series about the Met, and very good it is.
When Tony Garnett last produced a series which dared to question the
integrity of the British legal system (Law And Order in 1978) there was
pandemonium: the BBC was banned from prisons for a year, the police demanded
written undertakings before they would offer any more co-operation, and
right-wingers roared about destruction of the fabric of British society. How
things change. Today, with what we know about Stalker and the Guildford
Four, the Midlands Crime Squad and the Birmingham Six, Garnett looks more
like a prophet than a rebel.
The most impressive aspect of Between The Lines is that, although it
inevitably shows British police forces as harbouring freemasons and racists,
thieves and boot boys ('inevitably' because it is about an internal
investigation unit) none of this is seen in black and white. Not only are we
shown police arguing convincingly that breaking the rules may sometimes be
the only way of defeating the crooks, but the central character, our hero,
Tony Clark, is a married man and a womaniser and therefore an habitual liar.
Indeed this is precisely why he has the job. Few television police series
have the strength and intelligence to work consistently within realistic
moral shades of grey as this one does, and even fewer then manage the vivid
drama which is being achieved here. Those not watching yet can start on
Friday with a typically ambivalent episode about a woman constable
complaining of sexual harassment - by a black sergeant.
C4's Terry And Julian looks like the nearest that television has ever come
(whoops, sorry about the rude verb) to its own Carry On series. It appears
to have been created as a vehicle for Julian Clary whose wrists are so limp
they could serve as hammocks for gerbils. His last series, a soppy gameshow,
was undisciplined and quickly became boring, but this one is scripted - 'I
want to see the back of you'/'You won't be the first'. It should amuse those
with a taste for English seaside innuendo of the unsubtle Max Miller
variety.
There are still people, including media correspondents from national
newspapers who should know better, claiming that television is experiencing
a 'slide' and even a 'slump' in viewing. What are they talking about? The
most recent BARB figures are for the last week in August. They show average
weekly viewing per person as 24 hours 43 minutes. That is seven hours up on
the same week in 1983, six hours up on 1984, one hour up on 1985, two hours
up on 1987, '88 and '89, three hours up on 1990 and one hour up on 1991. The
only year in the past decade to record a higher figure than this year was
1986 when the last week in August was an anomaly: for some reason it is
credited with 26 hours 27 minutes which is four hours more than any other
week that summer. Some slump.
People interpret figures any way that suits them. After hearing a top
Channel 4 executive gleefully deriding the supposedly 'disastrous' ratings
for the BBC soap opera Eldorado it was interesting to discover that those
same BARB figures record audiences of 6.9m and 6.7m for Eldorado's two
episodes that week, a million more than any programme shown on C4. But to be
fair, what was C4's top-rated programme? Some worthy effort for black
viewers or feminists which could hardly expect a big audience? Not at all,
such programmes do not even struggle into the bottom of C4's Top 30; for all
we are allowed to know those series, which C4 makes such a song and dance
about, may be getting no measurable audience at all.
The top three slots on C4 are filled by the soap opera Brookside which
manages about 5.5m viewers, and the rest of their Top 10 comprises three
American comedies, two gameshows and two American movies. So much for being
different and serving specialist tastes. In the same week BBC2's Top 10
included British programmes on travel, sport, natural history, gardening and
cookery and Alan Bennett's splendid drama A Woman Of No Importance. That
week BBC2 attracted 10.1 per cent of total viewing to C4's 10.3 per cent. It
might be as well to keep this in mind next time C4 is held up as a shining
example of what can be achieved out there in the market place. No one in the
industry believes that C4 will be able to avoid competing even more fiercely
for audiences, becoming even more populist, once it has to start selling its
own airtime in competition with ITV next year. But the mind boggles at what
could be more populist than its present Top 10.
British programme makers have often expressed pride in a system of public
service broadcasting which permits 'the right to fail', a pre-requisite if
genuinely new ideas are to be tried. The question is, should viewers be
subjected to these failures? Last week's 75-minute drama on C4, Gummed
Labels, was, like so much 'experimental' material, a triumph of style over
content. There were venetian blinds and bright blue back-lighting, lots of
supposedly clever lines ('I'll tell you nothing]' 'I already know nothing,
nothing and I are close friends') bass sax on the soundtrack and, at the
centre, where there should have been a plot or at least some thought, only a
vacuum. As a student showreel indicating mastery of technique this could be
useful. As public entertainment it was deeply irritating.
Worse still was a BBC1 natural history programme called The Velvet Claw
which, astoundingly, we were told was the first of a seven part series
concerning ancient animals. The nastiest sort of modern animation was
accompanied by a an embarrassingly pretentious script, favouring phrases
such as 'in a very real sense'. The producers have made the famous old
mistake of hiring a plummy voiced actor to read the words with the result
that the voice-over sounds like Donald Wolfit showing off in a Victorian
melodrama. After proving over so many years the superiority of having
non-actors such as David Attenborough read their own scripts in
conversational tones, what on earth does the BBC's Natural History Unit
think it is up to producing stuff such as this? And having produced it, why
didn't anyone spot it before the poor old viewers were subjected to it?
A preview in a London cinema of Ridley Scott's 2 1/2 -hour Columbus movie
1492 on Sunday morning showed it to be visually striking, powerfully
atmospheric, strong on the minutiae of the 15th century, weak on character,
and quite often boring. BBC1's 95-minute 'Screen One' drama Disaster At
Valdez on Sunday night, another piece of dramatised history, showed how
superior television can be these days to even such 'prestige' cinema
projects. No doubt some of those involved in the notorious Alaskan oil spill
will pick nits out of this television account of how the clean-up became a
fiasco, but history will decide whether, as it seems, it is a broadly
accurate account. It is certainly a compelling piece of television.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: It Runs in the Family - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray Cooney outdoes even Lord (Jeffrey) Archer in his versatility. Not only
has he bought the Playhouse Theatre from the former Tory MP and writer who
found it did not make money. Cooney has opened it with his own play, directs
it and acts in it as well. Indeed, his acting is so good that it helps to
explain why he writes such splendid farces.
It Runs in the Family may not be quite the best of them, but you would have
to be in the most churlish mood not to enjoy it. The piece ought to have
opened at Christmas, for it starts with 'Jingle Bells' and has the doctors
and nurses of St Andrew's Hospital, London rehearsing for the annual
pantomime. Snow is seen falling through the famous Cooney windows which, as
so often, are set centre stage and bound to play a prominent part in the
action.
Yet never mind that it is still only September. The coach parties have
already begun to arrive in force and although this may not be a play to
arouse gales of laughter, it is strong on the steady chuckle.
The pantomime turns out to be only a sideshow. The real business is the
annual Ponsonby lecture to be delivered by the neurologist, Dr David
Mortimore (John Quayle) before the junior health minister and neurologists
from all over the world. The trick, as the hospital governor explains, is
not to plead abject poverty, because that would fail to impress the foreign
visitors, but to persuade the minister that the place needs more money.
In practice we never get that far. There are interruptions all along the
line, beginning with the arrival of Nurse Tate (Sandra Dickinson), an old
flame of 18 years ago, who reveals that she has Mortimore's son, a
distinctly punk youth demanding to meet his father for the first time.
From then on it is the customary fun and games. Mortimore has a wife from
whom the facts must be concealed. One of Cooney's techniques is to allow one
lie to lead to another until there is multiple confusion and nobody knows
who is who. He does this time and again, and the pace seldom flags.
The characters are stock: an old man in a wheel chair (perfectly played by
Henry McGee) who develops an astonishing new lease of life and has fun with
a soda syphon; Matron (Jacqueline Clarke), hard on the surface but soft
underneath, and an old fashioned police sergeant in Windsor Davis. There is
even a part for the veteran Doris Hare.
The windows come in when it looks as if the punk youth (William Harry) is
about to fall from the outside ledge. Matron and doctors hang on to him. A
slight criticism is that, seen from the stalls, there is not much sense of
vertigo.
The main pleasure of the evening comes from Cooney himself. He plays Dr
Bonney, not a high flyer and certainly not the sort of man to be invited to
give the Ponsonby lecture. Watch how he knows his deficiencies, the way he
wears his jacket, the expressions on his face even when he is not in the
forefront of the action. This is the performance of a man who knows that
farce is a very high art. Cooney enjoys every minute. By Christmas, the
production should be even better.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: The 'Other' Spoleto - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early 1950's, when Gian Carlo Menotti was seeking a home for his arts
festival, he visited a number of small towns in Tuscany and Umbria: it had
to be isolated, but within reasonable distance of Rome or Florence; it had
to be beautiful, with an attractive theatre. He had almost settled on Todi,
but then a friend took him to the historic, little-visited Umbrian city of
Spoleto and Menotti's Festival of Two Worlds had a home.
An important factor in his decision was the presence there of two working
theatres: the charming Teatro Caio Melisso, and the larger, 19th century
Teatro Nuovo, in perfect working order. Menotti soon learned that his would
not be the only festival in the city; he had been preceded by the Teatro
Lirico Sperimentale, an organisation created by an opera-loving Spoletino
lawyer, Adriano Belli. It was largely through Belli's efforts that the Nuovo
was in such good repair, and his Sperimentale had already attracted the
attention of key professionals in the Italian operatic world.
Founded to afford an opportunity for debutant artists to perform in a
professional situation, the Sperimentale supported its youngsters with
veteran conductors and producers from the Rome Opera, complemented by the
Rome orchestra and chorus. Sets and costumes also came from the Rome house.
In the cast of the inaugural performance of Don Pasquale were the tenor
Cesare Valletti and the baritone Rolando Panerai, neither of whom had yet
appeared on the operatic stage. The Sperimentale could hardly have had a
happier launching.
Chosen by a severe competition, Spoleto singers continued to maintain a
surprisingly high level: in 1950 came Gian Giacomo Guelfi and Antonietta
Stella. Then came the discoveries of Anna Moffo, Franco Corelli, Anita
Cerquetti, Gabriella Tucci, Renato Bruson.
But after several decades of glory, the Sperimentale fell on hard times.
With the death of Belli, the direction faltered and the accord with the Rome
Opera lapsed. In the past few years, under the artistic direction of the
Roman critic Michelangelo Zurletti, the organisation has been assaying new
directions, with mixed, but still encouraging results. Last year, an
experimental Norma was unmitigated disaster, so this year's opening - Wiener
Blut in Italian - hardly prompted an immediate trip to Spoleto. But then
when the second offering, Un ballo is maschera, was announced, the idea of
hearing a great opera with young artists made the journey seem worthwhile.
And though the cast was extremely uneven, the performance was, on the whole,
enjoyable; and there was the satisfaction of hearing three young voices - in
the three female parts - of distinct promise.
The casting also suggests the current state of Italy's vocal resources.
Among the six winners of the 1992 competition there was no tenor. Even last
year, when two tenors were selected, for the Pollione the organisation
called on Mario Leonardi, a winner from a few years back. He returned this
year as Riccardo, and has not improved. His performance seems to indicate
that voice training in Italy is in big trouble. The natural instrument has
volume and range, a clear ring, but Leonardi has little notion of
expression, the sound is produced as if at random, pinched one moment,
blaring the next. Yet, despite these glaring defects, since his first
Spoleto appearance he has sung in a number of provincial houses, including
the excellent Teatro Verdi in Trieste.
The baritone, Demetrio Colaci (Renato) is also a winner from an earlier
competition (in 1988) and has sung in Palermo's Teatro Massimo and in
concert. Tall and imposing, he has a large and agreeable voice, but also
lacks expression and has serious trouble with pitch. One is tempted to think
also that the reason for the decline in quality among the Spoleto winners is
that nowadays a truly gifted young male singer is not likely to encounter
much difficulty in finding a theatre that will hasten to sign him up.
Perhaps it is harder for sopranos and mezzos; certainly, the three
debutantes in Spoleto made a much stronger case for themselves than the two
males. The part of Ulrica does not give its interpreters much room. Daniela
Ciliberti, young and handsome, made an immediate visual impression; nerves,
however, diminished her vocal power at first. But soon she relaxed and
revealed that, in addition to interpretative insight and musical taste, she
possesses an instrument that, without being huge, carries well. The Amelia -
Claudia Pallini - also began somewhat shyly, but by the end of her aria she
too had gained confidence, and improved steading from then on. Next month
she will be a finalist in the Pavarotti competition in Philadelphia.
Lucia Scilipoti, though she looked the youngest member of the cast, made her
professional debut in 1990 and has also participated in various contests
with some success. She was a sweet, true Oscar, singing honestly and
effectively.
Borrowed from the Cagliari opera, the production was mostly acceptable,
though there were some deleterious mimes here and there and some idiotic
scenery. At the last minute the scheduled conductor was replaced by the
chorus master Carlo Palleschi, who did an excellent job. Perhaps because of
his presence the chorus - an Umbrian group called Umu-Sintesi - sang out
splendidly. The Budapest Chamber Orchestra was better than serviceable. The
Teatro Nuovo drew as big a crowd as any of Menotti's gala events does, and
it was a good deal more attentive.

There is a large amount of drama tonight, most of it clashing as usual. The
2-hour Inspector Morse on Channel 4 (8.30) shown previously on ITV, is, once
again, set in Oxford, this time in the university. Morse is called in when
an environmentalist is murdered just before he is due to give a lecture. The
fashionable subject of child abuse is well to the fore.
The even more trendy subject of transvestism is at the heart of BBC2's
'ScreenPlay', A Little Bit Of Lippy (9.00). When Marian finds women's
knickers in husband Rick's laundry she goes back to mum, only to discover
that there is no other woman but that Rick likes wearing the underwear
himself. Obsession (10.40 ITV) is a 1976 Hitchcock-type movie about a man
who meets the double of his dead wife. But a lot of people will be watching
BBC1's Inside Story (10.00) about today's white slave trade. Thousands of
women from poor countries are lured into the stripping and prostitution
business. Using hidden cameras it follows the trade from the Caribbean to
sex syndicates in Europe run by a 'Dutch based' gang who work the women for
as much as 15 hours a day.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK premier urged to pursue growth
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN employers yesterday urged Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, to look beyond Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty
and use Britain's EC presidency to pursue policies for longer-term economic
growth in Europe.
Representatives of Unice, the confederation of employers' organisations,
asked Mr Major to give priority to completion of the EC single market and to
seek agreement in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Although the meeting was billed as an opportunity to press for action to
stimulate recovery across Europe, Unice did not discuss turmoil in the
currency markets or request concerted moves to cut European interest rates.
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
a member of Unice, said employers agreed with the British presidency's
agenda for economic and political progress There was no case for a
devaluation of sterling as British companies were not uncompetitive at
current exchange rates.
The business leaders, headed by Mr Carlos Ferrer, the organisations's
president, restated their backing for progress towards monetary union, which
they said offered the best guarantee for medium-term financial stability.
Action, they added, should be pursued irrespective of the Maastricht
treaty's fate.
Mr Major was pressed to help improve Community procedures across a range of
activities affecting competitiveness. He was also asked to improve
consultation between business and EC decision-makers, including the wider
use of consultative 'green papers' and improved methods of assessing the
impact of legislation on small and medium-sized companies.
Mr Major said completion of the single market remained a priority.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Defence issue fails to heat the
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I DON'T know why they did not say more about defence,' said a puzzled
French naval officer after a two-hour rally in Vincennes, east of Paris, on
Monday night. Speakers including ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and
other pro-Maastricht UDF leaders mentioned not a word about the treaty's
provisions for common European defence.
Defence has, indeed, been the dog that did not bark in the referendum
campaign. Last year France fought successfully, chiefly against the
Atlanticist UK and Dutch governments, to include language in the treaty
which could presage the eventual replacement of Nato by the Western European
Union (WEU), as the military arm of the European Community. Yet, come the
referendum, this diplomatic success seems to have neither added to the Yes
camp nor detracted from the No forces.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, tried to kick the issue into life
with a speech to France's defence college, lauding the Maastricht treaty as
'an additional guarantee for lasting peace'.
His defence minister, Mr Pierre Joxe, followed up with a Le Figaro article
in which he warned that a No to Maastricht 'would clearly halt the dynamic'
towards closer European military collaboration.
But the word security in the French referendum campaign has tended to become
diffused in more immediate concerns such as police security against the
spread of the Mafia in a frontierless Europe. Where it has taken on a more
concrete military meaning, it has become identified with the Community's
failure to send sufficient forces to pull warring former Yugoslavs apart.
The theme of Maastricht as keeper of the peace is easily satirised. 'Is it
really likely that Germany will take back Alsace and Lorraine, Britain
reoccupy the Guyenne, Italy the region of Nice or even Luxembourg
Thionville?,' wrote ex-General Pierre Gallois, once one of France's leading
nuclear theoreticians and a staunch Maastricht opponent, in Le Figaro last
week.
But the debate has been a sideshow. Few seem to care much one way or another
about Maastricht's defence provisions.
A rejection of Maastricht would prompt two possible conclusions. Either, the
French electorate is not as anti-American in security matters as many of its
leaders have assumed. Or, these very leaders will have made an historic
mistake, comparable to France's rejection in 1954 of the European Defence
Community.

ranks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S divided political opposition yesterday prepared to close ranks in
readiness for a widely expected election battle against the ruling
Socialists some time after Sunday's vote on European political and monetary
union.
Mr Philippe Seguin, leader of the anti-Maastricht majority in the Gaullist
RPR party, yesterday tendered a rare olive branch to Mr Jacques Chirac,
party president, who has put himself out on a limb in the RPR by supporting
the treaty.
Mr Chirac was the best equipped to tackle the opposition's splits over
Europe and had his support as RPR candidate for future French president,
said Mr Seguin.
Mr Chirac yesterday issued his own appeal for party unity. 'No new majority
can be formed from a cartel of the Noes,' he said. 'The UDF-RPR union will
tomorrow be the only political force able to bring together the French. Let
us be careful to do nothing which might destabilise this force.'
Mr Philippe de Villiers, an anti-Maastricht rebel in the centre-right UDF,
the Gaullists' allies, added that he would return to the party rank and file
after the vote.
Mr Seguin's outburst of loyalty to Mr Chirac contrasts with his previous two
attempts to oust the RPR leader and suggests that opposition rebels have
begun to take seriously the possibility that President Francois Mitterrand
might spring a snap general or even presidential election.
According to Le Monde newspaper, the French president is debating with
officials his possible retirement next January, five years into his current
term and the opening date for the single European market, in the event of a
Yes vote. This is only the latest twist in weeks of speculation on Mr
Mitterrand's future, heightened a few days ago by his entry to hospital for
prostate surgery.
Senior UDF and RPR officials have agreed to meet after the Sunday vote to
prepare the ground for the joint election of a presidential candidate and
for a general election campaign.
Mr Mitterrand's popularity, at 29 per cent according to a poll by Ipsos a
week ago, is well below that of Mr Michel Rocard, the former prime minister
adopted by the Socialist party as its 'natural' future presidential
candidate. Mr Rocard is well placed to beat any presidential candidate
fielded by the right.
However, polls suggest that the Socialist party's popularity is low enough
for an RPR-UDF alliance to win a general election, even enfeebled by the
splits opened up in the opposition by the Maastricht debate.
Yet both opposition parties know they need to smooth over their divisions as
best they can, given the growing share of protest votes attracted by
alternative groups such as the two ecology parties and the National Front,
which won a combined 28 per cent in the March regional elections.
Neither the UDF nor the RPR have plans for reconciling their internal
differences on Europe, despite their leaders' repeated attempts to settle
the European problem. Mr Seguin yesterday made light of the internal splits,
arguing that they had strengthened the RPR by giving the image of 'a modern
political movement with freedom to discuss and vote'.
Some RPR members maintain that Mr Chirac need not have split his party over
Europe, since he does not have strong personal views on Maastricht.
However, Mr Chirac may have calculated that he would have no chance of
becoming joint RPR-UDF presidential candidate on an anti-Maastricht ticket,
in competition against former French president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
the deeply pro-European leader of the UDF. While the UDF rank and file is
nearly as divided on Maastricht as the RPR, the centre-right's leadership is
united in favour of the Maastricht treaty.

'Some say that the Maastricht treaty favours German power. I think the exact
opposite. From the point of view of monetary policy, a No to Maastricht
would leave all room for manoeuvre to Germany and its central bank. Without
Maastricht, Germany will command much more power in Europe,' Mr Cavaco Silva

A French rejection of Maastricht would be 'dramatic for the whole of Europe

A YES in France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty would generate
goodwill among the EC countries for finding a solution to the problem caused
by Denmark's rejection of the treaty in a referendum in June, writes Hilary
Barnes in Copenhagen.
This view was expressed by Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, after a
cabinet meeting yesterday.
However he also suggested that a sizeable No vote would be equally helpful
to Denmark, hinting that it would soften up the attitude of other
governments towards reaching an agreement with Denmark.
'One thing is certain: the treaty will not come in to effect on January 1,
1993,' he said. This was not only because of the Danish problem, but because
the EC's budget measures must be agreed upon before the treaty could be
implemented.

MRS Gillian Shephard, the UK employment secretary, has invited Mr Norman
Willis, president of the European Trades Union Congress (Etuc), and Mr
Carlos Ferrer, president of Unice, the European employers' body, to the
European Community Social Affairs Council meeting at Chepstow in October.
Mr Willis, who is also general secretary of the British TUC, is seldom
invited to meet ministers as head of the TUC, and will certainly attend the
informal meeting. Mrs Shephard is expected to lead a discussion on
employment and unemployment.
Mr Willis, as Etuc president, was also last night meeting Mr John Major, the
UK prime minister and president of the EC Council of Ministers, to call for
an emergency meeting of EC finance and employment ministers to plan how to
combat unemployment within the EC.
At the only formal Social Affairs Council meeting during the British
presidency, in December, a final agreement is expected on the controversial
working time directive. The directive was watered down earlier this year to
meet objections from the UK government but was then blocked by a technical
dispute between the French and Germans.
TUC officials believe that the French manufactured the dispute to avoid
agreeing the watered-down directive prior to the French referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty, which would have provided more ammunition to
anti-Maastricht views on the left.
In December the French are expected to agree the directive.
Mr Emilio Gabaglio, Etuc general secretary, yesterday called for a Yes vote
in France, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'We believe in what Maastricht is trying to achieve and we call on workers
all over Europe to support it,' he told a news conference.
The treaty was flawed, but better than nothing as a basis for securing a
better working life, he said. A No vote would be dangerous encouragement for
the extreme nationalist movements which are on the rise in Europe, and would
send the wrong message to east European countries wanting to join the
Community.
He said he was disappointed that Britain had so far called only one meeting
of social affairs ministers during its six-month term. He called this part
of a strategy in London to hamper adoption of EC-wide social legislation.
Britain has opted out of provisions on social legislation in Maastricht but
Mr Gabaglio said he still hoped Britain would act impartially in its
chairing of EC meetings.

The primary issue at stake in next Sunday's French referendum is the life or
death of the Maastricht Treaty on European union; but a vote against the
treaty would also have explosive effects on the French political scene, and
could even determine the political survival of President Francois
Mitterrand.
If the French vote against Maastricht, the treaty will undoubtedly be dead.
But the implications of a No vote for Mr Mitterrand are less easy to
predict.
It is commonly assumed that Mr Mitterrand's personal unpopularity has been
responsible for the swing in opinion polls against the treaty. The
government's fear is that the Mitterrand factor could become a decisive
consideration in the polling booths on Sunday, so that many who might have
voted Yes to Europe may instead decide to vote No to Mitterrand.
Hindsight suggests that it was reckless of Mr Mitterrand to have chosen to
put the treaty to a popular referendum. After all, the normal route for
ratifying a treaty, as provided in the French constitution, is a law
submitted to parliament. A popular referendum is a perfectly legitimate
alternative, but it is not inevitable.
Moreover, when Mr Mitterrand announced in June that he would call a
referendum, his deep unpopularity, as registered in the opinion polls, had
been virtually constant since he appointed Mrs Edith Cresson as prime
minister in the spring of last year, and his own standing had remained
deeply depressed even after he replaced her with the more popular Mr Pierre
Beregovoy. He must have been aware of the danger that he could drag down the
treaty.
Yet it has been clear for over a year that Mr Mitterrand intended to hold a
referendum this autumn, precisely as a way of restoring his battered
personal authority. He needed to stake out a political battleground on which
he could take on, and with luck defeat, his political adversaries; and such
a battleground could only be an issue of high political principle.
Last November he indicated that he would put forward a reform of the
constitution, including some form of shortening of the presidential mandate
(currently seven years renewable).
That project now appears to have been shelved, or at least postponed, as a
result of the decision to hold a Maastricht referendum. But in tactical
political terms, the only thing which has changed is the question being
submitted to the voters. In both cases, he evidently thought, not without
reason, that a referendum would embarrass the opposition parties, but could
nevertheless be counted on to produce a Yes vote.
Most mainline political leaders in France have long argued for some
shortening of the presidential term; and most mainline political leaders
have now come out in favour of the treaty, even though it has exposed
passionate divisions within the Gaullist party.
But if Mr Mitterrand thought he could restore his authority by picking a
high political issue for a test of strength with his adversaries, his
calculations seem now to be in double jeopardy.
A French No vote would obviously represent a rejection of Mr Mitterrand's
vision of a quasi-federal Europe, to which he is deeply committed; but it
would also look like a disavowal of the president himself. With a large No
vote, the disavowal would be profound, and must place him under considerable
pressure to resign.
But would he? By temperament (health permitting) Mr Mitterrand is a fighter,
a lawyer and a European; and each of these characteristics will tell him to
stay.
He is a legalist, who frequently and pointedly reminds audiences that he was
elected for seven years, and by implication intends to stay to the end of
his term by which time he will be 77. His commitment to European integration
is the most constant element in a very long political career.
He might therefore decide that duty required him to remain at his post, so
as to rescue the irrational mess created by a No vote; that the powers of
the French presidency and the remaining two years of his mandate still gave
him enough space to do so; and that resignation would be a major betrayal of
France and of Europe, because it could create the opportunity for the
election of the Gaullist leader Mr Jacques Chirac, who has no firm
convictions on Europe, and half of whose party is deeply hostile to the
Community model.
But Mr Mitterrand might draw the opposite conclusion. After a large No vote,
he might no longer have the credibility, either at home or abroad, to engage
in any operation to put together a substitute for the ruined Maastricht
Treaty; the general election next March is likely to produce a conservative
government with a Gaullist prime minister and an overwhelming majority; and
in any case a post-Maastricht recovery could take much longer than the two
years remaining to him.
According to this logic, his only remaining strategy is a Parthian retreat:
he may be able to serve the European cause better by leaving than by
staying. If he were to resign suddenly, the Socialist party would quickly be
able to endorse a strong single candidate: most probably the former prime
minister Mr Michel Rocard, or perhaps Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission
president. But the conservatives would be caught divided, and would probably
go into the campaign with several rival candidates, including Mr Chirac and
former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
In the resulting melee, the Socialist candidate might well win, and would
certainly call early general elections. And unlikely as it may seem today, a
convincing presidential victory by a socialist president could well have the
effect of transforming the outcome in the general elections.
The most recent analysis of voting intentions leaves Mr Mitterrand with a
deep dilemma. On the one hand, it indicates that his personal unpopularity
is only a marginal factor in the recent anti-Maastricht swing in the opinion
polls; on the other, it would seem to indicate a serious indictment of his
performance, if a majority of voters should turn against a European treaty
in which he passionately believes.
The central finding of the analysis, by Mr Jerome Jaffre of the Sofres
polling institute, is that virtually all (93 per cent) of those who are in
favour of the treaty will vote Yes, whether they are socialist or
conservative, while virtually all those who are against the treaty will vote
No, again regardless of their political affiliation.
If Maastricht is threatened by a Mitterrand factor, it only comes from the
20 per cent who do not believe the treaty will make any difference: in this
camp, 66 per cent of conservative voters will vote No; only 65 per cent of
socialist supporters will vote Yes; but socialist supporters will vote No if
they have lost confidence in Mr Mitterrand.
In the circumstances, the president has only one good option: to pray for a
Yes vote.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors seeks greater EC democracy -
European parliament address
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE survival of the European Community depends on its becoming more
democratic, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said
yesterday. His speech to the European parliament emphasised a much greater
role for national parliaments in monitoring EC decisions.
'Either Europe will become more and more democratic. . . or Europe will be
no more,' he stated flatly, adding that this was 'the major lesson' of the
battle to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, which can survive only if French
voters endorse it by referendum on Sunday.
Addressing a ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the parliament, Mr
Delors nevertheless addressed himself to the workings of EC democracy in a
way which confidently assumed the treaty will survive. He said that 'the
benign despotism' of EC institutions was over - a period in which the
Commission in complicity with the 12 member states took decisions against a
background of popular indifference, with a let-out clause for governments to
blame Brussels if policies misfired.
After an exposition of the ways in which Maastricht will strengthen the
European parliament's control over both Brussels and the member states
legislating through the Council of Ministers, he repeatedly stressed the
need for national parliaments to hold EC lawmakers to account.
'We must join together these two expressions of popular sovereignty in a
rational way, which is simple, accessible and reinforces the legitimacy of
our institutions,' he said.
Mr Delors' remarks, anticipated privately by Commission officials, presage
attempts at EC level to draw national parliaments more closely into EC
decision-making. The purpose is to develop 'subsidiarity' - the idea that
decisions should be taken at the lowest practicable level.
Assuming France does not follow the example of Danish voters in June, and
approves Maastricht, the emphasis on national parliaments is also aimed at
bringing Denmark back on board.
'We must exploit the legitimacy of national parliaments through ways and
means which depend on each country,' a Commission official said. 'The idea
that the European parliament is the only source of democratic legitimacy in
the Community is dead, and for a long time.'
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, minister of state at the British Foreign Office who
represented the UK presidency of the EC at the ceremony, also took up the
theme of national parliaments' role, embedded in a thorough defence of
Maastricht. 'One of the benefits of the Maastricht Treaty is that it does
enjoin national parliaments and this parliament to find ways of working
together,' he said.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Jobs: The only useful way to be outstanding - Whatever
employers say about seeking 'character', the best bet is to keep to the safe
profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF any secret service chiefs around the world are looking for
English-speaking agents, they might care to contact headhunter John McManus.
He says a lot of the people he interviews these days strike him as being
ideal for such work. The reason is that once they've gone out of the door,
he can no longer remember what they look like.
Who is to blame for same is of course a moot point. After all, even
recruitment consultants are not proof against the ravages of age, including
amnesia.
For his part, 57-year-old Mr McManus insists that, as far as he can recall,
his memory is as good as ever. A more probable explanation for the increased
forgettability of candidates, he thinks, is that the herd-instinct has been
strengthened by the recession. With so many people chasing so few openings,
they are averse to the risk of seeming to stand out as unusual, preferring
the shelter of the safe profile.
'It's paradoxical, because the more unexceptionably qualified candidates
there are around, the more vital it is to be exceptional,' he adds. 'But
daft though it be, that's what I see as happening.'
Alas, if his explanation is right, he and his fellow executive-recruiters
can expect to see candidates become still more forgettable over the next
year or two - at least in Britain. That much seems clear from the response
to my appeal eight weeks ago for hard evidence about so-called 'de-layering'
by employers, which is reputedly abolishing managerial jobs wholesale and
probably for ever.
While most of the replies were anecdotal, and even they reported little such
activity in continental Europe, the British Institute of Management produced
figures. They came from a survey it had just made in conjunction with
Manpower UK of the heads of 163 big employers in Britain.
It turned out that, since 1985, about two thirds of them had cut their
managerial staff by at least one whole layer. Moreover, two in every five
planned to do the same again by 1996. By contrast, a mere 3 per cent were
expecting to employ more managers in any way whatsoever.
Hence it would appear that the chances of getting taken on for a management
job will increasingly depend on bucking the herd-instinct and presenting
oneself as exceptional. Unfortunately, however, that is something which is
far easier to theorise about than it is to put into practice successfully.
Indeed, there are good reasons to believe that the percentage game rests
with the safe profile. For a start, there are many ways of being unusual,
and the odds are against hitting on the right choice for any given occasion.
The problem is not only that recruiters' prejudices are such that an
outstanding trait which appeals to one is apt to repel a second. There's a
still greater chance of just failing to sway them either one way or the
other. For instance, John McManus says the most memorable candidates he has
seen in the past year were three who turned up in bow ties. None of them got
the job.
Even stronger support for the safe profile lies in research published four
years ago by the Institute of Manpower Studies. It indicated that most
recruiters in Britain, and especially the majority with no training in
interviewing, approach the task defensively. Instead of setting out to
choose the right candidate, they are primarily concerned to avoid picking
the wrong one. Save for such eccentricities as being related to the company
chairman, unusual traits are liable to provoke rejection.
All of which points to a drab dilemma for ambitious managers. The percentage
game is to match each likely opening with an un-exceptionable application,
then support it when so invited with a characterless performance at
interview, and wait for the law of averages to deliver. The snag is that, in
an age of de-layering, the candidates may well be dead before their turn
comes round. Yet what can they safely do to accelerate their acceptance?
Happily, there is a way of being exceptional that is not only safe, but
productive. Or so we're told, at least, by theologian-cum-psychologist Max
Eggert, who surrounds his one-day-week as a part-time priest with work as an
outplacement consultant. He has just produced a book* on being interviewed,
which besides being among the shortest of the many on the topic the Jobs
column has read these past two decades, seems the most pertinent.
His thesis is that the only useful way of standing out from the similarly
qualified herd is to be that remarkable rarity, the thoroughly adept
interviewee.
True, such expertise will be swiftly twigged by the equally rare expert
interviewers. But far from being antagonised by it, he says, they'll tend to
respond warmly to the unusual chance to show their own mettle.
Meanwhile, on encountering the much commoner defensive amateurs, a skilful
interviewee can achieve the same effect by 'helping them' through their
struggles, not least by feeding their anxious hunger for proofs of a
safeness nobody - particularly not their superiors - could doubt.
Simply because that is usually the recruiter's main criterion, * The perfect
interview. Century Business, Pounds 5.99.
however, usefully exceptional candidates make sure to appear quite the
opposite of outstanding in other ways. For example, recalling headhunter
McManus's eye for points of dress, here is the book's advice on how to
identify what to wear:
'It is easy to get information on corporate style. First, visit the firm
about lunchtime a few days before the interview and notice what people are
wearing in terms of style, colour and accessories.
'The other source of infor-mation is the company's Annual Report which these
days features an obligatory picture of members of the board.'
A further safeguard against emitting unsafe signals is to remember that
crucial meetings tend to provoke a state of 'high arousal' which can
unsteady your physical movements.
So if you as a candidate are offered a coffee, however much you want one,
say no. The odds are that your shaking hands will at best slurp it into the
saucer. (As that warning doesn't apply only to interviews of job-seeking
kind, I wish I'd heard it long ago. Many a time, when vainly trying to still
my cup-clattering mitt, I've seen the eminence opposite clearly drawing the
obvious conclusion from the bibulous image of my trade.)
Moreover, just as sins you don't have can be a danger, so can blessings
which you do. One of the most dangerous is a talent for detecting and
pointing out irrationalities in things other people say. 'Never argue with
job interviewers, no matter how charmingly,' the book advises.
The sole exception comes at the last stage of the process, pay-haggling, and
even then it is best to stick to a tested format. One Max Eggert recommends
is the procedure by which Brooklyn opticians sell spectacles. It goes:
The lenses in these glasses are very reasonable - a mere Dollars 40 . . .
Each . . .
That includes the standard frame, but this particular one costs Dollars 120
. . .
If you want it in gold, that's another Dollars 50, although real rolled gold
is Dollars 150 . . .
We can deliver in four weeks instead of the normal six months, at a small
service charge of Dollars 50.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Management: Passing the hat round - The Cadbury committee
wants to see new faces among the non-executive directors of British
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Adrian Cadbury, the courtly chairman of a panel studying corporate
governance in the UK, caused a storm when he casually suggested that the
days of multiple non-executive directorships were coming to an end.
Howls of protest emerged and Sir Adrian quickly explained that what he meant
to say was that while holding several non-executive directorships could be a
good thing, holding too many might make it difficult to do the job properly.
His remarks underscored a fact of life that those seeking to improve the
performance of corporate boards have known for some time: the pool from
which non-executives are selected is too small. Indeed, the expanded demand
for non-executives means that a small number of individuals are being forced
to wear too many hats.
Increasingly, a handful of corporate insiders are called upon to do a job
which really calls for an outsider. 'If you confine the pool to those who
are on the boards of other corporate plcs, they will have the same mind-set
as those who are there already,' Sir Adrian said.
The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, chaired by
Sir Adrian, has urged a much greater role for non-executives.
The problem is not that suitable candidates do not exist, but that companies
have too narrow a notion of the kind of person who would fit the role.
Pro-Ned, the Bank of England-backed organisation that promotes
non-executives, has a list of about 750 individuals who it says have all the
characteristics to be good non-execs but who are rarely asked. Bruce Rhodes
of Pro-Ned says that roughly 100 approaches are made each year to Pro-Ned
from companies looking for a qualified non-executive but that only a handful
are actually selected from its list.
The list is compiled from those who have sent in their CVs to Pro-Ned. For
every five applicants, Pro-Ned is only able to add one individual to its
list. Rhodes said that the organisation sees little point in maintaining
individuals on its list who are unlikely to fit the requirements of any
company.
'It is natural for members of a team to look for others who will fit in
easily,' Sir Adrian said, delicately explaining why companies were so
reluctant to broaden their horizons. Most boards, according to Pro-Ned, are
unwilling to accept anyone who has never previously served on a UK corporate
board.
Thus, an incestuous group of directors move from one company to another
wearing, at various times, executive and non-executive hats.
Rhodes notes that such practices mean that women are under-represented on
boards.
Meanwhile, Pro-Ned says that the way in which vacant non-executive posts are
filled usually ensures that the pool will remain narrow. Typically, a board
chairman will ask other board members for recommendations.
Fewer than 20 per cent of all non-executive directorships are filled with
the aid of an independent search party and, frequently, the outside adviser
is none other than the company's investment bank.
Of Pro-Ned's list, roughly 5 per cent are academics and another 5 per cent
are from the public or voluntary sector. Among its small number of
successful placements of academics was that last year of Nancy Lane, a
microbiologist at Oxford University who is now a non-executive director at
medical supply company Smith &amp; Nephew.
Rhodes points out that an individual who has had experience running, say, a
large university, voluntary aid organisation or NHS hospital may have, in
practice, been running a company larger than many UK plcs.
Also on the list are divisional heads of some of Britain's largest companies
such as British Petroleum and ICI that have a policy of encouraging such
individuals to take on non-executive directorships.
But many on the list, with apparently suitable qualifications, are never
even approached. Chris Higgins, chairman of Bradford University Research -
the university's commercial research arm - has been on Pro-Ned's list for
five years and has never been interviewed.
A Cambridge University physics graduate and an expert in electronic systems,
he was a non-executive director of food retailer Amos Hinton before it was
acquired by Argyll. He had also been the director of Bradford University
Business School.
Higgins said his name was put forward several times by Pro-Ned to companies
seeking a non-executive but he has never been interviewed. 'When I was
accepted on the list, Pro-Ned gave me a list of five categories that
companies hate most. Military men, academics, management consultants,
bankers and retired people.' With his CV falling squarely into two of those
categories, Higgins figures his chances are slim.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Management: Why you should take asthma seriously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you suspect you have asthma? If you experience shortness of breath or
persistent coughing or wheezing, the first thing is to seek medical advice
on begining diagnostic tests. If your doctor has eliminated other potential
reasons for the symptoms - for example heart and vascular causes, lung
disease or bronchial obstruction - and has said you have asthma, the
diagnosis should be taken seriously.
The condition, which is caused by mucus build-up, bronchospasm and
inflammation, is potentially life-threatening.
You need not forego an active lifestyle just because of asthma, as many
top-flight athletes with asthmatic conditions have demonstrated.
With care, you should be able to enjoy normal sleep and normal activity.
If your asthma is related to exercise, Professor Bryant Stamford, writing in
the journal, The Physician and Sportsmedecine, offers some sound advice:
exercise in warm humidified air (such as swimming pools); breathe through
your nose; control breathing to avoid hyperventilation; and follow daily and
pre-exercise prescriptions as laid down by your doctor.
Find out what exactly is triggering your attacks. While respiratory
infections are among the most common causes of asthma attacks, allergens may
include: ambient smoke and dust, mold, cold dry air, perfumes, certain food
ingredients, enzymes in household cleaners, environmental pollution and
pollen.
Working closely with your doctor, controlling the necessary environmental
conditions and learning as much as possible about your condition will enable
you and your family to expect a full and active life.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Management: Sugarloaf for lunch on the road to Rio -
Christina Lamb continues our series on business entertaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The city of Rio de Janeiro may be well down the road to decay but the art of
lunching is alive and kicking. Deals are rarely made over the meal - what is
traded is information, a vital commodity in a country of such instability.
Consequently the main item on the verbal menu is fofoca - the latest gossip
from Brasilia. Will the government announce another economic shock plan?
What are the latest ways to make money from inflation? Currently most in
demand over lunch are outrageous stories on the extent of corruption in high
places.
But amid all the rumours and uncertainties, business people in Rio do not
lose sight of the pleasure of good food and, as a tourist resort, former
capital and one-time centre of the Portuguese Empire, Rio has plenty to
offer.
Many of the restaurants in the centre are dark and smoky, full of thickset
men in square-shouldered suits and dark glasses, huddled together eating
enormous steaks in a conspiratorial manner.
However, the newest place to be seen, called Grill One, is bright and airy,
set on top of the city's most modern office block and reached by glass lifts
with views over the port. It is crowded and vastly overpriced and one can
wait an hour for a table, even with a reservation.
Rio offers the ultimate vegetarian nightmare in the shape of the rodizio - a
restaurant where you can eat as much meat as you can stomach. Take your
table and prepare to be attacked by a constant onslaught of waiters holding
enormous spear-like skewers bearing everything from chicken heart and
sausages to filet mignon.
For something lighter try Mosteiro in the shadow of the Sao Bento monastery,
where seafood is more the order of the day. The speciality of the house is
casquinha de siri, delicious spicy crabmeat inside a half shell brought to
you while you peruse the leather-bound menus. As you sit down, the
white-jacketed waiters have an alarming tendency to emerge from the walls in
large numbers, almost as if they were about to start formation dancing.
If food with a view is more to your taste in one of the world's most
beautiful cities, then there are various choices in or near the centre.
Rio's on Flamengo beach serves 'international cuisine' but, to compensate,
has a splendid view across the bay to the palm-fringed yacht club with the
Sugarloaf mountain towering above.
La Tour is possibly one of the world's most bizarre restaurants. Revolving
on top of the city's largest tower it offers spectacular views but be warned
 -the terrible creaking sound, variable speed and indifferent food, often
produce a greenish hue in the faces of lunchers. Worse, the tables go round
but the waiters and food trollies remain on the central plinth which does
not move, so it can take several rotations to make a choice.
Rather more civilised is Maxims on the roof of the Rio Sul tower which
reopened in 1988 after a first experiment led to bankruptcy. Rio's picture
postcard scenery is spread beneath and the prices are far more accessible
than Maxim branches in New York or Paris.
Perhaps the best restaurant is Santa Fe, hidden away in the cobbled alley
just behind the stock exchange. Salads and sandwiches have actually been
seen here.
But the biggest treat in town is the weekly feijoada, the Brazilian national
dish. Originally slave food, it comprises a stew of pig bits and blackbeans
served with rice, kale, orange and manioc flour. Traditionally eaten on
Friday or Saturday, the best restaurants separate the ears and trotters from
the nicer parts for those with a delicate stomach.
Lastly and most importantly, do not expect to pay by credit card. With
inflation running at 23 per cent a month, plastic is only marginally more
useful than Monopoly money.

<TEXT>
PETRONAS, Malaysia's state-owned oil company, has confirmed the Idemitsu
Kosan company of Japan has pulled out of a venture to build an oil refinery
near Malacca on Malaysia's west coast.
Idemitsu Kosan had a 40 per cent stake in the 100,000-barrel-a-day project,
Petronas holding 45 per cent and Samsung of Korea 15 per cent. Idemitsu said
the parties involved had failed to reach a project implementation schedule.
The refinery is a key element in Malaysia's plan to become a big exporter of
refined petroleum products over the next few years. At present, it has four
refineries with combined capacity of 220,000 b/d. Most of its refined oil
goes to the domestic market. The Malacca project will refine imported crude
for re-export. Its estimated cost, with another facility at the same site,
is Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.05bn-Pounds 1.26bn).
Mr Azizan Zainal Abidin, Petronas president, said the Malacca project would
be subject to some delay due to the Idemitsu pull-out. Petronas was holding
talks with a US group and several Middle East companies, with a view to
forming a new partnership for the project.

SAIPEM, the engineering services subsidiary of ENI, the Italian state oil
concern, and the private-sector Tecnologie Progetti Lavori (TPL), have been
awarded a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 890m) contract by the National Iranian Oil
Company (NIOC) to develop the Gulf offshore South Pars gas field.
The field, in the centre of the Gulf, abuts Qatar's North Dome gas field.
The contract envisages developing 20 offshore wells, a gathering system for
gas and condensates, six offshore platforms and 200km of underwater pipes. A
gas treatment and condensate plant will be built on land.
Work is set to start at once, with completion in 1996 and planned output of
1bn cu ft of gas a day and 50,000 b/d of condensates. Sub-contractors are
Mitsubishi of Japan and Machinoexport of Russia.
The deal confirms the leading presence of Italian business in Iran and shows
the two sides have put behind them the long saga of debts due to Italy as a
result of construction of the Bandar Abbas port under the late Shah.
The contract was signed in Tehran yesterday, in spite of rising tension over
Iran's presence on the disputed Gulf island of Abu Musa.

Mexican services market.
This comes in a report by the Services Policy Advisory Committee (SPAC), to
accompany President Bush's notification to Congress that a pact has been
reached between the US, Mexico and Canada. Congress requires reports from
private-sector advisory panels, to help members weigh trade pact benefits
and drawbacks.
The report contains important annexes by dissenting members. Mr John Adams,
a Natural Resources Defence Council environmentalist, said the accord lacks
'sufficient environmental safeguards'.
He urges Congress to 'condition final approval on strengthening measures
that link environmental protection with North America's economic
integration'. Congress members may block Nafta if environmental and labour
provisions are not strengthened.
Mr Jason Berman, Recording Industry Association president, said Canada's
exemption for cultural industries should be matched by a warning that the US
will respond to Canadian discrimination against US copyright interests.
Mr John Sweeney, president of the Services Employees' International Union,
said Nafta should be renegotiated, and pledges sought to improve
environmental and labour standards and protect workers' rights to unionise.
But sentiment among the committee's 37 members, headed by Mr John Reed,
Citicorp chairman, is enthusiastic. Nafta's recognition of broad principles
covering all services was an achievement hard to overstate, the report says.
'Services' were defined 'so that service businesses not now in existence
will receive the benefits of the agreement'.
Foreign service providers are at present restricted in Mexican operations.
Under Nafta, US and Canadian service providers will be treated the same as
Mexican companies, unless their services are specially exempted. Civil
aviation, maritime and basic telecommunications services are not covered by
the pact; banks, insurance and securities have limits to be gradually phased
out.
Services and investment liberalisation is so extensive that US business may
have trouble accepting anything less restrictive under the Uruguay Round;
for example, US and Canadian service-sector companies in Mexico will be
exempt from export, import and domestic content rules.

<TEXT>
BARRING unforeseen hitches, Taiwan's application to join Gatt will have the
go-ahead when the organisation's governing council meets on September 29.
Taiwan applied for membership of the 105-nation world trade body in January
1990 as an autonomous customs territory, the formula used by Hong Kong and
Macao when they joined Gatt with China's agreement.
But objections from China, which has been trying since 1987 to resume its
Gatt place, have until now held up the decision for a working party to
negotiate Taiwan's entry terms.
Gatt's developing-country members have been reluctant to bless Taiwan's
candidacy without China's endorsement. Beijing left Gatt in 1950, and Taiwan
was expelled when China took its UN seat in 1971.
Under the terms of an understanding reached last spring between China, the
EC and US, China will rejoin Gatt before Taiwan is admitted, though perhaps
only minutes ahead.
Gatt members have agreed Taiwan will be known as Chinese Taipei; once a
working party is set up, its entry terms could be drafted in 12 months,
since Taipei has already moved to make its trade regime more compatible with
Gatt rules.  But Taipei they have longer to wait since China's membership
bid is being held up by trade frictions with the US.

FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Drive to give third world farmers fair
deal - An assault on EC agricultural subsidies is launched today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN AID today launches a two-year campaign to encourage 'fair trade',
with an assault on the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP), support for a 'Fair Trade Mark' and a call for coffee-lovers to drink
Cafedirect.
The campaign will highlight how third world poverty is closely linked with
entrenched and 'exploitative' trading relationships.
Christian Aid, along with other leading UK charity groups, aims to persuade
today's school-leavers to spend a bigger share of the Pounds 1m they are
likely to earn in their working lifetimes on products that give third world
producers a fair deal. It is backing the 'Fair Trade Mark', which from
January next year will pinpoint such products.
It aims to encourage shops, especially supermarkets, to stock fairly traded
goods, and customers to use their shopping baskets to ease third world
poverty.
The perfect example of a 'fair trade' product is Cafedirect, a high-quality
ground Arabica coffee bought directly from farmers in Mexico, Costa Rica and
Peru.
Instead of paying farmers the prevailing world market price for coffee, at
present so low that it has swept many of the world's coffee producers into
destitution, the charitable consortium, which has been selling Cafedirect
since November last year, pays an agreed fair price.
It commits itself to a long-term contract with democratically run farmers'
organisations, and pays 60 per cent of the cost in advance, taking no more
than 30 per cent of a farmer's harvest.
A breakthrough is hoped for this autumn as the consortium negotiates for the
Safeway supermarket chain to take Cafedirect nationwide. A trial currently
involves 54 Safeway stores in Scotland.
Monthly sales of about 11,000  1/4 lb packets, mostly through delicatessens,
or health food and charity shops, would surge if this 'fair trade' coffee
were available on supermarket shelves.
Cafedirect campaigners model their hopes on the Max Havelaar Foundation in
Holland, which has over three years made a significant impact on the
country's ground-coffee market. Unlike Cafedirect, it does not provide a
branded coffee, instead putting its 'fair trade' mark on coffees imported on
fair trade terms.
Today it accounts for 2,800 tonnes of imports, up from 200 tonnes in 1988.
Coffee carrying its mark accounts for annual sales worth Fl 40m (Pounds
12.6m), about 2 per cent of the national market for ground coffee.
It is available in 90 per cent of the country's supermarkets. Only Douwe
Egbert, the national leader in the coffee market, accounting for 45 per cent
of sales, has refused to collaborate with Max Havelaar by using its mark.
Max Havelaar coffee has become a market leader in Switzerland, is sold in
Belgium, and is soon to be launched in Germany and France. The foundation
plans to extend its mark to cocoa and drinking chocolate in spring next
year, according to Mr Bert Beekman, its spokesman.
Few would claim that Max Havelaar can be any more than a niche product,
mainly because it costs up to double the price of normal ground coffees.
According to Mr Erich Muller, spokesman for Ahold, Holland's leading
supermarket chain: 'It's a special part of the public that is interested in
the problems of the third world. For most, price is the most important
matter'.
But according to Christian Aid's Peter Madden, Cafedirect, like coffees
carrying the Max Havelaar mark, has an importance far beyond its sales
figures: 'Cafedirect is not an answer to faults in the world trading system,
but in campaigning terms it's a very effective way of getting people aware
and interested.'
Britain's leading third-world aid agencies have become increasingly aware in
the past decade that aid alone can do limited good without reform to the
trade system. The agencies note that Ethiopia received during the famine
year of 1985 a total of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.58bn) in aid.
But in the same year, the collapse in world prices for raw materials such as
coffee and copper meant rich countries paid Dollars 19bn less for what they
bought from Africa.
They blame CAP subsidies for impoverishing third world farmers, because
these effectively shut the EC market to third world exporters, and because
of the scale on which surplus EC farm products are dumped on the world
markets, often depressing prices below the costs of production.
Christian Aid will note today that a European cow receives twice as much in
EC subsidies as the average income of a third world farmer.
Of more immediate relevence to the average European shopper is the fact that
each family spends about Pounds 16 a week through higher taxes and food
prices because of the CAP, which alone consumes 60 per cent of the EC's
budget.
Christian Aid argues that fair trade will benefit all, not just because a
wealthier third world would provide a market for goods and services from
industrial countries, but because it would also lessen the global dangers of
conflict, environmental catastrophe and mass migration.

FT  16 SEP 92 / US doctors' group backs care reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the largest groups representing US physicians has endorsed health
care reforms similar to those proposed by Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate.
The American College of Physicians, which represents 77,000 specialists, has
called for a national cap on health-care spending and tough limits on fees
that doctors and hospitals can charge for services.
The college said it had been working on its reform plans for five years and
was not attempting to take sides in the presidential campaign, where health
care has emerged as one of the central issues.
The Clinton campaign, however, hailed the announcement as a breakthrough,
arguing that it proved that informed opinion was swinging in favour of more
government intervention to manage runaway health-care costs.
Like Mr Clinton, the physicians' group believes employers should be required
either to provide health insurance for workers or pay a levy to help finance
an expanded public-sector scheme.
President George Bush has flatly rejected an overall cap on health spending
and specific limits on doctors' fees, arguing that such policies are
socialist and would result in queues for care.
Opinion within the medical profession is split.
Meanwhile Mr Bush sought yesterday to revive the issue of Mr Clinton's
avoidance of the Vietnam war draft, which has dogged the Democratic
candidate since the early days of his campaign.
After first defending Vice-President Dan Quayle, who avoided serving in
Vietnam by opting for the National Guard, Mr Bush worked himself up to fever
pitch as he explained why he felt Mr Clinton's draft history was relevant to
the election campaign.
'We can never forget that we ask our presidents to lead the military, to
bear the awful authority of deciding to send your sons and daughters in
harm's way,' Mr Bush told the National Guard Association in Utah.
Mr Clinton, who also addressed the association, did not respond. Instead he
discussed defence budgets and economic policy, but stuck to his earlier
promise to say not a word more about the draft.

ARGENTINA unveiled on Monday evening a draft 1993 budget totalling Dollars

debate over alleged government insensitivity to the social costs of its
orthodox adjustment policies, John Barham writes from Buenos Aires.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said when presenting the budget to
Congress that although federal spending would increase by 17.4 per cent over
1992, the budget would be balanced, with revenues of Dollars 40.05bn -
equivalent to 24 per cent of GDP. Public spending, including local
government, is forecast at 42 per cent of GDP.
Central and local government will increase social spending to Dollars
47.5bn, or 28 per cent of GDP in 1993.
This is only the second time in 40 years that an Argentine government has
submitted its budget to Congress for approval on time.

FT  16 SEP 92 / World Bank plans to boost lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank plans a big increase in lending to developing countries this
year after a slowdown over the last 12 months.
The Washington-based development organisation aims to boost lending from its
core unit, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),
to between Dollars 18.5bn and Dollars 21.5bn (Pounds 10.9bn) this year.
The World Bank says in its annual report, published this morning, that IBRD
loan commitments in its 1992 fiscal year, ending June 30, fell to Dollars
15.2bn from Dollars 16.4bn the previous year, as lending in eastern Europe
slowed and big development projects were suspended in Turkey, Yugoslavia,
Algeria and Egypt.
The bank also expects to increase loans from its affiliate, the
International Development Association (IDA), which concentrates on lending
at concessional rates of interest to the poorest developing countries.
IDA commitments are expected to reach about Dollars 7.4bn this year, against
Dollars 6.6bn in the year ending June 30.
With sustainable poverty reduction, environmental protection and
private-sector development now its priorities, the World Bank says in its
report that it has placed new emphasis on its portfolio of existing loans,
rather than on making new loan commitments.
The bank has introduced a carrot and stick approach to encourage borrowers
to keep up with loan repayments. A country that falls 30 days behind in its
payments will have no new projects presented to the board for approval. If
it falls 45 days behind, even previously approved loans will not be signed.
On the other hand the bank has waived half of the 50 basis point interest
rate spread which it charges on loans to borrowers who pay on time.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Unease in Mexico rises as economy takes a dip: The
government, has been stung by problems that are less easy to explain away
when the economy is underperforming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHINE on the Mexican economic miracle, once the toast of Wall Street and
the envy of Latin America, is beginning to wear off.
Despite a sharp rebound on Monday, the stock market is 30 per cent down
since June. The economy is expected to grow by only 2-3 per cent this year,
compared with the government's original forecast of 4 per cent.
The current account deficit is likely to exceed Dollars 20bn (Pounds
10.1bn), or more than 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The
long-awaited rise in Mexican living standards appears as distant as ever.
The slowdown has generated creeping unrest. The Manufacturing Industry
Chamber has complained about tight government policy and the squeeze on
consumer spending. In July and August, workers at the Volkswagen car plant,
the largest in Mexico, and 22,000 textile workers were on strike.
Another 15,000 former petrol workers were protesting at their dismissal and
lack of severance payments.
At the same time the government has been stung by political problems that
are less easy to explain away when the economy is underperforming. Yesterday
the ruling party's governor of Michoacan state took office amid mounting
protests from the leftist opposition at alleged fraud by the government
party.
While economists differ on the severity of the problems, most agree on the
cause: Mexico's troublingly high current account deficit and inflation rate,
coupled with the sluggish US economy and nervous foreign investors. The
combination has forced the government to raise short-term interest rates to
17 per cent and to run an even larger budget surplus than forecast in an
effort to cool down the economy.
The government has warned the private sector not to expect any loosening of
economic policy in the near future. 'We cannot pay attention to the few
voices that propose relaxing financial discipline to adjust the nation to
their own inefficiencies,' President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in
August at the annual bankers' convention. The prize he is seeking is
single-digit inflation - not attained in two decades - and productivity
increases as companies restructure in order to compete.
The trouble is inflation, with imports remarkably unwilling to respond to
the economic slowdown, argues Mr Jonathan Heath, head of the consultancy
Macro Asesoria Economica.
Mexico's inflation rate is falling but will still be around 11-12 per cent
this year. The peso devalues against the dollar by a pre-set 2.5 per cent a
year in nominal terms, implying about 6 per cent annual real appreciation
against the dollar. On top of that, imports in the first half of this year
reached Dollars 23.1bn, 30 per cent up on the period last year, while
exports were Dollars 13.7bn, up 1.5 per cent.
The implication, says Mr Heath, is that 'the government is going to have to
continue with its restrictive policy all this year and maybe next year as
well'.
Mr Roberto Barreira, head of research at the brokerage Inver Mexico, concurs
and has cut his forecast for growth next year to only 2 per cent.
Such low growth will reduce company earnings next year and partly explains
the poor performance of the stock market. Low growth should also reduce
private investment, already suffering from the falling stock prices and
higher interest rates. Private investment, financed in large part by eager
foreign investors, has fuelled economic growth over the past two years.
The government's economic strategy may have become over-dependent on the
ability to attract cheap foreign capital, lulled as it was into security by
the boom years of 1990 and 1991. 'The 1990s are not the 1980s,' argues Mr
Jesus Reyes Heroles, head of the consultancy GEA, 'and unlike Spain then,
Mexico faces a real scarcity of world resources.'
Thus, while Mr Jose Cordoba, the president's closest adviser, says in one
breath that Mexico needs Dollars 150bn of foreign capital in 10 years, he
admits in another the difficulties, by publicly warning Mexican companies
not to raise too much equity capital in international markets.
The proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) grouping Mexico,
the US and Canada was meant to square the circle by locking in President
Salinas' economic reforms, and encouraging foreigners to foot the bill for
the country's industrial restructuring.
But the Mexicans first over-estimated the speed at which the Nafta
negotiations could be concluded and then under-estimated the opposition to
the agreement in the US Congress. A ferocious attack on Nafta last Tuesday
by Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader of the US House of
Representatives, helped the market fall by 7 per cent in the week.
Most people expect the congressional vote on the agreement to be delayed
until summer next year, and the final result to be close.
The shortage of cheap foreign capital may mean that the Mexican government
will have to put up with sluggish growth for the next couple of years, just
when the ruling party prepares for the 1994 presidential elections.
It will be a measure of President Salinas' political skills if he can
persuade Mexico that this was the best result obtainable.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK Democratic party leaders appealed to voters to elect a dead man in
yesterday's primary race, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Mr Ted Weiss, a Manhattan Democrat who was among the most liberal members of
the House of Representatives, died on the eve of the party's primary, which
he was expected to win overwhelmingly.
The eight-term congressional veteran, who was a critic of the US
pharmaceuticals industry and a campaigner for better Aids research, was to
have stood virtually unopposed in the election, facing only a fringe
candidate. New York's electoral law would allow the Democrats to select a
successor to stand in the November election if the late Mr Weiss wins the
primary. And a win in his constituency - which includes the heart of
Manhattan's Upper West Side liberal enclave - means certain victory in the
November election. Thus New York's Democrats urged the electorate to cast
their vote for the dead congressman.
Meanwhile, voters were also choosing a Democratic challenger to incumbent
New York Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato from a field led by former
Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro and Mr Robert Abrams, New York State
attorney-general.

Mr John Kerin, trade minister, and Mr Simon Crean, primary industries

subsidies only against the Europeans.
Mr Kerin rejected the US claim that the EC was about to go into the Pakistan
market with huge price undercutting. 'Pakistan is not a significant market
for the EC; sales were only 4 per cent in 1991-92. This is the first sale
under EEP to Pakistan, a valuable market for Australia.' Canberra would ask
US officials to explain.

The closure of Trentham, near Stoke-on-Trent, will leave only one pit,
Silverdale, in the North Staffordshire coalfield.
It is the eighth colliery to be threatened with closure this year, as
British Coal prepares to trim production to meet the anticipated lower
demand in new contracts with the electricity industry expected to be signed
shortly.
British Coal said Trentham, which produced more than 2m tonnes a year but
has lost Pounds 20m in the current financial year, had no future.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Treasury backs tax exemption on asset sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day restated its determination that companies will
continue to be exempt from capital gains tax on the sale of assets when they
reinvest the proceeds in a related company.
It held to its position in spite of a court decision on which an appeal is
soon to be determined. Mr Justice Knox said in the High Court in March that
the Inland Revenue's practice of granting roll-over relief to groups of
companies was probably based on an incorrect understanding of current law.
Defending long-standing Revenue practice, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury, backed the principle of granting roll-over relief
between trading companies in the same group.
'The Revenue's practice seems to me to be sensible and to reflect how
commercial transactions are commonly organised,' he said. 'We will ensure
that it continues to apply.'
He said he saw the need to make a statement following the judge's remarks,
which had caused 'considerable commercial uncertainty'.
Mr Dorrell's remarks suggest that the government may consider changing the
law if the appeal judges find against the Revenue when they consider the
case of Campbell Connelly &amp; Co Ltd vs Barnett.
'What needs to be done will depend on the outcome of the appeal,' Mr Dorrell
said.
Roll-over relief permits companies to be exempt from capital gains tax if
the proceeds on the sale of an asset are reinvested in new assets.
A statement of practice issued by the Revenue in 1981 said that roll-over
relief would apply where one trading company in a group disposed of the
asset and a different trading company made the acquisition.
Mr Justice Knox's judgment suggested that this interpretation was wrong, and
that the company disposing of the old asset had to be the same as the
company acquiring the new asset.

stakes at the round-table talks on the province's future which resume at
Stormont today. The paper has angered the Democratic Unionist party.
The paper confirms the Irish government's willingness to negotiate its
territorial claim to Northern Ireland, but says important concessions will
be required from Ulster's unionists in return.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'It is clear
the message the Irish government wants to give is that it is digging in its
heels.'
He and the Reverend Ian Paisley, the party leader, walked out of the talks -
which involve the British and Irish Governments and the four Ulster
constitutional political parties - last week, saying that unless the Irish
Republic 'realistically addresses' its territorial claim to Northern
Ireland, they will not participate further.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has warned that his
delegates will also withdraw from the talks in the coming weeks if there is
no indication of progress on this issue.
Both parties want the Irish government to commit itself to a referendum to
amend Articles Two and Three of the Republic's constitution.
Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'We cannot have any relationship with the Irish
Republic while they have a territorial claim over Northern Ireland.'
The Dublin-based Irish Times published extracts from an Irish government
position paper submitted to the talks on August 28.
One extract says the Irish government 'does not rule out constitutional
change resulting from the present negotiations' but adds that the Irish
electorate 'will be particularly sensitive to the impact of any proposed
amendment on the position of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland'.
It describes the minority as 'victims' of the Government of Ireland Act,
which partitioned Ireland in 1920.
The extract goes on to say: 'If as certain delegations have urged, proposals
for constitutional change emerging from the negotiations were to include
changes to the Irish constitution, the strength and quality of the link
between both parts of Ireland would be one of the important factors in
shaping the judgment of the electorate in this regard.
'Those who urge that the division introduced by the act should be endorsed
by the nationalist community have a corresponding duty to say how the
evident flaws of the original, purportedly temporary, provisions would be
addressed'
The Irish foreign ministry said: 'The talks are confidential and it is
regrettable there should be continued leaks. It makes things more difficult
for (participants) to reveal their positions if they think it is going to be
published in the papers the next day.'
ARTICLES TWO AND THREE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
Article 2
The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands
and the territorial seas.
Article 3
Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice
to the right of the parliament and the government established by this
constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the
laws enacted by that parliament shall have the like are and extent of
application as the laws of Saorstat Eireann 'the Irish Free State) and the
like extra-territorial effect.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Proton prepares for big sales boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTON CARS (UK) the importer of Malaysia's national car, has acquired a
30-acre import centre and distribution headquarters at Bristol with the
capacity to handle 45,000 cars a year - nearly three times its current sales
volume.
According to Mr Peter King, managing director of the UK company - which is
based near Birmingham - it expects to be using all this capacity before the
end of the 1990s as a result of production increases and a much wider range
of models from the Malaysian manufacturer.
It is also seeking to recruit a further 25 dealers to bring the UK total to
250, up from fewer than 160 at the time of the car's UK launch less than
three years ago.
Mr King said yesterday negotiations had started on the possible launch of
the cars in continental European markets within two to three years.
The UK is the only European outlet for the cars - Malaysia is also a
right-hand-drive market.
Proton, in which Malaysia's state industrial holding company has a majority
stake, plans to lift production from 120,000 last year to 250,000 by the
mid-1990s, including the capability to build left-hand drive vehicles and a
greater variety of models.
Proton Cars (UK) is 60 per cent owned by Mr David Brown, the north-west of
England motor trade entrepreneur, 30 per cent by the Inchcape Group, 6 per
cent by Mr King and 4 per cent by Mr John Miller, finance director.
Launched 3 1/2 years ago, Proton is one of the UK's fastest growing new-car
franchises. Sales rose from 6,555 in 1989 to 14,026 last year, with a
projected 15,750 this year.
Mr King forecast yesterday that Proton's sales would rise to 17,550 next
year even though the market would remain unchanged from this year's
heavily-depressed 1.6m.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Polytechnics warned on pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYTECHNIC directors were warned by the government yesterday to keep this
year's pay settlement within tight bounds.
Mr Nigel Forman, higher education minister, stressed the government's
'commitment to constraining public spending over the next three years in
order to reduce the public sector deficit'. He was addressing the annual
conference of polytechnic directors,
'Employers are recruiting in a buyer's market. Accordingly they need to
challenge the expectation that there will be annual increases in pay simply
for delivering a given level of service.
'The only prudent basis for a real increase in pay is improvement in
productivity and performance.'
His warning, set against the backdrop of this year's university pay
settlement of 7 per cent which was overturned by the government as too
generous, will be taken seriously by the directors.
The conference, meeting in Edinburgh, is the last of its kind. Most
polytechnics have now been granted university status under the government's
policy of creating a unified higher-education sec-tor.
Two of the few remaining polytechnics, at Leeds and Manchester, were
yesterday granted the titles Leeds Metropolitan University and Manchester
Metropolitan University by the Privy Council.
The conference agreed to a merger with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals, which is likely to take effect within a few months. A new Higher
Education Funding Council, embracing both 'old' and 'new' universities,
comes into operation next April.
Head teachers yesterday submitted a claim for a 9 per cent salary increase
to the Teachers' Pay Review Body.
The National Association of Head Teachers argued that 'substantial'
increases in responsibilities, as well as job evaluations with comparable
positions, justified the claim.
If met, the association's claim would take the salary of a typical primary
school head to Pounds 27,746, and that of a typical secondary head to Pounds
42,677.

FT  16 SEP 92 / National commercial radio launch delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIO Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, has decided
to postpone the launch of Britain's third national commercial radio station
until the spring of 1995.
According to Lord Chalfont, the authority chairman, the delay is partly
because of the recession but mainly to allow 'a kind of orderly progress in
the development of the radio regime.'
A spring 1995 launch will be about a year later than would be possible if
the franchise - INR 3 - was advertised and licensed as quickly as possible.
Mr Stuart Francis, chairman of the Association of Independent Radio
Companies, yesterday attacked the Radio Authority decision to delay the
launch of INR3 as 'sad and disappointing.'
Mr Francis said the original hope was to use the launch of three national
commercial stations to raise the profile of commercial radio and increase
its share of national advertising revenue from its present 2 per cent.
The decision means the BBC's 24-hour news station planned for 1994 will be
on the air before the third independent national station joins Classic FM
and Independent Music Radio, the pop music station.
The Radio Authority said it was going ahead with advertising five new
regional licences covering an audience of about 12m.
There would also be two new licences for the Greater London area and other
licences in Manchester, Birmingham and Wolverhampton.
Mr Francis said his association had wanted the national stations in place
before the regional companies were launched. 'If you have a plan you should
stick to it,' he said.
The regional stations covering areas such as Central Scotland, the
north-west and the west Midlands will compete with existing local stations.
Mr Francis said: 'The national stations offer a chance of attracting genuine
new money to radio.'
The Radio Authority was influenced in its decision by market research
suggesting it would take time for commercial radio to increase its slice of
overall advertising revenue significantly.
Lord Chalfont said one company could apply for and run all five regional
stations and even employ a similar format for each, but such an operator
could not also run a Greater London station, since this would amount to a
national network by the back door.
The Radio Authority also confirmed plans to re-advertise 130 existing
commercial radio licences over the next three years, starting next month
with Aberdeen.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Actuaries agree heavy cuts in policy bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIALLY smaller bonuses will be paid in future on millions of
with-profits life assurance and pension policies, actuaries meeting at
Harrogate agreed yesterday.
Many life companies are anxious about the impact of lower bonuses - caused
by poor investment results in the past five years - on the public and on
intermediaries such as brokers and salesmen.
Some cuts were made last year but many offices maintained their bonuses in
the vain hope that investment conditions would improve.
Yesterday Mr John Martin, president of the Institute of Actuaries, chaired
an unprecedented meeting following the profession's annual conference.
Speakers stressed the fundamental structural changes on the investment
markets following the entry of the UK into the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism. It was not a question of once-and-for-all cuts, speakers
stressed. Reductions would continue for some years unless conditions were to
change.
The meeting was concerned about how to present the message to the public,
and some actuaries said they feared a struggle with life company boards over
setting a responsible bonus strategy.
One speaker called on appointed actuaries - the company officials who have a
statutory responsibility to safeguard the solvency of their life offices in
spite of competitive pressures to pay high bonuses - to 'stand up and make
sure that their views are heard. Marketing considerations must take second
place.'
Appointed actuaries also have a duty to consider policyholders' 'reasonable
expectations'. Speakers said those expectations had to be reduced.
'We have to get out and explain that something fundamental is happening
here,' one actuary said.
Support was offered for company actuaries whose views were ignored. 'Anyone
who is getting into a difficult situation and would welcome confidential
discussions with senior members of the profession is very much encouraged to
get in touch,' said a senior actuary.
Mr Martin said: 'This is a very important actuarial matter indeed. Bonuses
should be coming down. The debate is about when and how.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / Tecs seek earlier training for jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils are seeking cuts in the amount of time
unemployed adults must wait before qualifying for training and job-search
opportunities.
The 82 Tecs, which administer publicly-funded training programmes in England
and Wales, propose provisions such as a Jobclub for the unemployed starting
in the first weeks of unemployment building up to entitlement to a broad
range of services at 13 weeks' unemployment. At present such services are
concentrated on people unemployed for more than six months.
Tecs have told the government the plan could lead to a sharp increase in the
number of jobs offered to the unemployed, but would not require more
government funds.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, is reviewing publicly funded
provision for the adult unemployed.
Tecs would also like the funding arrangements for Employment Training, the
main training scheme for the adult long-term unemployed, changed so that
individuals received pay instead of benefits. Tecs believe this would
improve the image of ET.
Tecs also ask for clearer lines of responsibility between them and the
government's Employment Service, which at present provides services such as
Jobclubs. Tecs would like to provide some of the services.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Stock option schemes queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S largest shareholder group yesterday proposed guidelines on the
awarding of stock options for top executives which could severely limit
their use by large companies.
The National Association of Pension Funds, whose members manage over Pounds
250bn in pension fund assets, issued a consultation document in which it
proposed that shareholders ask companies to abandon the normal practice of
allowing top management to exercise stock options if a certain level of
earnings per share growth was achieved. Instead, the NAPF proposed that
options should only be exercisable if the share price outperformed an agreed
benchmark such as the FTA All-Share Index.
Because only half of companies in the index can outperform it, the
guidelines, if adopted, could severely curtail the issuance of executive
stock options.
The NAPF also said that, while it believes share option schemes have their
role in motivating top executives, profit-related pay and well structured
cash bonus schemes achieve that goal better.
'There is no evidence that share schemes encourage people to stay with their
shares longer than is appropriate,' said Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the
NAPF's investment committee. The anecdotal evidence suggests that most
executives exercise their options and sell the shares as soon as the price
rises to the point at which a reasonable profit can be made. Thus, they do
not encourage managers to take a long-term view on a company's performance.
In explaining the NAPF's position, Mr Matheson said the review of stock
options began following general concern among the membership about whether
earnings per share are a reliable indicator of corporate performance.
'Everyone has become increasingly concerned about the validity of earnings
per share,' he said.
Fears that accounting conventions allow managements to distort EPS have led
shareholders to question it is a satisfactory basis for awarding
performance-related pay.
The NAPF proposed guidelines would assign a specific role to non-executive
directors who would have to confirm that, as well as the share price having
met a pre-determined benchmark, a sustained improvement in financial
performance had been achieved.
The NAPF position is not shared by Britain's other major shareholders'
group, the Association of British Insurers. While the ABI says it believes
real financial growth must be demonstrated, it sees no better measure than
EPS. Mr Matheson said 'protracted' discussions had been held with the ABI in
order to prevent the two shareholder groups from recommending different
policies to boards.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serbian-controlled rump state of Yugoslavia came under fire at the
opening of the United Nations general assembly session last night, with
moves foreshadowed to bar it from UN bodies.
Britain's delegate, Sir David Hannay, said the Belgrade government's claim
to be the successor of the disintegrated former state of Yugoslavia was
'anomalous and unacceptable'.
He said European Community countries would seek a bar on the rump state,
which consists just of Serbia and Montenegro. The EC nations would ask the
UN Security Council to recommend to the 179-nation General Assembly that
representatives of Serbia and Montenegro 'not be allowed to participate in
the work of UN bodies.'
This would mean the effective suspension of Yugoslav representation in the
UN. But Belgrade could later apply for separate UN membership.
The breakaway Yugoslav republics of Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina
have already done this and have been admitted to the UN in their own right.
Their delegates formally backed the EC initiative, which is expected to be
considered by the Security Council within a few days.
UN diplomats said they did not expect Russia to veto the move in the
Security Council. President Boris Yeltsin has been criticised at home for
going along with measures against the Serbs in Bosnia-Hercegovina. But even
so, diplomats believe Russia may abstain from voting, along with China.
The move seems virtually assured of endorsement by the General Assembly.
Turkey supported the move on behalf of the 47 members of the Islamic
Organisation.
Mr Dragomir Djokic, Belgrade's ambassador, stressed that his government did
not claim to be the sole successor to the former Yugoslavia.
He voiced concern that a move to suspend its representation was coming just
as efforts were being intensified to implement decisions of the recent
London peace conference. The move could jeopardise those efforts, he warned.
It would be the first time since 1974 that a member state has been so
ostracised bythe UN. In the earlier case, South Africa was ejected on a
credentials challenge but continues as a UN member.

rescheduling the debt repayments over 10 years. This would include a
moratorium of five years in which the new republics would pay back only

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments were yesterday warned by a senior banking official not
to re-schedule Russia's foreign debts without first obtaining big
improvements in the country's economic and financial policies.
Mr Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Washington-based Institute of
International Finance (IIF), said that if the Paris Club of western creditor
nations were formally to reschedule Russia's overdue interest payments
Russia could 'become the ward of tax payers' in the big industrialised
countries.
Speaking as senior government officials of the creditor countries met in
Paris to discuss the debts of the former Soviet Union, Mr Schulmann said it
was 'difficult to avoid the conclusion that policy makers in Russia do not
know what they are doing. Indeed they may not know what is going on,' he
added.
Mr Schulmann, who leaves Washington shortly to become president of the
German state central bank of Hesse and a member of the Bundesbank's
decision-making central council, said Russia had generated enough foreign
exchange so far this year and in 1991 to pay all the interest it owed on its
foreign loans. But the IIF, which was set up by large international banks in
the early 1980s to monitor sovereign debt problems, has calculated that
Russia has paid less than Dollars 500m (Pounds 253m) in interest since
January.
He said Russian ministers had estimated that capital flight from Russia
totalled Dollars 3bn so far in 1992. The real figure was likely to be double
that amount, he said.
Mr Schulmann said it would set a 'wrong signal' to reschedule Russia's debts
in these circumstances because such an action would give an appearance of
orderliness to a very disorderly situation. Instead, the industrial
countries should continue to deal with Russia's overdue debt by rolling it
over for three months at a time. He also said the International Monetary
Fund should not give Russia a standby credit at present.

THE French government yesterday offered to freeze the temporary suspension

However, its efforts were blocked when two of the biggest officers' unions,
the UFAP and Force Ouvriere, refused to attend a morning negotiating
meeting.
Despite the government's efforts, staff at most of France's 182 jails stayed
out on strike over their demands for improved security after the murder of
two officers. There were ugly scenes as riot police tried to restore order,
sometimes clashing with picketing officers as well as inmates.
The French airline pilots' unions have called out their members on a 24-hour
strike today in protest at proposed changes to their working arrangements.
The pilots' union criticised the European Commission by claiming that it was
tabling changes which would involve more flying hours and shorter rest
periods.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Bosnian peace force may prove too small / A look at the UN
soldiers' role

<TEXT>
THE decision by the United Nations Security Council to send up to 6,000 more
troops to Bosnia-Hercegovina is aimed at stepping up the international
relief operations throughout the former Yugoslav republic.
But UN officials admit that the numbers may be too small to cope with task
facing the United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR).
Under its enlarged mandate, the UN forces will support the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees aid efforts in Bosnia, and provide
protection, 'where and when the UNHCR considers such protection necessary'.
However, the UN remains determined not to change its operations in Bosnia
from peace-keeping to peace-enforcement for fear that it will be seen as
partial towards any one side involved in the fighting.
'The expansion of the UN presence is tied to the humanitarian aid effort,' a
senior UN official said yesterday. However, he added that it would run in
parallel with the Geneva talks, as well as continuing attempts to place all
heavy weapons under UN supervision.
In addition, the agreements signed last month at the London peace conference
envisage sending many more observers to Bosnia's borders to stem the flow of
weapons into the republic. As part of the humanitarian effort, UN troops,
which will work closely with the UNHCR, will be deployed in four or five new
zones, apart from the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. These include Banja Luka,
Bihac and Doboj in the north, Mostar in the south, and Tuzla and Gorazde in
the east.
A UN infantry battalion will be based in each zone. It will be complemented
by an engineer bridging company, military observers and logistical and
signals back-up.
'The UN units in the new zones would need to have a high degree of
self-sufficiency,' said Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general,
in his report on Bosnia to the security council.
'The troops will be doing a lot of repair work before the winter arrives.
Bridges have to be re-built. Mines have to be located. Roads have to be made
passable. We will not be able to use the mountain routes in a few weeks
time,' a UN commander explained.
'When we move the UN troops into the zones, they will be there for some
time. This is a long haul,' he added.
At the request of the UNHCR, the UN troops will protect aid storage
facilities in these zones. The relief convoys will be supported by a UN
transport battalion, which will escort them in and out of the zones.
The troops will follow 'normal peace-keeping rules of engagement', and will
be authorised to use force in self-defence.
Mr Boutros Ghali stressed that self-defence would include 'situations in
which armed persons attempt by force to prevent UN troops from carrying out
their mandate'.
He said that if all parties involved in the war in Bosnia did not stop
attacking UN personnel, 'further steps might be necessary to ensure
UNPROFOR'S security and enable it to fulfil its mandate'. However, Mr
Boutros Ghali conceded that the enlarged UN presence in Bosnia would not be
sufficient to protect any of the people released from the detention camps
who wish to leave the republic, let alone protect those who wish to return
to their homes, which have often been destroyed.
He said the security council would have to expand the UN's mandate even
further if it was to take on this role as well.
Under these circumstances, and the limitation of the current mandate, it is
now apparent that the UN's expanded role in Bosnia will not lead to the
setting up of safe-havens for the millions of refugees, nor will UN
protectorate zones be established.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, has backed off his threat to
boycott international talks on Bosnia's future scheduled to begin in Geneva
on Friday, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
He will be sending Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign minister.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, leader of
the Croat-controlled area of western Hercegovina, are also expected to
attend the talks, to be chaired by Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a UN official.
The talks, under auspices of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia,
co-sponsored by the UN and European Community, are to craft a long-term
political settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of
the conference, said yesterday that the negotiations would go into
continuous session from Friday until a solution was reached.
He added that the talks would start with a clean slate, now that the EC's
previous 'cantonisation' plan has been buried.
Sixty-eight sick and injured men from Serb-run detention camps in Bosnia
were flown to hospitals in Britain on a Red Cross flight yesterday, Our
Foreign Staff writes.
A Russian Aeroflot aircraft, chartered by the International Committee of the
Red Cross, landed at Stansted airport after leaving the Serb-held stronghold
of Banja Luka.
The Moslem-held Bosnian town of Sokolac in the north-west of the former
Yugoslav republic was 'practically destroyed' in a Serbian air raid on
Monday, authoritative sources said yesterday, agencies report. The sources
said they had no casualty figures for the attack, carried out by four
warplanes apparently based in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka.
One source well-informed on the incident described it as 'the most serious
air attack of the (Bosnian) war so far'.
Earlier, UN spokesman, Mr Fred Eckhard, told reporters in Geneva that
international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, had sent a message to
the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, deploring the incident.
Mr Eckhard, citing information received from UN military commander, General
Satish Nambiar, said Sokolac was one of four population centres in the
so-called 'Bihac pocket' that were hit in the attack which lasted
approximately an hour.

FT  16 SEP 92 / End of car strike opens way for Fiat takeover

<TEXT>
A SEVEN-WEEK strike at Poland's FSM small car factory, which is being taken
over by Fiat of Italy, collapsed yesterday giving the government a victory
in its battle for wage restraint.
The government had been hoping that its firm stance on the FSM strike would
send a positive signal to foreign investors.
The way is now open for Fiat Auto, which last May signed a deal worth nearly
Dollars 2bn for the plant, to take possession. Fiat has been waiting for the
strike to end and the company's office in Warsaw says it hoped the 'opening
date' for the takeover would be October 1.
Meanwhile up to three thousand workers yesterday agreed to leave the plant
at Tychy in southern Poland after failing to win concessions other than a 30
per cent wage increase offered by Fiat at the end of July. The rise will
come in to effect once the Italian car maker is in control and should bring
the average monthly wage at the plant up to 4m Zloty (Pounds 156).
The strikers had originally demanded that wages be indexed to the market
price of the new Cinquecento car they have been producing for Fiat at FSM
since the New Year. FSM was to have produced 160,000 vehicles this year but
the strike has resulted in the loss of some 15,000 cars, delaying Fiat's
western Europe sales campaign for the Cinquecento this autumn.

FT  16 SEP 92 / UK troops face uncertain role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH troops have been preparing for the past three weeks to form the
largest contingent of new UN forces for Bosnia, but remain in considerable
uncertainty about how and where they will operate.
Reconnaissance and planning teams are to fly out this week to investigate
convoy routes and establish areas of responsibility. The other main new
contingents will be from France and Canada, with smaller forces from Spain,
Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.
'A hell of a lot of detailed planning is still to be done,' said one UK
official. The 1,800 UK troops, with some 450 vehicles, are not expected to
be in place in much less than six weeks. Crucial questions still hang over
the rules of engagement - the confidential conditions governing a
commander's leeway to use military force.
The force's mandate to protect food and medical aid convoys for Bosnia has
been extended to cover possible convoys of released detainees. But it has no
brief to monitor the sites where heavy weapons are concentrated, and the
question remains open how these weapons will be controlled.
UN forces are empowered to defend both themselves and the convoys. This
means they may return fire and in some circumstances fire first. But it is
unclear what further action they might take against ambushers, and unlikely
that their powers would extend to pre-emptive firing at an ambush site.
'The name of the game is protection, not forcing convoys through,' said one
army officer. He accepted problems were likely to arise, but warned that
looser rules of engagement could 'open the door too far to a variety of
interpretations'.
Currents plans are based on the assumption that any attack on convoys would
probably involve direct fire - for instance from heavy machine guns or
anti-tank weapons - rather than artillery. British forces, although they
will have some mortars, include no artillery or radars to locate heavy guns.
The UK force is designed as a self-sufficient 'battle group', drawn mainly
from units based in Germany and built around a reinforced infantry
battalion, equipped with 40 Warrior armoured combat vehicles and backed up
by a squadron of Scimitar armoured reconnaissance vehicles and logistics
support.
Troops in Germany began painting their vehicles white last week. The
relatively heavy equipment was chosen to operate along difficult mountain
roads in winter, and both the Warrior and the Scimitar are equipped with
powerful 30mm cannon.
The cost to the UK is reckoned at Pounds 80m-Pounds 90m in the first year.
Britain, which currently has 300 medical personnel in Croatia, has up to now
been among the most cautious about sending combat troops to former
Yugoslavia. The Bosnian deployment has increased concern that the army, in
the process of being reduced by 25 per cent, may be overstretched. Troop
strengths in Northern Ireland have already been increased since last year by
two battalions. 'The pips will squeak a bit, but it's still tenable,' said
an army source. However, if significant further deployments became
necessary, the government might have to rethink its plans for army cutbacks.

<TEXT>
MR THEODOR Stolojan, Romania's outgoing prime minister, said yesterday the
country's leaders had 'made mistakes' and underlined the need for political
change after parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled to be held
on September 27.
'The situation is not so good for Romania. We have to give the chance to
people to have another government based on the power of the vote,' said Mr
Stolojan, a non-partisan prime minister of a coalition government. Mr
Stolojan's comments come in the wake of bitter criticism from the Democratic
Convention (DC), an 18-strong coalition of opposition parties. The
Convention contends in its election campaigning that the country's current
leaders, and particularly Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's president, have ruled
undemocratically, maintained supporters of the previous communist regime in
key institutions and failed to introduce meaningful reforms.
While many Romanians appear more concerned about recent price rises and
worsening bread shortages than in the elections, opinion polls suggest that
the DC's emphasis on the need for a clean break with the past is paying off.
The latest polls indicate that President Iliescu, a former high-ranking
communist official, who at the start of the campaign was tipped for
re-election with a comfortable margin, is now in a tight contest with the
DC's candidate, Mr Emil Constantinescu, the rector of Bucharest University.
In the parliamentary elections, pollsters give more than 32 per cent to the
Convention, which emerged from February's local elections as the main
opposition to the National Salvation Front (NSF). The NSF, which took power
following the bloody overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December, 1989,
went on to win two-thirds of the vote in the first post-communist elections
in May, 1990.
But the NSF was weakened earlier this year when supporters of President
Iliescu left to form the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF), a
left-wing party favouring only limited reform.
The polls indicate the DNSF will pick up 12-15 per cent, with a similar
proportion going to the NSF, which is led by Mr Petre Roman, whose reformist
government was toppled following three days of miner-led riots in September,
1991.
Many voters say they are still undecided, but with no group likely to win a
majority, the next government could be a coalition between the Convention
and Mr Roman's NSF.

FT  16 SEP 92 / GM alters Polish assembly plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the world's largest vehicle maker, is seeking to start
small-scale car assembly in Poland by autumn next year.
The company, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the Polish
Government and FSO, the Polish state-owned car maker in February, has
presented a revised plan to the Polish authorities.
This calls for the start-up of assembly of Opel cars in Warsaw - probably
the Opel/Vauxhall Astra small family car - within 9 months of a final
agreement being reached.
The revised deal, which could be finalised by mid-November, involves
assembly initially of up to 10,000 cars a year at a facility within the
existing FSO plant. It is expected that FSO would hold a minority stake in a
joint venture with GM.
The plan involves a more modest first step into local assembly in Poland
than GM had envisaged in February, but at the same time it is seeking to
bring forward the start-up date.
Under the terms of the original memorandum of understanding it was planned
that GM would invest initially up to Dollars 75m in plant and equipment at
the antiquated FSO plant for the production of the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, GM's
best-selling car in western Europe.
It intended to establish a capacity to produce a total of 35,000 Astras a
year on three shifts. It has now decided, however, that this plan must be
split into two stages.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Moves over German bank cartel inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Cartel Office has confirmed its 'suspicion' that German banks
misused a market-dominating position to pay consistently low interest rates
on savings accounts held by millions of Germans.
'The initial suspicion has been borne out and early next month we should be
able to decide to proceed with the investigation' Mr Dieter Wolf, the new
president of the Cartel Office, said. A public hearing of the banks may take
place first.
German banks were shocked last month when the Cartel Office announced an
investigation into interest rates paid on small savings accounts. Rates paid
in the last four years were between 2.5 and 3 per cent for savings accounts
of less than DM2,000 (Pounds 716), although the discount rate had more than
doubled.
'Our findings would not be legally relevant if savers could go elsewhere.
But they cannot unless they invest considerably more money' Mr Wolf said. In
order to lower costs, the investigation launched last month is limited to
eight banks operating in Berlin.
They include the three leading German banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank
and Commerzbank - as well as Postbank, the large postal bank, and four banks
operating mainly in the Berlin area.
However, the Berlin-based Cartel Office said its suspicion applied to banks
throughout Germany. The Cartel Office's next step is to decide whether to
order the banks to raise interest rates on small savings accounts to a level
which would exist if there was genuine competition.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Threat to treaty on dumping at sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW treaty to ban dumping of waste in the Atlantic may be threatened by
British and French refusal to agree to stop dumping radioactive waste, the
Department of the Environment said yesterday.
Ministers from 12 North European states - the UK, France, Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain and Sweden - will meet on Monday in Paris to sign a
convention covering all aspects of marine pollution.
It is intended to replace the existing 1972 Oslo Convention of 1972 on
dumping waste at sea and the 1974 Paris Convention on discharging waste from
rivers to the sea.
Britain and France insist on reserving the right to dump 'large bulky items'
at sea, a clause intended to cover the reactor components of nuclear
submarines and power stations. The other 10 countries want a permanent
moratorium on dumping of radioactive waste.
The DoE said yesterday that the government wanted to wait for a study by the
administrators of the London Dumping Convention, an international dumping
treaty, before committing itself on radioactive waste.
Mr David Maclean, environment minister, who will represent the UK in Paris,
said yesterday that existing treaties had already reduced marine pollution.
Levels of heavy metals in the sea had fallen since 1975, he said: copper had
fallen by 70 per cent, cadmium by 23 per cent, mercury by 38 per cent, lead
by 37 per cent and zinc by 29 per cent.
He added that Britain would stop dumping industrial waste at sea in a few
months, and would stop dumping sewage sludge by 1998.
Chemical companies yesterday attacked a report by Greenpeace, the
environmental group, which listed the top 50 industrial plants licensed to
discharge chemicals into UK rivers.
A spokesman for Glaxo, whose Cumbrian plant led Greenpeace's 'Filthy 50'
table, said: 'Greenpeace have misinterpreted the figures.
' They quote the limits we are allowed to put out, not what we do put out,
and much of what we discharge is simply water.'
A spokeswoman for the Chemical Industries Association said: 'Greenpeace are
accusing companies of polluting the North Sea when they are operating within
licences.
'A great deal of money has already been spent on cleaning effluents.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / Bundesbank chief in row over need for realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundesbank was last night at the centre of a renewed controversy
after reports that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, its president, had suggested that
a more comprehensive realignment of European currencies could have reduced
turbulence in currency markets.
The reports, quoted by DPA and VWD, the main German political and economic
news agencies, were denied last night by a spokesman for the German central
bank.
The reported comments were based on an interview given by Mr Schlesinger to
Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, and to the Wall Street Journal.
They prompted hurried telephone calls to Germany from officials at the
Treasury and the Bank of England last night to seek clarification.
According to the news agencies, Mr Schlesinger said that the measures taken
so far had not resolved all the problems in the markets.
The Bundesbank chief was reported to have suggested that the weekend
realignment of the Italian lira had not gone far enough and that a wider
realignment could have been more effective in reducing tensions in the
currency market. He did not rule out continuing pressure on individual
currencies.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said last night: 'There has never been any
question of sterling being realigned or devalued and at no stage did anybody
else suggest we should move with the Italians.'
For its part, the Bundesbank said through a spokesman after consulting Mr
Schlesinger: 'This statement is no authorised version of the interview.'
It added: 'The president did not say it in that way or mean it in that way.
The words were suggested to him and he did not answer them.' The spokesman
said an authorised version of the interview would appear in the Wall Street
Journal.
Mr Hans Mundorf, editor-in-chief of Handelsblatt said last night: 'This
interview . . . was conducted by the head of our currencies and capital
markets staff. I have no doubt in the correctness of the information he gave
to DPA.'
The reported statements are in line with what is seen as a common Bundesbank
view, but one it has been careful never to express publicly.
Few officials in Bonn deny that there had been arguments in the Bundesbank
for a wider realignment as part of last weekend's changes, but they insist
that the 'political reality' only allowed a limited move involving the lira.
The officials say that devaluation of sterling was 'not really considered as
a valid option' because of the fierce hostility of the British government.
According to the excerpts of the interview on German news agencies, Mr
Schlesinger said the EMS was now considerably more relaxed than it had been
last week.
The Bundesbank chief was said to have noted that other currencies could be
hit ahead of France's Sunday vote on the Maastricht Treaties.
But the report continued: 'Even if France were to vote to reject the
treaties - which he (Mr Schlesinger) thought unlikely - other currencies
such as the pound sterling were not likely to come under similar pressure to
that placed on the lira.'

FT  16 SEP 92 / PM cancels Seville trip to deal with 'business'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday cancelled an official visit to Spain, 24 hours
before he was due to fly out, in a move which heightened nervousness in the
City and at Westminster over the depth of the government's economic
difficulties.
The prime minister's unusual step put further pressure on the pound, which
fell to a new low in the exchange rate mechanism, at one point dropping to
within a tenth of a pfennig of its floor.
It also provoked fresh speculation at Westminster that the government has
serious problems in reaching agreement on the 1993-94 public expenditure
round, due to be discussed by the newly formed chancellor's committee on
Thursday.
Downing Street insisted that the eleventh-hour decision to postpone Mr
Major's visit to Seville's Expo 92 exhibition had nothing to do with
sterling but was to meet the pressure of business on his diary.
Officials said the new system for managing public expenditure was 'new
territory' for the government which warranted close attention from the prime
minister.
They also added that he would be using the empty space in his diary to
examine the spending implications of the new Council Tax and plans for the
new BBC Charter.
The explanations were widely greeted with scepticism. One Tory MP, Mr
Richard Shepherd, warned that the impression was that the government was
'losing control of the economy.'
Labour seized on the cancellation as a tacit admission by the government of
the dire state of the economy.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'It is a sign that they have
been driven to accept, as we have been urging on them for many, many weeks,
that this situation is extremely serious.'
Independent observers suggested Mr Major may have calculated that it was
better to risk market unease at the cancellation of the trip than to be
absent abroad when the economy was under intense pressure.
With the Treasury continuing to insist that the government will use any
means necessary to maintain sterling's ERM position, an interest rate rise
cannot be ruled out.
Some MPs recall the humiliation for the Labour government in 1976 when Mr
Denis (now Lord) Healey, the chancellor, was forced to return from Heathrow
to tackle an economic crisis.

FT  16 SEP 92 / City set to defend exchange markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING City institutions were yesterday considering making a forthright
statement in defence of unrestricted foreign exchange markets, because of
concerns that the markets and dealers are being blamed for the inability of
the UK government to reduce interest rates.
The Bank of England has been approached to join with the Corporation of
London and leading banks in making a public statement that unrestricted
flows of capital in foreign exchange markets are positive for the economy.
'Politicians are representing the free markets as a bad thing', said an
executive involved in the discussions. 'We fear that the general public
blames the City for the country's economic problems.'
The mood among City dealers and executives over the past few weeks of sharp
fluctuations in currency markets - prompting huge rises in interest rates in
Italy and Sweden - has become very defensive.
There are widespread fears that the exchange volatility and the government's
inability to cut interest rates could lead to pressure for new regulations
to be introduced into foreign exchange markets.
City institutions want to make it clear that it is not their fault that
sterling is under pressure. However, they are unclear how to say this
without putting the blame on the government by implication, which they are
reluctant to do.
The Bank of England has not decided whether it will get involved in making
any such statement in defence of free markets.
City institutions are also organising a related campaign to reassert the
strength of Europe's financial markets. They fear that international
financial institutions may reduce their investments in Europe if the French
vote against the Maastricht agreement on Sunday.
The Corporation of London and UK banks are keen to stress that the City will
remain one of the world's three most important financial centres, whatever
the outcome of the vote.
In order to reinforce this confidence, they will be lobbying hard at the
annual International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington next week.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, is likely to
be involved in this lobbying.
If the French vote in favour of Maastricht, part of this IMF-week campaign
will concentrate on the need for any future European Central Bank to be
based in London.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Growth falls give Singapore an attack of economic angst: The
rising fear of missing out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPOREANS have a word for it: Kiasu, a Hokkien Chinese term which
describes a fear of missing out or failing to keep pace with the crowd.
These days there is plenty of Kiasu in Singapore.
The reason is the economy. In 1988, the economy grew by 11 per cent, in 1989
by 9.2 per cent, in 1990 by 8.3 per cent and last year by 6.7 per cent. In
the first half of this year growth slid to 5 per cent.
Singapore sets itself high economic standards, and the decline in growth has
been enough to induce wholesale nervousness. Shops and restaurants are
unusually quiet. Though there are more tourists arriving, the big spenders,
notably the Japanese, are staying away. Hotels are in a price war for
customers.
Singaporeans watch as their old rival, Hong Kong, continues to grow rapidly.
There is also political uncertainty, with the old captain of the SS
Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, no longer at the helm. Singapore, it is felt, is
failing to keep up.
However, the picture is hardly all doom and gloom. Singapore's growth is
largely dependent on its exports, and analysts point out that a 5 per cent
rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is a significant achievement at a time
when Singapore's main export markets - the US, the European Community and
Japan - are simultaneously either in recession or showing only slight
growth.
Singaporeans might be full of economic angst, but investors are still
bullish about the island republic's economic prospects. In the 1985
recession there was a sharp dip in foreign investment: new investment
commitments in manufacturing in the first six months of this year were
SDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 534m), a 6 per cent rise over the same period in
1991.
The government says all is more or less on course: as the economy matures,
slower economic growth rates are inevitable. Singapore, with its highly
trained workforce, its well developed infrastructure and its Dollars 38bn
foreign exchange reserves is poised to take advantage of opportunities in
what is the world's fastest growing economic region.
But there are problems. As in the mid-1980s, there are signs the government
is pump-priming the economy by pouring money into the construction sector,
which enjoyed a 20 per cent growth rate in the first half of the year, while
manufacturing output continues to fall and the financial services sector -
one of the star industries in recent years - achieves minimal growth.
The GDP growth figures disguise an export performance which is sluggish in
comparison with recent years. While Singapore retains a strong position in
the electronics sector (it produces 50 per cent of the world's computer disk
drives) further growth is largely dependent on an illusive US economic
recovery.
'Singapore had grown complacent,' says one economist. 'It thought it had
escaped the effects of the recession in the west. That's clearly not the
case now.'
Singapore is also faced with the erosion of its competitiveness. While wages
are rising at a lower rate than in the mid-1980s, there are worries about a
growing gap between wage rises and productivity. Singapore is an
increasingly expensive place to do business: a 16 per cent rise of its
currency against the US dollar since the end of 1989 has further blunted its
export competitiveness.
The government's answer is to encourage domestic manufacturers to automate;
go into more high-tech industries; or move their labour-intensive industries
offshore. But such moves are taking longer than expected.
Government sensitivity to criticism of its management of the economy is
partly due to political factors. In elections last year, the governing
Peoples Action Party, in power since Singapore's independence, lost support.
A number of by-elections pending will be a severe test for Mr Goh Chok Tong,
the prime minister.
Mr Goh has recently warned against 'the democratic distemper which afflicts
peoples whose economies have become sluggish because of subsidies'. But the
government might find it dangerous to ignore pleas for greater health and
education spending.

In late June, the Singapore newspaper Business Times published preliminary
government figures for GDP growth in the second quarter of the year. The
figures gave a lower than expected growth of 4.6-4.8 per cent.
Six weeks later, officers from Singapore's Internal Security Department
(ISD) questioned Business Times journalists and took away notebooks and
computer files. The preliminary figures were apparently based on leaked
information.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the ISD officers were carrying
out their investigations in accordance with Singapore's Official Secrets
Act. Under the act, anyone who obtains such information and uses it 'in any
manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of Singapore' can be jailed
for up to two years.
Civil servants have been questioned, as have representatives of foreign
investment houses, about the source of the figures.

FT  16 SEP 92 / US direct investment challenges Japanese in Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INCREASED US direct investment in developing Asian economies is challenging
the conventional wisdom that US corporations must take second place to their
Japanese rivals as investors in the region, according to a report by Merrill
Lynch, the US brokerage.
In an analysis of investment statistics in its latest Asian Economic
Commentary, Merrill Lynch notes that US net direct investment in Asia,
excluding Japan, rose 37 per cent last year to Dollars 2.29bn (Pounds
1.16bn) in spite of the US recession, while worldwide US investment fell 52
per cent.
'US companies took a surprisingly aggressive stance on non-Japan Asia,' the
report says. 'US investments to all other parts of the world fell
significantly.' Flows of Japanese investment to Asia remained high at
Dollars 5.94bn in the fiscal year ended in March, but were down 16 per cent
from the previous year.
Although the investment figures issued by Japan and the US are not strictly
comparable, Merrill Lynch said, the fact that US investors' commitments grew
at a time when their Japanese counterparts were cutting back is confirmed by
investment approval statistics from recipient countries.
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines all recorded increased
approvals for US investments in 1991, and decreased approvals for Japanese
projects, which suggests the trend of higher US and lower Japanese
investments will continue.
One reason for the increase in US investments is probably the renewed
regional emphasis on the energy and petrochemical sectors, where US
companies are strong.
US investments in the future could also be boosted by the development of
financial and computer service industries in Asia and the demand for
recreational products such as films, books and even theme parks, Merrill
Lynch suggests.
The outlook for investments in the manufacturing sector is more mixed, with
US companies continuing to focus on medium- and higher-end industries
requiring skilled manpower; the bulk of the Dollars 1.2bn of US
manufacturing investments in the area in 1991 went to Singapore and Taiwan.
'In the long run, Asia could benefit from a more balanced mix of US and
Japanese investments,' Merrill Lynch says.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Indian shares rise on hopes of new money
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN stocks soared yesterday after the announcement of rules for the
opening of the country's capital markets to foreign investors.
The Bombay stock exchange index jumped 4.1 per cent as investors shrugged
off their worries about the recent market scandal and bought stocks in the
hope that the rule changes will prompt a wave of foreign investment.
'The mood was extremely up-beat,' said Mr S. Subramanian, vice president of
DSP Financial Consultants, an investment company.
The opening of India's markets to foreign institutions is a key element in
the government's wide-reaching economic deregulation programme. The
announcement coincides with the visit to the UK and the US of Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister.
Under guidelines published on Thursday, foreign institutions will be
permitted to hold up to 5 per cent of any stock. Foreign institutions as a
whole will be allowed to buy up to 24 per cent.
Dividends and interest income will be taxed at 20 per cent, long-term
capital gains (profits on securities held for more than a year) at 10 per
cent. The government has yet to disclose the tax rate on short-term
investments - an important consideration or many institutions.
A senior official of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said the
rules would be welcomed by foreign institutions. Mr Subramanian said more
than 20 foreign fund managers had called yesterday seeking further
information - mainly from Hong Kong, the UK and the US.
Some brokers in Bombay have been drumming up business by forecasting massive
flows of foreign money of Dollars 1bn and more into the Dollars 70bn stock
market over the next year or so. But others warn that Dollars 100m-Dollars
200m may be more realistic.
Mr Subramanian said 'old India hands' might start buying selectively, but
foreign investors as a whole were wary because of the recent scandal,
uncertainty about the future course of economic reform and the high price of
Indian stocks.
The average share in Bombay trades on a multiple of about 30 times earnings
for the year to March 1992 and about 26 likely earnings in the year to March
1993. 'At these levels we won't see much money coming in.'
Nevertheless, financial companies are busy preparing for the day foreign
investors become a permanent part of the Indian market.
Foreign broking houses - including Jardine Fleming, the British-owned
company and Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley of the US - are opening
representative offices or making alliances with local companies.
Until now foreign investment in India has been limited to eight offshore
funds which have accumulated net assets of about Dollars 1.1bn since the
first was launched seven years ago.

CHINA is boycotting talks between the five permanent members of the UN
Security Council on restricting arms sales to the Middle East in what
appears to be its first retaliation against President Bush's decision to
allow the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan.
Reuters news agency quoted a State Department official as saying China had
informed the US that it would not attend the talks, for which no date has
yet been set. 'They've said they will not be going to the. . . talks,' the
official said, adding: 'We will be arguing against that.'
However, China is taking part in separate multilateral talks on Middle East
arms controls, which began yesterday in Moscow.
Beijing is furious that Mr Bush cleared the sale of up to 150 fighters in
what it says is a breach of a 1982 Sino-US agreement. It said the decision
would make it difficult for China to co-operate in arms control and
non-proliferation efforts.
It was not clear yesterday whether the Chinese boycott was the beginning of
a sustained campaign of non-co-operation in arms control discussions, or a
one-off action designed to underline its displeasure at the fighter sale.
The State Department official said the decision did not mean Beijing would
resume arms sales to the region, but it would be watching carefully.

A BREAKAWAY whaling organisation could further undermine the influence of
the International Whaling Commission, the whaling regulator, which has seen
repeated challenges to its jurisdiction this year.
The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco), founded by Norway,
Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, declared at its first meeting that
dissatisfaction with the IWC's ban on commercial whaling was the main reason
for its creation.
Iceland left the IWC at the June annual meeting. Norway, while remaining a
member, plans to resume commercial whaling next spring. The two have
repeatedly criticised the IWC, which includes many non-whaling countries,
for pandering to animal rights arguments and refusing to agree quotas for
commercial whaling even on a 'sustainable' basis.
Nammco's influence will be greatly increased if Russia and Canada accept its
invitation to join. Japan, one of the largest whaling countries, also
attended the inaugural meeting as an observer.
Nammco will also cover seals and pilot whales.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Minister defends foreign holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Hu, Singapore's minister of finance, has defended his
government's investments in overseas companies which have run into serious
financial difficulties.
In recent years Singapore has been utilising some of its large foreign
exchange reserves - now officially put at Dollars 38bn - to invest in
various companies and enterprises around the world.
In May last year the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and
Temasek Holdings, a state-owned company, bought a 30 per cent stake in Mount
Charlotte Investments, the British based hotel chain, for SDollars 821m
(Pounds 272m at today's exchange rates). The purchase was part of a
Singapore government move which also involved acquiring a 4.7 per cent stake
in the New Zealand-based Brierley Investments company, whose biggest asset
is Mount Charlotte.
Mount Charlotte has severe debt problems and trading in its shares on the
London Stock Exchange stopped late last year. Responding to opposition
questions in the Singapore parliament, Mr Hu said no loss had so far been
incurred on the government's Mount Charlotte shares.
'Shares in Mount Charlotte were purchased as a long term investment.
Therefore, the return from this investment can be determined when Mount
Charlotte is relisted on the London Stock Exchange,' said Mr Hu. He also
said losses on investments in high-tech companies in the US were no cause
for concern. Mr Hu said Singapore Technologies Ventures, ultimately
controlled by Singapore's Ministry of Defence, had invested SDollars 38m in
Silicon Valley companies last year and losses amounted to SDollars 5m.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Japan's prosecutors pursue 'kingmaker'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE prosecutors insisted yesterday that Mr Shin Kanemaru, the
'kingmaker' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, will be formally
investigated over whether his receipt of Y500m (Pounds 2.1m) from a
scandal-tainted trucking company was in breach of political funding laws.
Doubt over Mr Kanemaru's future has unsettled the ruling party, which
presumed that its former vice-chairman would not be pursued. Mr Kanemaru,
head of the party's largest faction, also thought he would not be formally
questioned, and last week refused to travel to the Tokyo prosecutor's
office.
But investigators have grown impatient with Mr Kanemaru, and appear to have
leaked details of the donation and his alleged links to a gangster group
that were widely broadcast on Japanese television stations last night.
The information had clearly been gathered by prosecutors during questioning
of Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the
parcel delivery company at the centre of an unfolding saga of massive
payments to politicians and government officials.
Mr Kanemaru has admitted that his office received the Y500m, but said the
funds were 'goodwill money' for the party and were not in breach of the
Political Funds Control Law. However, the amount is far beyond the Y100m
allowed to be donated by a company to one party under the law, which has a
maximum fine of only Y200,000.
To show his remorse, Mr Kanemaru resigned as party vice-chairman, and yet
suffered no loss of power within the party. However, his ability to raise
funds, which sustains his status within the party, could be hurt by the
separate allegations yesterday that he asked gangsters to end protests
against LDP leaders by far-right groups.
By raising the gangster issue, prosecutors are attempting to embarrass Mr
Kanemaru into making an appearance at their office this week. His assistants
say he is preparing a written explanation for the prosecutors, but they want
him to make an appearance in person.
The possibility of Mr Kanemaru's reputation suffering serious damage from
the scandal has prompted a power struggle within his faction. Meanwhile, the
'kingmaker' is said to have spent much of the past few days at his home
playing mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed in one of the worst
floods ever seen in Pakistan.
Hundreds of peasants outside Multan, the historic city of the Sufi saints,
yesterday sought refuge on the roofs of their mud houses, as the heart of
Pakistan's cotton belt was hit by the floods.
Small patches of cotton and rice crops, and trees with their trunks fully
submerged in a sea of water were the only remaining signs of the lush green
farms that were flourishing up until last week.
Breaches made by army engineers in a canal west of the city helped prevent
flood water from entering Multan. But the floods were last night heading
towards the southern province of Sindh amid widespread fears of further
damage to life and the economy.
The floods and torrential rains have progressively spread over Pakistan and
parts of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan over the past week. The cost of
rehabilitation could intensify pressure on the national economy, already hit
by a world recession which has caused a setback to cotton-related exports.
Now there are concerns that the cotton crop, the production of which had
risen by 35 per cent over the past year, will take a severe beating.
Although the extent of the damage remains unclear, cotton production levels
may decline by at least 10 per cent, the government estimates. However, some
officials believe that the losses could be as great as 20 per cent. Last
year, almost 58 per cent of export earnings came directly or indirectly from
cotton.
Western and Pakistani journalists were flown in an army helicopter outside
Multan yesterday. Little land was visible, while motorboats, carrying relief
supplies and army troops, were plying between camps and the refuge sites as
rescue operations continued.
A government minister said Pakistan was considering launching an
international appeal for help.

FT  16 SEP 92 / Tthe ERM and Maastricht: Gloom spreads as Italy digests
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY'S burst of enthusiasm has given way to Tuesday's gloom on the Milan
stock market as dealers and economists in Italy's business centre digest the
effects of the lira devalution.
The cause has been the bleaker perceptions of the move after some
reflection. While industrialists caught in the vice of relatively high
domestic cost rises and a fixed exchange rate may have gained temporary
relief, economists are concerned that the devaluation should have been
accompanied by firm action on cutting public spending.
Mr Bruno Trentin, general secretary of the CGIL union federation, Italy's
biggest, offered the most coherent criticism.
Devaluation stemmed from 'the contradictory messages given by the government
to the country and the markets, reducing the credibility of the defence of
the lira in this situation, ' he said.
'It's all up to the government now. We're all waiting for them to show some
determination,' said the chief economist of one of Italy's biggest banks.
'Having tasted blood once, the danger for the lira is that it could come
under fire again very soon if the government doesn't show signs of getting
to grips with cutting spending and raising revenue,' said the chief dealer
at one big US bank.
Prof Giuliano Amato's government has sprung a number of surprises, notably
the planned privatisation of Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone, the
state-owned bank and engineering group respectively. But the last big attack
on Italy's structural economic problems came last month, with the agreement
between employers, unions and government to abolish the Scala Mobile wage
indexation system.
After appearing to rise above the party system in announcing the
transformation of the four biggest state-owned groups into joint stock
companies the government seems to have lost the initiative. 'They just seem
to be reacting to events now, rather than taking matters in hand.
Privatising Credito Italiano was the price demanded by the Bank of Italy for
pushing up the discount rate earlier this month,' said one bank economist.
Growing perceptions that the discount rate, at which the Bank of Italy lends
to commercial banks, will not be cut soon has been one of the main factors
behind the shift of sentiment on the bourse. Mr Luigi Abete, chairman of the
Confindustria employers' federation, has called for a swift cut in interest
rates, which he said were punishing Italian companies. Confindustria has
estimated that devalution would raise domestic inflation, which was running
at 5.3 per cent last month, by half a point.
However, yesterday's renewed pressure on the lira suggests there is little
sign of that happening, at least before Sunday's French referendum on
Maastricht. Rates for securities repurchase agreements between the Bank of
Italy and commercial banks, which fell to 16.06 per cent on Monday against
20.75 per cent at the previous bids last Wednesday, rose to 16.30 per cent
yesterday. Meanwhile, share prices fell sharply, losing much of the ground
made on Monday.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Waigel denies interference over rate
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to cut interest rates was not the result of German
government interference nor an EC 'finance ministers' coup,' Mr Theo Waigel,
Germany's finance minister, insisted yesterday.
However, Mr Waigel refused to deny that Chancellor Helmut Kohl made a secret
visit to the Bundesbank last Friday to discuss the move.
'Clearly a number of meetings have occurred and a number of telephone calls
have been made,' Mr Waigel said, but the details would be 'better left for
my memoirs.' He ruled out - for the time being - any further realignment of
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System following
Monday's devaluation of the Italian lira, and specifically ruled out a
sterling depreciation.
'I certainly do not envisage such a development at this point in time,' he
said. 'The government of the UK has made it clear that it would not accept a
realignment.'
Mr Waigel is understood to have accompanied Mr Kohl to the Bundesbank last
Friday, in what has been seen widely as the exercise of political pressure
on the independent central bank ahead of France's cliff-hanger referendum on
the Maastricht treaty this Sunday.
The finance minister, on a visit to the European Parliament his Christian
Social Union party say was arranged in April, hotly reiterated that the rate
cut in no way compromised the Bundesbank's independence.
He also flatly contradicted French president Francois Mitterrand's recent
assertion that the future European Central Bank envisaged by Maastricht to
administer monetary union would be subject to policies decided by EC heads
of government and finance ministers.
The rate cut was 'an entirely logical decision in line with prior Bundesbank
thinking,' he insisted. 'This was not a U-turn by the Bundesbank.'
He agreed the cut was 'not a disadvantage' for the French Yes campaign, but
primarily a 'positive signal. . . for the economic situation in Germany,
Europe and the world' and a 'very sovereign decision.'
Maastricht made absolutely clear, he pointed out, that the European Central
Bank which would subsume the D-Mark into a single EC currency 'will be
independent, and its independence will be enshrined in national legal
conventions.'
Mr Waigel brushed aside suggestions that fear of losing the D-Mark and
hostility to Maastricht were growing in Germany. But he acknowledged the
domestic pressure by calling on pro- and anti-treaty campaigners elsewhere
in Europe to stop brandishing fear of German power as a weapon.
'Fear of Germany is not justified. You must look at what we have achieved in
our country. We have been a reliable partner and everyone is aware of this.
I would appeal to all our partners. . . to have consideration for the other
peoples in Europe,' the minister said.
He also called for 'a European solution' to the flood of asylum-seekers
across Germany's eastern borders, echoing remarks on Monday by Mr Jacques
Delors, the European Commission president.
Speaking after the German rate cut, Mr Delors said solidarity in Europe was
'a two-way street' and that Germany's partners should reciprocate by
collaborating to ease its immigration burden.

FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lira is still overvalued, say
traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATORS took the view yesterday that Sunday's devaluation of the Italian
lira had been insufficient to stabilise the currency, forcing the currency
to decline sharply against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
Officials at the Bank of Italy tried to put a good gloss on the lira's fall
of around 1 per cent against the D-Mark, taking it below its central rate
against the D-Mark of L802.48. 'Some days will have to pass for the exchange
rate and financial markets to find a new equilibrium point,' an official at
the Bank of Italy said.
However, some dealers said the lira's decline was now unstoppable. 'Between
now and the end of the week we will see sustained pressure on the lira,
which will soon be trading near its new ERM floor,' said Mr Julian Simmonds
of Citibank in London.
The lira has been the victim of a new bout of selling by a range of players
in the market, including bank dealers and investment institutions.
On Monday morning, some 12 hours after the announcement of the devaluation,
the lira opened in London at L784.62 to the D-Mark, at the top of its
permitted ERM range against the German currency.
At first, speculators who had sold lire before the devaluation bought the
currency in a burst of short-term profit-taking.
Yesterday, the mood changed radically. Mr Mark Slater, managing director of
foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International in London, said that big
Italian corporations were selling the currency heavily. 'They have borrowed
around Dollars 180bn in D-Marks and Swiss francs and converted them into
lire,' he said, 'and are now buying back foreign currencies to hedge
themselves against losses.'
Several factors undermined the lira in trading yesterday:
Dealers felt that Sunday's 7 per cent devaluation was insufficient and could
well be followed by another one. The lira was already thought to be
overvalued by about 20 per cent against the D-Mark on a trade-weighted basis
before Sunday's realignment. Dealers are concerned that the Italian
government must reimburse the Bundesbank for the massive intervention
carried out by the German central bank in support of the lira.
The Bundesbank spent up to DM24bn last week, buying lire on the open market.
Under EMS rules, the Bundesbank can demand that the Bank of Italy repays it
in lire at the old rate for D-Marks.
There are fears that the devaluation will increase inflation and reverse the
decision earlier this year to abolish the Scala Mobile, which guaranteed
minimum wage rises.

<TEXT>
MRS Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, yesterday
defended the German Bundesbank's interest rate reductions as 'enough for the
moment.'
Mrs Schaumayer said the turbulence in currency markets had been caused
mainly by 'psychological factors.' Therefore, 'a clear signal' should kill
them off.
Larger reductions would have given the impression there was an emergency
within the European Monetary System or that the Bundesbank had caved in to
pressure.
She thought the German government and central bank had 'walked hand in
hand,' recognising the need for a political decision to emphasise commitment
to the EMS.
In July, the Austrian central bank, which pegs the Austrian schilling to the
D-Mark, allowed its discount rate to remain below the German rate,
reflecting the continuing strength of the Austrian economy and robust
capital outflows. But it has now realigned it. Mrs Schaumayer said this was
because 'our inflation got a little worse and Germany's got a little
better.'
However, the Austrian central bank has cut its main open market intervention
rate, the Gomex rate, by 0.5 per cent to 9 per cent, leaving it slightly
below the German open market tender rate of 9.2 per cent.

NORTH Korea is showing no sign of making concessions on closer ties with
South Korea, despite increased diplomatic isolation as the prime ministers
of both sides begin a new round of talks in Pyongyang today.
Although South Korea's bargaining position has been bolstered by the recent
establishment of diplomatic relations with China, North Korea's main ally,
this has apparently not persuaded the North to seek a compromise with Seoul.
North and South Korea signed reconciliation and non-nuclear agreements last
December, but negotiations to implement these pacts have reached stalemate.
South Korea is demanding that North Korea accept challenge inspections of
its suspected nuclear research facilities and is refusing to provide
economic investment until Pyongyang accedes to the request.
'No substantial progress in relations between the South and the North will
be possible without finding a bona fide resolution to the nuclear issue,'
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Won-shik said in a speech at the welcoming
dinner in Pyongyang last night.
Only limited progress has been made in reaching agreement on other steps to
promote closer co-operation between the two Koreas. A scheduled reunion of
separated Korean families from the two sides last month was cancelled due to
the impasse in negotiations.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Airbreak falls Pounds 2.9m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBREAK LEISURE Group, the USM-quoted tour operator, yesterday announced a
fall into losses for the six months to June 30 and warned that the full-year
outcome would be significantly below expectations.
Mr David Lewis, chairman, said that he was resigning as a consequence of the
anticipated disappointing results, as was Mr M Linton, the finance director.
The news came out after the market closed, when the company's share price
was 24p, down 1 1/2 p.
The pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 2.92m on turnover of Pounds 22.7m.
At the time of the annual meeting in June, Mr Lewis said he had been
'encouraged by the strong trend of advance bookings' and the 'firm prices'
of the company's holidays.
However, since June, the market had sharply deteriorated, resulting in
'substantial discounting' hitting the charter tour market. Airbreak was
forced to cut its planned flying programme by some 65,000 seats.
In addition, the company had problems at Sunsail International, which
provides sailing and club holidays in the Mediterranean. Airbreak acquired
Sunsail for up to Pounds 8m in shares and loan stock in January.
Mr Lewis alluded to 'unexpected problems' in two of Sunsail's associated
companies and to 'wholly unanticipated demands for repayments of existing
and long-established overdraft facilities from Sunsail's two principal
bankers'. Consequently, large amounts of Airbreak's cash had had to be
'utilised', resulting in cashflow difficulties.
Airbreak planned to sell Sunsail and had received a cash offer.
Mr Lewis said that a restructuring of the board would follow the
resignations, accompanied, he hoped, by a further cash investment.
Losses per share came to 7.18p.

<TEXT>
UNITED FRIENDLY Group, the life and general assurance underwriter, bucked
the trend in the insurance sector with pre-tax profits up 23 per cent to
Pounds 9.51m in the six months to June 30.
Mr George Mack, assistant managing director and financial director, said:
'We are relatively pleased with the results. This is a satisfactory out-turn
for the half year.'
He attributed the rise in profits to the company's focus on family and
individual policies, without exposure to large claims and mortgage
indemnities.
He said lower life profits were more than compensated for by general
business underwriting improvements, mainly as a result of a fall in property
claims.
General branch underwriting losses were Pounds 1.69m, against Pounds 4.21m,
while investment income rose to Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 4.41m).
Life business profits fell 3 per cent to Pounds 3.94m, which excludes any
profits from special 'reversionary bonuses'.
Life and general premiums were up 15 per cent to Pounds 140.1m. That
included total life premium income up 15 per cent to Pounds 98.7m and
general premiums up 16 per cent to Pounds 41.4m.
Motor premiums written rose 75 per cent as a result of higher business
volumes and increases in premium rates.
The interim dividend is raised to 4.9p (4.2p), payable from earnings of
9.14p (7.22p).

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Aegis meeting approves reorganisation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS'S extraordinary meeting in London yesterday marked several turning
points in the life of the trader in advertising space which has experienced
considerable managerial volatility since July, along with a share price
slide from a peak of 215p in October 1991 to 27p last night.
It also provided a final platform for Mr Peter Scott, its departing
chairman, who was ousted from the board in July and departed with Pounds
2.2m in compensation.
Mr Scott presented the group's reorganisation plans. These include a Pounds
19.8m rights issue, the acquisition of minority stakes in seven French
media-buying companies and the rescheduling of deferred payments due to
vendors of Carat, the group's main operating business.
All the resolutions were passed.
One of Aegis's main shareholders is Mr Gilbert Gross; the other is Warburg
Pincus, the US investment bank which is underwriting the issue.
Mr Gross is still due deferred payments from Aegis after it bought his Carat
business in France in 1988.
Under the debt rescheduling, SFEC, a company controlled by Mr Gross, will
receive Pounds 18.8m in new shares and Pounds 25m in cash.
The new structure accelerates the share element of the payment and reduces
the cash.
As a result SFEC's holding will increase from 26.8 per cent to 42.4 per
cent. The transaction received a waiver from the Takeover Panel.
SFEC will transfer its rights to the convertible loan stock to Warburg
Pincus. Its voting rights will increase from 14.8 per cent to 16.4 per cent,
while SFEC will hold 33.8 per cent of the voting rights.
The group has relocated its headquarters to Paris. Its main source of
revenue is buying and selling media space in France, which is the world's
fifth biggest advertising arena.
This year Aegis reckons that it will take a 12 per cent share of the west
European display advertising market - in total worth some Pounds 29bn.
But there are three mid-term doubts hanging over the group:
The French authorities have initiated an investigation into alleged lack of
transparency in the French advertising and media-buying markets. Aegis has
particular reason for concern; more than 70 per cent of the revenues of
Carat, its main operating business, derive from France.
There is a pending law suit filed in the US against Pascoe Nally
International (PNI) - a sports marketing subsidiary of Aegis - seeking
damages of up to Dollars 308m (Pounds 156m). The suit alleges that PNI
defrauded a US company, C&amp;W Associates, of its share of a lucrative joint
venture set up to market soccer in the US.
The activities of PNI sit uneasily with Aegis's core business and Aegis's
new executives may dispose of PNI, perhaps by selling it back to Mr Alan
Pascoe, the former British Olympic athlete who chairs PNI.
Finally, by relocating its managerial headquarters to Paris, Aegis's status
as a UK-based company has entered a kind of limbo. Aegis will retain its
London quote but it will no longer fall under the British takeover code.
According to a statement from Aegis yesterday, the French regulatory
authorities are due to meet today to decide whether the stock will be
admitted to the Paris Bourse.
If Aegis can weather the current unknowns, its aim is to be in a strong
position to meet an accelerating demand from advertisers for pan-European
marketing campaigns. This year pre-tax profits are forecast to fall from
Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 40m, but some of that lost ground may be recovered in
1993.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Tighter margins cut Fii by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FII GROUP, the footwear manufacturer, blamed tighter margins caused by the
difficult business environment for a further fall in pre-tax profits in the
year to May 31.
Profits were down 10 per cent at Pounds 6.46m (Pounds 7.15m) despite
turnover being maintained at Pounds 80.2m, near the previous year's record
of Pounds 80.3m. Within that exports increased 11 per cent to Pounds 11.5m.
Profits included net interest received of Pounds 780,000 (Pounds 789,000)
from record cash balances of Pounds 10m at the year end.
Turnover in the footwear division fell slightly to Pounds 68.6m (Pounds
69.5m) for operating profits of Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.5m). The scientific
and technical division, which distributes medical and laboratory equipment
and conducts research, reported losses of Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 600,000
profits) on turnover 7 per cent higher at Pounds 11.6m.
Earnings per share were 30.8p (33.5p) and an increased final dividend of
8.5p is proposed for a total of 14p (12.75p).

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: GPA sets preference conversion price at
Dollars 8 a share
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the aircraft leasing company, yesterday set the conversion price
of its Dollars 350m (Pounds 178m) preference share issue at Dollars 8 a
share.
In a letter to institutional shareholders, GPA confirmed its intention to
seek a listing for the convertible share issue in Luxembourg by the end of
the year.
This would be followed by a listing of the ordinary and convertible shares
on the Dublin stock exchange early next year.
GPA's planned flotation of ordinary shares, aborted in June, would have been
priced at Dollars 20 a share. The ordinary shares are currently quoted on
the Dublin grey market at between Dollars 6 and Dollars 8.
GPA said it had commissioned a study which showed new investors might be
attracted at a price of Dollars 11.90. However, after listening to advice
from its institutional shareholders, it decided to set the price at Dollars
8.
The decision means that shareholders will have to write-down their existing
shares to Dollars 8 apiece. Many institutional shareholders had only written
down the value of their shares by Dollars 5 to Dollars 15.
GPA is planning to meet with prospective shareholders next week if it can
secure the agreement of most of its existing shareholders to take part in
the convertible share issue.
Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder of the group who controls 8 per cent of
the ordinary shares, plans to take up a 'sizeable' amount of his rights in
the new issue.
The injection of fresh equity is part of an overall recovery programme which
includes two more asset-backed securitised issues and the renegotiation of
its aircraft acquisition programme.
GPA is locked in talks with Boeing, Airbus, Fokker and McDonnell Douglas
about cutting the Dollars 12 billion of orders for the rest of the decade to
Dollars 5 billion.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Forth Ports turns in Pounds 5.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTH PORTS, the operator of ports in Scotland's Firth of Forth, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.25m in the six months to June 28.
The company was floated in March, with 27m ordinary shares being issued at
110p, thereby raising Pounds 33m for the government. Yesterday the shares
rose 9p to 176p.
Operating profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 5.05m (Pounds 4.79m), which Mr
William Thomson. chairman, described as 'very encouraging given the low
level of economic activity in the country'.
Turnover increased almost 8 per cent to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 15.1m), though
Mr Hugh Thompson, chief executive, revealed that tonnage levels of piped and
dry cargo had fallen to 9.24m (9.64m) tonnes and 11m (11.3m) tonnes
respectively. He said that the 9.24m tonnes was 'the lowest for a long
time', but that it would be 'better after 1993'.
He explained that the mix of cargo had offset the overall tonnage fall and
enthused about prospects for the Braefoot Bay marine terminal, where traffic
levels had grown 'with a vengeance', and would expand by a further 50 per
cent when its new extension became operational.
Group debt was static at Pounds 11m giving gearing of 30 per cent (34 per
cent). A flotation condition was that Forth should pay the government the
Pounds 8.6m long-term debt it owed it for building lock-gates. Forth has
done this earlier than it envisaged - there was a Pounds 9.8m liability in
the 1991 balance sheet. The result was a Pounds 1.23m extraordinary credit.
The ports division currently accounts for 70 per cent of turnover, with the
marine division pitching in about 14 per cent and property about 9 per cent.
Earnings were 11.4p (9.5p) per share and the maiden interim dividend is 2p.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible up to Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the industrial materials manufacturer, yesterday reported a
modest 8 per cent fall in earnings per share despite harsh conditions in its
markets.
Helped by acquisitions, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 31m
in the six months to July 5, on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 334.4m.
Earnings per share fell from 10.2p to 9.4p and the interim dividend is
maintained at 5.75p.
Rather than tinker with a small increase in the interim dividend, Mr Bruce
Farmer, chief executive, said the group would prefer to make a fuller
increase at the year-end, depending on sales in the last four months.
Mr Farmer said the group, which has 84 per cent of sales outside the UK, saw
some signs of economic upturn in the US and Australia and a good business
climate in south-east Asia.
Gearing rose to 41 per cent from 26 per cent - a figure that included part
of the proceeds of last April's rights issue - but interest cover rose to 8
times. This was after capital expenditure of Pounds 17.3m - excluding
acquisitions - which was 1.5 times the depreciation cost.
At the operating level, margins fell from 11.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
Excluding acquisitions operating profits would have fallen 9 per cent.
Profits in the carbon division fell despite higher sales, partly because of
a freeze in orders from two customers, and price competition leading to
falls for the first time in 10 years.
Technical ceramics sales, profits and margins rose mainly because of
acquisitions, but thermal ceramics' margin was hit by competition in
refactory business which was not fully offset by the growth of new
applications.
Profits at speciality materials were maintained and margins increased
despite the relatively poor performance of Holt Lloyd, the car care
business, which is undergoing a restructuring.
COMMENT
Morgan has had a long haul toregain the confidence of investors wary of its
predilection for rights issues. But even discounting an 8 per cent
out-performance since the last foray into the market, there are grounds for
believing Morgan has spent long enough in the wilderness. When compared with
its peers, it has performed well for an industrial company in recession with
new applications for its technology moving it steadily into
higher-value-added areas. And limiting the earnings fall to 8 per cent while
maintaining operating margins above 10 per cent is not to be sneezed at.
What is more, the group may not have to wait until its self-imposed
abstinence from rights issues ends next April before returning to a more
active acquisition programme, particularly if it can sell some of its
non-core businesses. Add to that a relatively high yield and Morgan looks to
be on a modest rating - 12 times prospective earnings based on a full-year
forecast of Pounds 67m and 20.5p of earnings.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Photo-Me shows 3.8% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHOTO-ME International, the world's largest manufacturer and operator of
automatic photo-booths, reported a 3.8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 16.4m, for the year to April 30.
The fall came on turnover increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 114.8m (Pounds
107.5m) and reflected higher depreciation charges, up from Pounds 9.64m to
Pounds 11m.
Profit before depreciation and tax was ahead by 3 per cent to Pounds 27.5m
(Pounds 26.7m).
Profits before extraordinary items of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 10m) resulted in
earnings per share of 17.9p (17.06p), helped by slightly lower tax payments
of Pounds 5.42m (Pounds 5.69m) and a reduction in minority interest, which
fell to Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 1.33m).
The group's positive cash flow more than covered capital expenditure of
Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 20.7m) designed to expand the company's customer and
product base.
As expected the group adopted a 'more prudent' approach towards writing off
goodwill associated with the consolidation of its French and Belgian
subsidiaries in June 1991.
Goodwill of Pounds 4.53m at April 30 1991 and a further Pounds 3.24m arising
during the current year were written-off against reserves.
The final dividend is increased to 3.1p (3p) producing a total of 4.4p
(4.2p).
Mr David Miller, managing director, said that although diversification and
expansion had continued, the group will concentrate on its core photographic
and imaging profit-producing activities.
The express systems division continued to grow, increasing operating
revenues to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 2.4m), and will concentrate on promoting the
self-service printing systems already installed to a wider customer base.
For example, in the US Photo-Me has formed a joint venture with a financial
institution under which its partner buys and owns instant printing machines
producing business cards from Photo-Me, which then operates the machines and
pays the joint venture partner an operating fee. So far 200 machines have
been installed and 1,000 are planned by the end of the year.
The data identification systems division, which serves the growing market
for national identity cards and other forms of identification like driving
licenses and bank cards, is expected to benefit from moves to prevent fraud.
Mr Miller said the identity products fit in with the group's strategy of
generating further demand for photographs and increasing volume.
